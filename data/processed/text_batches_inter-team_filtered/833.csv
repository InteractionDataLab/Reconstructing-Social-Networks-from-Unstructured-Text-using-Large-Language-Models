Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"76% (up to 82% in midsummer) in just 27 years for protected nature areas in Germany. This considerably exceeds the estimated decline of 58% in global abundance of wild vertebrates over a 42-year period to 2012. Their results demonstrate that recently reported declines in several taxa such as butterflies, wild bees and moths, are in parallel with a severe loss of total aerial insect biomass, suggesting that it is not only the vulnerable species but the flying insect community as a whole, that has been decimated over the last few decades.

An issue Mexican beekeepers are facing are transgenic crops, there is the presence of transgenic pollen in bees' honey. In 2009 Germany banned MON810 maize from cultivation for agricultural purposes, even though the EU has approved it for release into the environment.3 Harmless honey for exportation to Germany is not allowed to have presence of MON810 maize which is cultivated here in Mexico.
In general, beekeepers told us we were doing impressive research and saw huge potential in our work as a real solution for the foulbrood problem as well as a possible treatment for Nosema and Varroa.
On the last day of the event, we visited apiaries with visitors from Mexico city, Chile, Cuauhtemoc city and other states of the republic. It was an incredible experience for us.
Detailed Description
We are truly grateful with Ernesto Tanús Sánchez, Manuel Ramírez Salcido, Juan Diego Pérez de la Rosa and Felipe Esquivel Díaz president of the Delicia’s beekeepers society in behalf of such, for inviting us as speakers at the IV State Beekeeping Forum, a forum organized by the Delicia’s Beekeepers society in coordination with the city council and the state government. The experience itself in addition to the willingness and kindness of beekeepers, government representatives, and beekeeping companies to contribute to our project, made of this event a valuable approach to understanding how the world affects our project and how our project affects the world.
The forum was held in the Chihuahuan Desert Museum and had an approximate of 340 attendees from the state including beekeepers from the Cuauhtemoc’s beekeeping society, attendees from other states and from the country of Chile. The event intended to update the sector, discuss existing options for increasing productivity and encourage beekeepers to continue making products derived from honey.
It was important for us to get involved with our relevant communities seeking stimulating dialogues and bi-directional learning. We engaged conversation with Engineer Sóstenes Rafael Rodríguez Dehaibes,"

Tec-Monterrey,2015,Team:Tec-Monterrey#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," yes, when only 21.4% of teams from other parts of the world answered the same. This shows that there is a clear difference between some teams. According to the answers we received, over 40% believe that it is due to regulation and laws.
It was even more surprising when we learned that those from non-Latin-American countries, when they said they had problems with customs, they were mainly for late arrival, stopping their work for two days. We had to stop our work for two months for the same reason. Why does this difference continue existing?
Most teams that haven’t had problems with customs answered that they hadn’t even heard of these problems. The team USCF answered “Our team is lucky in that the vast majority of reagents and supplies we use come from vendors in North America, so we have not experienced many problems. We hadn't realized until this survey how significantly this might affect other teams, and we hope this will help you draw attention to the situation so as to get it fixed! We'd love to support you in any way we can!” We are glad that not only were we able to shed light on a problem that affects a specific part of the world, but that we received such great responses.
We received feedback from the teams who participated on the survey, learning what they do regarding the problem. Basically, we all do the same and we still have the same problems. This is the signal for things to change.
Interviews
Watch the video here.
We are barely starting out in the area of research, compared with others that graduated and started researching many years ago. To get the perspective of experienced researchers, we decided to interview 3 professors and researchers from our university. In the video above you’ll be able to see their point of view. Their experience in the field allows us to have a clear idea of the current situation in Mexico and the progress that has been made. But most important, it is a way of motivating ourselves and other young researchers in Mexico. We should not get limited by the situation our country is living; On the contrary, we must be the change we want to see.
Statistics in Mexico
Despite the difficulties that Mexican scientists encounter, there has been much progress throughout the years. In 2007, there were over 27,000 scientific projects being worked on throughout the country, a number a decade ago would have been inconceivable. CONACYT is one of the organisms in charge of promoting scientific research in Mexico.  It has founded investigations and has given scholarships to help people continue their studies and ultimately help research in our country to continue its growth."

Meeting at Christian's lab
Today was full of wonderful manual labour as you can probably tell from everyone's update. After that, I managed to read a Second Life ethics paper. I didn't think it was very good because it was poorly written and it seemed the person was not qualified to do it. However, I enjoyed the paper with the molecular orbitals. I think it is the same person that did the molecule rezzer as well. The paper showed how useful Second Life can be  to visually present something, which is excellent because synthetic biology is not very friendly to the naked eye. I also started to write the ethics blog post and put some thought into what to present on Friday.
VICKI
APEGGA article
Carol and I started talking about how we’d approach it, but she was pretty busy in the lab so we didn’t make it too far. We’ll discuss it tomorrow and finish it by Aug 1, for sure. My preference would be to do a small profile of each engineer, where we discuss where we’re from, why we’re here and where we think we could go with synthetic biology. This would also include unifying paragraphs to start and finish the article, structured much like what I did for my showcase article for retiring teachers way way back in grade 12.

BBa_K2477000
iGEM GFP (E0040) mutant with added PAM site
The GFP gene was originally obtained from the iGEM 2017 DNA kit. Site directed mutagenesis was used to create a synonymous mutation at base pair 186 where a cytosine was incorporated into the top strand to replace a thymine. This acted to create a PAM site for Cas9 from S. pyogenes (5' NGG 3') on the bottom strand. This mutation was made in order to allow for the design of an sgRNA capable of interacting with the chromophore encoding region of GFP. The biobrick number of the sgRNA designed by our team for this purpose is BBa_K2477001.

Purdue,2018,Team:Purdue#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"Public Engagement
We had the opportunity to work with Purdue University Libraries in creating an event called DIYBio and Maker, where we educated the Purdue community about synthetic biology and our project. During the event we interacted with students and shed light on the importance of synthetic biology and the implications of our research.
Integrated HP:
Step 4
IRB-approved survey
The most important stakeholder for any diagnostic test is the user, the person tasked with completing the necessary steps and analyzing the results. Unfortunately, the stigma associated with yeast infections and the difficulty of finding a large diverse population of potential users make collecting data from this key demographic challenging. Thankfully Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online survey distribution platform, was able to help us circumvent these problems. After working with the Purdue Statistics Department to eliminate biases from our survey questions and receiving IRB approval, the survey was distributed and completed by 239 potential users. The survey allowed us to collect data on the habits of those with potential yeast infections and determine minimums for assay cost and speed among other metrics. Because users preferred the test have two sample channels instead of the one channel offered by our paper-based assay at the time, we updated our test design. To view our survey questions and full findings, click the link below,

Step 5
Collaboration
A truly accessible assay can be shipped anywhere with minimal shipping accommodations. To test how shipping and dormancy would affect the functionality of our assay we shipped prototypes to the Northwestern iGEM Team for experimentation. Although we were unable to characterize the impact of shipping on test effectiveness, the interaction demonstrated that our assay instructions needed to be more specific and that sample loading areas should be labelled. The updated design can be found on our hardware page. To view more details of our collaboration, click the link below.

RDFZ-China,2018,Team:RDFZ-China#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," dilution: two different bottle of LB with Chl were measured. The CFU counts in same dilution factor show great variation (Table 6). High variation may result from the difference of experimenters' spreading methods or fluctuations in the starting sample (starting samples were diluted to OD600=0.1 approxiamately).
Our Thoughts
Although it's not my first time to participate in an experiment, I still learned a lot from the InterLab.  With so many steps in protocols out there, it can be overwhelming to get started right away. I learned that I should copy down all protocols down on notebook beforehand; it's much easier to follow a protocol that I have written and analyzed by myself.  Also, it's handy to obtain all the necessary reagents in advance and make sure they are all in good conditions. I used to run out for reagent in the middle of an experiment and that makes it hectic and messy. Furthermore, I get to know that preparing a timeline is the key. Dividing a day into various blocks keeps me busy and efficient. The three-day experience in InterLab teaches me a lot, though it's mostly repetitive, I got to acquire new knowledge every day and that makes it memorable.Yishen Shen
We feel like that the protocol can sometimes be ambiguous. For instance, the protocol says to ""check the OD600 and make sure it is 0.1 (minus the blank measurement)"", it is kind of confusing about how to interpret the content inside the parentheses. Overall, the InterLab study is helpful for providing new measuring methods to our later part characterization study.Jianxiang Zhang

Meet Dinula De Silva
I am a grade 12 student at Winston Churchill High School. I enjoy programming, playing the guitar, and watching movies. When I’m not stuck indoors, I like going running and biking. I joined iGEM because the feats of synthetic biology fascinated me and I wanted to learn more about the processes involved. I additionally wanted to develop my computer programming skills by working on the wiki and software aspect of the competition.
I wish I were adenine, because then I could get paired with U ;)

They also hope that the new method can have less side effects and lower recurrence rate, thereby reducing their pain. In addition, rheumatoid arthritis can also increase the burden on the national economy. The United States has once carried out an epidemiological survey, showing that annual cost on rheumatoid arthritis and rheumatoid-related treatment is more than 1% of its GDP. Though there is no such exact data in China, it is estimated that the financial loss caused by this disease is not less than the United States. As the aging problem becomes increasingly prominent, this national economic burden will become more and more heavy. If a new treatment can be designed to cure this disease radically, it will be of great significance in promoting public health and people’s health conditions.

Finding new treatments
CAR-T, short for Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Immunotherapy, is a chimeric antigen receptor T cell immunotherapy. This is a new cytotherapy that has existed for many years but hasn’t been used clinically until some recent improvement. Similar to other immunotherapies, its basic principle is to use the patient's own immune cells to specifically remove cancer cells. As shown in Figure 6, T cells are differentiated and enriched by in vivo injection of cytokines, and then the target cells are separated by cell surface markers. Next, the cells are engineered in vitro with CAR (Chimeric Antigen Receptor), and are amplified by cell culture to a certain number before returned to the patient's body. In this way, the engineered T cells can kill the target cells specifically in vivo.
Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cytotherapy
We discussed how to design a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis during our group meeting (Figure 7) and with our advisor in depth. Eventually, based on traditional CAR-T, we chose Treg cells as engineering targets in the purpose of curing rheumatoid arthritis, and we innovatively introduced a Syn-Notch system to enhance the stability of the engineered Treg cells in vivo. We came to form a new Syn-Notch CAR-Treg system (the overall idea shown in Figure 8) after some optimization on our design.

The thermal conductivity of growth media.
Part of the Newcastle iGEM team's project this year involved an experiment centred around the creation of biological electronic components. Newcastle asked our team if we could help them out by finding the thermal conductivity of different growth media. With the help of our biophysicist supervisor Ryan Edgington , we came up with a plan to measure the conductivity.
To measure the thermal conductivity of our samples accurately using a temperature gradient, the effect of convection currents must be minimised. To do this we had to reduce the size of our samples (50mL falcon tube) and keep the temperature in a narrow range (roughly between 298K-303K).
To measure the temperature three thermocouples were used. The first one was attached to a 0.65m thin plastic coated copper wire (0.05m^2 in area) which ran through the flacon tube providing 5 amps to heat our sample providing the temperature gradient. The second thermocouple was attached to the inside of the falcon tube and the third was in the water to measure the external temperature.
Using this data a straight line of best fit was plotted using the least squares method. This was then used to calculate the average gradient of the graph. By using these value along with $$ \lambda = \frac{Q}{4\pi[T(t_{2})-T(t_{1})]}\ \log{\Big(\frac{t_{2}}{t_{1}}\Big)}$$ Where $Q$ is our power per unit length calculated by $Q = \frac{(I \times V)}{Length}$ , $T(t_\alpha)$ is the temperature at time $\alpha$ and $T(t_{2})-T(t_{1})$ is our gradient (Nagasaka and Nagashima, 1981).
As we used a plastic coated copper wire we had to apply a correction to the values to make them more accurate. This was done by calculating the conductivity of water using the insulated wire and comparing it to the given conductivities from here . We found that the conductivity value was roughly one fourth of the known value at any given temperature and the correction applied to the results of the lb and m9 media.Due to time constraints the lb experiment was repeated 6 times and 5 times for the m9 media with a water calibration being done each"

Overview
The model
Simulations
Simulation 1: The Generic Graph
This simulation shows the standard enzyme kinetics graph. Concentrations of product, enzyme, substrate, and enzyme-substrate complex over time are shown. Comparisons between the standard enzyme kinetic graph with and without Michaelis-Menten kinetics are made.
In this simulation, all parameters are arbitrary. K1 = 100000, K2 = 1000 and K3 = 0.1. This makes KM = 0.01. Furthermore, [E0] = 0.01 and [S0] = 0.1. The values of K1, K2 and K3 are proportional to their kinetic values [1], while the values of E0 and S0 are chosen to ensure a clear graph.
Module 2 Timeline
The above simulation shows that the Enzyme-Substrate complex is at a steady state.
There is a decrease in substrate concentration, accompanied by a rise in product concentration. As all the substrate is used up, there will be no more products formed. There is, however, a time delay before significant product formation starts. This time delay occurs as the enzymatic conversion of substrate to product takes some time.
After this time delay, the concentration of ES complex will gradually drop to 0, while the concentration of enzyme will correspondingly return to initial values.
In our case where the enzyme concentration is much smaller than the KM value, there is not much difference in the rate of formation of product when we compare the graphs obtained with the Michaelis-Menten assumption, and the graphs obtained when not making this assumption. This shows that our assumptions of Michaelis-Menten kinetics is valid.
Keeping the parameters the same as above, we perform a simulation of the first few moments of the enzymatic reaction. We can observe the transition state of the standard reaction that we would have missed otherwise. Here, the enzyme concentration will decrease to zero due to the formation of enzyme-substrate complex, and there is a corresponding decrease in substrate concentration by an equal amount.  There is no rise in product concentration within this short initial period, as the enzymatic conversion of substrate to product takes some time.
Simulation 2: Varying [S0]
Here, the values of K1, K2 and K3 are unchanged. [E0] = 0.01, while [S"

After that, we discussed with Prof. Dr. Thilo Stehle (Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry) and decided that it would be possible to facilitate the nucleophile attack of the hydroxyle group from Tyr179. Furthermore we tried different mutations in Leu183 and Val186. We found that a mutation of Val186 to Asp186 should stabilize the substrate. The distance between OH - 6 and Asp186 - COOH is 2,9 Å and would be suitable for a hydrogen bond (Figure 2). Also the distance to other residues is over 5 Å.
It is important to note that such negative charge could have a negative effect on the activity. Due to that we tried Asn186 (Figure 3), but the distance with 3,03 Å is not optimal. We again consulted Prof. Dr. Stehle. He made the point, that prediction tools generally don’t always deliver very accurate results. When we simulated substrate binding in the mutated active site using CLC Drugdiscovery Workbench, we could not obtain an applicable result. However Prf. Dr. Stehle also noted, that it is very difficult to predict the activity for the mutated protein soley based on structure. It might strongly bind the substrate with the new hydrogen bond.
Figure 2: Mutation Asp186.
Figure 3: Mutation Asn186.
In conclusion, the best option is a mutation of Val186 to Asp186, where no collisions with other residues occur and a stabilizing effect at OH - 6 is achieved. The mutant looks to be promising, however no definite statement can be made about the mutants effect to the enzymatic activity. With this modeling, we managed to suggest a possible improvement for our enzyme, which can be put into practice and further compared to the enzyme in its native state

Yale,2010,Team:Yale#Our Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"ulfide. Iron sulfide precipitates as a black solid and can be easily identified visually on the macroscopic scale. Bacteria that are actively producing H2S will reduce the Iron in the medium, and turn the agar black.
Growing Bacteria In Copper Medium
Bacteria expressing Thiosulfate Reductase can then be grown in media containing both a source of sulfur and free copper in solution. Some strains of E. coli exhibit robust growth in copper containing media, despite toxicity of high levels of copper in solution. By measuring cell growth and viability at varying concentrations of copper, we can maximize the reaction of H2S resulting from bacterial activity.
Correlating Bacterial Growth to Copper Deposition
In this experimental system, the formation of the copper sulfide should be directly related to the disappearance of Cu2+ with time as the insoluble metal sulfide formed is a complex of copper and sulfur. As H2S production is turned on, there should be a subsequent decrease in soluble copper concentrations as copper is bound in the precipitated copper sulfide.
Localizing Copper Deposition
With bacteria able to affect CuS deposition, the next logical step is to control this activity spatially and temporally. Inspired by the work of Christine Jacobs-Wagner (Yale, MCDB), we built a mold for constructing agar channels in which to grow and constrain the active bacteria. A master mold was designed and constructed out of the polymer PDMS. This could then be used to iteratively create indented agar channels in our solid growth medium.
When bacteria are washed over these channels, they become trapped in the indentation. By imposing a physical restraint prior to the induction of metal deposition activity, it is possible to control where the metal sulfide is deposited. This is a necessary requirement in the construction of a circuit.
Modeling the Construction of Metal Sulfides
The metal sulfide can self-associate to form clusters of a mineral called covellite. This Copper Sulfide has a specific arrangements of unit cells. In an effort to model this, we used CAD to construct an idealized computer model for how this mineral deposition would effectively create a circuit.
This method can then be applied for the construction and manufacture of innumerable microscale structures, ranging from electrical components to microfluidic devices. Read on to find out more about our applications!

EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," tumor cells and not healthy cells is supplied to the patient through a vaccine formulation. Dendritic cells of the patient uptake the neoantigen from the vaccine formulation. Alongside the neoantigen, the vaccine formulation supplies an adjuvant that activates the dendritic cell to uptake foreign material, and perceive them as danger signals.
The dendritic cell then processes the neoantigen and cross-presents it on MHC-1 complexes on its surface, where naïve CD8+ T cells can recognize it. Once the naïve CD8+ cells recognize the neoantigen, they mature into cytotoxic CD8+ T cells that specifically attack cells expressing this neoantigen; in this case, the tumor cells.
Rising Importance of Cancer Vaccination
The immunogenicity of neoantigens leading to T-cell activation has long been demonstrated in patients ( Wolfel et al., 1995 ). In fact, preclinical and clinical data has already shown that neoantigen specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) constitute the most potent T-cell populations for tumor rejection ( Wolfel et al., 1995 ; Matsushita et al., 2012 ).        Still, the natural production of neoantigen-specific CTLs by a patient’s immune system is scarce because of low clonal frequency and ineffective presentation of neoantigens ( Alexandrov et al., 2013 ; Zhu et al., 2017 ). Therefore, cancer vaccines or adjuvant cancer therapies (ACT) are crucial to potentiate immunity against neoantigens for cancer treatment. Hence, a large number of strategies have been progressed for the creation, formulation and delivery of various cancer vaccines; for example, whole tumor cell lysate, nucleotide (mRNA/ DNA), protein or peptide-based vaccines, dendritic cell (DC) based vaccines, viral vectors and biomaterial-assisted vaccines.
However, it remains challenging to develop a universal and effective delivery strategy to target neoantigen-based vaccines to professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for eliciting robust and potent T-cell responses against cancer.
In general, parenterally injected soluble antigens or adjuvants rapidly spread into the systemic circulation making them ineffective due to their small molecular sizes, poor targeting, and rapid draining in lymph nodes (LNs). This ultimately results in a limited immune response ( Liu et al., 2014 ; Fifis et al., 2004 ).
In addition, even if such soluble tumor neoantigens are acquired by DCs, they would be trapped in endolysosomal compartments and digested into peptides, which are"

Our human practices involve in several aspects including biosafety, social activity and public education. Our aSTARice is a genetically-modified organism, (GMO), so our work focuses on promotion of the knowledge for GMO and survey on people's concern about GMO.
1. Self-improvement
First of all, we should make sure that we ourselves have correct understanding on the GMO issue, therefore, we took part in some lectures about GMO and food security.
We attended the lecture given by Jianping Kou from the Department of Science, Technology and Education of the Minstry of Agriculture of China;  Min Lin from the Institute of Biotechnology of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Yongning Wu from the Key Laboratory of Food Safety Risk Assessment, Ministry of Health of China. In this talk, we obtained a lot of information in analysing GMO. In this lectures, we knew that transgenic food sold in market are safe because they were tested by many relevant departments and labs for many years. So far, only few transgenic products have permission to enter Chinese market. After lecture, we communicated with these scientists about new technologies used in transgenic researches.
To get a better understanding about agriculture, we joined the Sixth Asian Conference on Precision Agriculture as volunteers.
2. Innovation and Entrepreneurship Forum
As most undergraduate students have no idea about how to carry out a biological project correctly, we held an Innovation and Entrepreneurship Forum in our college. We gave a speech on our projects and the ways to do our biological research. Our forum attracted more than 300 students and most of them were impressed in our project.
3.  Laboratory Open Day
As many freshmen in our are eager to learn more about biological researchs in labs, we held a Laboratory Open Day for high school students, college students to visit our lab. We introduced the function of different equipments and showed them our video and posters. Our efforts might enhance the understanding of science and technology, so the students may love science and work on science in the future.

From party balloons to weather balloons, latex and rubber are perhaps the membrane materials most widely associated with balloons. While latex cannot be used for every type of balloon in every situation, it has myriad other uses. A recombinant bacterial means of production with high yield could be of use not only in space where tree growth is impractical and fossil fuels are scarce, but also on Earth where environmental concerns take precedence.

Nylon
The word nylon may be primarily associated with clothing, but the same material forms the membrane of hot air balloons. Nylon actually encompasses a variety of different polyamides, but we focused on nylon 6 because it is structurally similar to the most commonly used form, nylon 66, but requires only a single monomer which can potentially be produced from a biological source. We looked into a number of different means of production and successfully achieved the first step towards production on one path. Read more about that journey here .
Ultimately, however, we decided not to proceed with nylon production. As a woven fabric, it is sufficient for a hot air balloon and certainly a viable candidate for sustainable recombinant production, but at the same time is not light and impermeable enough to see use in modern helium balloons which are the closest analogues to the hydrogen balloons we sought to create. In addition, as can be seen in the more detailed nylon page, many of the possible next steps were more chemical than biological, so we focused on other projects more well-suited to a synthetic biology approach.

d-AuNPs Testing: ssDNAp interaction with EPO target DNA
The prescreening with d-AuNPs is tested with EPO DNA as target. To test the versatility of the prescreening, multiple variants of the ssDNAp were designed to target the EPO DNA. The ssDNAp 4 targets the EPO coding sequence. Prior, the ssDNAp is heated up to let the ssDNAp anneal to EPO target DNA and create the secondary structure. The ssDNAp 4 was used in this experiment to target the EPO DNA. The ssDNAp 4, EPO target DNA and hybridization buffer were incubated:
5 minutes at 95 ºC (denature dsDNA target)
1 minute at 57 ºC (anneal ssDNAp to dsDNA target)
10 minutes at 21 ºC
20 µL d-AuNPs, 10 µL target dsDNA (1 µM), 6 µL hybridization buffer, 4 µL ssDNAp 4 (1 µM) and 20 µL of a varying salt concentration (range of 0 mM to 1000 mM) were added to the 96 wells plate.

October:
This month has probably been the most intense, full of many different activities in every aspect of the competition and we couldn't be happier with all the progresses we've made so far.
2/10 → First Meeting with an high school, located in Prato. We were a bit nervous but everything went fine. Skype #10: Brainstorming about Professor David Kong’s tips and how to apply them. The city’s blind people association could be interested to a collaboration with us, our software could give them the chance to understand lab work and sense the difference between different datas.
5/10 → Acquacloning is a success! It's a versatile and simple enzyme-free cloning approach. Acquacloning solved our assembly problems...After a month ! It's magic or maybe all genetic engineering is magical.
9/10 → Skype #11: discussion about our project, our wiki and collaborations
12/10 → Creation of vectors (e.g. pJet and pSB1C3) and transformation of the bacteria. The transformation method is still electroporation.
14/10 → Our team went to high school Castelnuovo in Florence to present the iGem project.
18/10 → Skype #12: discussion about our medals and parts, both were complicated to deeply understand, so they checked our problems and asked their advisors too! Moreover, considering we are in the track ""Art & Design"", we have to pay attention to different criteria than the standard ones.
In lab, we have transformed by electroporation our plasmid and a positive control. Unfortunately, only positive control has grown but not our clone. In the evening, we extract our plasmid from the colonies transformed with pJet. It is a plasmid with a large number of copies in the cell, so we could extract the genic insert from pJet and obtain it yet amplificated without PCR!
18/10 - 19/10 → Our team visited Filippo Mazzei secondary school in Prato, meeting the five classes composed by oldest students in the school. Since they were just thirteen years old, we also prepared an introduction about biotechnology world and its potentialitis, so that they could understand better our project. The group of students was very heterogeneous but it was a great success!
19/10 → Plasmid extraction with kit Macherey-Nagel: no results :( But pJet is a ""suicidal plasmid"", and since the colonies are growing, our fragments entered!
20/10 → Castelnuovo High School students came to our labs to see the progress"
BNU-China,2014,Team:BNU-China#modeling.html_-_-_TEXT.html," distribution of running time increases. Otherwise, the time keeps the same as that in the uniform environment, no matter how high or low the concentration is[4].
Running
The running of E.coli can be descibed as a straight line. The distribution of running duration time fits a normal curve, with mean τrun0 and standard division σrun.
Brown and Berg[4] suggested that the mean τ has a functional relationship, shown as follows, with the current attractant (in their case, glutamate) concentration and the change of concentration over time. (See formula (1),(2)).
KD is the dissociation constant of the complex formed by glutamate and its receptor. Pb is the fraction of receptors (protein) bound with the attractant.
In their model, the mean velocity during a run, however, is independent from C and dC/dt [5,6].
Brown and Berg found the curve KDC/(KD + C)2 fits the chemotaxis sensitivity assays well (Fig. 2).
Obtain KD
Brown and Berg found the curve KDC/(KD + C)2 fits the chemotaxis sensitivity assays well (Fig. 2).
Fig. 2
We cannot determine the precise dissociation constants KD by experiment. However, the trend revealed in out experiments (Fig. 3) fits with the model well. With data from McfR-Succinate experiment, we set the KD value of succinate-receptor complex as 3.5 mM by Least Square method.
Fig. 3 the result from experiment.
Fig. 4 Fitting the experiment by a( KDC / (KD + C)2) + d, where a = 389, d = 260 and KD is 3.5mM. This work is
made by c++ and OpenGL. The code to get KD and a and to make sketch is available. Please contact us.
Given a concrete constant number of α in function (1), we would be able to calculate the value of τrun. Series of experiments[4] convinced us to* set α as 660 sec.
*We have no time to repeat the experiments with succinate.
In conclusion, modeling running is based on following statement:
The velocity during a run is constant (always equal to the mean);
E.coli move straightly during a run, and neither die nor divide in the process. The effect of quorum sensing and nutritional factors are eliminated;
The E.coli’s running time trun is a random number from N(<τrun>,σrun);
The mean duration time <"

Alginate Encapsulation
To encapsulate our diagnostic bacteria we utilize a microfluidic encapsulation chip. The first task performed by the encapsulation chip is the pinch-off of the solution of alginic acid and bacteria by an oil, the shear fluid, creating an emulsion. In the second and last step the polymerization initiating CaCl2 solution is injected into the pinched-off droplets. By the time the droplets exit the chip they are polymerized.  The size of the produced alginate encapsulated bacteria droplets is tuneable by using different flow rates of sunflower oil (shear fluid). The following videos show the dependence of the droplet size from the shear flow rates. To precisely test the influence of the flow rate on the droplet size we have used a syringe pump system. To produce big droplets, we have used a shear fluid flow rate of 15.000 µL/h and an alginate bacteria solution flow rate of 4.000 µL/h. Smaller droplets can be produced with a shear fluid flow rate of 8.000 µL/h and an alginate bacteria solution flow rate of 4.000 µL/h.

Implemented Projects are the Joint Research Project SMART (integrated Water Resource Management in the Lower Jordan Valley) and the Guanting Project (sustainable water and agricultural land use in the Guanting watershed under limited water resources).
In summary the visit of the conference made us realize that water scarcity and water quality are in fact vital problems that already attract much attention in academic circles. In contrast, we did not know that the global water situation is such a multifaceted subject and we were stunned by the broad range of subjects that were covered during the conference. As the conference took place at the beginning of our project, the impressions we received from the conference helped us understanding what problems we should address when talking to a broader audience in our subsequent human practice efforts. Moreover the presentation of  currently happening innovative projects inspired us in the design of our filter prototypes.
2) Workshop ""Drugs in the Environment"" in Berlin organized by the RCDS
Figure 5: Description
At the end of May we joined the ""Drugs in the environment"" conference that was organized by the RCDS (which is the youth organisation of the CDU, the currently governing political party in Germany) and the German Association of Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies .
During this discussion meeting we had the opportunity to meet and discuss with several experts as well as with representatives of leading German pharmacy companies such as Bayer and Novartis. The main focus of this discussion was on the point whether pollution of the environment by pharmaceutic substances is a considerable problem for our society. Furthermore whether Germany is going to invest money to reduce this pollution and who is responsible for financing these measures. The conclusion of this conference was that in Germany there is no acute danger for mankind by contamination of the environment by pharmaceutic substances. In contrast the lowering of the detection limit for several substances leads to an awareness that there is contamination caused by mankind and that several people are not willing to accept this pollution.

The diversity of the library was estimated by picking 10 transformants and sequencing the sensory domain. The average mutation rate was 2.8 per insert, with a maximum number of 5 point-mutations and only one insertion (which disrupts the       function of the protein). Having retrieved around 4000 clones, the coverage was drastically low, however, practical experience shows that a number as low as 5000 clones can sometimes be sufficient to find a hit.
Mutation frequency
Conclusion
We established two protocols to generate two different kinds of libraries, however due to time constraints, we could not iterate through the procedure enough to get to a satisfying coverage. However, this optimized pipeline can constitute a       good starting point which the iGEM community can build upon to create a diverse Tar receptor libraries and evolve this protein towards new and interesting specificities.
Screening assay
One of the main advantages of screening for mutants of the Tar receptor is the presence of a handy phenotype like bacterial movement. It is indeed relatively straightforward to select mutants that are attracted to a compound by physically       separating them from all the other variants. However, while the concept of such an assay can appear simple, in practice a lot of factors need to be optimized. We took care of tuning some meaningful parameters in order to provide a robust       experimental set up.
The key concept of this assay is the generation of a gradient of attractant on a semisolid agar plate, in the concentration range of the Tar sensitivity, that can be followed by specific mutants that will then separate themselves from the       group of non-responding bacteria.
The strain
Common laboratory strains of E. coli have all five main genes responsible for chemotaxis. This is an issue when trying to express mutants of the same protein, since Tar and Tsr receptor exhibit cross-talk, this could lead to aspecific movement       towards other molecules. While the proof-of-concept of this assay has been conducted with wild type MG1655, the experiments on the libraries should be transformed and screened into a ∆tar∆tsr strain. We were kindly provided with this strain by       the Panke laboratory, however since it was not used in crucial experiments we will not go into the details of its characteristics.
The plate
We performed our experiment using rectangular 9x15 cm plates for two reasons: they allow to easily plate a long straight line of transformants"

Edinburgh,2015,Team:Edinburgh#HeroinBiosensor_-_-_TEXT.html," luciferase as the coupled assay, which produced light in the presence of heroin7. To make the biosensor produce colour to the visible eye, and not light, we incorporated Nitrotetrazolium Blue (NBT) instead of the FMN oxidoreductase and luciferase. NBT, when coupled with phenozine methosulfate (PMS), reacts with the NADPH produced to create an insoluble purple-blue formazan 8. The intensity of the formazan indicates the heroin purity.
Heroin esterase was isolated from Rhodococcus erythropolis strain H1 in 1994 from the garden soil at Cambridge and is able to use heroin as its sole carbon source9. The gene her encodes this enzyme and has the ability to be expressed in  the chassis Escherichia coli 6. The sequence for our enzyme used the original sequence from Rathbone, et al., and was then codon optimised for E. coli. The RFC25 prefix and suffix were added along which required all illegal sites (EcoRI, SpeI, AgeI, NotI, NgoMIV and XbaI) to be removed. As this was a difficult sequence to make as a gBlock, it was ordered as a gene in an ampicillin backbone where it was then digested and ligated into the pSB1C3 backbone.
Morphine dehydrogenase, the second enzyme required for this biosensor, was isolated from Pseudomonas putida M10 in 1993. This enzyme is capable of oxidising morphine and codeine to morphinone and codeinone but not thebaine allowing high specificity10. The sequence was obtained from Willey, et al., for the structural gene morA11. After codon optimizing the sequence for E. coli, adding the RFC25 prefix and suffix and getting rid of illegal restriction sites we were able to order the gBlock from IDT.
The idea for the heroin biosensor is to put crude cell extract of the two enzymes fused to CBDs to allow the enzymes to be immobilised on the paper. The mixture of the two lysates with NBT and PMS freeze dried on the paper allows the production of a blue colour in the presence of heroin in a solution. The intensity of the blue colour depends on the concentration of heroin as it shows how much NADPH is being reduced. Morphine and codeine are two major contaminants of heroin12 which will yield false positives on the biosensor as the morphine dehydrogenase can oxidise"

The enzyme in N. multiformis that converts nitrite to nitrate in nitrification performs a reversible reaction, so Le Chatelier's principle suggests that the denitrification pathway will work because equilibrium will drive the reaction to produce nitrogen gas. Knocking out the nitrate reductase in N. multiformis will also ensure that our chassis is forced to proceed through the denitrification pathway instead of producing nitrate.

4 The 5th CCiC
On August 27, we attended the fifth CCiC held by ShanghaiTech university.
We presented our project at this meeting and had communication with other iGEM teams.
While communicating with the SJTU-BioX-shanghai team, we learned about another pathway of perceived nitric oxide-mediated by the promoter PyeaR. We wanted to compare the performance differences between the promoter PyeaR they used and the promoter PnorV we used later. In addition, an iGEMer introduced the improved SYNB1618 strain obtained by E. Coli Nissle 1917 with better safety. We are prepared to use this strain in the future. Through this meeting, we made a lot of friends and got a lot of useful advice.
5 Visitation of Pharmaceutical Factory
We wanted to make the lab work available to the market one day, so we asked ourselves if there was a possibility of mass production of the drug in our program. It is what we need to think about. With such an issue in mind, we visited pharmaceutical companies.
While some of our outreach to our community was short-term, we worked closely with our community partners to ensure that our impact does not end with this project. We will construct an organization aiming to learn more about IBD and other intestinal disease,and to devoted ourselves into the cause of provoking people's awareness of these diseases.
During the whole process, the researchers introduced to us the production method of the drug Zhengchangsheng, which inspired us to make our engineered bacteria into capsules for oral use by patients in the future.

This will confirm that the introduction of TGATG allows the plasmid to highly express the gene of interest (the upstream gene of TGATG), thereby avoiding the overall metabolic enhancement effect brought by gdh. The experimental group are as shown above.
After transforming plasmids into E.coli trans5α, we inoculated recombinant bacteria in M9 medium supplemented with amp and calibrated OD600 = 1 for each group. After a while, we measured the fluorescence intensity and OD600 of each group. Fluorescence intensity / OD600is used to roughly indicate the amount of fluorescence expression per cell, so that we can rule out the deviation caused by the number of cells.
The experimental results show that the average fluorescence intensity of Stop-Start Codon Overlap and HAIRPIN were significantly higher than that of control1, which indicates that the introduction of TGATG/hairpin and gdh successfully screened high-yield strains with strong expression ability. It was higher than the control2, indicating that the introduction of TGATG/hairpin brought gdh’s growth advantage for strains with high expression of GFP. The results of this experiment preliminarily prove that our final design is feasible.

Experimental design
The experimental group's bacteria were transferred to our designed T7 final part. Our system hopes to reduce the target gene degradation rate and prolong the plasmid retention time by positively promoting growth, thus replacing negative selection with antibiotics. Our experiments are built around the purpose of verifying this. In this experiment, GFP was used as the target gene. We can determine the expression level of the target gene by measuring the fluorescence intensity of GFP. The fluorescence intensity of a certain volume of bacteria is not only affected by the amount of GFP in the bacteria, but also the total number of bacteria in the bacteria. In order to judge the expression level of GFP by fluorescence intensity more accurately and scientifically, we chose to use the fluorescence intensity/od value at the same time to finally measure the level of GFP expression of the strains transferred to different plasmids(Single cell fluorescence Value ="

Collaboration with the other iGEM teams
In the course of our project, we established collaborations with several iGEM teams.
Collaboration with TU-Delft
Firstly, we established a collaboration with the IGEM TU Delft team , after realizing that our two projects had one component in common: Biosilica. Since we had already done an extended bibliography search on this topic, we helped them by sending them some links on refractive index measurement methods using the surface plasmon resonance technique, and a couple of other articles we believed could help their project. Additionally, we talked with them (via Skype) about the poly-silicate structure and the optical effects of biologically produced poly-silicate. Then we sent documents to help them for their literature search. In the biomineralization paper we pointed to them that the experiments (silification of wood in the laboratory, Gotze et al, pg 275) performed, and the analysis showed that materials that were deposited have a peak size of 20 nm or so, and spectral analysis shows absorption at 500 nm (similar to Opal). Some similar values of the optical characteristics of bimoneralized silica. Here is the references of these papers, click on the book to Download them:
Following an interview on Skype we also talked about laboratory manipulations. This led us to help them in protocols on labwork for their protein purification, we advised them to use a His-tag (A polyhistidine-tag or Histag) which is an amino acid motif in proteins that consists of at least six histidine residues, often inserted at the N- or C-terminus of the protein. Various purification kits for His-tagged proteins are available from Biorad, Qiagen, Sigma, GE Lifesciences, and others. We also helped them to develop a testing strategy for expression and validation of expression, especially with the choice of methods of induction (IPTG,  growth curves, taking the OD (optical density) at different times, and methods of comparison whether or not there has been expression SDS-P"

Modeling
Centrifuge Power
Before purchasing a motor, we needed to calculate to see what the requirements for power would be.
First we calculated the maximumload (weight) of the rotor plus the samples with the parameters:
Weight of microcentrifuge tube: 1 g
Capacity of microcentrifuge tube: 1.7 mL
Density of LB: approximately equal to water, 1 g / mL
Capacity of rotor: 30 tubes
Density of PLA: 1.25 g / cm3
Volume of rotor (given by AutoDesk Inventor): 106.706 cm3
The maximum load on the motor will be 214.38 grams
Next, we determined the desired speed, which is determined by the miniprep protocol. We proved that minipreps need only 10,000 x g to be effective (see results). Converting RCF (x g) to RPM, with the radius (r) of our rotor being 60 mm:
To find the required torque, we set our desired angular acceleration of the centrifuge to 42 rad/s, which translates to reaching our max speed in 30 seconds. To calculate the moment of inertia, we modeled the centrifuge rotor as a hoop, where the mass of the rotor itself is negligible compared to the total mass of the samples. Ignoring friction and aerodynamic drag:
We found the required torque is 0.0324 N m, which we will use to calculate the RPM generated with this torque.
We found the technical data on the motor in the spec sheet and found the maximum power of the motor to be 180 Watts. However, the motor cannot run at max power for a long period of time due to heat constraints. The max-efficiency current, which lessens the heat constraints is 12A, where the efficiency is about 75%. The efficiency is defined by the ratio of mechanical power (used to drive rotational motion) to the electrical power (current times voltage). At 12 A and 11.1 V (which we will use to approximate the 12 V of our system, we have an efficiency of about 75%. This means electrical work (12 A * "

General questions about art and science
According to you, what is the link between art and science?
Therèse Bichon: In my mind, the artist has to be careful about the audience and the purpose of his work. With scientific work it is not the same. The scientific wants to answer a specific question, improve a system or create new technology. The aim of audience and judgement is not equal. These two domains should be in parallel and not in opposition. Science may change art and art may improve the impact of science on a public.
Alexei Grinbaum: With the notion of science there is also the notion of usefulness, but the purpose could be diverse: to prove that we can do it, to improve a mechanism, or to progress the knowledge. Art is beautiful but ""useless"". The aim is different, we want to raise a question or just to make an artistic work.
Is it possible to have a real collaboration between the artist and the scientist?
Morgan Meyer: I think that there are every kind of collaboration: the scientist that only provides technical support, or the scientist who really thinks about his work. About reactions, every kind of reaction can also be found. Some scientists, who are skeptical about art, may say that there is no precise purpose, and that it will not change science. Through the collaboration between scientists and artists, we can have a global view about what life is.
What can art and science share to open up new horizons?
Thérèse Bichon: Art allows to underline the link between science and reality. Because scientists are often individualistic, art opens a new window on their research and make them aware about potentially danger.
Morgan Meyer : Art and science are distinct by the fact that they belong to different domains. For an artistic work, the author, who may or may not be a scientist, should suggest to the audience the way to look at his/her work. It is not only about beauty, it is also about how spectators will understand your work.
Bioart point of view
What is the main goal of Bio-Art?
Thérèse Bichon : To my mind there are two main goals of Bio-Art. The first one is to inform, because the power of deciding belongs to society. However, someone who is ignorant cannot choose as he does not know the choices. Thus, Bio-Art gives an opportunity to understand synthetic biology or biology in general. Then, I would say that Bio-Art educates its spectators. You learn something when you see a bio-artistic work. However"

REC-CHENNAI,2017,Team:REC-CHENNAI#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," this journey and we have come to understand that the public is more educated about synthetic biology than we expected.
We gave out survey forms before and after explaining our project, and everything we know about synthetic biology. We also did a comparative study between the two and we believe that we have made a change in the minds of people who doubted the potential of synthetic biology.
A little over 250 participants took up the survey and the results were quite interesting. Here are some highlights
After a brief explanation about synthetic biology and Latarcoli, this was the response to the same question.
The rise was significant and a lot more people were informed about synthetic biology.We shot another question before the interaction.
Well, after our interaction there was a significant decrease in the amount of people who voted ‘no’.
We asked a range of questions concerning Latarcoli and its relevance to the society, of which a few are mentioned below. The results gave us so much more confidence about Latarcoli.
This took us by quite a surprise, since we were not expecting the majority of the respondents to know about antibiotic resistance.
We still feel a little proud to have increased awareness, with this result.
We interacted with the 9.4% respondents who thought it was unsafe and found out that they were predominantly worried about human safety and ethical issues. We addressed this, citing laws and regulations governing GMOs. We also explained to them how Latarcin is safe enough for its application in food.
Through this survey, we think we have achieved at least a little part of our objective of creating awareness about synthetic biology.

Since we were working in a large building, during the first weeks, it was hard to find all the different rooms for the various devices.  Besides this, we were also very happy to welcome our new lab buddy “thymio” - an open-source robot from EPFL University.  At this point, we want to thank all our sponsors , who supported us with lab material and chemical substances.  Last but not least, to celebrate the end of a busy semester, we organized a “Spritzerstandl” for all friends of iGEM. As a special surprise, we offered 3D-printed bacteriophages and microscopes made by a team colleague.

Week 4: 24rd of July - 30th of July
Finally, our primers and gBlocks from IDT arrived. We diluted a couple of primers - in fact many, many primers. After a while, all primers were ready for PCR---the first step of successful cloning. Also, the biobricks we needed, provided by iGEM, were extracted from the plates and transformed into E. coli to duplicate them. Sounds easy, but E. coli is not always willing to absorb plasmid DNA. After some tries, we finally convinced E. coli to duplicate our gBlocks and biobricks. The next and last step for this week was our Miniprep-session, to get our biobricks and gBlocks in higher concentrations. Lab-work during the weekend can be exhausting, but the results of this hard work were worth it.

Tuebingen,2014,Team:Tuebingen#Results#Characterization_-_-_TEXT.html,". These are commercially available (e.g. by our sponsor Elicityl ). There are several techniques on hand to monitor the cleavage of these substrates and the formation of the corresponding monosaccharides (galactose and/or N-acetylgalactosamine) e.g. thin-layer chromatography (TLC) [3], high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [4] or NMR. Liu et al. [1] reported that smaller substrate analogues such as GalNAcalpha-pNPP which are typically used to assay glycosidase activity spectrometrically might fail in detecting the activity of NAGA.
Figure 1: Scheme illustrating the detection of glycosidase activity by TLC and HPLC of a hexasaccharide.
Can we efficiently convert erythrocytes to type O (enzyme in solution, substrate on solid phase)?
However the isolated oligosaccharides can only serve as a rough model. If we regard the red blood cells as solid particles with an average size of 6-8uM we have to consider that the diffusion of our substrates (the oligosaccharide on the cell surface) is limited. Furthermore other biomolecules on the cell surface might inhibit the reaction. There are two possibilities to monitor the conversion of red blood cells to blood group 0. First we can use do cross-matching to observe whether our converted erythrocytes show hemagglutination if they are mixed with blood of the group 0 or the Bombay type in the case of the EABase. Second fluorescently labelled monoclonal antibodies against the blood antigens are commercially available and can be used to analyse the erythrocytes in FACS-analysis.
Figure 2: Scheme illustrating the detection of blood antigens on red blood cells by antibody detection and FACS.
Do our enzymes retain activity upon immobilization (enzyme on solid phase, substrate in solution)?
The loading of the SulfoLink resin with our peptides can be roughly estimated by the fluorescence of the carboxyfluorescein coupled to the peptides. We plan to quantify the binding of the fusion proteins to the matrix by comparing the protein concentration in solution before and after incubation with the beads. At this step we can demonstrate the functionality of our immobilization domains.
Figure 3: Loading of the SulfoLink resin with fluorescently labelled peptides and fusion protein.
Subsequently we can perform a glycosidase assay using isolated oligosaccharides as detailed above. By normalizing the activity to the amount of bound protein and comparison with"

Dairy and beef production are important to our daily lives and consumption needs. However, there are serious climate change issues regarding the continual expansion of these industries. The microbiota inside the cow’s rumen releases dangerous amounts of greenhouse gases as they help digest the animal's food. Therefore, finding ways to decrease the production of greenhouse gases of dairy cows and cattle is essential in fighting global warming.
In this year’s iGEM project we fight global warming right at its source - the cows rumen. Using the powerful tools of synthetic biology we were able to reduce the methane levels through a genetically engineered E. coli.

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a"

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Modelling Stability Analysis_-_-_TEXT.html," On the other hand, as shown in figure 2, there are two functions namely nullclines which are obtained by setting $\frac{dx}{dt}=0$ and $\frac{dy}{dt}=0$, have 3 intersections. The intersections, as defined above, represent the equilibrium points of the system. Nonetheless, according to the phase portrait, not all the points are stable; in fact only 2 points are stable to which the arrows points, while one of the intersections is unstable from which the arrows point away, while at the unstable point, all the repressor proteins’ concentrations are of equal concentration. And upon slight perturbation at this point, the system switches to either one of the stable points. This property is shown pictorially that when it is perturbed slightly away from the unstable point, the arrows point to one of the stable points.  And the other intersections are considered stable due to their recovery ability under perturbation.
As expected, phase portrait can be applied to tri-stable toggle switch, which provides us another way to analyze the system stability pictorially.
Fig. 3a. Phase portrait of tristable system, under the condition of Hill’s coefficient, n = 2 and a = 8. Red arrows indicate the 3 intersection points of the three surfaces.
Fig. 3b. Cross-sectional diagram of 3a. Red arrows indicate the intersection points of the three surfaces.
We notice there are three intersections on the phase plane which corresponds to the three stable points identified by Poincare-Perron Theorem in the previous section: $\begin{pmatrix}x_s\\y_s\\z_s\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}a\\a\\0\end{pmatrix}$ , $\begin{pmatrix}x_s\\y_s\\z_s\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}a\\0\\a\end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix}x_s\\y_s\\z_s\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}0\\a\\a\end{pmatrix}$.
Accordingly, it shows that the system has three steady states, which conforms to our original design.

Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," biology if we might now be permitted to dismiss the idea that life is a precise scientific concept’ (Balmer, 2008).  Perhaps the crux of the matter lies in accepting uncertainty in the definition of life.  ‘If Machery is right, that the idea of life is highly complex, but can possibly be defined by science, it would require multiple definitions across multiple fields.  What implications might this have for an ethics that sought to trouble synthetic biology at the level of life definition?  Put another way, if life is not a stable concept how might one argue that it is fundamentally immoral to create it?’ (my emphasis) (Balmer, 2008).  To accept a degree of uncertainty may cause problems for a number of people but certainly it should not for scientists, the comment that ‘Often all it takes is a literary allusion to the idea that truth exists only in the plural – that there is no such thing as a single truth but only a multitude of truths – to make the defenders of one or another truth sense danger, mortal danger.’ (Grass, 1999) should not prove difficult to accept given the consistently questioning nature of scientific endeavour, applied doubt and the search for understanding and facts rather than perfect, absolute truths.  Ethics too possesses this questioning nature, rather than a crystallized absolute decided upon and never to be reconsidered.  We are all ‘perfectly capable of asking ourselves the ethical questions.  Once asked they demand not so much replies as continual, sustained questioning.  To ask is to admit that we have both a need and an obligation to ask, to go on asking and, along the way, to act in accordance.  To ask and not go on is to admit personal failure as an ethical being’ (Saul, 2001)
Patents, Trade and Justice
Rousseau commented “Liberty without justice is a veritable contradiction”.  This sentiment may explain why perhaps one of the most fractious areas of debate concerning synthetic biology has been in terms of patents, trade and justice.  It is of course not surprising that the potential to create microorganisms which can produce fuel such as ethanol or medical components such as artemisinin has attracted such a level of interest and investment.  The potentials are indeed great, but many questions concerning the nature of investment and subsequent patenting of innovations have occurred.  Dr Venter’s work on producing hydrogen for fuel from a synthetic form of Clostridium has received a large level of funding, including an expected $125m over the next five years from US Department of Energy.  Additionally"
Judd_UK,2017,Team:Judd UK#Pages#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"ematical modelling and synthetic biology” [1] that the rate of transcription, also known as the velocity (v) of a reaction, will be proportional to this fraction:
If the TF is an activator, v = kTX(θ)
If the TF is a repressor, v = kTX(1-θ)
Where KTX is the maximum transcription rate of the mRNA.
<img src=""

Because both of our transcription reactions are regulated by a repressor TF, both our velocities will be equal to kTX(1-θ).
The Hill equation is actually used to describe the fraction of a macromolecule saturated by ligand as a function of the ligand concentration. It can be used to describe transcription, but we can also describe our FURactivated reaction by using the Hill equation, where [TF] becomes the iron (II) ions and KTX becomes initial FUR concentrations (FURt). 
We can now consider each reaction. We will use v as an arbitrary variable, simply there to denote a rate of reaction. The r0x notation will be used later in the programming to remove clutter from the code

For the FURactivated reaction, we make a quasi-steady state assumption. This is used when a part of a system reacts much quicker than the other parts, and thus reaches completion on a much smaller timescale. While FURactivated reaction will reach equilibrium on a scale of seconds and minutes, translation and transcription takes hours, so instead of considering the velocity of the reaction, we will assume it happens instantly.

Note that this rate will be negative. This is because it will be decreasing the concentration of the mRNA. We can now put them together, to form an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the rate of mRNA production.

1. How warriors kill enemies:
    AHL1 in warrior I excretes AHL1. AHL1 goes into its enemies and forms a complex with the protein AHL1R. This complex activates the promoter Pahl1, thus activating the expression of LacI. The expression of LacI inhibits the promoter Plac, thus inhibiting the expression of cmR. Because we culture our E. coli in medium containing chloramphenicol, warrior I kills its enemies. As AHL1 cannot activate Pahl2 via AHL2R inside E. coli from warrior I’s group, we fulfill our desire that warrior I just kill the enemies but not bacteria from it own group. Warrior II works in a similar way.
2. How farmers provide nutrients:
    RafD encodes invertase, which can hydrolyze sucrose into glucose and fructose. The signal peptide of HlyA ligated to RafD can help the invertase be secreted through the recognition of its signal sequence. This is our new part. Besides, by combining extrinsic HlyB, HlyD with intrinsic TolC from the nucleoid in E. coli, we form the transporter which helps the invertase to be secreted.
    This whole part is designed to produce a secretory invertase. As our E. coli can use glucose but not sucrose as its carbon source, farmers fulfill the role of providing nutrients.
    However, from our Orthogonality"

Ethics for Synthetic Biology
""The iGEM team BIOSINT México considers that when people talk about ethics, specifically, the members of all the teams, lack of an ethical code to serve as a guide for considering the ethical aspects of the projects.""
As an iGEM team, iGEM Pasteur thinks that it's a very important part of the iGEM and necessary for the evolution of the competition. We are encouraging this initiative! During this collaboration, iGEM Pasteur answered to the ""suggested topics"" survey and traduced from english to french, the ethics guidelines for the iGEM community: Ethics for Synthetic Biology.

3.Our project
We plan to introduce IRE-IRP1 system into Saccharomyces cerevisiae to control the translation of FET3 mRNA, enhancing its iron aborption capability. In the circumstance of low iron concentration, the constitutively expressing IRP1 bonds to the stem loop of IRE preceding the FET3 mRNA, impeding the translation of FET3. Once iron reaches to a high level, the breakdown of IRE-IRP1 interaction shall activate the FET3 translation, which lead to more iron uptake, at last achieve the goal for iron accumulation.[fig.5]

III.Optogenetic apoptosis system
1.Caspase-3
Apoptosis or programmed cell death (PCD) is a highly coordinated cellular suicide program. Caspases, cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases are a family of cysteine proteases that play essential roles in apoptosis[fig.6]. In previous studies in yeast, only the over-expression of caspase 8 led to cell death while the over-expression of caspase 3 was not lethal and only retarded yeast growth. In our design, the apoptosis related protein expresses when exposed to the blue light. Totally dark is harsh to fulfill in the industrial practicing, and urge us put the possibility of expression leakage into consideration, when the toxity of caspase may interfere the iron uptaking. Hence, we choose caspase-3, instead of caspase-8, as the apoptosis trigger.
Fig.6 Extrinsic and intrinsic pathways to caspase-3 activation.
Although yeasts lack some elements of the complex apoptotic machinery of metazoan cells, recent studies show that many features of apoptosis, including a caspase-like activity, can be induced in these organisms by DNA damage and other apoptotic triggers. Here we plan to introduce CASP3 gene from human, and attempt to verify our hypothesis of the apoptosis effect in yeast by Caspase-3.
2.CRY2-CIB1
Cryptochromes (CRY) are photolyase-like blue-light receptors that mediate light responses in plants and animals. Arabidopsis CIB1 (cryptochrome-interacting basic-helix-loop-helix) protein  interacts and only interacts with CRY2 (cryptochrome 2) under blue light condition. This has been varified in both yeast and Arabidopsis cells. Recently, a variety of microbial and plant-derived light-sensitive proteins have been engineered as optogenetic actuators"

Summary
While the iGEM team from Darmstadt has developed the project they quickly realized that the degradation of PET and the recovery of resources are a topic for the entire population. The question was how to inform the whole people, and how to reach them best. For this reason, the iGEM team decided to separate the people into five broad areas. To do so, the team has participated in events, which cover many areas of the society or they organized these events on themselves. At these events it became clear that Synthetic Biology was not a well known topic or was highly controversial discussed. The team took on the task of eliminating the misinformation and to discuss the impact and safety assessment.
The team has organized a student laboratory, in which the students themselves can experience Molecular Biology. Students should learn that DNA and proteins are ordinary tools of biologists. The students have seen, by what means organisms are changed and what safety standards prevail in an S1 laboratory."

Reliability of the output as a function of α for different ratios $\left(\frac{\sum_{on}\mathcal{R}}{\sum_{off}\mathcal{R}}\right)$.

Collaboration iGEM LMU-TUM Munich
Both the iGEM TU Delft and iGEM LMU-TUM Munich teams realized that optimal crRNA is a prerequisite in utilizing Cas13a for their respective detection purposes. In addition to sensitively detecting a sequence of interest, modeling the off-target effects of a chosen crRNA is important in assessing the reliability of the system, as it provides information about the probability of a false positive output. Both teams took a different approach: we employed a kinetic model ( Klein et al. 2017 ) while iGEM LMU-TUM Munich applied an alignment algorithm.
Biophysical modeling has the advantage of providing a unified targeting framework that is able to take into account tiny (local) off-target effects that together may add to affect the reliability of the system. However, it is computationally intensive as compared to homology search and requires the development of the software, which is already available from NCBI for homology search.
We ran 4 off-target simulations for 2 different crRNAs spacer sequences (crRNA1-3 and crRNA4) designed by iGEM LMU-TUM Munich for targeting the 16s ribosomal RNA of two different bacterial species (E. coli DH5α and B. subtilis). The on and off-target activities are modeled for sequences on all possible frames on the genome (Figure 10). From the simulation results, we deduce that the crRNAs specifically target the different bacterial species.
Figure 10: On and off-target effects of Munich crRNAs on different bacterial targets. On and off-target effects of designed crRNAs on different bacterial targets.

An 8th grade class from the local public school, Odense Friskole, were invited to see our laboratory workspace. It was a challenge to successfully convey our project and the concept of synthetic biology in a way that would be easily understandable by 8th graders, who have only recently been introduced to science. A challenge that we accepted and solved, by relaying the fundamentals in synthetic biology, e.g. the basics of a cell, DNA, and GMO.
From all of these presentations and interactions with younger individuals, we had a strong intuition that it had made an influence on their awareness of synthetic biology. This intuition was supported by the positive feedback provided by teachers and students. An awareness of how new scientific technologies can be a feasible solution to a possible energy crisis. Technologies such as synthetic biology, with endless capabilities to achieve efficacy, since no one knows what tomorrow brings. For more information about this read To Future iGEM Teams
Final Presentation at SDU-Denmark
The day before we travelled to Boston, we booked one of the big auditoriums at the University of Southern Denmark, for the final rehearsal of our jamboree presentation. We made sure to take note of all the feedback and tips we received, while also implementing these into our final presentation. This event was promoted on all the information screens at our university in order to attract a broad audience and increase the interest for iGEM. Thus, making it possible to reach a substantial amount of future applications for the SDU-iGEM team and ensure that the iGEM spirit will continue to prosper in the future!
Social Media
Social media is an easy way to impact a high number of people, so a strategy was concocted with the intention of reaching as many people as possible with our outreach. Our strategy yielded marvellous results, amongst which was a video on our project, that reached viewers equal to 16% of our hometown’s population, along with becoming the second most seen bulletin of the year from University of Southern Denmark. They have also asked us to film our experiences at the Jamboree, which will feature on the homepage of the student’ initiative BetonTV. Several articles were written about our project in local newspapers, one was even featured in the saturday special.

Stage 02: Identification of Useful Genes for Making New BioBricks
Identifying Azo-Dye Degrading Enzymes
Searching through the literature, we identified a number of bacterial species (including Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas sp.) that have proven to degrade azo dye compounds [1] [2] [3] [4] .
We contacted the Microbial & Enzyme Technology Lab led by Dr Lígia O. Martins at the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, who are currently researching how azo dye degrading enzymes function, and they were keen to collaborate with us on our project. They agreed to send us a set of five plasmids, each containing different genes encoding azo dye degrading enzymes from both B. subtilis and P. putida (including mutated forms found to exhibit enhanced degradation activity), for us to use in our investigations (see Table below).

From this assay, we assure that the SpyCatcher will not impose negative effect on the binding between nanomaterial and biofilm. The picture was snapped by ChemiDoc MP, BioRad, false colored.
His-CsgA-SpyCatcher
Using the same approach, we also conducted binding assay of His-CsgA-SpyCatcher with QDs to characterize the expression of biofilm and  the visual result shows vividly that His-CsgA-SpyCatcher can bind successfully with the QDs with the existence of inducer aTc, which shows the functional similarity in CsgA-Histag. The picture was snapped by BioRad ChemiDoc MP, false colored.
Fig 11. Quantum dots templating assay on His-CsgA-SpyCatcher biofilm.
3. TEM: visualization of binding test
TEM further characterize the biofilm expressed by strains secreted His-CsgA-SpyCatcher-Histag (HSCH) and His-CsgA-SpyCatcher (HSC) respectively. The distinct nanofiber network manifested the large biofilm expression.
Fig 12. aTc induced secretion of His-CsgA-SpyCatcher-Histag and His-CsgA-SpyCatcher visualized by TEM. Without the presence of inducer, there’s no nanofiber formation around scattered bacteria.
CsgA-His can interface with different inorganic materials since they form the coordinate bonds with the same ligand, Co-NTA, on nanomaterials. Here we use to AuNPs in place of quantum dots and nanomaterials to characterize the validity of Histags on CsgA fused amyloid protein and meanwhile prove the versatility of our biofilm-based platform.  As the figures shown, we confirm the feasibility of our newly constructed biobricks to template inorganic material and thus form bio-abiotic hybrid system.
Fig 13. After aTc induced, biofilm secreted by His-CsgA-SpyCatcher-Histag and His-CsgA-SpyCatcher mutants organize AuNP around the cells. In contrast with the third one without inducer, there’s nothing templating on the seemingly smooth outermembrane of bacteria.

I.3) Numerical evaluation
We have simulated the effect of arm length on free energy (low free energy implies high binding probability) using the Born salvation free model, pair van der Waals energy, and electrostatic potential, described above. However, there are some parameters that we are not sure about (Equivalent charge and Hamacker coefficient of Zinc fingers, equivalent charge and Hamacker coefficient of base pair) that depend on charge distribution of the DNA strand, which should be determined experimentally as boundary conditions. Alternatively, one could consider each base pair with independent charge.
The systems have been simulated in MATLAB.
Figure 1 shows a rendering of the bacteria - arm compound (E. Coli in blue, zinc fingers in red, arms in orange).
Figure 1. Rendering of bacteria connected to DNA arms through zinc fingers expressed superficially.
Figure 2 shows relative free energy against arm length. As expected, the longer the arms, the lower is the free energy, and thus the higher is the bonding probability.
Figure 2.Effect of arm length on free energy for a constant zinc finger surface distribution.
Figure 3 shows relative free energy against arm length, where the distribution of zinc fingers is randomized. We notice that the distribution of the zinc fingers plays a very important role in the binding as shown in the figure where the distribution is varied randomly, but the trend is more and less the same as when the distribution is assumed to be deterministic.
Figure 2.Effect of arm length on free energy for randomly distributed zinc finger distribution.
I.4) Conclusion
The bead approximation and thermodynamic information theoretical framework we proposed effectively captures the challenge of modeling binding probability where different DNA strands compete in binding with a multitude of zinc fingers. The model takes into account the geometry and charge magnitude distribution on the bacteria and the DNA strands.

Our other approach was community-outreach based. We aligned ourselves with our local museum to be guest scientists for a few of their camps throughout the summer. We also involved ourselves in demonstrations and science fair activities for youth, see more on our silver medal HP page.
In the Lab
Our Regional Health Authority, Northern Health
At the beginning of the year, during the process of picking our project, we had multiple conversations with the CEO of Spirit of the North Healthcare Foundation (works in cooperation with the Northern Health Authority, the regional health authority for Northern British Columbia) as well as with other Northern Health Professionals (NHP). Through these discussions we learned that the predominate mode of MRSA transmission in healthcare facilities is from one (infected or colonized) patient to another through contaminated hands of healthcare providers. They indicated that those at greatest risk of infection are the elderly, those with chronic diseases and/or those undergoing invasive procedures. We also learned that the current treatment for those infected with MRSA is vancomycin, an intravenous antibiotic that has been compared in harshness to chemotherapy. NHP’s also discussed concern in their daily practice about the spread and proliferation of MRSA.
Furthermore, Northern Health provided statistics for us that indicated that, in comparison to the Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Public Health Agency of Canada 2015 infection rates of 0.29 MRSA cases per 1000 pt. days compared to Northern Health infection rates, which were higher at 0.37 per 1000 pt. days in 2015 -2016.
The combination of concerning statistics, as well as with the information provided to use from NHP’s demonstrated to our team the burden MRSA on Northern communities. These conversations and burden ultimately became the factors propelling our project choice.
Medical Lab Technicians at Canada Day
We had the opportunity to speak with a few laboratory technicians during our time at a local park for Canada day. This group of three technicians were extremely interested in our project. At the time, we had two branches planned for our project, first was to use hfq protein to bind our constructed sRNA’s to S. Epidimidis, and second was to develop a novel detection method for MRSA. Through our discussions with these lab technicians we learned that there is new detection method just about to break the market. We then asked them if they thought proceeding with our detection method would be worthwhile, to which they replied no. With this new information, we looked further into current and projected methods and found consistency in what the lab technicians informed us of. Therefore,"

Cambridge,2010,Team:Cambridge#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the maximum chance of being taken forward and used to promote further thought rather than reaching intellectual dead ends? And what can we do to maximise knowledge recycling?
We believe the need for openness and sharing of ideas to be of considerable importance to further knowledge, in the iGEM competition and beyond and the information society that we live in makes the sharing of ideas and finding relevant knowledge easier than ever before. The breadth and depth humanity’s current scientific understanding means that it is difficult for any single person to know enough about a particular area to make substantial advances on their own; collaboration is essential. It is not enough to only publicise and publish polished results at the end of a project. Work in progress should be made just as accessible to encourage this collaboration. Making available results from, and information about, experiments that failed is also important. It could prevent someone from wasting time trying exactly the same protocol again and may in fact be an important result in itself (that what was attempted be discovered simply cannot be discovered in that way).
It is difficult to get research papers published for experiments that do not work, though journals such as the Journal of Articles in Support of the Null Hypothesis are changing this. Instead experiment attempts could be documented on wikis or blogs such that they are still available to someone searching the internet for them - this means all the hand work is not wasted, even if the desired results are not obtained. Protocols and techniques are particularly valuable when shared; reproducibility is a central concept to science and standardising protocols is necessary for this. Putting detailed protocols up on sites such as open wetware also helps encourage new researchers to get involved the particular field and prevents time and resources being wasted optimising procedures.
After coming to these conclusions from our discussions we made sure we conducted our research in the light of these ideas. We got our Wiki up as early as possible with our aims and ideas and kept the online lab book updated with our ongoing research. We always endeavoured to be open and honest about exactly the protocols we were using and what results they gave. The UNAM Genomics, Mexico team contacted us because of the information on our Wiki and we were able to collaborate with them and help them with part of their project. We were also able to have useful discussions with the Edinburgh team based on information we read on each other’s Wikis. From our thoughts about sharing our findings we decided that we should put effort into publicising our science. Our project will be featured on a documentary to be broadcast on ARTE which will bring a better understanding of synthetic biology to the general public. We also wanted to get a message across to"
BYUProvo,2012,Team:BYUProvo#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," Miller units, the enzyme activity of each thermosensor at 3 different temperatures: 30°C, 35°C, and 37°C.
It is interesting to note the change in enzyme activity for many thermosensors from 35°C to 37°C. These thermosensors are particularly useful for our project, because this range is close to the physiological temperature range for mutating cells. Higher temperatures and smaller temperature ranges in which the thermosensor unfolds indicate a better quality thermosensor. We determined the secondary structure of each thermosensor using Matlab (we also compared this with the online program RNAfold, seeing almost identical results). A few of the secondary structures are shown below. We used these secondary structures to determine the total number of bonds within each RNA hairpin. Using text values, G-C = -2.0 kcal/mol, U-A = -1.0 kcal/mol, and U-G = -0.8 kcal/mol, we calculated the bonding energies. We then compared the bonding energies to the change in enzyme activity and to the total number of bonds. In both comparisons, we identified the data point representing the wild type thermosensor as an outlier (G-test) and removed it.
Performing a linear regression on the data comparing bonding energies to enzyme activity, we found a line with slope m = 0.969 and intercept b = 0.343. The r^2 value for this dataset was 0.4703. We performed a similar regression on the data comparing Total number of bonds to enzyme activity, finding a line with slope m = 0.940 and intercept b = 0.236. The r^2 value for this dataset was 0.639. Thus, for our thermosensor library, to determine which species would have a large change in enzyme activity, another a measure of quality, it is more useful to look at the total number of bonds than to look at the individual G-C, A-U and G-U bond content which determine the bonding energy.

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Science#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," decided to put that to the test! In order to do that we used Flux Balance Analysis (FBA). FBA is a method that uses the metabolism model of E.coli (see below) and calculates the flow of metabolites through that system that is required to maximise a given objective.
The image below demonstrates the E. coli metabolism plotted in Cytoscape (Cline, 2007):
 
In our case we used growth rate as the objective to maximise. We performed FBA for the core E.coli metabolism with and without Ubiquinone present. With Ubiquinone present the growth rate was calculated to be 0.98 h -1 . Without Ubiquione in the system the growth rate was found to be 0  h -1 , indicating that E.coli would not grow and survive without ubiquione. This suggested that silencing the essential genes for Ubiquinone production and supplying it externally would give us control over the survival of the chassis and ultimately allow us to contain it.
Core metabolism map used for FBA
Currently Synthetic biology is primarily based on the use of active modules (usually enzymes) from organisms to create one single organism that can successfully execute a goal. However without understanding the enzymatic action on a molecular scale we are unlikely to ever be able to improve them or design our own. Be believe that this will be the future of SynBio and therefore we have made a special effort to further the understanding of the enzymes we are using via chemical mechanism modelling in conjunction with our chemistry department.
Azo Reductase
The mechanism of reductive cleavage can either be thought of a step wise addition of H+ ions and electrons or hydride and H+ ions in concert as pictured below
Laccase and Peroxidases
Although many papers have touched on these oxidation mechanisms; they tend to skip steps and don’t make entire sense. Examples of this exist in [1]:
It’s issues include radicals gaining electrons and remaining radicals. Protons disappearing and more of the like. We have therefore worked hard to create a mechanism that makes sense.
Other reactions such as the polymerisation are lacking literature completely and therefore have been modelled as below. The example polymerisation is via the azo reductase product of mordant brown 33.

For more information, please visit our Parts page.
Current clinically-relevant pathogens have not been seen to exhibit resistance against our antimicrobial proteins of choice. Art-175 has been experimentally shown to be not susceptible to resistance development, likely because it targets the structural element of the bacterial cell wall that is highly conserved across species and difficult to mutate [ 8 ]. The mechanism by which Microcin S exerts antimicrobial activity is still currently unknown, but no bacterial strains except for the original strain of probiotic E. coli which produces Microcin S has been shown to be resistant to it thus far [ 9 ].
Secreting the Proteins
The proven secretion of folded, functional proteins across both bacterial cell membranes is a challenge for present day microbiologists. Our solution requires that we can export DspB, DNase, Art-175 and MccS out of the expression host and into the local biofilm environment. To achieve this, signal sequences are fused to the enzymes to target them for export through natural E. coli secretion pathways. Using this mechanism we can direct our anti-biofilm and antimicrobial agents at a biofilm infected surface as they are being produced.
DsbA
DsbA is a oxidoreductase protein found predominantly in Gram-negative bacteria, which functions as a protein-folding factor [ 19, 20 ]. The 2-19 peptide sequence of DsbA is a signal sequence that can direct passenger proteins for co-translational export via the signal recognition particle pathway [ 21, 22 ]. It has recently been shown that the DsbA signal sequence is capable of mediating passenger protein secretion under a selection of different induction temperatures [ 23 ].

OVERVIEW
Aside from plastic degradation and alkane metabolism, generation of electricity was another important focus of our iGEM project. For this module, we focused on generating a stable electrical current by utilizing Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 strain’s inbuilt extracellular electron transport mechanism. In order to better harness its electrogenicity, we housed a culture of the bacterium within a microbial fuel cell of our design, aiming at maximizing electrical output for a given amount of substrate.
While many other microorganisms are capable of electron transport by reduction of suitable substrate, we chose to work with Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 strain as it is a relatively well-studied facultative anaerobe capable of generating current by reducing a broad range of substrates, utilizing them as metabolites. While the processes behind this electron transport mechanism are not yet fully understood, it is known that a few outer and inner-membrane Cytochromes are responsible for the shuttling of electrons from within the cell body to the extracellular substrate. The multiple heme-centres present within these Cytochromes allows for efficient transport of electrons to the extracellular space. The extracellular electron transport mechanism is described in figure 1.
Figure 1 Extracellular Electron Transport mechanism of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1
According to literature[1], electrons are shuttled from the inner-membrane Cytochrome c molecule CymA to another Cytochrome c molecule, MtrA, present in the periplasm. They are then transported to the outer-membrane Cytochromes MtrC and OmcA. These outer-membrane cytochromes are in fact lipoproteins associated to the outer membrane and outer-membrane protein MtrB. By this arrangement, the outer-membrane Cytochromes are exposed to the extracellular space where they may reduce suitable substrates. This reduction may occur by direct contact between cell surface and substrate or may be mediated by Flavins[2] to reduce substrate far from the cell surface"

c. Did you receive any biosafety and/or lab training before beginning your project?If so, describe this training.
All the team members had already been through extensive lab training and biosafety rules, because of previous experimental projects at the Center for Microbial Biotechnology, DTU. It was therefore decided that the laboratory work could be initiated after signing the formula concerning CMB’s safety rules and writing the project description without further laboratory training.
d. Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines?If so, provide a link to them online if possible.
In Denmark, specific laws and guidelines exist, that are to be considered when working with GMO. These guidelines are based on “Bekendtgørelse om genteknologi og arbejdsmiljø” (“The Order of Gene Technology and Working Environment) from 2008, which is based on guidelines/rules determined by the European Union (1). Our project has followed the guidelines and laws set by the authority in Denmark and the European Union. In conclusion, the organisms and biobricks used in this project do not represent any hazard to the researchers, when working in the laboratory or to the public safety. If the safety standard procedure is followed there is also no risk for contamination of the environment.

HNS/HNST108I
We aimed to compare bacteria motility between two kinds of HNS knock-out E. Coli; first one expresses HNS protein and the other one expresses HNST108I mutant gene. In order to produce these proteins in high amounts, we chose to combine GadE sequence with T7 promoter, a promoter which has a high rate of transcription. In addition to this, to have a controllable system, LacI protein attachable Lac operator was added between these two gene’s sequences and T7 promoter sequence. We searched to find a vector which can lay down all those conditions and found out that peT-45 expression vector is useful. When we ordered our genes, we put RFC10 prefix site on 3’ end of HNS and HNST108I and also BamHI restriction enzyme recognition site for cloning them into peT-45. We added RFC10 suffix site on 5’ end of the same gene sequences and also XhoI restriction enzyme recognition site for cloning to peT-45 vector, again.
As shown above,we planned to clone the ordered HNS and HNST108I genes into peT-45 vector"

As can be seen from Figure 3, a maximum of approximately 3 mismatches is tolerated by Cas13a. We can use a binomial distribution to compute the probability that a random target and spacer have at most 3 mismatches (thus having 25 or more matches) is low:
$$ P_{\textrm{at least 25 matches}} = \sum ^{28}_{m=25} \frac{28!}{(28-m)!m!} \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^m \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{28-m} = 1.276 \cdot 10^{-12} \tag{7}$$
Having found suitable model parameters for $\Delta C$ and $\Delta I$, we can now employ the model to compute the cleavage probability for different guides and plasmids (or even entire genomes). We started by investigating the relative cleavage probability of our crRNA 1-5 on the tetracycline-resistance conferring (TcR) plasmid that the crRNAs were designed target (Figure 4). We were able to confirm that crRNAs 1-4 target the plasmid at the desired position. However, we also found that crRNA 5 did not meet the design requirements of the PFS: the position 3’ to the target sequence was a G. This finding prevented us from wasting time on testing crRNA 5 in the lab. This is also the reason why we will not consider crRNA 5 in the remainder of the simulations.

Cas13a activation on TcR plasmid for crRNA 1 to 5 ($\Delta C=0.25$,$\Delta I=2.5$). Figures a-e display the predicted relative probability of cleavage of Cas13a on every position along the TcR plasmid. crRNAs 1-4 clearly showed the designed on-target hit approximately at position 1750. crRNA 5 only shows off-target activity, indicating a design flaw that prevented us from wasting time on testing crRNA 5 in the lab.

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.       There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.

Both Jacobians were calculated and they were decomposed through similarity transformation of their eigenvalues and eigenvectos to obtain the modal matrices. This matrices represent the formation of molecular ‘pools’ on the system and the negative inverse of the eigenvalus represent the time scales at which this interactions occur. The Jacobians and modal matrices can be downloaded on Excel (.xls) format if you click here .
