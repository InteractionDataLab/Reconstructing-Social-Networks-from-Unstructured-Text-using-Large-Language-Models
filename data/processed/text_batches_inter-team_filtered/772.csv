6/12/14: (Devora typed today up)  Took photos of the pACYC184 plates that didn't grow then threw them out.  Took some of the pACYC184+UV and put it in 5 mL of LB media + 30uL of 25 mg/mL chloramphenicol and let it incubate in the shaker starting at about 11:45 AM. Took it out at 5:00 PM.   We set up the PCR of the pACYC184 and pBR322 by adding 20 mL of pACYC184+UV and pBR322+GFP mixed with 200 uL of water along with 2.5 uL of each of our forward and backward primers. We put it on #130 and will leave it overnight because it's late and we won't be here to take it out.  Then we inoculated our pACYC184 and pBR322 with constructs by doing a 1 in 10 dilution of the already inoculated cultures. Basically, we split up the 2 cultures into two different 50 mL conical tubes each. Each conical tube got 25 mL of LB media with the required antibiotic concentration (150 uL of chloramphenicol for pACYC184 and 25 uL of ampicilin for pBR322) and added 250 uL of the already inoculated plasmid into each. We put them in the shaker-incubater at 37 C overnight atarting at 5:00 PM.   We made a stock concentration of LB ampicilin media using 250 ul of amp into 250 mL of LB media.   Re-suspended the primers that came by adding 10X the amount of TE buffer in uL as there was ng of primers in the container.

A project with the essence of ours would not be possible without the validation and feedback of expert researchers, beekeepers, and governmental organizations. The problem against which we are fighting has a global presence and for us, it was indispensable to listen also affected persons of outside our country. Making us stronger in the entrepreneurship part was also essential; the selling of a product of this nature implicates different marketing strategies and taking courses about this was crucial for the development of the business model.
We believe that for synthetic biology projects to catch the attention of the community and be considered, it is necessary for people to get informed, get involved and participate. We made different Public Engagement activities for pursuing this objective, covering from our principal concern, beekeepers, up to students from middle school till college. As mentioned before our local community is just a tiny part of the society so we got involved in national and international events.
The the project evolved got better and fitted in thanks to all the different events mentioned in this timeline. We present here a general overview of what we did in each event; when entering each section at the end of the page we detail how each experience molded our project.

Project Overview
Biofilms are cells encased in a hydrated extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix that is composed of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids (Lu & Collins 2007). Biofilms act as a protective umbrella for their inhabitants against various adverse conditions and can aid in communication between cells (Foley & Gilbert 1996). Biofilms have recently become a concern in various fields, including health, food, and energy. The structure of biofilms make them difficult to remove once mature. By protecting the cells involved and facilitating horizontal gene transfer biofilms increase virulence of the incorporated bacteria.
Synthetic biologists are beginning to tackle the problem of biofilms, as evidenced by the number of iGEM teams interested in the degradation and inhibition of biofilms in recent years.  These projects have been conducted using the workhorse of synthetic biology, E. coli, with a focus on finding ways to kill the bacteria in the biofilm before the biofilm is formed (inhibition) or by infiltrating the biofilm (degradation).  Our team approached this problem differently in two ways: we aimed to exploit the rigorous type I secretion pathway of Caulobacter crescentus, and we sought to degrade the EPS rather than kill the involved cells.
We decided to utilize Caulobacter because it has many advatages over E. coli for our purposes.  The first of these is the robust TypeI secretion system that Caulobacter uses to secret its paracrystalline S-layer protein, RsaA, which makes up 10-12% of manufactured protein in lab strain CB15N (a strain which is deficient in producing a holdfast). Caulobacter is an aquatic bacterium and it grows well in low-nutrient environments.  Like E. coli, Caulobacter is gram-negative and has had its genome sequenced, however Caulobacter is safer for use around humans as it produces 100 times less endotoxin than E. coli, and is unable to survive in a human body. To exploit the secretion pathway, we planned to attach the C-terminal secretion tag from RsaA to a bio"

The DNA Printing team came into the lab to start testing the plain slides from Mycroarray to see if E Coli cells would naturally stick to the slides and what buffers should be used.
⇒ Looked up a PBS recipe for our first buffer. We added 2.62 g NaH2PO4(H2O), 11.5 g Na2HPO4, and 43.84 g NaCl to 450 mL dH2O. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 using 4 M NaOH (odd because the protocol only told us to adjust it using HCl). The final volume was brought to 500 mL. We then made 400 mL of 1xPBS buffer by diluting it with dH2O.
⇒ DH5alpha cells were centrifuged and the liquid drained from it. A small amount of the dense cells were placed in a 50 mL centrifuge tube and nearly 50 mL of 1xPBS media was added to the tube.
⇒ One blank slide was placed in the centrifuge tube with cells and PBS and let sit for 20 minutes.
⇒ After 20 minutes, we removed the slide without rinsing and checked it under the microscope. There were definitely E Coli cells stuck to the slide. This is most likely due to us choosing not to rinse the slides.

MODIFIED CELL
aiiA: UNREGULATED GENE RESPONSIBLE FOR QUORUM SENSING INHIBITION
After studying the wild cell behavior, one of our solutions to turn off its virulence was to genetically modify Erwinia amylovora. We introduced a gene that codifies to an AHL degrading enzyme, AHL-lactonase (aiiA). In bacterial pathogens, this enzyme disrupts bacterial quorum sensing, consequently inhibiting the production of pathogenesis factors.
In this modified bacteria, the aiiA gene (green rectangle) codifies to our antidote protein (green oval) in an unregulated manner. After some time, the protein production will reach a constant production big enough to act on the quorum sensing regulation. With a constitutive aiiA expression, we expect a complete and uninterrupted inhibition of the AHLs activity by hydrolyzing them and varying the lengths of their acyl chains, modifying their conformational structure. Therefore its autoregulation will be unable to be completed, resulting in no more AHL production.
To model the behavior of this gene inside Erwinia amylovora, we first came to several assumptions discussed below.

Telus Spark Science
Calgary's local science centre, Telus Spark, let us share with their visitors hands on activities with synthetic biology during their monthly Adults Only Night.  We had two showcases over the summer.  The first, showed off the ability of bacteria to be engineered with genes for fluorescent proteins by getting people to draw art on agar plates. The second, was a public beta test of our synthetic biology video game.
Minds In Motion
We partnered with Minds in Motion, a science and engineering camp for elementary aged students run through the University of Calgary.  We hosted 'synthetic biology' afternoons throughout the summer where the kids got to do crafts and run 'experiments' pertaining to synthetic biology.  They even got to wear cool 'sciencey' gloves!
Genome Alberta Blog Posts
One of our generous sponsors, Genome Alberta, invited us to post blog entries on their webpage about the life of an iGEM student.  We had a great time writing about the humorous and sometimes stressful life of a student on an iGEM team.  This was a great way to interface with industry and academia to convey a more humanistic view of synthetic biology.  After all, we're all kind of normal...maybe...
TED City 2.0
Our team was chosen by TEDxCalgary to work with them on developing a TED talk for the upcoming City 2.0 international event in Calgary.  This was an awesome challenge for us to present what we're doing to a general audience in a relevant and meaningful way.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Tag-Optimization_-_-_TEXT.html,"PS pathways and bacterial strains can be used, when creating novel engineered NRPS pathways. We implemented our findings into the ""NRPS-Designer"" Software , so that the underlying algorithm for NRPS design takes into consideration the abovementioned findings (e.g. domain border setting) which are certainly crucial for successful in silico prediction of functional NRPSs. Moreover, we modeled the indigoidine production of our constructs (please find more detailed information on our Indigoidine Production Model Page ). The crystal structure of our optimized indigoidine synthetase, which is currently investigated by the group of Dr. Bange (Philipps-University Marburg), will give more insight into structural aspects of non-ribosomal peptide synthesis.
Thereby, our project pioneers the research on high-throughput methods for creation and optimization of synthetic NRPS modules composed of user-defined domains. We believe that our findings will highly contribute to future development of custom NRPSs.
Methods
Cloning Strategy
We assembled the different indC variants on a chloramphenicol resistance backbone (pSB1C3) with an IPTG-inducable lac-promoter, the ribosome binding site BBa_B0034 and the coding sequence of the respective indC variant. The indC plasmids should be co-transformed with a PPTase construct to get a significant and fast indigoidine production. Therefore, we used a second plasmid backbone carrying a kanamycin resistance (pSB3K3). We assembled five pSB3K3 derived plasmids, each carrying an expression cassette with an IPTG induceable lac-promotor, the BBa_B0029 ribosome binding site and the coding sequence of the respective PPTase (sfp, svp, entD, delC and ngrA). We used E. coli TOP10 for co-transformations of the possible combination of the indC variants and all PPTase plasmids.
Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning
Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning (CPEC) is a sequence-independent cloning method based on homologous recombination of double-strand DNA overlaps of vector and insert(s) ( Fig. 11 )(Quan 2008). It is suitable for the generation of combinatorial, synthetic construct libraries as it allows for multi-fragment assembly in an accurate, efficient and economical manner.

The arrow in the figure indicates proteins corresponding to the molecular weight of MVN-mRFP (38kDa).
rTEV protease digestion assay
INP can help display our protein on the outer membrane, but the orientation is unsure. So we designed this rTEV   protease digestion assay to verify that MVN is oriented outwards into the medium. Also we can roughly estimate the   amount of outward-displayed MVN that can be digested each E. coli from the result too.
We constructed the functioning plasmid by the means of PCR and Gibson Assembly. The plasmid uses pSB1C3 as the   vector and expresses the fusion protein INPNC-MVN-mRFP. We designed a 7aa protein linker named Linker2 between INPNC   and MVN which can be specifically recognized and digested by rTEV protease. Also, there is a Linker1 between MVN and   mRFP to ensure that the fluorescence is not affected. The coding sequence is regulated by the promoter J23105, the   RBS B0034 and the terminator B0015. We transformed the plasmid into E. coli BL21(DE3) after the construction   work.
Figure 6. Final construct of the plasmid for rTEV protease digestion assay. Linker2 is a 7aa linker that can be specifically digested by rTEV protease. Linker1 is the 10aa flexible protein   domain linker mentioned in Figure.4. The whole INPNC-MVN-mRFP fusion protein is expressed under the constitutive   promoter J23105.
To make our results persuasive, we also constructed 3 control groups: C1, C2 and C3. Plasmid C1 has the Linker2   shifted to Linker1 so that it can not be digested by rTEV protease. Plasmid C2 has the INPNC and Linker2 sequence   deleted so that MVN-mRFP is not displayed on the cell surface. Plasmid C3 has the whole coding sequence from INPNC   to mRFP deleted. We also have a blank control group with no cells added.

ETH_Zurich,2017,Team:ETH Zurich#Experiments#Anti Cancer Toxin_-_-_TEXT.html,"in-free bacterial via calcein AM assay.
PROCEDURE
For the two different cell lines, namely,  HeLa CCL-2 lc and HT-29, cells were seeded in 2 different 12-well culture plates with initial concentration of 100'000 cells/mL. After 24-hour growth the cells are incubated with increasing amounts of azurin-free lysate in order to assess the effect of the lysate on the cancer cell growth . Simultaneously, cell samples were also incubated with increasing amount of PBS, instead of lysate, in order to check the effect of nutrient depravation on the cell growth. After 24 hours the cells, apart from the HeLa CCL-2 lc, were incubated with calcein AM solution. The viability of the cells was assessed via fluorescnce microscopy. The samples of HeLa CCL-2 lc cell-line were directly examined for their viability via fluorescence microscopy as these cells are producing constitutively citrine.  A detailed protocol is available in Protocols.
RESULTS
From the microscopy pictures obtained, we could verify that the bacterial lysate can substitute up to 20% of the HeLa CCL-2 lc culture volume without affecting the cell growth (Figure 12).
Figure 12. Pictures of HeLa CCL-2 lc cell cultures after 24-hour incubation with different amount of azurin-free lysate or PBS. The upper row of images depicts the fluorescence stemming from HeLa lc cells incubated with 0%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30% bacterial lysate, while the lower row depicts the cell samples incubated with 0%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30% PBS in order to assess if the decrease in cell viability is originating from bacterial toxins or due to nutrient depravation.
Different cell lines were expected to react differently when exposed to bacterial lysates, and that is the case for the HT-29 cancer-cell line which seems that cannot tolerate the same amount of azurin free bacterial lysate as HeLa CCL-2 lc (Figure 13).

Shen Yunhao finished the lux positive feedback plasmid. Even before extraction the broth shone very brightly. We decided to build an IPTG induction device above the quorum sensing system.
Week12 20180610-20180616
Light sensing still had no results. We decided to divide and conquer, separating the sensor HPTC to several parts and then ligate. However sequencing and colony PCRs indicated that the construction of smaller parts were no lighter work than the entire plasmid. We decided to change the construction plan.
Week13 20180617-20180623
Sequencing of the S1.0 dCas9 plasmid revealed multiple mutations. Strong expression of dCas9 may be too toxic to the bacteria that it has to be mutated so that the bacteria can survive. Therefor we decided to use W0.6 dCas9 generator in the following experiments.
Week14 20180624-20180630
Summer holiday (also finals) were creeping in! Nothing really changed. Phusion was still fickle, gel recovery was still lacky and InFusion was still very difficult. We started the PCRs for IPTG inducible quorum sensing devices.
Week15 20180701-20180707
Summer holiday officially starts! We asked around other iGEM teams and found out that nearly everyone had encountered troublesome promotors, leaky, unreliable or otherwise had low intensity. We finally finished light sensing reporter LSP. But even without its sensors the reporter sfGFP still expressed. We reconsidered our position and decided to focus more on expression control instead of artistic presentation. Also we welcomed the high school teams SHSBNU_China and RDFZ_China. They settled into the lab next door.
Week16 20180708-20180714
Wang Tingxuan and Huang Tianze stayed behind… Life was all about PCRs, overlapping PCRs and gel recovery. In order to improve our PCR success rate we ordered Q5 premix. IPTG induced las QS plasmid was constructed. We sprayed some IPTG on the plate but there was no effect. We finished the design of the NEON system.

Validated Part
This year we use quorum sensing genes from distribution kit to construct JTPI (BBa_K2768010), which can activate expression of genes downstream. And we also added a positive feedback to make it able to regulate in low AHL concentration. We have proved that this part can activate the expression downstream with positive feedback. You can check it here: http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2768010

USP-Brazil,2013,Team:USP-Brazil#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," Mxr1 is. This is done by substituted the Ser215 of the protein with Ala, inactivating the 14-3-3 protein interaction (phosphorylation) with Mxr1 [14]. It is also smaller than the original Mxr1 because it was already reported that the major activation domain of Mxr1 is located within the first 400 amino acids.
The modified Mxr1 is able to activate the PAOX1promoter in ethanol, methanol or in a ethanol/methanol solution [14]. This is useful for our biosensor design, which aims to detect levels of methanol above 2% in common alcoholic drinks (normally containing 10 to 60% ethanol). This will allow government to make a preliminary high-throughput screening of ethanol drinks tainted will methanol.
Preservation mechanism
In order to allow portability and storing of the device, and to create a robust, resistant and fast-responding methanol detector, some lyophilization tests were performed, aiming to produce results similar to Saccharomyces cerevisae yeast granules. That was made possible by adapting some protocols, originally for different yeast species to Pichia pastoris. Some tests were realized, essentially looking for answers to the questions below:
How many cells would have to be lyophilized?
What is the ideal dilution of the drink?
How long would it take between the contact of yeast and the drink to obtain results?
Freeze-dry
As a strategy to develop a biological system cheap enough for the specific economic issue related to the population involved on the risk of methanol poisoning, our detector should be very cheap. It also should be easy enough to prepare for storage and remain functional through long periods of time. An easy way to do so is the commonly used methodology for long storage of food, biological samples and pharmaceuticals: the lyophilization or freeze-drying process [19]. Maybe one of the most known examples of lyophilized product is the dry yeast, used for baking dough and for other food recipes.
Just to evaluate how cheap would be to produce a biological detector, we could take—as an estimative—the average cost of dry yeast on retail market, which is around 74.54 g per American dollar [20]. So, if the cost to produce and sell the net weight of our detector by lyophilization was the same of the average price in retail market, the user would spend less than five cents by net weight for each unitary detector (approximately 0.04 USD!), considering the use of 3 grams of lyophilized material per product.

Overview on the life cycle of Bacillus subtilis
B. subtilis is able to differentiate into cells with different morphologies and functions (Fig.1). The most characteristic form is the endospore, which is produced under nutrient starvation. In our project, we will exploit the production of endospores. Because they are extremely stable, they are perfect vehicles for the display of functional fusion proteins on their surface as illustrated by our Sporobead module.
Fig. 1: The vegetative cycle is very similiar to the one of E. coli. But if there is a stress like for example starvation, the cells enter sporulation, where they first undergo a polar cell division, followed by the formation of the endospore. If the enviromental conditions are suitable again, the spore will then germinate and reenter the vegetative cycle.
Visit later our Intro page for more information on B. subtilis

Engaged in discussion about the ethic of synthetic biology at the Co-Lab workshop, involving participants from 10+ countries. As a part of the workshop, conducted a survey of public opinion on the topic.
Organized an outreach event on synthetic biology at a team member’s previous school.
Several members were also actively involved in the inauguration of a Cambridge BioMakespace as well as the Cambridge University Synthetic Biology Society.

INTEGRATED HUMAN PRACTICES
Have discussed our experimental design with over 15 experts in the field, mainly on the issue of biological containment, our homoplasmy strategy and the impact of the project.
Connected with the Cambridge Centre for Global Equality on the potential of plastid engineering for the use in developing countries and have integrated their advice in the design of our homoplasmy strategy.
For our open-source hardware (biolistics and growth facility), have consulted 7 community science groups, from 5 countries, to make our design as much user-oriented as possible.
IMPROVE A PREVIOUS PART OR PROJECT
Have submitted a version of an existing Cas9 part, which we codon-optimised for C. reinhardtii chloroplasts, among other codon-optimised parts.
Cas9 was also optimised for the Phytobrick standard by removing illegal restriction sites with silent point mutations
Have modified Cas9 overhangs and removed the stop codon for the assembly of a FP-fusion in a one-step reaction with a fluorescent protein (VFP) from our library.
Have also submitted a version of the GFP gene, which we also codon-optimised.
DEMONSTRATE YOUR WORK
Have demonstrated our project under real-world conditions, i.e. in the chloroplasts of C. reinhardtii, as opposed to E. coli, where some of our parts could also be verified (due to the similarity of the two expression systems). To do so, have assembled two full gene units using our modular library, which were transfected into CW15 C. reinhardtii and conferred resistance to two different antibiotics.
PROOF OF CONCEPT
Proved that our library of C. reinhardtii chloroplast L0 parts (first-ever in iGEM!) can be used to assemble higher-order constructs, using the recently adopted Phytobricks standard. The assembly of the resulting L1s was confirmed with a restriction digest.

Method of Extraction of Essential Magnetosome Genes
A genome prep was provided to our group by the Komeli lab at Berkeley and the sequence of the AMB-1 genome has been documented online [1].  This allowed us to quickly design pairs of primers that would extract the mamAB operon out in groups of 1-3 genes, trying to keep the chunks around 2kb long.  These primers were ordered with an extra 20bp on their ends with homology to the bglbrk prefix on the forward primer and the bglbrk suffix on the reverse.  This way, once the primers were used to extract the operon  fragments, they could be cloned into a pGA vector via gibson assembly.  Thus we broke up the operon into the groups shown below and submitted them as parts to the registry.

The plasmids for quorum sensing experiments concerning the Lux system are made and operational to be used for experiments. We have three different plasmids:
Lux promoter folowed by GFP gene
Lux promoter followed by cisRNA and then by GFP
Lux promoter controlling the expression of taRNA and cisRNA. The cisRNA coding gene is followed by GFP.
The third plasmid corresponds to a riboregulating system. The second plasmid allowed us to validate the crucial role of taRNA in this riboregulating system.
On the modeling point of view, we only tried to fit the data coming from experiments done with plasmid one (with no riboregulating system) and plasmid three (with an effective riboregulating system). They were the only one to show an answer to a change of input that was not on the noise level.
The experimental setting was to inject different concentration of the signaling molecule AHL at the same time point into different bacterial colonies. The factor that we want to observe is the strength of the activation of the Lux promoter. The read-out is made by the fluorescence. The data was gathered over several time points in order to be able to observe the dynamic behavior. More precisely, the read-out of the promoter activation is made by the relative fluorescence, which corresponds to the ratio of the absolute fluorescence over"

So we brainstormed a work-around. Why not have students go out and collect water samples from their local environment as a pre-activity assignment? Not only did this circumvent the difficulty of organizing a field trip, this also gave students a sense of ownership - a sense of individual responsibility that we had previously identified as an important factor in a successful civic engagement initiative.
The second obstacle Ms. Moriarty mentioned were the constraints imposed by teaching to a curriculum. However we identified the following AP Biology standards that the lesson plan could fulfill, allowing our lesson plan to be more easily integrated into an AP Biology curriculum:
Essential Knowledge: 4.B.1 - Interactions between molecules affect their structure and function
Science Practice: 5.1 - The student can analyze data to identify patterns or relationships
Learning Objective: 4.17 - The student is able to analyze data to identify how molecular interactions affect structure and function
In regards to improving our lesson plan for more wide acceptance, Ms. Moriarty made the following four suggestions:
Providing a teacher’s guide with detailed background information about the project because teachers have to fully understand the project before they can teach it,
Providing an outline of how to carry out the lesson with suggested prompts and a sense of timing,
Providing a deck of powerpoint slides to show to the class, and
Providing assessment questions/worksheets
Through collaborating with CRS and talking with Ms. Ann Moriarty, we gained an appreciation for the depth of thought required in developing an engaging and implementable lesson plan.
Lesson Plan Engineering:
This appreciation was deepened through our conversation with Dr. Chris Pagliarulo, Associate Director of Instruction & Assessment at the Office of Undergraduate Education at UC Davis.
Dr. Pagliarulo talked about how designing an educational activity is a process by which you identify objectives and criteria for success, come up with a prototype, test it, evaluate it based on criteria, and iteratively refine it.  This sounded just like the engineering design cycle! We were engineering an educational plan.
As in any other engineering process, Dr. Pagliarulo highlighted the importance of defining lesson plan objectives (design goals or objectives) to more easily assess whether the lesson plan achieved its goal.  We identified several design objectives for the lesson plan:
The lesson plan must help an instructor teach or reinforce one or more of the Next Generation Science Standards and/or meet address some learning goals from an Advanced Placement topic in STEM. This was a necessary requirement to convince teachers to allow the activity into an already"

William_and_Mary,2016,Team:William and Mary#Binding Array_-_-_TEXT.html," However, when we induce with aTC (which causes TetR to be unable to bind), then there will be functionally less TetR, and thus a higher amount of fluorescence (Figure 3). If we add a decoy binding array, each amount of working TetR remaining, will be functionally equivalent to less due to molecular titration.
Figure 3: Schematic illustration of an induction curve of a circuit repressed by TetR. Note that until a certain threshold of aTC is reached, there is so much TetR available to bind that very little GFP is produced. When the binding array is added, that shifts to the left, as each [TetR] is functionally equivalent to less.
The ability to tune the threshold of transfer functions embodies the ethos of the Circuit Control Toolbox. Oftentimes a practical iGEM project ends up infeasible as a real world solution due to inability to tune the threshold of sensitivity. For example, a cancer detector whose reporter function is either too sensitive or not sensitive enough. While the binding array portion of the Circuit Control Toolbox is designed to be able to orthogonally slot onto any existing circuit, binding arrays can be used in any circuit regardless of the use of our toolbox. Since a binding array requires only that the circuit it modifies contain a DNA binding transcription factor, binding arrays can be constructed (using the method detailed below) for almost all circuits.
To test our ability to shift an arbitrary circuit, we first attempted to shift our previous example circuit, a pTet GFP and constitutive expressed TetR. We obtained a plasmid containing 85 TetO repeats off of Addgene from Finney-Manchester et al. (2013) (“Harnessing mutagenic homologous recombination for targeted mutagenesis in vivo by TaGTEAM). We moved the segment containing the repeats to the Biobrick Backbone, and then transformed a reporter circuit containing pTet GFP and TetR (Bba_K2066053) on the high copy plasmid 1A3 either with or without the repeat array on the high copy 1C3 backbone. We induced both circuits with varying concentrations of aTC and then measured fluorescence using flow cytometry, which allowed us to get single cell level resolution (Figure 5)
Figure 5: Population level FACs data comparing the relative fluorescence of a pTet GFP and TetR reporter with and without a tetO binding array. While the data is noisy, it is clear that the inflection point of the circuit with the binding array has shifted to the left as expected. Additionally"

How to reflect an effective feedback mechanism?
How to reflect the innovation point and function line of the project?
What is the relationship between glutamate concentration and cell survival?
Changes in product yield after project completion.
Then we followed the staff to understand the development of the Institute, related research projects, fermentation production and scientific research status, the operation of synthetic biological instruments. Through this communication, we better improved our project ideas and experimental techniques.
Tianjin International Joint Academy Biomedicine
In order to better understand the prospects and significance of the project, we went to Tianjin International Joint Academy Biomedicine for exchange and study. We communicated with the teachers in the field of medicine and production, we discussed the influencing factors in scientific research and production, fermentation, the current production of surfactin and poly-γ-glutamate and so on. The teachers put forward many valuable questions to us and provided a lot of helps in the transformation of the project results.
Here are the inspirations and suggestions we got from the exchange:

Formation of new patterns
by
programming  cell motility
Abstract
The ability of living organisms to form patterns is an untapped resource for synthetic biology. The HKU iGEM2008 team aims to generate unique patterns by rewiring the genetic circuitry controlling cell motility. Specifically, E. coli cells are programmed to autonomously regulate their movement by sensing local cell density. Interesting patterns are formed by two types of newly engineered cells. The low-density mover cells spread outwards and spontaneously form a distinctive ring of low cell density surrounded by rings of high cell density whilst the high-density mover cells form a Mt.Fuji-like structure. Moreover, we build a theoretical model that satisfactorily fits our current experimental data, and also predicts some parameters which may significantly affect the ring formation. The study of this self-organized spatial distribution of cells helps us to understand principles underlying the formation of natural biological patterns, and synthetic non-natural patterns have various potential applied uses.

Overview
The iGEM2008 iHKU team aims to  deliver a brilliant project this year. We major in multiple disciplines  including Biochemistry, Bioinformatics, Physics, and Chemistry. Using our  different backgrounds and modalities of thought, we complement each other in  developing new ideas, and in carrying out wet/dry lab work ( Team ).
Pattern formation is one of the  most common yet fascinating biological phenomena happening in our daily lives,  though for centuries, biologists, physicists and mathematicians have struggled  to understand its nature. How do highly ordered patterns arise from a few  living cells? How can our hands, our eyes, our bones form their shape with such  low error rates? These questions are fascinating and crucial. The fundamental  elements in biological pattern formation are cell growth, cell movement,  cell-cell communication, and differential gene expression. In this project, we  aim to form new patterns by controlling cell movement, using a single strain of engineered bacteria. Bacterium E. coli was chosen as our  model system. E. coli cells use their flagella to move around. To  generate a recognizable and stable pattern, bacterial motility must be  controlled and coordinated. This can be accomplished by designing"

GROUP 5: MATa Specific Promoters II
Summary for MATa Specific Promoters II Group
Part Description: Ste2 Promoter Reverse  Summary here: We were able to grow colonies with sequence verified Ste2 promoters.     The promoter is currently located in a glycerol stock in pGEM vector. One attempt to     transfer to the iGEM vector has been made, unsuccessfully. This was due to a mistake     in protocol however, so final transfer to the iGEM vector should still be straightforward.     Progress on this bio-brick has been paused in order to focus on MFA1, which is more     applicable to our project design because this Ste2 designed for the wrong direction.    Part no.: BBa_K110015  Part Description: MFA1 Promoter Forward  Summary here: We have been unable to get successful, sequence verified clones with     our MFA1 promoter thus far. We currently have a few samples of DNA ready to be tested     by restriction enzyme digest, and then, hopefully, sequencing.

He discovered a tri-national school with a great atmosphere and he is really enjoying it. He decided to take part to the igem competition with some of his friends because it is a very challenging competition and he was attracted by the fact to be autonomous toward the reflection and the manipulations. So far he has not been deceived in his expectations.
Thea Ziegler
Thea started her studies at the Humboldt University Berlin with the Bachelor program of Biophysics. As the trinational conception and organization of the ESBS captivated her, she left the German capital after finishing the 4th semester and went to Strasbourg to continue with the diploma course in Biotechnology. In the current last year of her studies she decided to specialize in Synthetic Biology and to take part of the iGEM competition. Behind the basic idea of iGEM she was attracted by the opportunity to work independently without limitations in creativity. She is very satisfied with the theme her team chose, the role and functioning of photoreceptors fascinate her since the early beginning of her studies. In the future she wants to continue within this field.
Yohann Lacotte
Yohann had pretty much the same curriculum than his copartners coming from ""Classe Prépa"". He is particularly interested in neurophysiology, biophysics and of course, synthetic biology.
He likes to go to movie theatre, draw some manga and sing in the  shower, but not at the same time natürlich. Although he really enjoys watching some cartoons on TV before his daily nap, he can also be a  brutal extrem lab worker all day AND night long. Unfortunately for us, his good mood is proportional to the success rate of his experiments,  but once he decided to succeed, he can manage the impossible. Within  iGEM, he thus can be seen as the man of the situation, as far as clearing the hurdles is concerned.
Yves Gendrault
After obtaining his bachelor's degree in Electronique, Signaux et Automatique (ESA), Yves does a Master’s degree in Micro-and Nano-Electronique (MNE) at the Université de Strasbourg (UdS). He discovers the field of Synthetic Biology during an internship in the Institut d'Electronique du Solide et des Systèmes (InESS) laboratory in Strasbourg. During this internship he creates models for several biological processes.

Genspace,2015,Team:Genspace#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," quorum sensing to regulate gene expression in response to changes in local population size.  We stumbled upon the AI-2 pathway, which is shared by gram negative and gram positive bacteria. The system is based on an Lsr regulon, and is comprised of multiple interacting parts, including a promoter, LsrR, LsrK, and LsrACDB.
LsrA, C, D, and B encode subunits of a transmembrane transport protein that brings AI-2 into the cell, where it is phosorphorylated by LsrK.  Phospho-AI-2 binds to LsrR, the repressor for the Lsr promoter, allowing transcription of the regulon.
We hope to couple the Lsr regulon with a downstream fluorescent gene to create a quorum sensing-based “biosensor,” that fluoresces in high concentrations of E. coli. In doing so, we provide the Gowanas community with an instantaneous means of evaluating the canal’s potentially dangerous contents.
In order to prevent the biosensor from self-inducing, we must knock out luxS, the gene that produces AI-2.
This is a diagram of the E. coli AI-2 quorum sensing pathway (above). It was drawn by some of the team members who had been researching quorum sensing, in order to explain the results of this research to the rest of the team.
This is a flowchart of our preliminary plan.

Objective: Waking parts from the registry
Purpose: iGem Parts
Puncture the foil covering with a clean pipette tip.
Using a fresh tip, pipette 10μL from a fresh aliquot of Molecular Biology Grade Water into wells 18I (K117002) and 18K (K117008), then pipette up and down to mix.  The DNA contains a red dye, so the water should turn red as you mix.
Record the well you opened up and continue by transforming the DNA.
Summary: The ""Quorum Sensing"" group looked up two parts we need for the sensing project (Lsr Promoter: pLsrA {BBa_K117002} pLsrA-YFP {BBa_K117008}), and decided to teach the students how to take DNA out of the registry.
In pursuing further quorum sensing research, we came across the Lux operon. Like Lsr, the Lux system is important in bacterial quorum sensing. The operon consists of a Lux promoter and its regulator, LuxR."

Overview
This year, we successfully construct synthetic microbial consortia MFC (microbial fuel cell) system with three species. Through the electricity generation platform we design, the final electrical output of the system reaches more than 520 mV and lasts over 80 h. What’s more, the synthetic microbial consortia MFC system can not only enhance the electrical output significantly but also broaden the spectrum of carbon sources. This is the very first time to introduce three different species into MFC system, namely E. coli, Shewanella and B. subtilis. We strongly believe our MFC system will have wide prospects in future applications.
Figure 1. The overall relationship of three kinds of bacteria in our co-culture system.
Microorganisms rarely live in isolated niches because natural microbial communities have unique advantages of stability, robustness and versatility due to nutrient adaptability, stress resistance, complicated interactions, etc. Considering that single-strain MFCs face many practical barriers such as narrow range of carbon sources, low efficiency of electricity generation, demanding requirements for environment and so on, we aim to construct new generation of MFC system by using synthetic consortia with elaborate division of labor.
In our system, there are two kinds of zymophyte bacteria and one electricigen. Co-culture strategy among zymophyte and electricigen develops a delicate commensalism relation on the basis of material, energy and information flow, which may remarkably benefit the whole system.
Material Flow
For the material flow, we construct an engineered E. coli strain to provide proper amount of carbon source, lactate, for Shewanella which have a poor ability of utilizing glucose. In this way, we broaden the spectrum of carbon sources of Shewanella to glucose and even xylose, cellose and cellulose in the future.
Energy & Information Flow
As for energy and information flow, we choose riboflavin as our entry point. It is because riboflavin is the major factor determining the extracellular electron transfer efficiency of electricigen. Firstly, we construct high-yield engineered E. coli strain producing riboflavins and the final yield reaches 90mg/L in tube. The strain works well and the electrical output reaches 350mV. Then, in order to enhance the functionality of MFC device"

Boxes: New substrates used: white and brown rice and coffee grounds. Rice are natural substrates for A. oryzae and coffee grounds are supposed to add to the texture of the mycelia. All substrates autoclaved before inoculation of boxes. Pipette boxes inoculated and incubated at 30°C dark.
Baking of boxes: The baking or autoclavation of the boxes were to find a way to kill the mycelia, so the boxes could be brought outsite the laboratory.  Boxes inoculated from Skyttegaarden and saw dust boxes were autoclaved.  The saw dust boxes were very crumbly regardless of concentration before autoclavation.
Weighing of boxes: Boxes were weighed everyday to follow the growth of the mycelia and to see if there was a difference over time.
Drylab Overview
We began the week with a meeting to set the course for the rest of the week. This week Nicolai is on holiday. On the modeling side of things, the work on the HMM is coming along nicely but it is not clear how it can be related to real life. The model outputs the probabilities of branching for individual hyphae. The bigger picture is not clear for this model. Hannah is working on codon optimization after having dropped the imaging programme. The reason being that the color variation of the sample pictures was too great and writing a program to be able to take this into consideration proved to be too hard. An alternative program was used to do this, called VGG Image Annotator (VIA) , where the radius of all the colonies were manually annotated. The area of each fungal colony was calculated and visualized in plots.

We used Flux Balance Analysis, a method that calculates the fluxes of metabolites through a metabolic network in steady state condition. We also used the percolation theory, which describes when connected clusters will make a connection between any two opposite boundaries of a domain. Lastly, we used graph theory to translate a biological problem to a graph representation and subsequently, we found an algorithm that solved our problem for that graph.

Deterministic Modeling Methods
The three main systems that form a part of our iGEM project, the landmine promoter, the formation of (conductive) curli, and the assembly of the Extracellular Electron transport (EET) pathway, all involve various biological mechanisms that are not fully understood yet. To gain more insight in these mechanisms, we will apply the approach of deterministic modeling. Deterministic modeling, as opposed to stochastic modeling, does not involve randomness, and therefore yields “exact” solutions. In this section, we present a general outline of the strategy used to set up and analyze a deterministic model.
The first step in deterministic modeling (and in every kind of modeling) should be to get a clear view of what you want to model. In all our cases, we want to obtain a model that predicts the amount of a certain protein or protein complex formed at a certain time. Once this modeling goal is established, you should get a very good and detailed understanding of the system at hand. What compounds are involved? How do the different compounds react with each other? Is localization and transport an important part of the system?  Answering these questions (and many more) will mostly be achieved by doing extensive literature research.
Once a clear overview of the model is established, you should decide which processes are most important. Although it is tempting to describe your system in as much detail as possible, this will make your model cluttered and difficult to work with and analyze. Besides that, every reaction you include introduces at least one extra parameter, such as a reaction rate. To find exact values for those parameters is nigh-impossible, and even making an educated guess is not as easy as it seems. To decide whether a process is important or not, a good strategy is to see if certain steps are described as rate-limiting. Rate-limiting steps are steps that take a lot of time and therefore have a big influence on the time behavior of your system. Another class of important processes are processes in"

A-P Conference
Alpha Version Trial
Science and Technology Week
Science and Technology Week is an on-campus annually celebration of science, technology, and engineering involving different colleges students in USTC conducting various science-based activities. This year, Science and Technology Week attracted over ten thousand citizens to USTC, varying from innocent pupils, high school students and college students in biology-related majors to the public from all walks who may have limited knowledge of Synthetic Biology. Our team cooperated with Team USTC and offered visitors a feast of biological knowledge.
We introduced elementary knowledge of genetics to citizens by poster presentation, then showed them some basic experiment operation, like liquid relief, centrifugation and etc. We used metaphors of LEGO and principle of programming to introduce the concept of biobricks and Synthetic Biology. In addition, we distributed questionnaires to the visitors to get some feedback to improve the design idea of our software.
Asia-Pacific Conference in Taiwan
We attended International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference held by National Cheng Kung University from August 8th to 14th 2016. Over 20 iGEM teams attended the conference and 6 members of our team was sent to Taiwan.
During the conference, the iGEMers communicated, changed ideas and learned from one another. The conference is not only a simple warm-up for the upcoming world championship in Boston, but an Asian regional platform for teams from different countries to exchange ideas and explore synthetic biology as well. All the teams made a project presentation and introduced their projects. In this way, we received useful feedbacks and technology-improvement suggestions from students and professors of other teams.
We are so grateful to be invited and glad to have a chance to communicate with other teams in Taiwan.
Alpha Version Trial for Schoolmates
Before we have collected our data of questionnaires form the Science and Technology Week, we did not come up that a simulator should be programmed into our software. However, the result of the survey showed that over 40% of participants both were in the major of biology and wanted to have a program to analyze the concentrations of several interacting substances in a biological reaction. Some participants told us that solving them manually was often a harsh job and there might probably be miscalculations in the result, which was a huge"

Welcome to iGEM Aachen 2016
Public Engagement
“Education is a common task of science and economy [...].”
Dr. Karsten Schürrle, DECHEMA
Establishing a dialogue with the public and getting them in contact with synthetic biology was something we feel is extremely important. Listed below, you can find in which ways attempted to spread the iGEM spirit.
Spreading the News
We wished to get in touch with as many people as possible. Hence, for presenting our work without us being physically there, we developed several ways to spread information about our project and the idea of synthetic biology.
Newsletter
From the beginning on, we received a lot of support from various sides and many people were interested in our project. That is why we thought of a way to inform them all at the same time about our progress and developed a monthly newsletter. It was sent to all of our supporters and everybody who opted in. With the newsletter, we intended to explain our project to people with and without the scientific background and therefore developed a short and an extended version. Writing it helped us reflecting about our work and also preparing for the wiki. We even received suggestions from experts who read about our main challenges in the newsletter.
Flyer Distribution
Our flyer was created in the beginning of our project to give interested supporters a short overview about our idea and to inform people about what we are doing throughout this year of participating in iGEM.
As iGEM is a great opportunity and experience for everybody - not only university students - and as we could not visit as many schools as we wished, we also sent an adapted version of the flyer with additional information about the competition to about 300 different schools.

However, visual inspection under the fluorescence microscope demonstrated that the low magnesium cultures had very different fluorescent properties, both in quantity and quality of the light produced (higher magnesium cultures had a more yellow hue). We took this as a sign that our plate reader may not be producing reliable data, perhaps not surprising given that we were having to use non-optimal emission and excitation filters. Additionally, the final fluorescence was lower than the initial fluorescence despite the fact that visual inspection demonstrated that it increased considerably from start to finish. This just goes to show the dangers of normalizing data without looking at it first! It also shows the importance of an internal ratiometric control channel which is measured in the same way - this should eliminate the normalization artifacts that we have found from using OD620 as our normalization channel. If the plate reader was unable to measure one fluorescence channel, it is unlikely that it would be able to measure the second, eliminating the artifacts.
We then attempted to transform the construct into Bacillus subtilis, with a view to repeat the same assay in this new chassis. Because the part originally comes from bacillus, we hoped that this might give more useful data. Unfortunately, we did not have time to characterise the part in this chassis, as our transformation attempts failed. This may be an excellent starting point for any future teams seeking to explore this part.

EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Tools#Microfluidics#HowTo_-_-_TEXT.html," microfluidic chip is a low-magnification rear-illuminated binocular microscope. However, we needed a cheap way of viewing the chip on a computer, to then stream the image through internet. We used a toy webcam microscope ($50), and bought a toy light table for rear-illumination ($25). To improve stability and focusing, we fixed the microscope to a chemist's stand and placed the light table on a scissor jack.

Hooking it all up: preparing tubes and priming the chip
The presence of bubbles in a channel increases its fluidic resistance, and therefore perturbates or even blocks flow. To avoid this, the first step in running a chip is priming: filling all the channels with fluid, then closing all the micro-valves and keeping pressure applied, until any air remaining in the chip diffuses through the chip walls and disappears.
Once all the channels are filled, the experiments can begin. For the worm chip, we would prime the device with buffer, then introduce the worm after the chip is filled. For the MITOMI chip, we would flow in various biomolecules (neutravidin, bovine serum albumin, antibodies, cell-free extracts) and DNA.
Details of connections
Below are four images detailing how the tubing and electronics in our setup are connected, and the role of each component.
A printed circuit board (PCB) is used to connect the solenoid valves to the relays on the easyDAQ, and power them. The solenoids are connected to the PCB via two flat cables, one soldered to the red wires, one soldered to the black wires (they are 14-wire cables, with two wires removed). The other end of each cable is fitted with a 14-pin connector. The PCB is powered by a 24 V power supply, and distributes the power to each solenoid through the relays on the EasyDAQ. Therefore, when a relay is open, a 24 V load is applied to the corresponding solenoid (wich opens it). When the relay is closed, both leads of the solenoid are grounded (which closes it).
Annotated picture of the fluidics setup. The role of each component is explained. Not shown: since the picture was taken, manometers were added to the pressure regulators.

ROSETTA Enzyme Design
Overview
Since the non-canonical amino acid synthesized in the laboratory is completely novel, there is no corresponding tRNA synthetase which can load the tRNA, yet. For this reason, we use the enzyme design protocol to design the binding pocket in a way that allows it to form an effective and specific enzyme. The protocol consists of two main steps: matching and designing (Richter et al., 2011)      The enzyme design algorithm is briefly summarized in Figure 3.
Figure 3: Flowchart Enzym Design Protocol.
Matching Step

all possible constraints, which can be set, with dashed lines indicating hydrogenbonds, normal lines indicating covalent bonds
The meaning of the matching step is to match the amino acids which constrains to the ligand, following specific constrains which ensure that the result is sensible and feasible. For this, ROSETTA analyzes the structural formula of the non- canonical amino acid and offers the possible hydrogen binding partners.
Matching step inputs
For the matching step, the following input-files are needed:
a “.params”-file specifying information about the ligand
a “.pdb”-file providing a rough scaffold layout
a “.cst”-file to define the bindings between ligand and scaffold
a “.pos”-file to define the positions of the amino acids in the scaffold
a “.flags” file to control all inputs. These files are necessary, as they describe the ligand and backbone and specify the parameters of the algorithm
To read about each file in further detail, please click the technical detail button below: SHOW TECHNICAL DETAILS
“.params”-file: A conformer ensemble has to be generated using information about the ligand, as the non-canonical amino acids are not generally available in databases like PDB , making it necessary to build them manually      using tools like pymol , Avogadro or Chemdraw . Using these tools,      files can be saved in the desired format. The ligand needs to be specified in the “.sdf”, “.mol” or “.mol2” file format. Such a      file can be obtained automatically by converting the relevant information from a “.pdb” file, if available. This conversion process usually also involves augmenting the data with hydrogen atoms      in case they are missing from the “.pdb” file. Alternatively, the ligand can be designed using ""Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Specification"" (SMILES) or manually using tools such as"

Light-Dependent Dormancy System
Dormancy Optimises the Efficiency of the Bacterial Solar Battery
Photosynthetic bacteria draw energy from sunlight to drive the fixation of carbon, implying that the bacteria are not able to carry out carbon fixation in absence of light. However, the bacteria constantly metabolise and the carbon fixed during time of exposure to light, will be used as an energy source for the cells. To circumvent this, a photocontrol system created by the UT Austin iGEM 2004 team was used in combination with the RelE-RelB toxin-antitoxin system native to E. coli. In this way, a light-dependent dormancy system was implemented in E. coli.

Sense/Respond: The students began the day with a new PCR. After examining the plates from yesterday, it was determined that there indeed was green fluorescence on the plates. However, a PCR was needed with a gel to determine whether or not it was sfGFP or GFP. High in spirits, the students immediately went to work. First, they created a Master Mix following the PCR Protocol for Phusion DNA Polymerase. They did some tricky math and figured out exact proportions needed for nuclease-free water, Phusion Buffer, DMSO, Kpn1(forward primer), BsrG1(reverse primer), as well as the phusion DNA polymerase. They each used 6 colonies. Four students used green colonies and then dipped it into the PCR and the LB Broth with chloramphenicol. This method ensures that only the bacteria immune to chloramphenicol can survive. On the gel, it should give a precise band of base pairs indicating sGFP or GFP. Another student used 6 colonies without the green fluorescence. It acts as a control. When it is run as a gel, there should be random bars that indicate there is no sGFP or GFP. Then the samples were put into the thermocycler for 1.5 hours according to the protocol. The students then had the endure a nerve raking wait as they wondered if the PCR had gone successfully and whether the bacteria had sGFP or not. After preparing another gel, the students meticulously put the samples on the 40 wells. After 30 minutes of running the gel, the students came back to an ecstatic Dr. Goodson informing them that the gel had turned out as planned and that they could proceed with the mini-prep before sending"

At the end of the day, they answered again to the question about the GMOs. Here is what they wrote:
« A huge progress and a big potential »
« GMOs are genetically modified organisms that are not only used in agriculture, but are very useful for many fields like biology and medicine. »
« Not only food. It is good for medicine. »
« Insulin, Monsanto, Biopad. »
« GMOs are very useful in sciences. It is the Future. THE SOLUTION ! »
For the Swiss German class, we also made them fill the quiz after the presentation. The final score for them was 71 %, which is a final score 15 % lower and an improvement 6 % lower than the students who participated in the workshop and the mini iGEM game. These results show that the practical part was also important for the understanding of synthetic biology concepts and that a complete formation must include theory and practice.
Swiss-German students' quiz answers
It was a very interesting experience and a great chance for us that these students could come to see what our project was about. They were very collaborative and enthusiastic from the beginning to the end, and everyone participated to the activities with energy. As shown by the quiz results, our message was delivered with success and we hope that they will keep good memories about this day with our team. It is a proof that the best way to teach people about the true meaning of « GMO » is to present them concrete cases and to make them think about it too.

Characterization of Rate of Photobleaching of Wild Type GFP (BBa_E0040)
Photobleaching is the phenomenon of irreversible damage to the fluorophore, such that after certain number of electronic transitions on absorption of photons, it cannot fluoresce anymore. This hinders the ability to continuously image a sample over a long period of time, thus acting as a bottleneck to the characterization pipeline. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to understand and characterize the bleaching effect so that an optimum time gap between successive images could be chosen. This would ensure that the fluorophores do not bleach and at the same time we don’t have to compromise on the amount of collected data due to the time gap.
Here, we characterized the photobleaching effect in wildtype GFP (E0040), which was the reporter in our oscillator using fluorescent microscopy with the etaluma Lumascope 500 microscope. Cells expressing GFP under the PhlF repressible promoter (BBa_K2525016) in the absence of PhlF, so that it constitutively expressed GFP. Cells were loaded in microfluidic chambers and droplet encapsulation was performed to capture a small number of cells. This droplet was continuously exposed to light corresponding to the excitation wavelength of GFP (~485 nm) and the emission was captured continuously as well. ImageJ was used to analyze the images, to obtain the rate of photobleaching as shown in Fig 1. Where we have fitted an exponential curve to the total intensity over time. It is known that photobleaching has a first order decay. We obtain a photobleaching rate of 0.002 per second (7.2 per hour).

Groups
We decided on groups of five or six participants with a moderator each, so that there would be enough time to let everyone speak and also to ask each other questions. We hoped this would enable the discussion gets to the value level. We also wanted to expose our participants to as many different opinions as possible. This is why we decided to form new groups per discussion round, and why we decided on a short plenary discussion of 5 minutes after each round. In this plenary part, we asked groups to shortly present what they had discussed and allowed the groups to react to each other.
Guidance
We asked supervisors present at the meetup to moderate each table. They would be impartial moderators that would ensure everyone had the opportunity to speak and that would ask “Why?” questions if the discussion was superficial. Per topic, we also prepared questions that our moderators could ask to steer the discussion away from dead ends and opinionated sources that could trigger a fresh discussion topic. The moderators were free to use these if they thought they needed them. We introduced the workshop to them in a short presentation the day before so that they had time to prepare.
Time per round
We decided on 30 minutes per round, of which 5 were to introduce the topic, 20 to discuss in groups and 5 minutes to discuss plenary.
Preparation
We decided against asking participants to prepare something beforehand, as we wanted them to come to the discussion with an open mind.
3. Materials

DTU-Denmark-2,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Project#Other assembly systems_-_-_TEXT.html,"A method is based on use of restriction enzyme digestion and ligation, which means that illegal restriction recognition sites need to be eliminated. The method also leaves a scar between the BioBricks. Another disadvantage of the 3A assembly is the requirement for plasmids to contain three different antibiotic markers. Furthermore, the 3A method can only combine two parts at a time.
Gibson Assembly
Gibson Assembly is an isothermal, single-reaction method for assembling multiple overlapping DNA fragments. The method was developed by Daniel G. Gibson at the J. Craig Venter Institute in 2009.
The assembly system employs 5´-T5 exonuclease, Phusion DNA polymerase, and Taq ligase. Gibson can be used to assemble both ssDNA and dsDNA fragments. This method makes it possible to join DNA molecules that are as large as 583kb and clone joined products in E. coli with a length up to 300kb. Among the advantages is that it takes the same amount of time to ligate N number of DNA fragments as for two DNA fragments [3].
The way it's done
The isothermal 5´-T5 exonuclease removes the bases from the 5'-end of double stranded DNA, leaving a recess in the DNA. The ssDNA overhang is used to assemble the DNA fragments.
The T5 exonuclease is inactivated during the incubation at 50ºC. Phusion polymerase and Taq ligase fills the gaps of the annealed complementary ssDNA overhangs and seals the nicks in the ends, leaving a joined DNA molecule ready for transformation [3] .
Difference between Plug'n Play assembly and Gibson Assembly
One of the disadvantages of the Gibson assembly is that the primers for the assembly are more expensive due to the 40 bp extra nucleotides the primers have to be flanked with. The Gibson assembly is not as specific as USER cloning, where there is nicked at a uracil instead of chewing back from the end point.
Gateway assembly
The Gateway® cloning technology is based on a site-specific recombination system of the lambda bacteriophage provided by Invitrogen.  The lambda phage can change between the lytic and the lysogenic life cycle by enzymes called clonases. The recombination occurs between phage and DNA of E. coli via specific recombination sequences denoted as att sites (4).  On the phage genome attP sites are found, and on the host bacterial genome attB sites are found. After recombination the att sites, hybrid sequences"

Alex: Well it seems to me that we aren’t doomed at all, all they made was an naturally occurring germ. But, another commenter said “I want to be excited by this news, but it scares the bejeezus out of me...”
Dev: So what else are they scared of?
Alex: Well I know a lot of fear stems from the possibility of synthesizing organisms which would be extremely harmful to humans if they were released.
Dev: Ok, I think that is a legitimate concern. So what kind of organisms would that be?
Alex: Well one example of a synthetic organism that could cause massive casualties is smallpox. Digital genomes of smallpox are present online, and could potentially be created chemically using a similar process that Craig Venter used. In June 2006 a reporter for the guardian obtained a small sequence of smallpox DNA delivered to his home from a gene synthesis company. Now that sounds scary.
Dev: Well what kind of company would send the smallpox genome to a residential address? Even if it is piece by piece.
Alex: This reporter was able to achieve this from a major gene synthesis company through the lack of screening technology and safeguards that are present at these gene synthesis companies. As the price of synthesizing genes gets more and more affordable, efficient safeguards which screen both the content being ordered, and who is ordering them needs to be put in place in order to ensure that gene sequencing isn’t used by would-be terrorists.
Dev: Why isn’t there anything already in place to help gene synthesis companies from sending out sequences that contain harmful genes?
Alex: Actually there is. The International Gene Synthesis Consortium is an organization consisting of 5 major gene synthesis companies, and makes up over 80% of commercial gene synthesis capacity world-wide. These companies have agreed to screen synthetic gene orders to identify pathogen sequences and other potentially dangerous sequences, screen customers by requiring identification, and keep records for at least 8 years of customers, sequences, and delivery information. They also do not send to post office boxes, which seems like a no brainer to me.
Dev: Ok, so we can all feel a little safer knowing that random people can’t just order sequences containing harmful genes, but the idea that some disgruntled scientist can synthesize killer bugs in his basement is a little far-fetched.
Alex: Yeah people need to understand that this kind of work requires more than a"

To give this law some context, in the late 1400’s Venice was in the middle of the Renaissance: glassworking, art, and new methods of manufacturing were blossoming in the city. The Provveditori di Comun concluded that 1) A novel creation by an inventor is intellectual property, and, 2) protecting an inventor’s intellectual property stimulates the economy and encourages new ideas to grow. These conclusions are reflected in most modern IP systems today, and the Venetian Act of 1474 went on to directly influence IP statutes that would be established in England, the United States, and much of the rest of the world centuries later.
Significant inspiration was drawn from the Venetian Act when England first implemented its own major patent and copyright laws. The Statute of Monopolies (1624) and the Statute of Anne (1710) [United Kingdom], a patent law and copyright law respectively, were implemented as a response to the tendency of the English crown to grant monopolies to ‘favored individuals’. A great example of this abuse of power was Queen Elizabeth I, who would grant monopolies to  ‘favored individuals’ in return for a cash payout [3]. In effect, the Queen sold trade monopolies to individuals in an effort to raise money (who knew – monarchs can run into financially tough times as well!) These two statutes acted to rebuke the power of the monarchy to grant trade monopolies; instead, individuals with original intellectual property could now apply for patents and copyrights to protect their ideas [4]. The United States IP system was directly influenced by these English statutes. One thing to note from these two statutes is that IP laws have a place in preventing market dominance, protecting individuals unique ideas, and stimulating competition.
The origin of IP protections in the United States came from the Patent Act of 1790 and the Copyright Act of 1790. Since we are interested in looking at the evolution of these IP protections over time, the first detail to note is the scope of these protections. In this original copyright act, applicants’ work was guaranteed protection for 14 years. Fast forward to today:"

Welcome to the Stanford team Wiki for iGEM 2010
Stanford iGEM is a student-run, faculty-directed research group at Stanford University. The objective of our interdisciplinary group is to design and build novel engineered biological systems using standardized DNA-based parts to submit to the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) competition, held annually at MIT. Our research draws from the principles of synthetic biology, an emerging interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary area that involves the design and construction of biological systems. Here is our team for the 2010 competition and our page on the Stanford University Website.
If you are looking for our winning 2009 project, check out our old site .
Our Project: EscheRatio Coli
The field of synthetic biology is in the process of a rapid expansion. As more and more researchers join the burgeoning discipline, they will need new biological tools. This year our team created a new type of tool for the synthetic biologist's toolkit: a system to allow E. coli to sense the ratio of two different chemicals in its environment and produce a protein output based on that ratio. Our new sensors will allow synthetic biologists to explore novel application areas beyond the limits of current sensors. While designing these new tools, we asked ourselves several critical design questions. We invite you to follow along in our decision process.
Why Ratios?
Ratios rule the biological world, and controlling them will unlock a vast range of applications for synthetic biology. Current sensors can respond to absolute concentrations, but have no way of producing an output based on a ratio. Using such sensors, ratios must be computed by some external means. In other engineering disciplines, computers can be used to calculate a ratio from precise measurements, but biological engineering doesn't have that luxury. We need a hardwired device to compute and act on ratios independent of a controlling computer or human researcher.
The Stanford team's ratio sensors use biological machinery to eliminate the human component from ratio computation. Our output system is more efficient than two individual sensors and, most importantly, can pass its results on to other parts and devices. A ratio sensor performs"
Grenoble-EMSE-LSU,2013,Team:Grenoble-EMSE-LSU#Documentation#Safety#KR_-_-_TEXT.html," was spilled on an exposed body part.
Once the risks have been identified, scenarios can then be imagined in which one or more parts of our system are accidentally or intentionally released, leading to exposure of researchers, the external environment or the general population to biological material.
The first imaginable case is one where KillerRed-expressing bacteria come into contact with researchers and are unknowingly transported outside. These bacteria are resistant to ampicillin and produce a photosensitizing protein.
The bacteria themselves pose no particular risk for several reasons. First of all they are E. coli strain K12, widely used in laboratories and known to be in the BioSafety Level 1 group of micro-ogranisms. They are thus not known to cause any disease in humans or other organisms in the wild appart from allergic reactions. Their expression of KillerRed does not give them any advantage for survival in the wild: on the contrary the protein is toxic to the cells when they are illuminated. If they were spread in an environment away from light, there is no reason to think the protein has any other effect, based on its structural similarity with other fluorescent proteins such as EGFP, which are well-studied. As there is generally no presence of ampicillin or other beta-lactam-based antibiotics in the environment, the cells' resistance to ampicillin gives them no advantage.
The second case is where a solution containing KillerRed is spread outside or comes into contact with other organisms, for example a cell lysate in which the protein wasn't denaturated. In this case no genetic material is spread and so we focus on the chemical properties of KillerRed itself. KillerRed is a macromolecule (26.55 kDa [6]) and so cannot enter cells without specialized transporters. These transporters aren't present in E. coli, and probably aren't present in any other organism, since KillerRed is engineered and presents unique structural features which wouldn't be recognized by transporters for fluorescent proteins should they exist.
This leaves us to discuss the potential effects of KillerRed as a photosensitizer on the outside of cells, unlike clinical photosensitizers which readily penetrate cells. Due to the low lifetime of ROS, we only have to consider damage to membranes, in which case KillerRed could be considered a light irritant. Indeed, ROS reactions with membranes, primarily composed of lipids, leads to lipid peroxidation, which damages membranes and causes cell death. With the skin as a thick protective barrier compared to the scale of the protein and possible interactions of ROS with other molecules, the chemical risks posed by the protein itself are negligible both for"

5. Add 1ml 75% ethanol (the 75% ethanol is prepared by using absolute ethanol rather than ethanol for disinfection) and mix up to wash away salt ions.
6. Centrifuge the reactant under 12000rpm for 5 minutes, then throw away the supernatant.
7. Centrifuge the reactant for another 3-4 seconds and use transfer liquid gun to throw away residual supernatant.
8. Centrifuge the reactant for another 3-4 seconds and use transfer liquid gun to throw away residual supernatant.
9. Open the centrifuge tube and expose the reactant to air. Put the centrifuge tube into incubator at 37 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes until the plasmid turn into transparent.
10. Add appropriate volume of ddH2O to dilute the plasmid according to precipitation capacity.
11. Use 1μl solution and add 9μl ddH2O to dilute it, then use electrophoresis to measure its quantity.
3. Plasmid purification
1. Culture of E-coli: Select single colonies from plate culture medium then inoculate them into 1-3ml liquid nutrient medium containing antibiotics, then culture them at 37 degrees Celsius overnight. (Usually the culture time is 12-16 hours, because if the cells have been cultured over 16 hours, it is hard to lysis the cells so that plasmid production will decrease. Besides, the medium should not be excessive, because too many bacteria are difficult to be fully lysised so that plasmid purity is affected.)
2. Collect 1-4ml overnight culture of bacterial fluid, then centrifuge it at 12000rpm for 2 minutes and throw away the filtrate.
3. Use 250μl Solution | (be sure that RNase A is added to Solution |) to fully suspend the bacterial precipitation. (Pay attention not to leave over small pieces of bacteria. Vortex can be used to make the bacteria fully suspended)
4. Add 250μl Solution || and gently blend the solution by turning it up and down for 5-6 times to make the bacteria fully lysis until the solution becomes transparent. (Be sure to blend the solution gently instead of oscillating fiercely, and this step should be no more than 5 minutes.)

On September 1st,  we gave a presentation at a workshop called “MUSE TALK”. Managers, executives and technicians working in IT company participated in this event to learn about things outside their specialty. The contents of the presentation are listed below.
• What is iGEM?
• The trend in synthetic biology  (The trend in iGEM 2013)
• The project of Team Tokyo_Tech 2013
• The development of technique  that supports iGEM
(BioBrick, database related to synthetic biology, MATLAB,  etc.)
• Introduction of Team  Tokyo_Tech
• What Team Tokyo_Tech 2014 has  been doing since the new team was organized
In the presentation, we used many pictures and figures in the slide to make it easier to image synthetic biology, which is a completely new field for them.
Fig. 6-1-3-2. Our members explaining the iGEM database and BioBrick
After the presentation, we were able to get opinions from the audience. Hearing from people working in a different field was a great opportunity for us. Some people gave us ideas of a new product which we never thought of. Also, there were people who asked questions related to safety. All the people with those questions had things in common; they all thought it would be a big business chance if genetically engineered E. coli can be released safely in human and nature.
By listening to our presentation, many audience were impressed with the technology of synthetic biology, and acknowledged it as a research which estimates future prospects. We are planning to present in this workshop again after this year’s Jamboree, so we will be glad if more people from a variety of fields come to attend. In the next presentation, we are planning to introduce the trends in iGEM2014.

We have also been advised greatly by Dr. Surette and the Farncombe Institute, as well as Alastair Tracey from  the McMaster University Biology Department. It took an extraordinary amount of collaboration and support and we could not have done it without them.

In the past May of 2016, mGEM collaborated with Hamilton Health Sciences to present Discovery Day at McMaster. This constitutes a day filled with workshops where secondary school students are able to explore a wide variety of careers in medicine and health sciences. One of the workshops lead by mGEM allowed students to apply their basic knowledge of cellular structures to a common laboratory practice where they were able to stain and visualize the cells. The second workshop reviewed the basic structure of DNA approached in the science curriculum, and further applied this to characteristically separate DNA in PCR, a common laboratory practice. This collaboration between mGEM and Hamilton Health Sciences further strengthened our efforts to educate other students on synthetic biology and its scientific relevance in the working world today. The reputability of Hamilton Health Sciences was effective in attracting secondary school students for the workshops prepared by mGEM.

Therefore the OD measurement that is usually performed when conducting the β-galactosidase assay would not be accurate enough. The protein concentration of the fungal samples were instead determined by a Bradford assay. For the Bradford assay a standard dilution series with known concentrations of bovine serum albumin (BSA) were made in order to determine the protein concentrations. The protein samples and BSA standards were mixed with Bradford reagent. The procedure is based on the dye, Brilliant Blue G (Sigma-Aldrich), that forms a complex with the proteins in solution. This dye-protein complex results in a shift of the absorption maximum of the dye from 465nm to 595nm, where the absorption is proportional to protein present.
For the β-galactosidase assay, a solution of o–nitrophenyl-β–D–galactoside (ONPG) was used to measure the  activity of β-galactosidase. β-galactosidase hydrolyses ONPG to o–nitrophenol at a linear rate until ONPG is completely degraded. In other words, the amount of o-nitrophenol produced is proportional to the amount of β-galactosidase present in the sample (6). This can be seen as a yellow colour that becomes more and more intense as the degradation proceeds.
Protein extracts were mixed with Z-buffer in a microtiter plate. ONPG solution was added, and OD420 was measured every minute for 20 minutes. The specific activities were calculated using the equation below.
Where:
Abs420 = the absorbance of o-nitrophenol measured.
the factor 1.7 corrects for the reaction volume.
0.0045 is the absorbance of a 1 nmol/mL o-nitrophenol solution.
[p] = the concentration of protein [mg/mL]
v = volume of culture assayed [mL]
t = the reaction time [min]
Specific activities for the three promoters were calculated according to the equation above. The specific activities of the promoters are an expression of the specific activity of β-galactosidase. All measurements in the figures are for the time: 5 minutes. The mean specific promoter activity for each sample (based on triplicates) is shown below.

The lovastatin pathway has been added to the metabolic model of Aspergillus niger. Because the medium composition of the model is not yet properly defined, the maximum flux towards lovastatin can be achieved.

As described in literature, N593 formed giant cells after 24h at 44C. Since transcriptome data on N400 from multiple stages in its life cycle is available, this strain is chosen such that this research complements the current RNA landscape profile of A. niger and allows for comparison of data from different life stages. However, unlike N400, N593 repeatedly formed mycelium at 44C. To overcome this effect the temperature was increased to 45C, at which a single cell phenotype was obtained for N593.

This will need to be repeated and investigated further as this enzyme may have an unexpected activity.
Determining if expression of putative glycogen acyltransferase enzymes affects the structure of glycogen in E. coli
AIM:
To determine whether we could detect any acylation or other modifications to glycogen extracted from bacteria expressing the putative acyl transferases.
METHOD:
Approximately 1 mg glycogen that had been extracted from induced and non-induced bacterial cultures containing the acyltransferase constructs was dissolved in 100 uL 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4 and then treated with Pseudomonas Isoamylase (1 Unit) at 37 °C for 3 hours. Isoamylase removes α-1,6 linkakes and therefore this treatment completely debranched the glycogen samples. The debranched glycogen was analysed by addition of Lugol’s solution as described in previous results sections. To help look for evidence of acetylation commercial glycogen was chemically acetylated according to a published method 1
Samples of acetylated and non-acetylated commercial glycogen, along with samples of the extracted glycogen were then analysed by 1H NMR. Approximately 10mg of each sample was dissolved in in 600 uL D2O and 1H NMR spectra recorded at 400 MHz. The spectra of extracted glycogen was then compared with the controls.
RESULTS:
Interestingly the glycogen debranched with isoamylase from cells expressing the putative acylation enzymes stained significantly darker than the controls (Figure 1). This experiment needs to be repeated to confirm this result.
Glycogen from cultures expressing Rv3030 and Rv3034 stainened darker with induction of the promoter, whereas for MAO and Rv3037 there was no real difference between induced and non-induced samples (Figure 1). In the case of the darker cultures, this could reflect longer branch lengths or some other modification of the glycogen structure such as acylation.

Analysis of glycogen samples by NMR did not indicate the presence of acyl groups  (Figure 2). We now plan to use more sensitive methods such as a chemical assays and also to further"
ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#modeling#qs_-_-_TEXT.html," a transfer function of normalized GFP concentration as a function of input Las-AHL.
Parameter fitting
We used MEIGO Toolbox to fit the parameters to the experimental data. We used the concentrations at the end of five hours from each simulation and fit it to the experimental concentrations at the same time.
Figure 1 Lux QS Module fitted to experimental data from riboregulated Lux system.
Using the 'DHC' local-solver (Direct search method) in MEIGO, we found the lumped parameters  $$K_{mLux} = 0.45 \pm 0.00051 nM$$
and
$$K_{mLas} = 10 \pm 0.0082 nM$$
respectively.
Figure 2 Las QS Module fitted to experimental data from riboregulated Las system.
Range of validity of the assumptions
These assumptions hold true for all input LuxAHL and LasAHL concentrations.
Retrieving degradation rates
We are considering quorum sensing experiments with riboregulator, where Plux is induced by LuxAHL or Plas is induced by LasAHL and GFP is produced instead of Bxb1, and this time we look at dynamic curves.
Figure 3 Dynamic response of the promoter Plux to a dose entry at time t=0.
By adding an additional quasi steady state assumptions on RLux, and neglecting degradation of RLux compared to its unbinding rate, we can find :
$$\frac{d[GFP]}{dt}=LeakyLux+\frac{k_{mRNAGFP} k_{GFP} \alpha_{LuxR}^2}{d_{LuxR}^2(Km_{Lux}^2+\alpha_{LuxR})} \frac{[AHL]^2}{K_{mAHL}^2 + [AHL]^2}-d_{GFP}[GFP]$$
$$\text{with} K_{mAHL}=\frac{K_{mLux}^2 k_{-RLux}}{k_{RLux}(K_{mLux}^2+\alpha_{LuxR}^2/d_{LuxR})}$$
We have dynamic curves for different initial AHL concentrations.
We can see in the equation above that for initial AHL concentrations much higher than KmAHL=0.3 nM, GFP is only produced and degraded and thus :
$$\frac{d[GFP]}{dt}=LeakyLux+\frac{k_{mRNAGFP} k_{GFP} \alpha_{LuxR}^2}{d_{LuxR}^"
BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,", each output on the TERRA Adapter will have a set of valves for output selection. By actuating these valves in certain combinations, the TERRA Adapter selects for certain outputs while directing all others to waste.
Visit the TERRA Adapter page to learn more about how TERRA handles multi-output selection:
TERRA Adapter
To also handle multi-output chips, TERRA implements a flush protocol in between outputs to clean the nozzle tube with and prime it with the next output. To clean the nozzle tube, the TERRA must first move the plate to a corner of the plane after an output is finished dispensing so that ethanol does not contaminate the plate. A visual below demonstrates TERRA executing this protocol.
Integration with Benchtop Analytics
To accurately dispense user selected sample volumes, TERRA uses a droplet formation model to calculate dispensing times. Given a certain flow rate and tubing properties, the system calculates the dispense time per droplet and multiplies this value by the number of droplets required to fill the sample volume. Our model is located here:
Droplet Characterization
To prove that TERRA is compatible with the benchtop analytical tools, we ran a basic experiment that demonstrated the ability to detect GFP. A smiley face was dispensed onto a 96-well plate using the user interface and TERRA. The final plate was then read using the lab’s plate reader, the results demonstrate that the outputs of TERRA can be analyzed using benchtop analytics.
Now that we verified that TERRA is compatible with benchtop analytical tool, we can use a plate reader to prove that we can accurately dispense sample volumes.                  To test the model we plated a GFP gradient on a 96-well plate with TERRA using a single output microfluidic chip. The fluorescent reading of the 4x6 well gradient of three, two, and one 0.047 mL GFP droplets provides a quantitative measure of sample volume in wells.
In order to dispense different amounts of fluid into different wells, we needed to input the protocol into the UI individually per fluid volume. The resulting well-plate was analyzed in a plate reader to evaluate the accuracy of the dispensing system.
In the gradient, we observed a general decrease in fluorescence as droplets decreased. This proportional decrease, alongside video analysis, demonstrates that each third of the gradient had different sample volumes. However, the data the relative fluorescence of individual wells were inconsistent compared to the general trend. This can be attributed to GFP not diluted properly or spread evenly within the well.

As the iGEM Toulouse team was working on functionalizing cellulose, we met them on Skype to discuss our respective approaches on cellulose binding. We planned to have a collaboration in which we would send them our birch cellulose nanofibrils and receive their bacterial cellulose produced by Gluconacetobacter hansenii, so that both teams could test their own products on two different substrates. Unfortunately, due to time limitations we could not complete this collaboration, but it would have been a great opportunity to further test the binding affinity of our final products.

We decided to participate in iGEM Düsseldorf’s Postcards collaboration idea. The goal of this collaboration was to design synthetic biology themed postcards to bring the topic closer to the general public. Every participating team created a postcard related to their project or synthetic biology in general and sent 100 printed postcards to Düsseldorf iGEM team. They then took care of sending back to each team 50 postcards together with 50 postcards from other teams. In this way, each team would have a range of hands-on materials to share with their local community during public engagement events. Our postcard design represented the theme of our project: colors and dyeing.

In their project, the NUS_Singapore team was also tackling the environmental pollution caused by the textile dyeing industry by producing natural dyes with synthetic biology. Given the affinity of our goals, we decided to collaborate on human practices. On the one hand, we joined our efforts in finding reliable and unambiguous sources on the issue, to have a better and more consistent picture of the damages that textile dyeing is doing to the environment and human populations. On the other hand, we agreed to parallelly write learning materials about sustainability that could be potentially used to educate the fashion industry players about natural dyes. Unfortunately, this second part of the collaboration was not completed due to our busy schedules, yet both projects benefited from our thorough discussions about the textile industry.

#3 - Chemoreceptor Library
Prologue
The objective of the “Legendary TAR librarians” was the generation of a mutant library of the chemoreceptor Tar (Taxis to Aspartate and Repellants). Tar is one of five membrane-bound chemoreceptors E. coli uses for chemotaxis [1]. The receptor is well characterized and an X-ray structure is available (see PDB file ). Residues of the Tar ligand-binding domain that interact with L-aspartate were identified from the pdb-file. Here, we aimed to identify novel receptors by applying directed evolution to Tar chemoreceptors. To enable E."

Cellock Holmes
Our device Cellock Holmes is designed to be an automated 2D fluorescence analyser. We aim to be able to quickly measure the fluorescence emitted by our sensor cells and automatically analyze the emitted images with our software Measurarty. This will enabel us to reliably detect the amount of CFU (colony forming units) of the pathogens present on the sample. The device will have different filters for different wavelenghts included to be able to analyze different fluorescent proteins at the same time.
More information will be available soon!

BrownTwo,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"3 uL insert, 1.5 uL 10x ligase buffer, and 1.5 uL T4 DNA ligase.  Decrease water if you use higher volumes of insert and vector.  Maintain total volume of 15 uL.
1 uL of J63001 contains 15.5 ng while J63002 contains 17.6 ng.  Note that J63001 has a length of 744 bp, while J63002 has a length of around 2292 bp.  Thus, the normalized amounts of J63001 and J63002 per uL are 17.6 ng/744 = 0.023656 and 15.5 ng/2292 = 0.006763.  Thus, a ratio of 0.023656/0.006763 =3.498 natrually exists when one uses the same volume of insert and vector.  If one uses a volume ratio of 3:1 between insert and vector, the ratio of DNA amounts will end up being 10.494, which is even better.
Used the volumes listed above for two separate yet identical ligation reactions, which began around 4:25 pm at room temperature.  Will try to let them run for a full 24 hours.
Inoculated liquid cultures with two from each part colonies except those that did not have colonies on them (Z0842 and Z0279).  Also made cultures for P0501 since the glycerol stocks were not made for this over the weekend.  Placed them in the incubator around 11:50 pm.  Will check on them again at 1:50 pm tomorrow.
