We came to a conclusion circuit A’s adaptation to DNA copy number is higher than circuit B’s. So, the negative feedback works.

Discussion
Due to some restrictions in wetlab, we only finished the above-mentioned experiment. We found that the number of Hela cells who possesses high copy number is   comparatively low. We also noticed the circuit C’s output is higher than expected in Figure 1.This may cause wrong judge when use the design to detect miR-21. Some measures will be taken to solve this question. Besides, we are going to endeavor to construct the other networks mentioned in modeling work.

The Local Community
We value the inclusion of local communities in the world of science and we have tried, during the iGEM project, to actively stimulate the involvement of the people in the vicinity of the University of York in science. To this end, several of our team members visited Lord Deramore's Primary School during their ""Science Week"" in July 2017. We took some activities with us to introduce the Year 6 class to the scientific method. While they used our props to explore each of The Five Senses, we discussed with them how the scientific method can be applied to this kind of experimentation to come to valuable conclusions about the world. We hoped to inspire some interest in science and it seemed to do the trick! We got a lot of questions from the children, including some that we were not able to answer. Both the teachers at the school and our team were very happy with the enthusiasm that we saw.
Further, we met with an aspiring science journalist, Josh Male, who wrote an article about our project here. This was a great way to get the word out to a wider audience concerning what we have tried to do as part of the iGEM competition.
The Scientific Community
Since the start of this project, we have considered the QWACC as something that would be useful for research and industrial applications. Hence, we wanted to ensure that the needs of our demographic (primarily researchers) were met. We spoke to Dr. Richard Kasprowicz, who works for Phasefocus , about the quality of our holograms. He suggested to us that we should make sure that the brightness of each frame was as even as possible.
We also spoke with Andy White, of the Department of Electronic Engineering at the University of York, about the design of our hardware. He helped us to consider the versatility and stability of our DIHM, firstly suggesting that we avoid 3D printing, for reasons outlined here . He also helped us adapt our design so that the degree of magnification could be changed more easily -"

WELCOME TO OUR WIKI PAGE
Have you ever wondered if there was a better way to target cancer cells?
Find a sustainable alternative to batteries?
Or visualize hidden forces in the world around us?
We worked on creating such a biological platform using organelles consisting of tiny magnetic crystals housed inside a lipid membrane, known as magnetosomes. These are naturally found in so-called magnetotactic bacteria that use these organelles to orientate themselves in the earth’s magnetic field.     In our project we make a proof of concept fusing a fluorescent protein to the membrane of the magnetosome. Through this we open the way for using magnetosomes in all sorts of exciting new applications, like for example targeted drug delivery, developing biological batteries or creating magnetic paint.
You will find more information on our project page .
WHO ARE WE?
The UNIK Copenhagen team’s home base is the University of Copenhagen, the biggest university in Denmark and one of the oldest of Northern Europe. UNIK is the university’s interdisciplinary center for synthetic biology which hosts and supervises our team. 2013 is the third year in a row an iGEM team from Copenhagen is competing for a medal at the European jamboree. This year our team consists of 11 curious undergraduate and graduate students coming from different areas inside the field of science.
WHAT DO WE DO?
Magnetotaxic bacteria is the core of the 2013 iGEM team representing the University of Copenhagen. In nature, these bacteria exert an extraordinary ability to coordinate themselves in relation to the earth’s magnetic field. This ability is mediated by organelle-like structures (magnetosomes) lining the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane. Significant amounts of Magnetite (Fe3O4"

Polyethylene and Bubble Wrap
An alternative would be to use a single layer of polyethylene used for bubble wrap. By filling the media bubble with media and air, it’ll form a pouch that can be popped.
Polycell makes a bubble wrap called Oxo-B Eco Bubble which incorporates their Reverte Oxo Biodegradable into their polyethylene resins. After discard, through the use of substantial UV light, oxygen and/or heat it will break down in smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are then broken down further by the ingestion of bacteria and through respiration will degrade the plastic into carbon dioxide and water.  
Will look into plastics that degrade over time

This paper tested EVA 2%, 9% and 19% both in vitro and in vivo. The trend held true that the higher the % of EVA, the more drug diffuses.
They also tested ethyl cellulose, Eudragit RS-100 and Eudragit RL-100 but only in vitro.
The drug was glibenclamide to treat diabetes.

Hello readers,
The lovely and sophisticated lady, Coleen Tran can't write her bio right now. She's busy riding a horse backwards with me. Listening to me reading romantic poetry while I make a bouquet of paper flowers from each read page. Ingesting my delicious Old Spice man smell. Being serenaded on the Moon with a view of the Earth, while surviving off the oxygen in my lungs via a passionate kiss.

Prediction 2050: Every data relating to In vitro immune system including manufacturing methods and financial records leaked to the public. Causes massive public backlash and eventual upheaval in the medical community and industry.'
I am an independent Chinese woman that don’t need no man. I am obviously rich, upper middle class. I had acquired the technology of in vitro immune system by breaking into a lab. Because of me, this technology is now widely available to the public. I work as a professional criminal. I don’t like the connotation of criminal as negative. For me, “criminal” means ‘crime-exposing”. I expose the crimes of corporations and labs.
I used to have a husband, but I got a divorce because he wasn’t needed. In my busy life, I can only focus on two things at once - child rearing and a job. I can’t handle a relationship and the time and effort it takes to make it work.
I am able to make a better living for myself and my child without the need of a man controlling me and telling me what to do. I lost my husband, but no biggie, I work hard to bring food to the table and a sizeable house my child can run around and play.
I am one heist from exposing multibillion dollar industries from lies they have been keeping from the public. My fortune is amassed from taking from the rich and and redistributing the wealth they did not deserve. My very own husband was a CEO that I needed secrets from. He was a means to my end. With his secrets leaked, I was able to wreck his company and leave him bankrupt.

This prefix and suffix will allow us to create a fusion protein with GFP and the coils to be used in our testing purposes. After successful transformation of the part the plasmid was isolated via miniprep and its presence was confirmed through a restriction digest. The part was also sequence confirmed to indeed verify that there were no unexpected changes to the nucleotide sequence.
Week 8: June 17 - June 21
Research efforts were devoted to the Ferritin system during this week. Flooding in the city of Calgary interrupted the planned lab work for the beta-lactamase and coil group.
Week 9: June 24 - June 28
The first BioBrick construction was attempted this week. The goal was to put the RFC25 fusion standard GFP ( BBa_K648013 ) behind the IPTG inducible LacI promoter (with a ribosome binding site) ( BBa_J04500 ). This construction however did not yield any colonies after ligation and transformation were performed. It is recommended the next time this construction be performed that the amount of vector DNA added to the ligation reaction be increased from 5 µL to 7 µL to correct for the dilution of the vector DNA during the Antarctic phosphatase treatment performed. BBa_J04500 in pSB1C3 was transformed this week so that we could have this part available with a chloramphenicol resistant plasmid. The colony PCR for this part was successful (Figure 3) ergo overnight cultures were prepared on the weekend so that a miniprep of the plasmid could be performed the next week.
Figure 3. A colony PCR of potential colonies containing the part J04500. Standard BioBrick primers were used. Bands between 400 and 500-bp indicate the successful amplification of these parts. +C indicates a positive control making use of the RFP coding device J04450 which has an expected size of about 1300-bp when using BioBrick primers. Some non-specific amplification is seen within this control. The gel was 1% agarose and was run at 100 V for an hour.
Week 10: July 1 - July 5
The overnight cultures produced on the weekend were successfully miniprepped producing DNA stocks of the LacI promoter BBa_J04500 (in pSB1C3 ). Restriction digests of this part confirmed a successful transformation and miniprep. An initial attempt was made to make a construct composed"

Diagram 2 presents the main algorithm, which shows how BioGuide application     works. In BioGuide the major components are device and Biobrick graphs.     While the device graph represents input-output (promoter-regulator)     compatibility combination of iGEM devices, the Biobrick graph represents     combinations of atomic parts assembled in a device or system. The flowchart     shows how these graphs are created and embedded into the program, which     displays both of the graphs to the user when launched. Application presents     few interactive options to the user when started, which were shown on     the flowchart under the horizontal, bolded line. As shown on the diagram     2, there are four interactive tasks BioGuide can do, where the device     and Biobricks graphs are utilized. Upon clicking a node on a devices     or Biobricks graph, that node changes in size and color and the various     functions shown on the flowchart can be performed then after.
Modeling
Graphical Modeling for Bio-Guide
Introduction
Graphical Modeling Theory has been applied to construct four different     graphs where relations of atomic parts, devices and systems and the     functional combinations that can build new constructs are presented     for the iGEMs parts registry database. Three graphs are composed of     iGEM devices and one graph is based on Biobricks. Each graph comprises     a set of vertices or nodes and a set of edges. In the set of nodes each     node represents a device, while in the set of edges each edge represents     the input-output combination of the nodes. These graphs are directed     graphs as the edges are created according to input-output combination.     All compatibilities between a regulator and a promoter of an edge is     created, where the source of this edge is the device with the corresponding     regulator and target of the edge is the device with the promoter in     concern.
Fig. 1: A node representing a device
Fig. 2: Arrow representing an edge between two nodes
The atomic structures used in our graphical model have been represented     in Figures 1 and 2. A node is represented with a solid circle where     the label, the part/device ID according to iGEM standards, of the device     is marked on the foreground. The blue arrows between nodes connect the     related devices, representing the input-output connectivity. End style     of the arrow helps us to determine the direction of the node, like in     Figure 2 where the node labeled BBa_S03520 is the source and BBa_JO9250     is the target.

Hydrogen or hydrogen rich materials are ideal materials for radiation shielding because hydrogen does not easily break down to form a secondary radiation source.
Mycelium Glue
Mycelium has been the subject of increasing renown in recent years as a versatile substrate for use in biological engineering applications [1].  In thinking about the versatile uses of mycelium for both Earth and Mars based applications, it became clear that it would be highly advantageous to have some form of attachment mechanism for distinct pieces of mycelium material. This would be advantageous for several reasons, the first being that larger-scale structures comprised of mycelium could be more structurally sound if made up of adjoined subunits rather than one continuous unit. Modular subunits, perhaps in the shape of bricks, could be grown in parallel to accelerate the process of constructing a large mycelium structure. Another compelling reason to engineer an attachment mechanism for mycelium is the flexibility it would afford individuals in space and on Mars: mycelium can grow in virtually any shape and can grow into into 20 cm by 10 cm by 8cm bricks in under two weeks.
IIn the process of selecting different forms of biological attachment mechanisms, it was found that a bacteria-synthesized, mycelium specific bioadhesive would best fit our need. First of all because of how mass-efficient the system could be made for spaceflight. It’s been estimated that on a journey to mars, the cost of transportation is approximately $2.78 million per kilogram, so transporting bacterial spores would be highly cost-efficient in comparison to several kgs of pre-made glue or larger scale attachment devices [2]. The bacterium Bacillus subtilis has been shown to be highly resilient to the spaceflight environment and would be a viable organism to use for this endeavor [3]. It’s also worth noting that NASA and other space agencies have long been developing applications of bacteria on space; once the infrastructure for these applications are in place, the addition of a singular DNA construct for our bioadhesive"

Chinese government officials plan to grow R&D spending from 1.5% of GDP today to 2.5% in 2020 (Pei, Schmidt, & Wei, 2011). In addition to funding from the state, provincial and municipal governments are the other constant sources that contribute to the budget for research. Compare to the abundant industry or private funding in the US, there are only a few private sources in China (Pei et al., 2011). An example of private company in china is Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology (QIBEBT), which is in cooperation with Royal Dutch Shell Group and Boeing Inc. for the development of biofuel.
Regulations for Synthetic Biology
One of the most reliable regulations on transgenic organisms, Regulations on Administration of Agricultural Genetically Modified Organisms Safety was published in 2001 by Ministry of Agriculture (“Regulations on Administration of Agricultural Genetically Modified Organisms Safety”). Other safety assessment and regulation on export and import Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) were also formulated. Since organisms synthesized by synthetic biology are also considered as GMO, it is likely that the government will use these laws and regulations to govern the use and development of synthetic biology.
The difference between synthetic biology and more traditional genetic engineering do exists. Using synthetic biology, scientists will be able to generate novel organisms that possess designed functions for specific use. In this case, it is hard to define if novel organisms are risky or unsafe. Complete laws and regulations that encompass all aspect of synthetic biology can create sustainable and safe development of synthetic biology in China.
Perception of Synthetic Biology
Recently, the Chinese government and many Chinese scientists’ interest in synthetic biology is growing. Many conferences were conducted in the past few years in China, discussing how synthetic biology should be further explored. In February 2008, the Xiangshan Conference on synthetic biology was held and it was the first of its kind in China. In July 2009, the Key Laboratory of Synthetic Biology of Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) organized a forum on the design of drug and energy products based on synthetic biology techniques (Zhang, Chang, & Wang, 2011). More forums were held in the following years, where experts and scholars were invited to discuss the current status and development strategies of synthetic biology, with the aim of promoting its further prosperity in China.
Meanwhile, research centers about synthetic biology were established with the financial support of central government, including the Systems and Synthetic Biology Research Center in Tianjin University, Key Laboratory"

Our iGEM bootcamp was designed as a 2-day workshop for year 8 students, where during day 1 they learnt what synthetic biology is, what we are doing and some activities that we designed to get them thinking about the relationship between synthetic biology and the real world. During day 2, the students were then brought into the labs where they got to do learn from our iGEM team how to do some mini prep.
Day 1 of the iGEM bootcamp: discussing misconceptions of the elderly
The point of the workshop was to pioneer a new, but effective programme during summer at which future iGEM teams can use for their outreach activities.Some of the activities that we ran were to get the students to draw what they think of when we talk about ageing.

Slideshow showing the images from day 1 of the iGEM bootcamp
Other activities involved getting the students to pick out an image from a box, and then they had to relate the image to synthetic biology in some way.
Outcome: As this was our very first outreach session, we really wanted to keep doing these sessions and raising awareness of synthetic biology and our project. The bootcamp was not only fun for the students but we really enjoyed talking and interacting with the students.
Sutton trust programme: Interactive workshop
Michelle, Amandeep & Abbie presented to a group of year 12 students about synthetic biology, iGEM and ageing (and even got invited back to present later this month)! We encouraged discussion throughout the lecture and it was great to teach them a little bit too.
We then proceeded to have two debates: one focussing on ageing, another on synthetic biology.
The arguments were eloquent, well thought through and focussed on aspects such as the economic, ethical and even emotional impact of this research. The debate was particularly poignant at times and the students all had their own opinions which we encouraged the discussion of. We were not only impressed, but inspired by their enthusiasm and the feedback we received. Especially now some of the students want to get involved with iGEM and even study biochemical engineering- a degree they previously didn't know existed.

The Queens team are making chimeric bacteria flagella. By making insertions in the variable domain of the bacterial flagellin, Queens aim to incorporate metal binding proteins, enzymes, adhesive proteins as well as scaffolding proteins to further extend the possible applications. Inspired by Dr. John Bohannon and the Dance Your PhD Contest, Queens are also developing dance as a unique alternative for explaining scientific concepts.
Dr Jay Keasling (Berkeley) is working on a replacement for jet fuel and diesel, following his success creating anti-malarial drugs from yeast. Biofuels are liquid fuels derived from the solar energy stored in plant biomass. His research team aim to engineer new microbes as an alternative to yeast that can quickly and efficiently ferment complex sugars derived from starch-based biomass into biofuels.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#ModellingAndPrototype_-_-_TEXT.html," sensor when detecting black and white surfaces. The sensor has its own LED light and it shines red, blue, and green light onto to the surface.  Relative and respective amounts of red, blue, and green reflected back indicate the colour of the surface, although the reflected light is mixed with the LED light. This effect can be eliminated by taking an initial reading without any LEDs turned on, and then subtracting this reading from each of the red, green, and blue components. We also started designing a formal experiment for testing the colour sensor.  We began brainstorming aspects of the sensor/device that it was very important to both quantify and optimize the operation of the sensor itself:
What is an optimal distance between the surface and the light sensor?
How does colour intensity effects measurements? (example: bright red vs faint red)
What is the minimum amount of transformed bacteria colonies needed to produce enough colour to be detected?
How does ambient light and the environment affect the calibration and readings, and will this need to be an important design consideration?
We started writing up a more formal procedure for the experiment to begin to determine answers to these questions, after we are able to get the sensor functionally working. Next week we are hoping to perform a test using an accurate plate reader to take an fluorescence reading of RFP 30 minutes overnight with different concentrations of cells.  After this data is obtained, we are planning on creating a graph and fitting a mathematical model to describe the results.  This data will allow us to determine how to achieve an ideal signal and what we need to aim for when constructing other portions of the device.  Once we get the sensor, we can perform similar measurements with an Arduino and colour sensor to ensure the results that we achieve using our device will match the results collected using a plate reader.  Using the “gold standard” of the plate reader and the experimental sensor results will allow us to jumpstart our quantitative modelling.  Additionally we broke down all of the processes and reactions that are taking place within our biological system in our device and are hoping to model each reaction individually - with the optimistic hope that we will eventually be able to model our entire system. In particular, we determined some of the parameters that we would have to determine with our models through this experiment.
To collect a more vast background knowledge on quantitative modelling of biological systems we read literature recommended by Dr. Nygren.  This week we continued to get more familiar with the Arduino Uno microcontroller. We built simple circuits to make an LED light blink in different patterns and how to change the brightness of the light in response to being stimulated (LED will dim in a brightly"

Exeter,2014,Team:Exeter#Detection_-_-_TEXT.html," a transcription factor known as NemR, previously entitled YdhM1.  Disruption to the gene encoding NemR results in a decrease in nemA expression, both in the basal and induced states. This indicates that the nemA gene and NemR form a single, connected operon. Umezawa et al. (2008) proposed that the function of NemR is as a redox-operated transcriptional repressor of the nemA gene.  NemR is proposed to remain bound to the operon and, when it binds TNT in the environment, undergo a conformational change to expose the promoter, resulting in increased protein expression. The region of the promoter sequence to which NemR binds (the ‘NemR recognition box) has also been identified2 (Figure 2).
Figure 2: Diagram depicting the sequence of the ‘NemR box’. Adapted from Umezawa et al.3
On the assumption that TNT was able to naturally diffuse into the E. coli cell, we hypothesised that if we designed a promoter containing this binding site DNA sequence, the promoter would  become inducible through the addition of TNT. The NemR transcription factor which is naturally found in E. coli and we confirmed ts presence in the genome of our laboratory strain. This would be a simpler TNT-detecting gene expression system as it would rely on the success of  fewer engineered parts. It has been shown that NemR also responds to cysteine-modifying electrophiles, including NEM, showdomycin, and, more weakly, iodoacetamide 4 . The repressor function of NemR was inactivated through the addition of Cysteine modifying reagents. Furthermore, based upon a predicted 3D structure (Figure 3), it has been proposed that NemR utilises reversible oxidation of a conserved Cys-106  residue as the signal for confirmation change and dissociation from the DNA strand thus activating gene expression5.
Figure 3: 3D  molecular structure of the E. coli NemR monomer. Cysteine residues are in orange, conserved Cys-106 in red, and DNA binding helices in green6.
Finally, it has also been indicated that the NemR protein was responsive to Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), the active component of household bleach. Addition of bleach resulted in the expression of two detoxifying enzymes for bleach: glyoxalase I and NemA7.
We have therefore designed and tested two promoters based on the NemR response described above. These are parts ( BB"

Team > Collaboration
Being one part of the iGEM society is a wonderful way to learn about what is going on in the field of synthetic biology, how to share your fancy ideas with people and work collaboratively with team members. Besides, it provides fantastic opportunities to make friends with people in other teams and EVEN collaborate internationally. Since the PKU iGEM team was founded in 2007, we have been cooperating with other iGEM teams from different countries and continents. This year we followed this tradition and developed collaboration relationship with 4 iGEM teams.
Exchange Program collaborated with UCSF team
Tiffany(the girl before the whiteborad) with us
This program started in 2008 and allows the two teams exchanging 1 student with each other. Last year, we had Eric Meltzer from San Francisco and sent Dan Lu to UCSF.
This year, Tiffany Saw, a lovely ABC girl who was in UCSF iGEM2008 team, came to Beijing and worked with us for the entire summer. In the lab, she loves mini-preping, drawing cartoons for everybody and taking care of our lab pets. When free of work, she carried her camera around and tried different cuisines in Beijing and then took picture of them. She loves almost everything here in Beijing, including the people, food, historical attractions--but not the cars. Now she has been back to United States and begun her college life at the University of California, San Diego.
Visit to SJTU-BioX-Shanghai team
In the middle of this summer vacation, we paid a visit to Shanghai to meet our new friends, the SJTU-BioX-Shanghai team. Before that, we had already got contact through emails and discussed a lot about the development of iGEM in China. We first arrived in Xuhui Campus and visited labs in SJTU BioX center which sponsors the team. Then we went to the beautiful Minhang Campus (and very huge!) and held a meeting together"

DNA Electrophoresis:
For detailed information on how to prepare and run agarose gels see    the following protocol .
Figure 4. DNA electrophoresis of colony PCR for the key sequence in     pDR111. Sample 5,6,7 and 9 show the correct size of     504 bp.
Conclusion:
Transformation of pDR111+key into E. coli Top10 appeared to be    successful. The samples 5, 6, 7 and 9 showed the right size of band in    the colony PCR. These samples were used to obtain the plasmid from an overnight culture.
Validation
Experiment:
02/09/16: Grown cultures of E. coli Top10 with pDR111+key were used to    obtain a glycerol stocks and plasmid isolation was performed (QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit) . Firstly, concentration of the plasmids obtained was    measured on Nanodrop. Secondly, plasmids were sent for sequencing and    then stored at -20°C.
Sequencing:
Plasmids pDR111+key from colonies 5, 6, 7 and 9 were sent for sequencing with the sequencing primer F message    sequencing (see primer list) .
Conclusion:
Sequencing results showed that cloning of message sequence into the    integration plasmid pDR111 was successful. Sample 5, 6 and 9 show a    100% homology, so the key was successfully cloned into the pDR111    plasmid. See sequencing results in Figure 5.

Key sequence in pSB1C3 ( BBa_K1930000 )
The iGEM team Groningen 2016 worked on bioencryption in order to safely store data in DNA. In our project we were mainly working with two sequences of DNA which were the encrypted message sequence and the encryption key sequence. The key sequence was created by our software. It is therefore artificial DNA. We ordered the encryption key sequence as gBlock from IDT (Integrated DNA technologies). To submit our key sequence as BioBrick ( BBa_K1930000 ) we cloned it in the pSB1C3 standard iGEM backbone.

Experiment:
27/09/16: The key was PCR amplified (see following protocol ) from the pDR111"

Future Work
Conjugation System
It would be interesting to attempt the R751 knockouts using the TargeTron system from Sigma-Aldrich. Two of the three proposed knockouts could be done with this system. Successful knockouts would answer key questions about the predicted functionality of our system.
Self Destructive Plasmid
The most obvious improvement for future work on a self destructive plasmid would be to replace the LVA-tagged I-SceI homing endonuclease in  by a wildtype sequence. I-SceI protein with the wildtype sequence is commercially available and has been shown to work. The restriction site and reporter gene have been shown to work, so these would not require immediate attention. Possibly the restriction site could be integrated into the reporter gene sequence, so that cleavage would immediately block transcription of the reporter gene.
Time-Delay Device
Synthetic Transcriptional Cascade
It is interesting to test the time-delay device including a constitutive LacI generator and incorporate control as planned, in order to have more reliable results. The complete sequences of the biobricks are being confirmed now.
Biosynthetic AND gate
It might be interesting to construct the planned biobricks here in order to corroborate that a time-delay behavior can be achieved using post-transcriptional mechanisms. Moreover, it is promising to obtain a time-delay using both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in which the researchers can have more parameters to tune the time of the delay.
Lock and Key Library
In order to completely characterize the new riboregulators, the constructed plasmids should be enhanced by the addition of a LacI generator and they should be tested. Although the algorithm and the online generator seem to work, future work on the interface with the user should be improved.
Modeling Conjugation
The addition of a conjugation delay time would greatly improve the capabilities of our conjugation model. Another interesting feature would be the ability to confine the growth within predefined geometrical structures. This would allow it to simulate the creation of complex spatiot"

Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html,". We decided to get this product sequenced in order to determine exactly what parts of the vector were being amplified by our vectors. For the thrC vector we saw a band around 4000 bp, which was exactly what we were expecting after taking the RFP generator into consideration!  Only one of the three replicates produced a band, and as mentioned previously, many unknown samples were found in our gel. We plan on modifying the protocol in order to receive more favourable results.Next week, we will try our PCR again using confirmation methods suggested by the 2012 LMU iGem team (threonine test for the thrC vectors, starch test for the amyE vector and colony PCR with their primers).
Week 11: July 7 - 11
During our weekly meeting with the faculty advisors, we further discussed the variables we will be manipulating to optimize our B. subtilis transformation protocol. Our supervisor Dr. Tony Schryvers suggested we not shake the cells in the incubator after exposing them to our plasmids. Based on his experience he warned us that vigorous shaking may sheer the pilus; a vital structure bacteria used for the uptake of DNA. -> (reference literature here)
In the lab, we continued with the task of optimizing our transformation protocol by testing the effects of higher xylose concentrations, using fresh comK cells, and omitting the shaker step following the addition of plasmids to our B. subtilis cells. In addition, we prepared MNGE-agar and starch plates in order to determine whether our integration vectors are being inserted into the proper loci.  -> (Nice pictures)
We also heard back from the LMU iGEM team regarding the unusual bands we saw in last week’s colony PCR of the integration vectors. They suggested that it may be an RNA contamination, thus we tried using RNase to remove the RNA. Unfortunately, no bands were seen on the gel created thereafter.  -> (Maybe a picture of last week’s gel beside the gel with no bands?)
Week 12: July 14 - 18
We did not get accurate results from last week’s optimization due to plating the bacteria on the wrong resistance plates. We redid the experiments but this time just focusing on transforming the ComK strain with the thrC vector and compared the effects of the following on transformation: 1% and 2% xylose, shaking and not shaking following xylose induction, and ComK cells that were stored in 10% and 25% glycerol. Initial trials of manipulating these variables showed 2% xylose,"

Problem and Solution
Biofilms are communities of bacteria connected by protein nanowires and surrounded by an extracellular matrix. In this form, they are more resistant and can severely affect human health, industrial productivity and the environment. More precisely, biofilms can cause infections in the human body, affect water quality, and damage industrial installations and equipment. Research and industry have been"

Being an anchor for COPII molecules that cause the budding of vesicles off the membranes, it needs a domain to attach to the ER membrane [55] . The C terminus of the Sar-1 protein fullfills this task. Therefore one can use the C terminus as an ER targeting sequence for other proteins.
Myrpalm
This localization signal is located at the N-terminal end of the amino acid chain. The myrpalm signaling sequence causes a myristilation and palmitolyation of the targeted protein. Both modifications lead to a binding to the cell membrane [56] .
NLS
Nuclear localisation signals are peptidesequences that are able to bind to nuclear import receptors. These cause an import of newly synthesized protein through nuclear pores . This feature is caused by several positively charged amino acids. Nuclear localization signals can be located almost anywhere in the peptidechain [57] We used a nuclear localization signal at the C-terminal end of the protein.
GFP
Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) was first discovered by Shimomura et al. in the Aequorea jellyﬁsh. They described a slightly green colour of a GFP-containing solution that in the sunlight [63] . The same group of scientists investigated the protein in more detail, and have since discovered many characteristics, including the excitation and emission wavelengths . The most important accomplishment was the cloning of the GFP gene into other organisms to make them fluorescent [64] [65] . Many scientists have since worked on GFP and introduced mutations to enhance fluorscence levels or change the spectra. Nowadays flourescent proteins exist in different colours exist increasing their range of application even more.

We collaborated tightly with Wageningen UR and Pasteur Paris. Besides that, we also filled in a lot of surveys.
Wageningen
The collaboration between our team and the team from Wageningen consisted of two parts: Using a plate reader, they measured the spectrum of our fluorophores and in return, we imaged vescicles for them using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). You can read more about our collaboration on their wiki .
Transmission electron microscopy
The iGEM team of Wageningen wanted to encapsulate fluorophores in vesicles. To prove that they were indeed able to make the vesicles,                                  they needed pictures made by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) to confirm the presence of the vescicles and characterize them.                                  Since the Wageningen team did not have access to a TEM, we made the images for them using the TEM.                                  Electron microscopy is an imaging technique that can acquire images with resolutions far above the optical limit due to the small wavelength"

The sample was lysed for 2-3 minutes before adding 350 μl (procedure 2: 300 μl) buffer N3 and inverting the whole solution 4-6 times. Following the neutralization, the sample was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3,000 rpm (~17,900 x g) in a table-top microcentrifuge. Supernatant was decanted to a QIAprep spin column and vacuum applied to the manifold until the solution was drawn through the column. To wash the column 500 μl Buffer PB were added and again vacuum applied. In addition the QIAprep spin column was washed by adding 750 μl Buffer PE and applying vacuum.

Clinically relevant targets
Existing ZFs that bind under-represented triplets
Updating our programs
Many of our current programs currently look at overall data or data based on specific DNA triplets (for example: 'GAT' or 'AAA'). However, in order to more easily understand some of the patterns that occur in the datasets, we want to examine broader subsets of data. For example, do different patterns appear when looking at fingers that bind to 'GNN' triplets versus 'NGN' triplets (where 'N' represents any of the 4 bases)?
We added the capability for our programs to accept inputs with the variable 'N' by using regular expressions.
We can now create lists of the zinc fingers that bind to any triplet, and create interaction matrices and frequency tables for any triplet input.
June 17th - Wet Lab
Update on selection strain knockout status: We are trying to reach Addgene to check how His3 was knocked out---instead of deleting the gene, they may have simply introduced an early stop codon. If that's the case, our gel would have the correct bands because the primers we designed can only show whether a deletion or insertion was in that locus.

Newcastle,2018,Team:Newcastle#Notebook#Operon_-_-_TEXT.html," gBlock amplification arrived and were used to amplify the gBlocks by PCR. A gradient PCR was attempted to try a range of annealing temperatures and a 1 minute extension time was used. Analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis showed that gBlocks 3 and 4 and the pSB1C3 backbone amplified well resulting in bright bands at the expected sizes. However, the amplification of gBlock 1 resulted in two bands on the agarose gel and this raised concerns over contamination. gBlock 2 had not successfully amplified, and no band was observed on the agarose gel. To troubleshoot this, a gradient PCR was attempted across a range of different annealing temperatures, this resulted in 8 reactions (Table 4). Reaction 3 of the gBlock 2 amplification showed the clearest band, therefore this was purified and the DNA concentration quantified which determined a concentration of 51.8 µg/ml. Gel extraction was performed on the other bands amplified from gBlock 2, as there was uncertainty as to which band was correct. Two bands were obtained for gBlock 1, so both of these were gel extracted to recover the PCR product. The stock concentrations of all purified fragments are shown in Table 5. A series of Gibson assembly reactions were performed using different combinations of the amplified products. Reaction mixes were used to transform commercial TOP10 chemically competent cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and between 30-60 colonies grew on each plate following overnight incubation on selective medium.
Week commencing- 24/09/18
Overnight cultures for 3 colonies from each of the 4 plates were grown and plasmids were extracted from the resultant cultures. Plasmid extractions were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 4). Only the backbone had been taken up by the cells. An additional 10 more colonies were analysed in the same way. An additional Gibson assembly was also attempted and two transformations of commercial TOP10 E. coli were carried out, one using 2 µl of reaction mix and one with 5 µl, each reaction used 50 µl of cells. Unfortunately, these attempts did not yield any colonies. The plasmids extracted from the additional 10 colonies were ran on agarose gel, however only 2 kb bands were observed. An additional 10 colonies were analysed in the same way. Agarose gel electrophoresis showed a promising band at 7 kb for the miniprep of colony 19 (Figure 5), which was the correct size of the plasmid and the"

SCUT,2015,Team:SCUT-China#hospitalInterview_-_-_TEXT.html,", cardiovascular disease needs treating by taking medicine for the whole life once it is found. No matter how expensive the medicine is and how uncomfortable and inconvenient he feels, they cannot choose to reject taking it in order to keep alive. Thus, many patients get accustomed to this method and complain less. It is the one example after another that lets us know how fragile life can be, how incapable current technology can be, and how long the way we should spare no efforts to go.
As for our project, due to their education background, most patients we interviewed have no idea what synthetic biology and what gene therapy are. They even never consider the safety of their therapeutic regimens being used now. They just follow the doctors’ instructions because they don’t want to take more risks. It is okay for them to keep alive so some of them hold negative attitudes towards our idea. While there are still a lot of patients in favor of our research, and hope we can make it. They really hope that a painless, safe, high-performance, and safe therapy can replace the current method. More importantly, we believe that as researchers, we are supposed to shoulder the responsibilities of raising the public awareness about individual health, safety of treatment and social justice."
Fudan,2014,Team:Fudan#pro_-_-_TEXT.html,"-axis as Input1, Y-axis as Input2. There we can see four regions representing different input state: low [X] low [Y], high [X] low [Y], low [X] high [Y] and high [X] high [Y], named region A/B/C/D correspondingly. If a report signal only shine in region D in certain circuit, then we could say this circuit is a AND GATE of two input, and if report signal appear in both region B&D in certain circuit, then this would be a XOR GATE. In similar way, we can list all common logic gates and its corresponding graph.
What if there exists a circuit that it can separate these four regions, in other word, each region within the circuit can decide its own report state? Obviously, that would be a circuit which is capable of performing all kinds of common boolean calculations ideally, and that is what we want!
So far we have set the goal to design a circuit take X/Y as two input and A/B/C/D as four output, namely a 2-input-4-output circuit where 4 outputs show relative high orthogonality. If we can achieve it successfully, more complex and multi-parallel boolean calculation could  be constructed within single layer using multiple kinds of outputs’ signal.
Now we have a goal, what we have to do next is to find a motif that can serve as blue print in circuit design.
 
Search for Motif
Consider a motif or combination of several motifs that can perform all 2-input boolean calculation. In other words, what kind of motif would perform 2-input-4-output calculation? Our answer is the bi-fan motif. Given input X/Y and output A/B/C/D, through drawing following lines that X activate B/D while repress A/C, Y activate C/D while repress A/B, we can get a network which is derived from bi-fan motif containing 2 input elements , 4 output elements and  8 lines represent the interaction between these elements.
To figure out the motif which underline the boolean operator we need is essential for circuit design. Once we figure out the motif that serves as formula for our logic circuit design, the only thing remains to be done is to match certain biological processes to all corresponding lines in this network.
Before setting about puzzle solving, we have to be aware of one thing first. It needs 8 lines in total to construct this multi-functional logic circuit, which means lots of inter-elemental interactions should be packed within the circuit we design. But we have no intention of making one single circuit which is too"

The Future of our Method
The Dutch Doping Authority has shown interest in the implementation of our method and the Delft Sport Engineering Institute is interested in further support of our research. More on this can be read on the Entrepreneurship page .  On top of this, we identified another market interested in our gene doping detection method: horse racing. Gene doping lately receives huge interest in the horse racing world. Earlier this year, the 37th Asian Racing Conference in Seoul specifically focussed on gene doping ( Bloodhorse, 17 May 2018 ), illustrating the imminent threat of gene doping in this world.

WEEK 18 (North America Regionals)
Oct 3 2013 - Oct 9 2013
Goals:
We just became the Regional Winners for North America for iGEM 2013, but there's no time to rest. Now it's time to get back in the lab and prepare for the World Jamboree. We want to make a game plan for what we are going to accomplish before the World Jamboree at MIT in early November and gather data in areas where we needed more work. We're taking the judge's comments from the regional Jamboree very seriously and attempting to improve our project as much as possible in the coming month.
Achievements:
We ran our MaGellin assay in a preliminary screening of our cas-methylase fusion and got some activity. We re-ran some previous experiments in triplicate to make the data more compelling.
WEEK 19
Oct 10 2013 - Oct 16 2013
Goals:
We wanted to look further into the possibility of transcriptional silencing using targeted methylation. Additionally, we planned to run the full assay to screen our potential Cas-methylase fusion. Another major priority is to perform bisulfite sequencing to look at the target site for our TALE methylase.
Achievements:
We continued to reach out to underclassmen and recruit members for the upcoming team. At the same time, we were hard at work in lab, performing our assay and trying to further quantify the extent of methylation in our fusion constructs. We got our bisulfite sequencing for our TALE submitted and are eagerly awaiting the results.
WEEK 20
Oct 17 2013 - Oct 23 2013
Goals:
This week we wat to begin utilizing a cell-free system to test our targeted TALE methylase. It is imperative that we give the Wiki a complete design overhaul. We also want to make a plan for the couple weeks.
Achievements:
This week we were screening our cas methylase and found noticeable activity when done in triplicate with all the proper controls. We experimented with various induction times as well. We re-ran some experiments that had previous flaws or were missing controls in triplicate. We had some additional cloning to do to modify our constructs as well. We gathered data for our 3D plot of induction for our methylase"

1. Introduction
In the previous section, the expression level of the cold-inducible promoter (Pcold: BBa_K1949000 ) that triggers the start of the story was examined. What happens if this story is set in warm countries?  Therefore, in this section, the expression level of the temperature sensitive promoter  (Pheat: BBa_K608351 ), which is heat-inducible, was examined.
2. Summary of the experiment
The objective of the experiment here is to characterize temperature dependency of Pheat;  28°C and 37°C are non-inducible and inducible conditions for this promoter. We prepared three samples shown below. After temperature up-shift, the RFU of GFP at regular time intervals was measured.
A. Pheat ‐ rbs ‐ gfp (pSB1C3)

B. Positive Cntrol : Pcon ‐ rbs ‐ gfp (pSB1C3)
Fig. 3-4-2-2-2 pSB1C3
C. Negative Control : empty vector (pSB1C3)
3. Results
The RFU of GFP of each sample was measured at 28°C and 37°C. The results are shown below.
Fig. 3-4-2-3-1 Pheat is a heat inducible promoter
This graph shows RFU of GFP / Turbidity at the indicated time points after temperature up-shift. The error bar represents the standard deviation of three samples which derived from three different colonies, respectively.
The RFU of GFP induced by the promoter was calculated by subtracting the RFU of GFP of negative control at each temperature from the RFU of GFP of Pheat ‐ rbs ‐ gfp. It was confirmed that GFP expression was induced when cultivating at 37°C but not at 28°C. Therefore, it is concluded that Pheat is a heat-inducible promoter.
4. Discussion
GFP was not induced from the Pheat ‐ rbs ‐ gfp plasmid at low temperatures and was"

Substrate
As the substrate utilization of Yarrowia lipolytica is central to our project we have performed an array of growth experiments. We have tested the growth on simple media to determine strengths and weaknesses in the catabolism of Y. lipolytica. We further expanded our research by acquiring real waste streams and byproducts form organic industrial productions in the Nordic countries and screened Y. lipolytica growth for these substrates.

Introduction
""Growth can be the result of many trials""
Mohamad El Lakany,
Mohamad's Mantra
The dimorphic, non-conventional yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, belonging to the Ascomycota phylum, was first isolated in the 1960s from lipid-rich materials, hence the name “lipolytica”. The organism was classified and reclassified a number of times, first as Candida lipolytica, then Endomycopsis lipolytica, Saccharomycopsis lipolytica and finally Yarrowia lipolytica 1 . Figure 1 shows Y. lipolytica cells under a microscope.
Figure 1: Y.lipolytica in plactonic growth with 100x magnification.
×
In recent years, Y. Lipolytica has received increased attention from researchers, as studies have found it to possess great potential for producing industrial enzymes and pharmaceutical proteins. This potential is a result of several advantages that Y. Lipolytica has over the conventional yeast S. cerevisiae. Y. Lipolytica prefers secreting proteins through the co-transcription pathway and does so very efficiently 2 in addition, it does not exhibit hyperglycosylation as S. cerevisiae does 3 . Y. Lipolytica has also been shown to exhibit excellent characteristics for the production of value-added chemicals such as a long range of organic acids and polyols. The recent introduction of several genome-scale models for Y. Lipolytica will most likely lead to more"

Cell debris, proteins, lipids, SDS, and chromosomal DNA should fall out of solution as a cloudy, viscous precipitate. If the supernatant contains a large amount of floating particulates after centrifugation, recentrifuge the supernatant before proceeding to step 6.
4) Prepare column:
Insert a GenElute Miniprep Binding Column into a provided microcentrifuge tube, if not already assembled.  Add 500 μL of the Column Preparation Solution to each miniprep column and centrifuge at ≥ 12,000 xg for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Discard the flow-through liquid.
Note:The Column Preparation Solution maximizes  binding of DNA to the membrane resulting in more consistent yields.
5) Load cleared lysate:
Transfer the cleared lysate from step 3 to the column prepared in step 4 and centrifuge at ≥ 12,000 xg for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Discard the flow-through liquid.

Add 750 μL of the diluted Wash Solution to the column. Centrifuge at ≥ 12,000 xg for 30 seconds to 1 minute. The column wash step removes residual salt and other  contaminants introduced during the column load. Discard  the flow-through liquid and centrifuge again at maximum  speed for 1 to 2 minutes without any additional Wash  Solution to remove excess ethanol.
6) Elute DNA:
Transfer the column to a fresh collection tube. Add 50 μL of Elution Solution or molecular biology reagent water to the column. For DNA sequencing and other enzymatic applications, use water or 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, as an eluant. Centrifuge at ≥ 12,000 xg for 1 minute. The DNA is now present in the eluate and is ready for immediate use or storage at –20°C. Note: If a more concentrated plasmid DNA preparation is required, the elution volume may be reduced to a  minimum of 50 μl. However, this may result in a reduction in the total plasmid DNA yield.

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," an even busier next week! The competition is less than a month away and lab work is high priority now.
We did several rounds of colony PCRs, most of which failed. On the last round, colony #4 and colony #17 of 30 both showed up on the gel at the right height. We then created liquid cultures of our successful colonies and grew them up over night. The cultures didn’t grow so we performed a few experiments to try to get it to grow. We created several tests that included longer incubation time, leaving the caps slightly open, and tilting it while it shakes. Nothing worked.
Since the transformation protocols were not working, we tried a new technique to create our plasmid. We decided to do a KLD (Kinase, Ligase and DpnI enzymes) reaction and hope that our plasmid was made. We performed a KLD transformation because other members of our team were successful in making plasmids this way. When we performed a transformation with this technique with our gene P450scc, there were 15 colonies. We proceeded to inoculate five of the biggest E. coli colonies into liquid media in preparation for a miniprep. We performed a double digest of the miniprepped plasmid and ran it on a gel along with the non-digested miniprepped plasmid to confirm if the plasmids were our BioBrick. For some reason there were no bands in the restriction digest lanes, but in the undigested plasmid lanes there were bands at around 4kb which means that there is some insert in our plasmid. We will perform more double digest to confirm if the P450scc plasmids are correct.
In comparing Tsynth8 and Tsynth30 for use in yeast, both demonstrated increased heterologous protein expression and transcript levels greater than 2-fold over the commonly used CYC1 terminator [cite study]. However, specifically for use in Y. lipolytica, Tsynth8 showed 3-fold greater protein expression than Tsynth30. In addition, Tsynth8 had slightly lower cryptic promoter activity and a lower tendency for transcript read-through, which would signal  insufficient transcript termination. Most significantly, Tsynth8 could be ordered as a sequence from IDT; whereas Tsynth30, with it’s extended TA efficiency region, could not.
We miniprepped the yeast mediated cloning products and received high DNA concentrations in all of our samples. Afterwards, we attempted multiple PCRs with different primers to check if our genes"

TALENs are constructed by fusing a C-term truncation (+63aa) of the TALE DNA binding domain with the non-specific FokI endonuclease catalytic domain. TALENs form dimers through binding to two target sequences separated by ~17 bases (Sanjana et al., 2013).

B. LINKER
As we’ve said before that we inspired by the Calgary Team 2013 ’s project, so we decided to learn the linker from previous work by them. The E/K coil is a heterodimeric coiled-coil that often used for biosensors and as an expression and affinity purification tag. The E coil contains all glutamic acid residues and the K coil contains all lysine residues. This coiled-coil can be found in a wide variety of proteins and contain a single type of secondary structure or the α-helix. There are two ways to increasing the stability of this sequence: the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil (positions at a and d) and the α-helical propensity of surface esposed positions at b, c, e, f, and g (Litowski, 2002).
Figure 4. Helical wheel of the E4/K4 heterodimer (Litowski, 2002)
We used linker to connect  Tale and reporter. We used E and K coil since they can interact each other with high specificity. E-coil was fused to amilCP blue chromoprotein (reporter), while K-coil bound to Tale. This fusion make the reporter can be linked to Tale (detector) through K coil-. This fusion involving PCR and these part was digested and ligated as Igem protocol.
 
C. REPORTER
In order to make sure the presence of DNA  from HPV 16 and 18, we need reporter which connect to detector.  Fluorescent protein usually used as reporter gene to study about gene expression. Gene encoding fluorescent protein was synthesized in four stages (Laufer et al, 2013). Chromoprotein can be used as good reporter. Another useful feature of the chromoproteins is the “kindling” behavior, which makes them prospective photoactivatable markers. In this project, we used amilCP blue chromoprotein. This chromoprotein was extracted"

User Feedback
Since the L.A.S.S.O. was designed using input from the CF community we wanted them to let us know how well it worked. It was essential to the team that possible future users could use the prototype. Therefore, we took the L.A.S.S.O. back to the our local CF clinic in order to get possible future users to have a go at testing the device.

Audit
We had an ISO 13485 certified auditor look through our documentation for the L.A.S.S.O. and perform a mock audit to highlight any additional steps we could take to have a product that is as industry-ready as possible. In addition to receiving suggestions about how to improve our documentation (which have been acted upon) we were informed of the following:
In Europe, to obtain a CE mark there are three devices directives:
Medical Device Directive
Active Implantable Device Directive
In Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) Directive
According to the auditor our device, while being “active”, is classed as an IVD and therefore if we were to optimise our device for uptake by a manufacturer we could streamline the process further by satisfying the criteria laid out in the IVD directive. This is being investigated currently.

Duke Engagement Seminar
Wanting to improve last year's forum, we held a seminar together with East Chapel Hill High iGEM team and the Museum of Life and Science to discuss future outreach projects as well as how to improve our success in engaging a diversity of thoughts. Our mosquito forum from last year (see: Mosquito Forum )drew primarily from Duke University and thus most people already came from a very scientific background. A variety of backgrounds and point of views is essential to having an engaging and meaningful forum.
We discussed with Chapel Hill and the Museum of Life and Sciences on collaborating to create forums in the future that can achieve this goal. During this seminar we examined the the incredible gap of opinion between the general public and scientist communities, and conversed about how scientific communities must create spaces to speak with and hear public opinion surrounding genetic engineering topics. We deliberated about appropriate ways to engage the public in learning about the scientific process and the research already being done with genome-editing technologies. We concluded that one of the most important goals of such public engagement is the interaction between trained scientists and laymen - this gives ""science"" a human face and allows researchers to learn from perspectives not often considered in their daily work or by their colleagues.  The key structure of a forum is that it is NOT a lecture, but rather a chance for opposing sides to discuss; this enables scientists to reach out to people not accustomed to academic settings.
We also discussed price structuring to improve attendance in such public engagement forums. From what the museum found in their past experience, charging people a nominal fee encouraged a higher retention rate but saw an attendance consisting of people already knowledgeable and interested in the topic such as local scientists and graduate students. Making the event free, however, saw a dramatic drop in attendance since there was nothing to disincentivize dropping out the day of the event. What is important is to find a balance between maintaining acceptable retention of attendees but also keeping the event open to all community members. This often requires grant funding to attract a crowd diverse enough to have representative opinions (i.e. running the forum as a kind of paid study).
In a future collaborative forum run by Duke iGEM, the East Chapel Hill iGEM team, and the Museum of Life and Science there are"

Tsinghua-A,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A_-_-_TEXT.html,"FP2. These constructs mimic the effect of dimerization in living cells, and are under fine control because they can be induced by the drug Dox. Dox concentration serves as the input to our system and navigates the quantitative properties involved in dimerization.
Cellular Information Inference
Sense the environment, or die. The intricate world is full of chaotic information, knowledge of whom are vital for survival. But all that the cell “knows”is the concentrations of downstream products. It has to infer the right input and try to eliminate the uncertainty caused by noise.
For each level of input, the cell exhibits a specific probability output distribution. If the distributions are overlapped too seriously, the cell will have difficulty guessing the right answer. Thus the circuit is prone to error, its ability to accurately transmit information low.
Traditionally, we evaluate the impacts of noise using variance-related statistics, such as coefficient of variance. These quantities can only describe how concentrated the output is around the mean value, but cannot tell us how well we can infer one of the correlated random variables from the other. Channel capacity makes a better criteria of noise because it more scientifically depicts the information dissemination process.
Experiment & Results
Experiment
Protocols:
Experiments:
We transfect HEK-293 human cells with our plasmid constructions as described in the form. Different concentrations of Dox are applied to cell culture at the same time.
Transfected cells are cultured for 48 hours before performing flow cytometry, long enough for protein expression level to achieve steady state. FACS examination measures florescent intensity emitted by each cell, from which we obtain a large sample of florescent protein expression level, tens of thousands of cells for each experiment group.
Data collected from flow cytometry are later analyzed on computers. We estimated probability density function (p.d.f.) from data using kernel density estimation, a nonparametric statistics method. Given high and low Dox concentration input, cells exhibit different probability distributions, as illustrated in the example below.
What we have in hand is the conditional distribution $p\left( {Y\left| {X = x} \right.} \right)$ , given a known level of input $x$ . In order to calculate mutual information $I\left( {X;Y} \right) = \iint {p\left( {x,y} \right){{\log }_2}\frac{{p\left( {x,y} \right)}}{{p\left( x \right)p\left( y \right)}}dxdy}$  and estimate"

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and"

With a pair of sharp pliers which was installed after he begged Summer for a long time and could be regarded as the first in the universe, he poked the cell wall unconsciously. Immediately, a hole showed up in the cell wall. If a little further into it, Mr Careless even could enter the bacteria body himself to see the inner structures clearly. What he could do now was just to wait quietly under the microscope and hopefully would receive the blame from Summer. After all, he made a mistake. Time passed by, he did not hear the roar of Summer, so he raised his head and had a look upon to the microscope.
“Hey, Mr Careless, what are you doing?”
“I, Um...I was wrong.”
“You did not do anything wrong.”
“How comes?” Mr Careless was confused with his eyes opening widely.
“Go into the body of the colon bacillus and help me install these parts.”
“Um, what?” Mr Careless did not fully understand. Actually, I did not figure it out too.
“Get all these things installed according to the drawing I offer you. I need a new weapon!” Summer pretended to be in complacency.
“Well, OK.” Mr careless had thought the inner part of cell wall should have lots of nice artwork. How it comes? It was just an empty shell with nothing! That really was a big disappointment. However, work was work and should be separated.
“I've finished it.”
“Come out, you need to do more to complete it.”
Looking at the bacteria remains, Mr Careless was overwhelmed. How long it would take to deal with all the bacteria? He curled his lips in discontent. “Summer, what is the use of this new weapon? How it will be so much? Will mechanical arms be helpful?”
“Mr Careless, you know what, only you can accomplish this tough task. You know, if we make out the new weapon, the disaster will be eliminated. You won’t believe what a significant contribution you will make!”
“Really?”His eyes flashed lights when he was hearing this. Up to now, he always made mistakes and got critics. Thus, he was looked down by the little guys. But this time, I was afraid that they would look upon me respectively. Gradually, he got lost in his thought.
“Hey, Mr Careless, wake up!”
“Oh, work...”
Wind and Lily finally accomplished their mission, after fighting a whole day. Back to the safe house, Summer set the parts of the rest germs in order. She hoped all the plants came to"

Front propagation for cell growth
If we only considered the diffusion effect and  growth effect of the cell culture, it came up with the model Fisher-Kolmogorov  equation which was firstly developed by R. A. Fisher and A. N. Kolmogorov [ 4 ].
where ρ was the cell density, D was the diffusion coefficient, γ0 was growth rate, ρs was saturation density.
Here, due to the symmetry, we investigated  equation (4) in case of cylindrical domains with u depending only on radius.  Numerical study with an initially condition of  Gaussian function                                                                      as Fig.2 can  give a solution shown in Fig.2, while analytical solution can refer to  reference [ 5 ]. Based on the solution, it was found that the speed of the front  propagation of the pattern was proportional to the square root of the product of  diffusion coefficient D and growth rate γ. As this migration speeds of the cell pattern at  different cheZ expression levels can  be obtained from experiments, and the growth rate was also measured, the  diffusion coefficient D at different cheZ expression levels were also known  then. And the cell density can be transformed to the brightness that we observed  in the experiments (see the brightness model part) , the quantity ρ can be compared with the experiments. Therefore, each  quantity in equation (4) can be compared with the experiments.
If we  looked at the wild type E.coli which  only had random walk and growth, the equation (4) was successful to describe its behavior. As shown in Fig.2, a droplet of wild type E.coli in the center of the plate will  from a round expanding pattern. And most regions in this pattern except for  some near in boundary seems to be uniform, which was the same as the  result of the model (Fig.2).

Density Dependent Motility
Fig. 3 Designed genetic circuit
In experiments, we designed a circuit  that the cell motility was repressed by cell density ρ. When the cell density ρ was high, the  diffusion coefficient D became small.  Therefore, the fisher’s equation as equation (4) was not valid  in this  case any more.
To  order to be simplified, we firstly considered  the one dimension problem again. We assumed the  cell density at point x was"

Monday 29th
This week we finally managed to start the proper lab work! In the morning prepared agar plates with ampicillin/chloramphenicol. Then we carried out transformations of four promoters from the 2014 distribution that we plan to use for characterization of our parts:
BBa_K554001 FlhDC promoter)
BBa_R0082 (OmpR promoter)
BBa_K144300 (blue light activated system) we got from our friends from Aalto-Helsinki team
BBa_K864400 (PTac promoter)
+ DH5 alpha competent cells control
In the meantime some of us were cleaning and organizing our new lab to make it ours and pretty! We will post a picture once it's ready :) We also tried to autoclave our tipette pits but they didn't quite like the autoclave!
Tuesday 30th
In the morning, we have checked the plates and obtained some pretty colonies!
We have inoculated 4 colonies per plate to be incubated overnight at 37C
In the afternoon, we planned the assembly of our BBa_J23100-BBa_B0034-TPH1-BBa_B0015. We have digested the gBlock1 with EcoRI and gBlock2 with PstI. Then we have performed the Gibson assembly of digested gBlock 1, gBlock 2, and linearized pSB1C plasmid, followed by the transformation .
Wednesday 1st
Bifidobacter
There was only one colony on our plates from the Gibson assembly! We suspect that this is because the overlap between the linearized pSB1C3 backbone and our synthetic constructs was not long enough. We plan to try the Gibson assembly of two gBlocks alone tomorrow, followed by ligation to the plasmid backbone. We will see if this works better!
We have also purified the DNA from the transformants of four promoters from Monday. Some parts from the kit were missing, so we spent 4 hours on making a miniprep! This is bad!
Interlab Study
In the afternoon, we have transformed the BBa_I13504 part from the 2014 distribution which we plan to use for our InterLab study.

As the digestions of the transcriptional unit (TU) of EaDAcT were incorrect, we repeated the process from the ligation step.
We transformed the same TU in a E. coli competent strain (DH5α). Then, the transformants were cultured in LB media and Spm and stored at 37°C overnight.
Finally, in order to obtain the FAO1 gene, we want to extract the Candida tropicalis genome, so we have picked a colony of C. tropicalis. To check the extraction protocol, we used a yeast previously tested, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have cultured C. tropicalis in YPD media and S. cerevisiae in YPDA media at 28 °C (5 mL).

Candida genome extraction
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used as a control in order to see if we followed the protocol correctly. We aren't really sure if this protocol is going to work in Candida.
Cultures measured at 600 nm:
S. cerevisiae Abs = 1.07
C. tropicalis Abs = 0.39
S. cerevisiae is recultured with new media (1:2) because the previous media was saturated. 2.25 mL of YPD media were mixed with 2.25 mL of S. cerevisiae culture. The mix has to grow at 28 °C until the exponential phase is reached.
The absorbance was measured again:
S. cerevisiae Abs = 0.52
C. tropicalis Abs = 0.40
Buffers needed for the genome extraction were prepared freshly.The genome of both strains of yeast were extracted following the protocol:
Grow yeast in 2 or 5 mL YPD to exponential phase.
Collect cells in 1.5 mL eppendorf-cup (centrifugation 20 s, 6000 rpm).
Wash once with 1 mL sterile water.
Resuspend cells in 200 μL protoplast-buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 1000 units Zymolyase/mL, 10 μL beta-mercaptoethanol/mL; prepare freshly!). Incubate at 37°C for 1-2 h and finally resuspend by turning the cups.

UK iGEM Meetup- 12th-13th July 2018
Nottingham iGEM 2018 participated in the UK iGEM Meetup. This was one of the best opportunities to make collaborations with other teams and bring back useful information that we gained during 2 days in Oxford on 12th-13th July 2018.
The first day was very interesting! We got an opportunity to present our project, answer questions and get feedback from other iGEM teams. This was very useful as it helped our team to understand what type of question the jury might ask at the Giant Jamboree. As well as this, we took part in a collaboration workshop. It was a great chance to meet other teams, discuss our projects and also make collaborations, which is a very important part of iGEM.
The next morning, we started with a short introduction of activities. We were split into 3 groups and started our lecture sessions. The first one was called “The iGEM Alumni Trouble-shooting Workshop”, where we focused on our problems and shared our iGEM experiences so far. This helped us to understand how other teams are doing and gain advice from last year’s winners and alumni. Then we had a lecture on human practices, safety and security. This lecture was extremely important because it helped our team to understands the concept of human practices and gave us some tips about how to avoid mistakes in the safety and security part of iGEM. The final lecture was about entrepreneurship. This helped us to look at our project from another perspective and learn about the After iGEM potential for our team.
Hassan, Sofya and Nemira were brainstorming a lot during these two days, so we came back to Nottingham full of different ideas about what we can do or change. We presented these thoughts to the rest of our team, who had even more ideas!
To conclude, we found the meetup"
