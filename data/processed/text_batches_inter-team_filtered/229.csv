Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

James innoculating LB with pre-culture
1ml of preculture (which had been left overnight) was taken and used to inoculate 200ml of LB (standard bacterial broth). The flask which contained the mixture was then placed into the shaker, which both incubated the culture at 37 degrees Celsius and constantly shook the flask.
Once 2 hours had elapsed, the optical densities of the cultures were taken using a spectrophotometer. This was to determine whether the cells had grown and if they had, where the cells were in their growth phase. For competency, E.coli need to be in early log phase. The results were as follows:

After several times of discussion with us, BNU-China understood the background of our modeling part and the problems they were about to settle. Meanwhile, they helped us to find some bugs in modeling, such as the inconsistency of some variable values in each group of equations, and the problem that parameters of some equations don’t accord with the fact.
First of all, BNU-China adjusted a series of independent variables and corrected the parameters. Then they found the solution of the equations by applying the Runge-Kutta Method. The method could be used in differential equation system in different dimensions with high efficiency. According to concentration of hydroxyl ion in equation ABCDE groups, pH of each equation was obtained and was used to judge the termination condition. In equation C and equation F, concentration of specific substances were used to stop the conditions. The initial value of each equation group was the terminal value of the last equation group. By this way they achieved the whole cyclic process and finally got dynamic image of pH(Fig.5).
Fig. 5 The dynamic change of pH during the regulation process
The initial concentration of OH- is 0.2×10-6, and the initial pH is higher than 7.0, so the whole reaction starts from Group A, and the reactions are in the order of Group A, B, C, D, E, F, A, B, C, D, E, F.
○ The detection of protein NhaA and NhaB by BNU_China.
BIT-China’s project this year is to regulate the pH in fermentation environment and to strengthen the competence of microorganism to survive in both acid and alkali. Therefore we want to express two kinds of membrane proteins, NhaA and NhaB. Considering the fact that membrane proteins are particularly hard to express and detect, BNU_China helped us to establish this part. To this end, they reviewed amounts of relevant articles and consulted several professors in this field, on which basis they tried various protocols to express, purify and detect NhaA as well as NhaB.

The newsletter was particularly successful and helped the Sheffield team integrate into the iGEM community.
We also participated in the development of Paris Bettencourt’s MOOC (Massively Open Online Course), run on Genius online knowledge base website, on which we annotated some of the entries and hope to continue to edit in future.
Valencia_UPV
To assess how good the Lab Notation we had developed was, we reached out to Team Valencia and asked if they would be interested in testing the notation for us according to the specific procedure we sent them. They were sent the notation key and 2 protocols written in the standardized lab notation format. The titles of the protocols were not included in this pack to ensure that the volunteers were only using the information provided to them. They were then asked to fill in a qualitative review assessing how they had found carrying out each of the protocols . The  information obtained in the review and Team Valencia’s suggestions were very beneficial for the final correction and testing the the new notation we developed.

Preparation of large plasmids
For isolation of plasmids larger than 15 kb in size, 7 ml bacterial culture were harvested after 12-16 hours of growth in appropriate medium. Samples were centrifuged at 6000 xg for 20 min at 4°C. Supernatant was discarded and cell pellet resuspended in 200 µl of Buffer P1 (QIAGEN). Afterwards, 400 µl of Buffer P2 were added, mixed thoroughly by inverting until the lysate appeared viscous. Solution was incubated at room temperature (15-25°C) for 2 min. Afterwars 300 µl of Buffer P3 were added to stop lysis. Cell debris and Proteins were pelleted by centtrifugation at ~ 17,900 x g for 30 min at 4°C. Supernatant was carefully transferred into a fresh 2ml eppendorf centrifuge tube and isopropanol purification of DNA was conducted.
Sequencing
Samples were sent to GATC Biotech for sequencing.
Protein detection
Thin Layer Chromatography
TLC was carried out on silica-gel as immobile phase and Dichloromethane as mobile phase. For the procedure a 50 ml beaker was filled with ~15 ml Dichloromethane and let stand for about 10 minutes (in order to let the Dichloromethane-vapor fill the beaker). The TLC plate, coated with silica-gel was spotted with sample 0.5 to 1 cm above the lower edge and placed in the beaker. TLC was run until the solvent front was at two thirds of the TLC plate. As Indigoidine is light-sensitive, the beaker was covered with aluminium foil in order to prevent direct light irradiation.
Purification of Indigoidine and tagged constructs
1 ml of IPTG-induced, blue culture was spun down at full speed (14,000 rpm) for 20 minutes, washed in 1 ml of methanol and centrifuged once more for 5 minutes at 14,000 rpm. Methanol was discarded and samples were dissolved in 200-400 µl DMSO.

DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#SPL Section_-_-_TEXT.html," SPL taking care of issues in relation to handling, such as visualizing the fragment on a UV image after running the amplicon through gel electrophoresis, digesting and retrieving the digested product as well as the yield. Another advantage to this was that now the SPL contains a selectable marker that can be screened for as long as the plasmid backbone inserted into contains a different resistance marker than chloramphenicol.
Figure 2 illustrates how the SPL was amplified via PCR resulting in a genetic part that contains a chloramphenicol selectable resistance marker that has the prefix and suffix added to the appropriate ends and is therefore compatible with the BioBrick assembly standard.
The fragment was now large enough for digestion and subsequent ligation with BBa_I13507 into pSB3T5. Being able to judge how much variation between promoter strengths were obtained was accomplished by following guidelines of BBF RFC 19 - ""Measuring the Activity of BioBrick Promoters Using an In Vivo Reference Standard"" written by Endy et al. The backbone pSB3T5 was chosen on the basis of having the same origin of replication p15A as the backbones pSB3K3 and pSB3C5 that were used in BBF RFC 19. Reference promoters were thus chosen from the Anderson promoter library. BBa_J23101 was chosen first and foremost due to serving as an in vivo reference standard for promoter activity as described in BBF RFC 19, it was thereafter selected as the medium reference promoter which had a relative strength of 0.7, J23100 was chosen as the strong reference promoter as it had a relative strength of 1 and J23116 was chosen as the weak reference promoter which had a relative promoter strength 0.16.
Strains were constructed containing:
SPL + BBa_I13507 + pSB3T5
BBa_J23101 + BBa_I13507 + pSB3T5
BBa_J23100 + BBa_I13507 + pSB3T5
BBa_J23116 + BBa_I13507 + pSB3T5
These were transformed into two different E.coli strains, namely XL1-Blue and DH5α. Once colonies were visible on the plates, 15 random colonies were picked from the SPL containing constructs, 2 of the BBa_J23101 containing constructs, 2 of the BBa_J23100 containing constructs and 3 of the BBa_J23116 containing constructs. References were also needed in order to make sure we were indeed measuring RFP and to see how"

Industry Collaboration
We began our collaboration by speaking with industry experts from the innovations team at Anglian Water and academics within Chemical and Biological Engineering and Civil Engineering from the university who were heavily involved with sewage systems. This enabled us to determine, alongside the liability study, that the product should be incorporated at the consumer end as an alternative to currently used grease traps. By breaking down the fats, oils and greases early on, there would be prevention of build up deep in the sewer as well as domestic clogging; this gives our product the advantage of being used as a preventative measure in two different locations. Click here to see the development of our product over the summer and the final designs.
We also set up a trip to the Yorkshire Water Hayton Wastewater Treatment Facility. We met with Clarke and Lindsay, representatives from Yorkshire Water, who explained to us how the facility should operate and how deposits of fats, oils and greases inhibited it from functioning properly.
Hayton is the location of a small facility where a fatberg had recently been found. Yorkshire Water jetted the site prior to our visit after a large fatberg deposit had accumulated previously, but since then more fat deposits had begun to develop.  We were given the chance to see an amassing fatberg in the real world, and we could see how damaging FOG deposits were with our own eyes.
Upon arrival we were shown around the enclosure within which the tanks and blowers were built. They explained to us that the site was a typical descriptive site where inappropriate disposal of FOGs had led to the development of a blockage in the tanks, which typically would process sewage received from the surrounding domestic and commercial properties. Hayton serves a largely rural population, mainly receiving waste from farms and small villages, and is one of"

In order to be considered for the Best Measurement Approach award , you must fill out this page.
There are a lot of exciting Parts in the Registry, but many Parts have still not been characterized. Synthetic Biology needs great measurement approaches for characterizing new parts, and efficient new methods for characterizing many parts at once. If you've done something exciting in the area of Measurement, describe it here!

Phage Team
The goal of the Phage Team is to modify the capsid sizes of enterobacteriophages T4 (a large phage) and T7 (a smaller phage).  Bacteriophages are subjected to random mutagenesis by growing them in liquid culture with 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a nucleotide analog that causes mutation. Phages are then separated from the bacteria and purified in a CsCl gradient.  The gradient is separated into fractions and each fraction is tested for the presence of phage. The plaque sizes in phage-containing fractions are analyzed and compared with the plaques produced by wild-type phage. Plaque-size variants are then purified, tested for phenotypic stability, and are imaged and measured using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Stable mutants showing varying capsid sizes are added to the library and their mutations are characterized by PCR and sequencing. Mutants are then subjected to further mutagenesis.

Public outreach
Spreading awareness and interest for synthetic biology can be a difficult task due to the complexity of the field and the fast pace of development. Furthermore, the public scepticism towards genetic engineering and GMOs has been quite strong, at least in Sweden. To explore the awareness of some aspects of synthetic biology and the knowledge about it, our team conducted a survey covering the use of GMOs in household products. The survey also covered some basic concepts within biology, such as DNA and where it can be found. We also went a step further in the pursuit of understanding the public position, in our collaboration with the Istanbul Technical University iGEM team
In our collaboration, we designed the layout and questions for our survey to be able to compare the differences in people's opinions and knowledge of GMO. The results could then be compared and an analysis of the differences can be used to devise future strategies for informing the general public on the use of GMOs in both our countries.
The survey
The survey consisted of 15 questions in total with an initial part covering age, gender and education level to aid in analysis of the results. The questions were first written in English and then translated to the native languages of each teams' country (Swedish and Turkish).
For the survey questions, click here ❯❯
Results and discussion
The participation on the survey was good, with 183 and 875 participants in Sweden and Turkey respectively. Demographically, the diversity was not optimal with over 80 percent of the participants having a university education which is not representative of the population as a whole in either Sweden or Turkey. Correction for this will of course have to be part of the analysis. Furthermore, it should be stated that conclusions drawn here are merely the thought and conclusions drawn by our team and are open for interpretation. After statistical analysis in the form of a t-test, the discussed results were shown to be significant.
As a whole, the attitude towards genetically modified organisms (GMOs) was more positive in Sweden with over 80 percent being positive, whereas in Turkey, 72 percent had a negative or sceptical attitude towards GMOs. The sceptical attitude towards GMOs could be linked to the low exposure to the subject within formal education. Results show only 28 percent of the Turkish participants having received any information regarding GMO within an educational setting. Furthermore, the Turkish participants showed a higher level of dissatisfaction with the information that they had received. When asked if GMOs should be used for medical purposes, 24 percent of the Turkish participants disagreed, whereas 3 percent disagreed in the Swedish poll. This result can most likely"

Paris_Bettencourt,2016,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Enzyme_-_-_TEXT.html,"I was correctly overexpressed, with the observed size being the expected, around 59kDa. CatA overexpression was very mild, but the correct sized band was observed, of around 34kDa. XylE was correctly overexpressed, with the correct band being observed, of around 36kDa.
Overexpression of three of the four enzymes was achieved. BG1, although very promising, was not correctly expressed, and therefore we continued our experiments with BpuI, CatA and XylE alone.
Testing our enzymes in their natural substrate
The next natural step was to test whether the overexpressed proteins were functional. We performed cell extracts of BpuI, CatA and XylE enzymes and measured their activity using the appropriate substrates.
Figure 4 Confirmation of enzymatic activity of heterologously expressed BpuI, CatA and XylE. Results obtained using the cell extracts prepared as explained on the methods section of this page. Control corresponds at BL21(DE3) background, using  cell extracts of BL21(DE3) cells that do not express our proteins. In all cases, values measured correspond to reaction product.
A. BpuI activity was measured in Citrate Phosphate Buffer at pH 4, with 0.4mM of ABTS being used as substrate, as recommended in the literature. Measurements were taken after 90min, timepoint at which the substrate present in the reaction medium was finished.
B. CatA activity was measured in Sodium Phosphate 50mM at pH 7, with 30mM of Catechol as substrate, as recommended in the literature. Measurements were taken after 35 min, timepoint at which all the substrate had been consumed.
C. XylE activity was measured in Potassium Phosphate 100mM at pH 7.5, with 30mM of Catechol as substrate, as recommended in the literature. Measurements were taken after 12 min, timepoint after which all the substrate had been consumed.
In all cases, the proteins were demonstrated to be functional. All three cell extracts carrying them were able to degrade their natural substrates more than the control.
Testing the effect of fusing FBD with proteins
The following step was to construct our fusion proteins, fusing Fabric Binding Domains to our best performing enzymes.
First, we needed to understand whether it was feasible to build a functional FBD-enzyme fusion protein. We needed to understand if the joining together of the two parts would have a negative effect on the binding capacity or in the"

Cellobiose mass balance
Glucose mass balance
Arrhenius Equation
Arrhenius equation is an empirical relationship which is used to model the temperature dependent reaction rate constant. Note: T1 is set at 45 °C
Constants
Kir — Reaction rate constant of reaction i
Eai — Activation energy of reaction i
R — Universal gas constant
Construction of Model
The model was constructed using the numerical programme MATLAB. A script file was generated which holds the variable dictionary, constants, temperature dependency equations, the ""ODE45"" differential equation solver, and the plot command.
A separate function file to the script is created as script files can only operate on the variables that are coded into their m-files. Rs (the substrate reactivity parameter) changes at every iteration because it is dependent on the S the substrate concentration at a given time, the substrate being cellulose. Therefore S at the first iteration is S0, the initial substrate concentration. At the second iteration S is the previous value calculated by the ODE, and so on. After each step the new value of S is fed into the function file and is used for calculating the reaction rate constant for cellobiose and glucose, etc.
Rs — substrate reactivity equation
ODE45 calls on the function file to calculate the rate equations and then substitute them into the respective mass balance. A numerical integration is performed and the results can be seen below. ODE45 is used as it is more accurate than other solvers (according to Mathworks) . It is based on an explicit Runge-Kutta formula and is a one-step solver.

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!
Best Basic Part Special Prize
To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.
Please note: Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize."
Tec-Monterrey,2012,Team:Tec-Monterrey EKAM#Sybre_-_-_TEXT.html," students of ITESM’s Monterrey Campus. It will seek to include members from a cross-disciplinary background in order to broaden the scope and reach of the projects being developed. It will foster the creation of biotech start-ups and research groups from undergrad students. With the implementation of DETECT (‘Detección de Estudiantes con Talento’ - Detection of Talented Students) as a social community program, SyBRE will spread the knowledge of synthetic biology (starting from basic biology and chemistry) through gifted children in local schools.
Regarding iGEM, SyBRE’s founding will allow to plan ahead and coordinate future participations so that preparations are done in time and lab work can begin as soon as the January-May semester ends (or sooner if possible). Sponsorship seeking and overall funding will be better handled as an official student group since it has more legal venues to procure resources both inside and outside the Campus. SyBRE will also allow the development of long-term relationships with sponsors by keeping the same ‘face’ through the years, irrespective of the current team composition.
The final goal of SyBRE is to procure a physical place where its members can nurture academic and business projects related to synthetic biology without having to depend entirely on other departments and to review the policies and controls of the grant of access to laboratories and the use of equipment. Several issues arose during the past months and most of them could have been prevented or better handled.
Another challenge to tackle is to change the cultural biases that prevent the full utilization of the laboratories due to territorial feuds, bureaucracy, whimsical baroque formalities, the ‘nobility’ of the PhD (a grave issue in high context, high power distance, patriarchal societies like ours), etc. We know that modifying hard-wired behavior is difficult, but it must be at least tried. Science and initiative should not be hampered by self-defeating practices.
Thankfully, there's always people (administrators and faculty) which go out of their way to try to help motivated students achieve their dreams. They work against the statu quo to mobilize resources and find spaces to provide undergraduates with the necessary tools for the iGEM experience and research ventures. Some of these people are in our Attribution page and we are deeply grateful to them.
There are some excellent students in our Campus. With the right stimulus they can be moved to do great things. SyBRE is our way of helping them and ourselves bring those things to reality, knowing that the effort will last, that future generations will benefit from the advances made by the previous ones and, little by little, create something"

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer2_-_-_TEXT.html,"B) may cause increases in flagellar speed by altering the conformation of FliG relative to the other rotor proteins and/or the MotA·B complex, thus, compacting the motor complex and allowing fast errotation by creating less friction within the surrounding stationary MotA·B ring complex (56).
This study having captured our attention, we decided to use mutant HNS to increase flagellar speed and torque power.
PotB59/PomA
The flagella of bacteria is made up of 30 different proteins and at least three different parts. These parts are the basal body, hook and filament. . The basal body is made up of the rotor and stator and is the region responsible for the rotation of the flagella. The stator is the part made up of channel proteins that generate the necessary proton motive force. The rotor is a stable region of the basal body which controls things such as the speed and direction of the flagella and is found in the inner region of the stator. The interaction between the rotor and stator, found in the basal body, result in the movement of the flagella. The filament is the long string-like structure that reaches outwards. . The role of the hook is to connect the filament and the basal body together.
Figure 1. Schematic diagram of the bacterial flagellum. The flagellum is a locomotive organelle for bacterial propulsion. The flagellum consists of the basal body, which acts as a reversible rotary motor, the hook, which functions as a universal joint and the filament, which works as a helical screw. OM, outer membrane; PG, peptidoglycan layer; CM, cytoplasmic membrane. .
The driving force of the bacterial flagellar rotation is an ion concentration gradient between the two sides of the membrane. The energy needed to rotate the flagella is generated by the majority of bacteria as a H or Na ion concentration gradient. In proton(H)-driven motors, the rotation of the flagella is carried out by the MotA and MotB membrane proteins. These proteins are actually H+ channels and when H+ moves through these channels depending on the concentration gradient, the necessary energy for flagellal rotation is created. This system that uses H+ is used by E. Coli and many other bacterial strains to generate energy for flagellar rotation. Other bacterial strains rely on Na+ to power their flagellar motor.  These include Vibrio spp. (V. alginolyticus, V. parahaemolyticus ve V. cholerae) and alkaphilic"

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Air Samples Testing for ICT-Mumbai
ICT-Mumbai is working on dealing with the problem of excessive ammonia in toilets and chemistry labs. They contacted us via email after reading our abstract and found out that we both deal with excessive ammonia. We collected air samples from the toilets and chemistry laboratories in Huairou Campus of UCAS, and assayed them following their standardized protocol. We are glad that this data is helpful for improving ICT-Mumbai’s project.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food. Wish them good results!

Dale Cook of Affinity, who provided us with a copy of Affinity Designer,  a fast, clean piece of graphics software. We relied on the program for most of our graphical work, and are extremely grateful to Dale for his generosity.
Attributions within the team:
A huge strength of our team is its interdisciplinary nature; having biologists, physicists, natural scientists, and biochemists allowed us to tackle the problem of bTB from different perspectives. We harnessed the diverse nature of our team and gave equal weighting to the three main areas of the project: the lab work, the modelling work, and the outreach (human practices) side of the project. Although every team member had input in all sections of the project, each of us had preferences in the area in which we worked. These are briefly outlined:
Todd, Amy, Dan, and David worked on the modelling section of the project. This included creating a simulation of our system with complex toehold-trigger interactions in a 3D environment, researching real world values for properties such as binding distances, viscosities, temperatures, etc., and solving problems such as confinement into a low binding affinity microcentrifuge tube.
We were all present in the laboratory at various stages of the project but the key laboratory members were Bradley, Emilia, Jasmine, Georgina and Joe. Lab duties included making up antibiotic plates and glycerol stocks (using liquid nitrogen), using the FLUOstar Omega microplate reader to gain accurate quantitative fluorescence readings, and running and extracting agarose gels.
Bradley, Emilia, Jasmine, and Georgina were all involved in toehold research and design during the early stages of the project. This included searching for a piece of target RNA present in a Mycobacterium bovis infection but not present in the BCG vaccine, and using tools such as NUPACK and UGENE to design a toeholds with a variety of chromoproteins and other markers. Yemi also created a detailed schematic of TB infection.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. For 2015, we're removing the track and introducing an award for entrepreneurship.
Note
In order to be considered for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award , you must fill out this page.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2015 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!"

Effort on the publicity of iGEM and synthetic biology
In the preliminary stage of our project, we found that the public knew little about synthesis biology. We hope to grasp every opportunity to introduce the concept of synthesis biology to well-educated people. Therefore, we signed up a scientific research innovation contest held by Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
During the contest, we introduced the idea of our project, knowledge about synthesis technology and iGEM competition by presentation and posters. Our project was widely appreciated by judges and other competitors and won the gold Prize.
We also spread the idea of iGEM and synthesis biology to students and teachers who were interested in scientific research. Most of them hadn’t heard about synthesis biology before. During the contest, we got the opportunity to introduce the basic ideas of synthesis biology to teachers and students, especially the concept of future biology engineering. This is our first step in the promotion of synthesis biology. We hope that in the future more and more people will be attracted by it and make further development to this promising discipline.

UAB-Barcelona,2009,Team:UAB-Barcelona#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," polymerase, [Rf], and on the promoter-specific Michaelis-Menten parameters, Vmax and Km, that determine the RNA polymerase-promoter interaction during transcript initiation [1]. Generally constitutive promoters are distinguished from regulated promoters; for the first, Vmax and Km remain constant under varying conditions of growth, whereas for the latter, Vmax and/or Km vary.
EFFECT OF THE FREE RNA POLYMERASE ON THE RATE OF TRANSCRIPTION INITIATION AT A GIVEN PROMOTER
All mathematical relationships involving free RNA polymerase derived below refer to steady-state conditions in exponentially growing bacterial cultures and are based on the standard Michaelis-Menten equation:
Transcription kinetics 1
Here V is the rate of transcript initiation at a given promoter, [Rf] is the concentration of free functional RNA polymerase, Vmax is the maximum rate of initiation at saturation of the promoter with RNA polymerase, and Km is the free RNA polymerase concentration that produces the half maximal rate.
EFFECT OF FREE RNA POLYMERASE ON THE RATE OF TRANSCRIPTION FROM A GIVEN PROMOTER
The rate of transcription, ri, originating from a given promoter Pi with an associated length of transcripts, Li, equals the product of the initiation rate V, given by the equation written before, the transcript length:
Transcription kinetics 2
If V and Vmax are measured as initiations per minute per promoter and the length of transcripts is measured in nucleotides, then ri is obtained as RNA nucleotides polymerized per min during steady-state expression from the promoter Pi. From this it is clear that ri is proportional to [Rf] only if the free RNA polymerase concentration is much smaller than Km.
Biosensor of chloroform modelization
INTRODUCTION
A mathematical model of the detection and degradation of chloroform by a recombinant Escherichia Coli is proposed. The model includes chloroform transport to the cell, transport to the gas phase, transformation and output (GFP) induction. Our model consist of a system of seventeen nonlinear ordinary differential equations describing the temporal evolution of the key variables involved in the regulation of the pathway mentioned before. Computational simulations of our model are carried out for different external concentration of chloroform.

Take out the heated aluminum plate and chip, and apply a small amount of water to the outside of the aluminum plate with a test tube brush to slowly cool it to a free evaporation state.
Place the cooled aluminum plate and chip in a ventilated place, and then take out the chip after natural air cooling to check whether the bonding is successful. If successful, the chip is completed.
Precautions:
When cutting the chip, complete it as much as possible, and repeating the cutting multiple times may cause the chip cavity error to become larger;
Check whether the layers of the chip are aligned before bonding. Use a small amount of tape when fixing to avoid the indentation on the surface of the chip.
When bonding, pay attention to the stability of the bonding temperature. If the temperature is too low, the bonding may fail. If the temperature is too high, the chip may melt.

Safety
New Regulations on IVD devices
The technological advances of the last decade have facilitated the development of new in vitro diagnostic (IVD) devices. Since these tests may have high impact on individual and public health, their safety is a major concern. To keep up with the scientific and technological progress and with the needs of society, the European Parliament adopted new regulation on in vitro diagnostic medical devices just a few months ago - on 5th April 2017 14 . Previously, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration also issued a regulatory framework on 1st July 2010 1 .
The current trend is to develop new stricter policies to improve the safety of IVD devices. Only one out of five IVD devices were required by the previous EU directive to be checked by a Notified Body, before it was placed on the market. However, the new regulation states that only the safety class A tests (lowest risk) will be sole responsibility of the manufacturer, while all devices of higher risk classes will require involvement of a Notified Body 14 . The risk classification of IVD devices is new itself. Besides, a scheme for performance evaluation during the lifetime of a device was introduced. While the U.S. system focuses on evidence of clinical efficiency, the FDA rarely requires clinical outcome studies 1 . In contrast, the new EU regulation introduces new requirements for clinical evidence including clinical data and continuous performance evaluation with incident reporting.
Self-tests
Another big topic related to new IVD devices is the usage of self-tests (ST). There are several risks associated with them 13 :
Diagnostic sensitivity
False-negatives occur when the device shows a negative result, eventhough the true result should be positive. Since self-testers often perform tests for reassurance, without considering the disadvantages 12 , in the best case self-tests for high-severity conditions should be available only if the false-negative ratio is in the similar range as for clinical tests. Otherwise poorly informed patients may be harmed in case of false-negative results; treatment will be postponed and the condition will worsen. Consumer information should promote more informed usage"

Biological switches
A biological genetic switch is a system that enables cells to ""remember"" a state set by transient signals. Many biological processes exist in mutually exclusive states. Cells or organisms exist in one of the distinct states depending on the level of stimulus input. A change in states is triggered in response to fluctuations of a stimulus above or below threshold level. This is frequently mediated by a regulatory circuit with positive and/or negative feedback mechanisms.
Temperate bacteriophages are classic examples of such natural genetic switches as they can choose between two distinct life cycles, namely lytic and lysogenic. However, once the lytic cycle is instigated, the lysogenic cycle cannot be reinstated. For more information please click here .
Bistable Switches
Now, taking an idea from the world of electronics, we define a bistable switch with a memory function and with two mutually exclusive steady states. Once stability in one state is reached; only stimulus above threshold level would switch the system towards reaching the other steady state. Bistable switches in one state remain on when stimulus concentration decrease below the level originally required to flip them on in the first place. Such behavior is known as hysteresis.
However, bistable switches are not naturally occurring mechanisms. As in the example with bacteriophages, once the lytic cycle is induced, the lysogenic state cannot be reattained. This is also an example of a robust switch in which once the system is set to be in one state, reduction and in some cases even removal of the stimulus input does not trigger switching to the other state. Robust switches have biological importance because in mechanisms such as differentiation of cells during development, gene regulatory systems must hold the state set during development. This can be accomplished by a network of genes that regulate one another through repressor and activator proteins that they encode.

Today   we found that colonies had grown on the plates transformed with part   BBa_B0032 (RBS) yesterday, but no colonies on the plates transformed   with part BBa_J23109.  
A colony of BBa_B0032 (RBS) transformed E.coli cells was inoculated in LB media and left to grow overnight at 37°C. 
We   selected another new constitutive promoter, part BBa_J23119 and carried   out the transformation of this, as well as retransforming part   BBa_J23109. These were both plated and left at 37°C overnight to grow. 
We carried out a miniprep of part BBa_1742111   (limonene synthase) transformed cells and part BBa_B0015 (terminator)   transformed cells that had been grown up overnight. The plasmid obtained   from these was stored at -20°C. 
We   also had a meeting with Wei-Feng and Luca, in which we discussed the   planning of Boston and YSB 2.0, our ordered sequence and general lab   work.  
We also skyped Paris Bettencourt and discussed a possible collaboration between the teams. 
 
Day 24 (30/07/14): 
We   had a lot of growth of both promoters, parts BBa_J23109 and BBa_J23119,   however we realised this is as they had been grown on plates with no   chloramphenicol and therefore transformed colonies had not been selected   for. We therefore transformed both of these parts again, plated these   and left them to grow overnight at 37°C.  
We had been growing up overnight E.coli cells transformed with part BBa_B0032 (RBS). We carried out a miniprep of these and collected the plasmid.  
Plasmid obtained from the minipreps of the E.coli cells transformed with parts BBa_1742111   (limonene synthase), BBa_B0015 (terminator) and BBa_B0032 (RBS), was   then ran on an agarose gel to check if the plasmid is present. All three plasmids were present.  
 
Day 25 (31/07/14):

USP_UNIFESP-Brazil,2016,Team:USP UNIFESP-Brazil#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," FabLearn Conference was held by the University of São Paulo (USP) and the Stanford University during the 9th and 10th of September, 2016, at the campus of USP. We presented Seletora Centrifuge and Electrophoresis System using digital fabrication techniques. The conference gave us the opportunity to share experiences in research and education based in the “learning by doing” principle. We talked, for example, with high school students who built a syringe pump using Arduino and were planning to build a centrifuge as well in a really insightful meeting.  We perceived a great interest from teachers, professors, high school and undergrad students who also encouraged us to provide a repository with our designs and projects so they could reproduce the devices themselves. This acceptance reveals that the practical impact of our project goes beyond research, transforming education and learning.
FAZ
The FAZ (""make"" verb in impetartive form, portuguese) festival was held at the Red Bull Station, in Sao Paulo downtown, and gathered a very diverse group of people interested in the maker culture. Our team presented the hardware built using digital fabrication techniques in a lecture and demonstration session. The event represented a singular opportunity to share our work and insights: from the motivations that led us to built our own lab equipments to the context of the iGEM competition and the social impact of our project. As we were used to talking to scholars and students, FAZ gave us the chance to reach out for designers, architects and artists, a public we had not dialogued before. The insights and questions raised there enriched our experience by pointing out the design and visual aspects of building biotechnology devices. It was great to see how different backgrounds lead to different ways of approaching an specific problem."

Newcastle,2016,Team:Newcastle#Notebook#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," our system might be taken out of the lab. For this reason, we further investigated ways in which we could improve the safety of our system.
In investigating how we could further increase the safety of our transformed organisms we came across the use of genetic kill switches which have been investigated by a number of iGEM teams in the past, e.g. Wageningen 2014  , the parts for which can be found in the parts registry.  We considered adding such a system to our own bacteria but felt that this increased the complexity of our system too much. Additionally, in cases such as the microbial fuel cell, we are explicitly trying to reduce the metabolic strain on the cell which would not be helped by adding a kill switch system.
After further consideration of this issue we identified an alternative safety system which functions along similar principles to a ‘kill switch’ and which could easily be integrated into our systems to make the safer. That is, the notation of ‘dependent bacteria’. These are strains which require supplements without which they could not survive. An example of such a strain mutation is ΔdapD. Strains with this mutation in the gene encoding Succinyl diaminopimelate aminotransferase require a succinate supplement in order to survive. Refer to the OpenWetWare page on E. coli strains for more information .
Such a dependency system is summarised in 'Building-in biosafety for synthetic biology'; (Wright, Stan & Ellis, 2013) and does not appear to have any negative impacts on the bacteria in our use case. As we do not have time to test such as system as part of our own work we located an existing experiment in the literature to serve as a proof of concept for this scheme. The work by Cranenburgh (2001), ‘ Escherichia coli strains that allow antibiotic-free plasmid selection and maintenance by repressor titration ’ shows that ΔdapD mutants suffer low growth without supplements (in this case IPTG as dapD was placed under the control of the lac promoter). We have included the relevant figure below (Figure 2), the line with squares in graph B charts the growth of the mutants with no supplements.
Figure 2: Graph showing growth rate in ΔdapD mutants. The line with squares in graph B shows that there is reduced growth of the mutants when no supplements are present.
In the future we suggest that our constructs be used in bacteria with this or a similar mutation to improve the safety of our system. This serves to supplement our physical containment strategy.
Whilst considering the risks posed by our physical container, it"

Water Collection
In order to use our portable detection kit, a filtration system is needed to isolate pathogenic V. cholerae from water sources. Lambert iGEM has developed a spira swab to carry out these functions at a lower cost. The spira swab consists of a filter packed plastic bottle with a 2-cm hole at the bottom as an outlet for the filtered water. To demonstrate the in-field application of this water filtration method, Lambert iGEM ran a series of experiments to test the efficiencies of different filters (muslin filter, coffee filter, cheese filter, and t-shirt cloth) to determine which would be the most effective filter. By using water from a nearby creek and E. coli liquid cultures, these samples were filtered using the spira swabs containing different filters, and the remaining filtered water samples were plated onto carbenicillin plates. The muslin filter produced the least amount of colony forming units in comparison to the other filters demonstrating its efficiency isolating V. cholerae. Because V. cholerae is larger than E.coli, the spira swab is able to allow V. cholerae to flow through while still letting the muslin filter trap unwanted sediments and bacteria validating the effectiveness of the spira swab in our detection kit.

1.Brief introduction of the project
Transgenic yeast is designed to be activated by light, being able to secrete out the enzyme which mainly catalyze cellulolysis. Instead of using chemicals, we introduced a new model to detach the ink particle from paper fiber specifically.
2.The organisms we used
east (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), E. coli (DH5α)
3.The parts we used
(1) Three enzymes for cellulolysis endo-beta-1,4-glucanase B, endo-1,4-beta-xylanase A and lipase ORF sequence are from the genome of Aspergillus oryzae, Neocallimastix patriciarum and Rhizopus niveus respectively. (2) Ste12 promoter and protein of positive up-regulation We retrieved the sequence of ste12 promoter from upstream 500bp of a pheromone-related pathway transcription factor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. And we directly acquired the sequence of ste12 protein which is the product of this pathway. (3) Improved GAL4 based yeast light-switchable promoter system We adapted the sequence of GAL4 based yeast light-switchable promoter system from BBa_K801042, which is originally designed by Dong-Jiunn Jeffery TRUONG and the group iGEM12_TU_Munich.
4.The operation risks during experiments and their solution
(1) Molecular cloning of E. coli In order to make DNA visible on agarose gels, ethidium bromide was used for staining. It could insert itself between double stranded DNA of samples as well as ours and act as a mutagen which affects DNA biological processes, such as DNA replication and transcription. To prevent skin contact, we not only used protective gloves but also changed it frequently to avoid any ethidium bromide left over. All materials that contact with ethidium bromide were considered polluted"
TU-Eindhoven,2017,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," decided to join this Exchange and this year teams from all over Europe have joined! Since iGEM is not only about lab work but also about spreading the knowledge about synthetic biology into society, each team was asked to make a postcard depicting their project or more general a subject from synthetic biology. On the back of the postcard, a small informational text can also be found. This was a very easy and fun way to incorporate outreach into our project! Every team also received a batch of postcards from all the other participating teams. It was very interesting to see the postcards from the other teams and made us curious for the presentations at the Giant Jamboree.
Franconia
Together with the iGEM team Franconia, we made a biological themed cardgame. They made an English version of this game and together with other teams we translated it. We made a Dutch version of this game. If you want to play this nice game you can download the cards here . We also have a Dutch version of the rules, which can be found here . If you prefer the English version, the cards can be found here and the rules can be found here.
Waterloo
Additionally we answered a survey from the Waterloo iGEM team. This survey was about the customizability and price of current lab materials. It was aimed to see if 3D printing was a good solution to overcome financial problems which might limit teams in their performance.
Nebraska
We also answered a survey from iGEM team UNebraska-Lincoln. This survey was about methane production in cattle and the responses helped them with their project. If you want to know more, visit their website.

Conference with Team AHUT_China and NAU-China
On 28th, September, 2016, we were invited and held a conference on iGEM projects with Team AHUT_China and NAU-China. It was a great opportunity for us to publicize our team and projects in other cities. On this conference, we introduced great therapeutic effects of our engineered MSCs on inflammatory diseases and shared different opinions on cell therapy. We were excited to find that most audience were interested in this new chassis (MSCs) including its phenotype, function and low immunogenicity. After that, they raised questions on our biosafety of our engineered MSCs and gave some suggestion to us. We were pleased to communicate with people from different fields.

Since it was the first time for our team, SYSU-MEDICINE, to participate in iGEM competition, we were eager to publicize us as well as our projects. Learning that Newsletter is a great stage for iGEMers to communicate and collaborate with each other, we showed ourselves by publishing our ideas, questionnaire, photos and so on. Surprisingly, we received some replies and suggestions.

Welcome
Welcome to iGEM E 2012 at UC Davis!
This year's UC Davis team is composed of ten undergraduates, two advisors, and a graduate student. We come from different areas of study, but we're all working together on this year's synthetic biology project. Due to the global impact of plastic pollution, we have decided to focus on biodegradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). PET is a commonly and widely used plastic, but only a small percentage of them are recycled, meaning a majority of the trash ends up in landfills and the oceans. It is a global issue, and achieving our goal would have a big impact on the issue of plastic degradation.
Our Project/Abstract
We hope to accomplish:
This year, our team hopes to successfully insert the gene for cutinase, an enzyme that has been shown to degrade polyethylene terephthalate (PET), into several strains of E. coli. PET is a major kind of plastic used today, and we hope to overproduce cutinase within the E. coli and secrete the enzyme into the extracellular region to degrade the PET. We hope to test the cutinase out on several kinds of PET, such as films from scientific companies and plastic bottles, and test how much each is broken down. We also hope to improve the cutinase itself through targeted mutations and codon optimization, through programs such as Foldit and SWISS- MODEL.
Through our research, we have learned that with cutinase, PET degrades into terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol. While TPA does not appear to be harmful, ethylene glycol is a toxic substance. We hope to degrade ethylene glycol as much as possible by enhancing the promoters that express the degradative enzymes involved. After ethylene glycol is degraded, we hope to redirect all further byproducts into glycolysis within E. coli so that the project would sustain itself. We also hope to"

1.Overview
Recent researches show that 4S pathway（a four-step enzymatic pathway that converts DBT to 2-hydroxybiphenyl (HBP) and sulfate） has a great significance in biological desulfurization. Mechanisms related to the 4S pathway have been broadly studied. In our project, we tried to study the pathway with mathematical theories and modeling. Based on the model of E.coli lac operon system in which lactose is used as an inducer, we derived the optimal proportions of Dsz-enzymes and the most accurate induced concentration of IPTG. Also, we calculated the best proportion between water and oil in the reactors, which effectively optimizes the system.
We analyzed the major parts of this pathway respectively, such as using Michaelis-Menten equation and substrate inhibition equation to analyze catalytic process of enzymes, as well as using differential equations(ODE) to analyze the concentration variations of different components in the system during the catalysis. We also established relevant models to fit images, building up a three-dimensional sense of understanding.
2. Enzymes’ proportional model in 4S Pathway
The procedure of 4S Pathway:
2.1 Theory Part
As the picture above illustrates, there are totally 4 enzymes participating in the 4S pathway. Through the pathway the C-S bonds in the DBTs are cleaved. After 4 steps of oxidation, the sulfur elements are converted into sulfate or sulfite, thereby dissolving in water and being removed. Meanwhile DBT is oxidized to HBP and remains in the oil phase, without degrading the hydrocarbons, which means the calorific value won’t be reduced. This is the process of 4s pathway biodesulfurization.
However, the lacking in durability of catalytic activity in the 4S pathway has become a major obstacle to BDS. Studies have found that HBP and HBPS in 4S pathway"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

Overview
A critical component of characterization and comprehension of synthetic biology, software, and hardware tools exists in the form of mathematical modeling. Here we outline the models developed to facilitate the understanding of CALM (machine learning model) and ElectroPen (ultralow-cost synthetic biology tool), and assist in the prevention of cholera outbreaks. The model for CALM serves to develop a proactive response to potential outbreaks by utilizing predictive algorithms to identify at-risk areas and inform relevant organizations to mount a response. The model for the ElectroPen demonstrates the underlying principles allowing for the functionality of this ultralow-cost electroporator in terms of mechanical, electrical, and biological engineering. With the ElectroPen facilitating infield biosensor tests and CALM predicting cholera outbreaks, the described mathematical modeling serves to describe two key elements of CAPTIVATE and the mechanisms behind their performance.
Proof of Concept Results
In order to utilize LacZ color expression as a biosensor mechanism, Lambert iGEM obtained a LacZ toehold construct assembled with a T7 promoter from the Styczynski Lab at the Georgia Institute of Technology. When assembled with a distinct RNA sequence that is complementary to the trigger sequence, the LacZ operon is induced and subsequently breaks down Xgal and produces galactose and a blue pigment. This color can then be characterized by the shade of the blue pigment expression. This part is transformed in pSB3C5 instead of pSB1C3 because when LacZ is induced in a high copy plasmid such as pSB1C3, it drains the metabolism of a cell.
The construct above displays the proof of concept T7 LacZ switch and trigger. The switch consists"

Tianjin,2014,Team:Tianjin#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," to Beijing  Institute of Technology (BIT) for a brief discussion on our projects. We each  made a presentation and exchanged the ideas on both. Through their  illustrating, we were well impressed by general idea and delicate design of their  project. Apart from the project, we also consulted Professor Zhang Xunwen from School of Aerospace Engineering on some  experimental devices, namely an ammeter with accuracy at a magnitude of 10-12.  Though we didn’t get the proper device at last, we gained a lot of helpful  suggestions. We did learn a lot!
This meeting helped us come to a better  understanding and not only of the limitations of our project itself but also of  the innovative thinking for developing an overarching structure for a new  biological system.
（3）Cooperation with NKU iGEM 2014
We carried out a work of mutually help  collaborating with Nankai   University iGEM Team. We planned  to help each other in several ways. To begin with, we launched a exchange  conference in Oct 13, 2014. Both team made a brief introduction about the  project firstly. Through their illustration, we were pleased to know that their  project is about the synthesis of rhamnolipid from microbes to assist the oil  exploitation. Then our team introduced our project and shared the experiences  and difficulties on the experiments. In the following part of “Prospecting”, we  exchanged our idea about our project on potential applications and blueprinted  our further cooperation.
In  addition, due to the lack of experiences and related laboratory reagents, we  were not able to do SDS-PAGE to identify our target protein and roughly  estimate its concentration. So they helped us do the SDS-PAGE and analyze the  results. We were very grateful about that!
④Collaborations
In this busy but unforgettable summer, we  have devoted our greatest passion; put all the thoughts in the iGEM  competition, so as the companions from other universities, I believe. Luckily,  however, we utilized our strengths to aid members of the iGEM community and  received considerable kind and helpful instructions from other teams so that we  can get through many tough moments or come up with new ideas by these joint  efforts.

This graph shows the absorbance of our colonies versus time.
It is clear that several strains exceed the rest.
The strongest strains did not bear the highest TIR ribosome binding sites.
Unexpectedly, the most prolific strains did not contain the strongest ribosome binding sites. It is possible that at very high TIR the cells experienced toxicity or too much metabolic strain from the production of GFP. With further characterization of the GFPs it will be possible to compare the expression of strains containing the same RBS but different variant GFPs. Through this analysis we will be able to determine the strength of our optimization criteria and hopefully add to the ability of future engineers to optimize their genetic systems.

Tokyo-NoKoGen,2010,Team:Tokyo-NoKoGen#Project#lysis_-_-_TEXT.html,"a_K317040 (Fig.3 (B)) for the characterization and application of BBa_K112808
First, we amplified Plac (BBa_R0010) from RFP coding device (BBa_J04450) by using BBa_G00100 as forward primer and Plac-Rev as reverse primer. Then, digested the PCR product with EcoRI and SpeI and ligated into pSB1C3. Next, construct RBS-lacI-Double terminator-Plac. This was constructed by 3A assembly and used BBa_I732820. After analyzing the sequence, RBS-lacI-Double terminator-Plac was ligated into BBa_J23109, which was digested with SpeI and PstI. We confirmed the construction of BBa_K317042 by sequence analysis.
Second, we ligated the digested BBa_K317042 and BBa_K317038 by 3A assembly. And more, we did transformation of DH5α with these ligated samples. Plasmid extraction from obtained colonies and sequence analysis was done. Obtained plasmid were registered BBa_K317040
Evaluation of BBa_K317039 (Fig.3 (A))
We performed an experiment with our parts above (Fig.3 (A)). The experiment was performed from single colonies in a streaked LB agar plate. At first, we cultured the single colony having the above device in 100 mL LB for 6 hors at 37℃ with agitation. Then, the culture was dispensed into 3 mL scale and AHL (f.c. 50 nM) was added to each dispensed culture to induce the expression of Lysis genes. The obtained culture was incubated for 20 hours at room temperature without agitation. After that, the OD660 of each culture (N=3) was measured. The result was shown below (Fig. 5).
The result showed that the OD660 were different in presence of AHL (red bar) or not (gray bar).
OD660 of samples with the AHL were half less than no additive samples. That indicates that the complex of AHL and Lux activated the expression of lysis genes and the E. coli in the culture were lysed.

Cornell,2018,Team:Cornell#Policies_-_-_TEXT.html," non-disclosure agreements. However, there is real potential for our project to eventually reach the stage of commercialization in which these suggestions would play a key role, so we plan to explore these options further in the future.
Ethical Considerations
One major consideration when working on our project was the eventual commercialization of our product. Questions of business ethics were raised as we got deeper into discussions about the potential applications of our foundational advance. Since the technology we are proposing has a limited number of contenders, if any, we were afforded a decent amount of liberty when deciding in which direction to further develop our idea. For this reason, we turned to experts in the business field to discuss our concerns.
During our meeting with Dr. Nicholas Argyres, the Vernon W. & Marion K. Piper Professor of Strategy at Washington University in St. Louis, we discussed possible strategies for narrowing our search for the best application. Dr. Argyres made an interesting suggestion to assess the commercial viability of each application idea by looking at market sizes and potential tradeoffs. However, he brought up another important consideration to keep in mind when using this approach: the most viable applications might help fewer people than a less viable option that might benefit a greater percentage of the population.
For our team, our goal is to create a product that will have the most effective impact on the greatest number of people. With this in mind, we decided to focus our ideas to applications that directly affect people. However, this decision led to another ethical concern that frequently comes up in the debate around synthetic biology. We would be genetically modifying organisms, specifically E. coli, with the intention of introducing it to the general population.
We brought up this concern when consulting Dr. Lamar Pierce, Professor of Strategy and Faculty Director for Masters of Science in Leadership at Washington University in St. Louis. Dr. Pierce mentioned that there would indeed be potential concerns with the Food and Drug Administration and advised us to provide ample evidence of its safety and efficacy in vitro as well as in humans.  We kept these important considerations of ethics, purpose, and design in mind as we continued our work to ensure that we can make the most desired impact."

Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) iGEM 2013 team has built a fatty acid inducible system that enable inducible glyoxylate shunt to serve as an artificial futile cycle in human liver cells to ultimately increase energy expenditure responding to high circulating fatty acid levels. This can help obesity patients increase expenditure of calories and alleviate health complications such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. To express this futile cycle, genes necessary for the inducible glyoxylate shunt need to be introduced into a human body. Because introducing genes into the human body is currently not a common therapeutic method, we thought it would be necessary to research on the details of how our project could be actually applied. Even though the application of our project may not occur in the near future, we thought it was necessary to evaluate our project’s application as a potential biotechnology product. We have investigated a possible method that is under serious research in the science community: gene therapy. In this article, we will introduce the approach in more detail; examine the bio-safety and bio-ethical issues; and lastly inspect if our project could be applied using this method.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," is a TED-like forum jointly set up by CAS Computer Network Information Center and CAS Science Communication Bureau, inviting elites to share new ideas and discoveries. Its name is the abbreviation respective of Science, Education, Life and Future.
This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

One stop of two of our team members' trip to Cambridge was the MIT. They got to talk to the MIT team to share our projects, ideas and experiences. We learned a lot about each other through this encounter, especially in the area of computational simulation in biology applications.
BostonU
Meeting
As one of our team members was in Boston, he got to check Boston University and this lead him to meet BostonU iGEM. Their project was really interesting and we learned about each others' projects and ideas. We interchanged comments that served us as feedback.

Tarta TUIT
Collaboration
Our team got in contact with Tartu TUIT team and after a few days we had a Skype meeting to get to know each other’s projects and progress. They sent us a poll regarding their sunscreen related project so we could share it here. This allowed them to get a broader look of international opinions rather than just local. They gave us feedback and a few useful tips to improve our project

NCKU_Tainan,2017,Team:NCKU Tainan#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"However, the talent show was definitely tonight's highlight. Every single team have diligently prepared. Team from China shown us many Chinese cultures, including swords performance, Chinese kung fu, Chinese instrument and etc. Team from           Taiwan have a lot of talent too, including guitar, Chinese instrument, fluorescent sticks and etc. Team from Japan performed some high-technique tricks on Kendama, it is really amazing!
This year, our team prepared a dancing performance, Play, a song from one of the most famous female singer from Taiwan. It was mission impossible for us at first, and we really put a lot of efforts in it, the applause and cheering from           audience really make everything worth it. Even though we have some mistake, we hope that everyone still enjoyed our performance tonight! Good Job to everyone!
Day 2
We started the first morning in Asia Pacific Conference with open ceremony and team introduction, each team’s video fully showed their passionate and adorable personality. Our team was going to present in the afternoon, and we were super excited yet nervous           when we stood on the stage, Although we made some mistakes, we still have a great time with the audience, in the Q and A section, the opinion of the audience really inspired us a lot, we felt so thankful for the idea from every iGEMers. We were           so impressed by the presentation of every iGEM team, they show us many creative ideas and critical thinking in different tracks.
In the evening, instead of joining city tour, we enjoyed our time in professor Chen’s laboratory. We have an interesting talk with professor Chen and professor Wu, they shared their experience in leading iGEM team for many years, which           really broaden our horizons. They even have a hallway that hang their team T-shirt from the very first year just like NBA team. Even though we are a little envy about their well-equipped laboratory we understand they didn’t get it for granted.           They have been through their hard time but they didn’t give up and work very hard. Be BRAVE if you want to strive for the success! Let us achieve the target together.
Day 3
We felt so grateful for a day full of knowledge and presentation. The audience are not afraid about expressing their feeling and always caught the key point of the presentation, ask the depth questions. This reminded us that professor Wu once told us           the importance of critical thinking. We hope that we can always remember the deep feeling of attending the conference even we back to the school, it is even better if we can really practice how to ask right question when we are in class.

The methods are very involved and complex, but are very specific for how to prepare substrates.
Create substrate with proteins to be identified and then create conditions so that only very specific bonding can occur. Get rid of elements that do not have a high bond affinity, then un-bond the proteins.
Note: Some one with more biology background might want to take a look at this, as it deals with really specific topics, that I do not have experience with. Also some relevant over-view things were highlighted.

Relevance to iGEM: High
Subjects:
G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)specificity vs. sensitiyity
Directed evolution in GPCRs
Functional expression of heterologous GPCRs in yeast cells
Summary:
The authors took a Human GPCR and used simmilarites between yeast mating response pathways and the human signal transduction pathways to couple a human GPCR to the yeast pheromone respone pathway. They then used  random mutagenesis to create hybrids. Ultimately the hybrids were more sensitive, but had the same specificity for the compounds they sere tested on.

Relevance to iGEM: medium/low
Subjects:
bacterial periplasmic (between the cell wall and cell membrane) binding proteins (bPBPs);
fluorescence;
fusion proteins
Summary:
The authors took bPBPs and did two things to them: they mutated them to change their ligand specificity on a limited scale, and they attached a fluorescent domain to the bPBP so that ligand binding would cause a change in fluorescence without the need for a full signal transduction pathway.
The authors' main focus was on the fluorescence.  We could conce"

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."
