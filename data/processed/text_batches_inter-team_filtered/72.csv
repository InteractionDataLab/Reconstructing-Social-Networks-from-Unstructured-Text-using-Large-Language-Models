Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.
Dynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gomp"

Safety Issues
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
research safety,
public safety,
environmental safety?
During the planning stages of the project, many ideas were abandoned due to safety issues. For example, the original idea of creating xenomorphs via the use of BioBricks and synthetic biology was discontinued due to the risk associated with these highly aggressive, unpredictable, and uncontrollable species, as documented in the records of the Nostromo, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation Terraforming Colony on LV-426, prison planet Fiorin 161, and the Science Vessel USM Auriga, as well as numerous unsubstantiated sources. The idea of bacterial synthesis of opiates was also abandoned due to a number of potential ethical, legal, and social problems, such as losing the ability to enter the United States of America, further destabilizing the countries of Central Asia and South America, and concerns that the criminal element might attempt to acquire this information through violent means. We also made a conscious decision not to work on biosensors of any form, or any other related applications, such that our project would not require the exposure or release of the engineered organism to people or the environment.
Of our final choice in project, we believe that the pairing of light-producing and light-sensing BioBricks does not raise any known safety issues to research, the public, or the environment. On the other hand, the BRIDGE construct might, since it involves directly editing the bacterial genome. While we see this as an"

We are a small group of undergraduate students studying life science with professors as mentors at Stockholm University. This is our website about our work and effort in representing our school as Team Stockholm in the International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition against other teams from all over the world.
iGEM is an international research competition focused on synthetic biology. Each team is given a kit containing biological parts for practical work, which takes place at each teams' university. The use of these biological parts in combination with self-designed parts, will lay the ground for building innovative and useful new biological systems and operate them in living cells.
This competition opens for students to think “out of the box” when engineering living organisms to be applied as tools for solving problems in healthcare, bioenergy, chemical and material production and bioremediation, to name a few.
The principles in the field of synthetic biology is to combine science and engineering in order to genetically design and build living cells with novel biological roles and systems, aimed at overcoming the obstacles in modern life.
Stay tuned for daily updates in the run up to the finals at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)!

Penn_State,2014,Team:Penn State#Biodetox_-_-_TEXT.html," or used as automobile fuel, among other uses. One way to produce biofuels from biomass is by using bacteria to ferment the sugars in plant matter to fuel alcohols. However, the bioenergy industry faces problems converting this inexpensive plant matter into high value fuels. Biomass is tough to break down and requires costly pretreatment processes before it can be converted to fuel. Pretreatment produces toxic byproducts, including furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF), which will kill cell cultures and inhibit the conversion of biomass to usable sugars.
To solve this problem, we intend to engineer bacteria with a recently discovered metabolic pathway that consumes furfural and HMF. Koopman et. al. identified the six enzyme pathway from Cupriavidus basilensis and showed that it functions in Pseudomonas putida.  In C. basilensis or P. putida, HMF can be used as the sole carbon source. Engineering bacteria with this pathway would allow them to survive and produce biofuels but also use the toxic HMF as an energy source. However, this pathway does not function in Esherichia coli is commonly used to manufacture valuable chemicals, including fuels, because it is fast growing, easily manipulated, and well-studied.  Based on our recent experiments, the pathway also does not function in Pseudomonas fluorescens, a microbial relative of P. putida.
The first and foremost objective of our research is to identify the genomic differences that allow the pathway to function in one organism, P. putida, but not E. coli or P. fluorescens.  We will do this using a novel approach, combinatorial dCas9 gene knockdown.  Cas9 is an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease that cleaves DNA at precise locations.  Cas9 binds CRISPR RNAs (clustered regularly spaced short palindromic repeats) in order to bind corresponding DNA sties.  The deactivated form of Cas9, dCas9, contains two mutations that block its endonuclease activity, but it still can stably bind DNA and block transcription.  Gene expression can be lowered 100- to 1000-fold. To carry out combinatorial gene knockdown, we will construct CRISPR RNA libraries containing all possible 3-gene combinations for the 19 target genes we have identified. These libraries and the dCas9 system will be co-transformed into P. putida construct containing the HMF pathway. These colonies will be grown for the furoic acid assay and"
Waterloo,2014,Team:Waterloo#Math Book#sRNA_-_-_TEXT.html," a target protein, our Metabolic Control Analysis focused primarily on how the parameters of the model and affect the steady state concentration of the target protein (in this case YFP). Listed to the right are the Concentration Control Coefficients for the steady state concentration of YFP for each parameter in the model:
The most notable of these are the concentration control coefficients for the following parameters: βM the degradation rate of YFP), αm (the transcription rate of the YFP mRNA transcript). These relatively large flux control coefficient values demonstrate the system is highly sensitive to changes in these variables. Therefore, these would make particularly good choices for synthetic intervention, as they would induce the largest changes on the steady state concentration of YFP. In order for sRNA gene suppression to be most efficient, a minimal amount of YFP-flux through the system is desirable. However, since we want to use this sRNA system to control a protein whose degradation rate and transcription rate that we could not physically change, we need to turn our attention to some other potential confounding factors.
Some other notable concentration control coefficients are αs, αM, K-1. These constants are respectively the rate of transcription of sRNA, the rate constant for translation of YFP, and the rate constant of dissociation of Hfq-sRNa to Hfq and sRNA. These rates have the least impact on the system and are not good targets for optimization of sRNA.
Conclusion
Using parameters from the literature we were able to construct a model of sRNA gene repression in Staphylococcus aureus, using Hfq from E. coli. In the subsequent analysis of the model, the relationships between the expression rate of sRNA, Hfq, and the subsequent steady state concentration of a target protein, YFP, was elucidated.
The model was successful in providing an estimate of the amount of suppression as well as the approximate amount of time until maximum suppression was obtained. Additionally, in the Metabolic Control Analysis, we were able to deduce the best regions of the metabolic pathway to target in order to reduce the steady state concentration of YFP; unfortunately, however, these ended up being parameters outside of our control.
In the end, the model of sRNA repression was able to inform the conjugation model of the magnitude and temporal characteristics of sRNA gene regulation.

When our bacteria is in proximity of Y. entercolitica we want it to express the colicin Fy. Therefore, the Sensing group have been working on a Yen system which will inactivate the promoter that regulates the spot42 when it is close to Y. enterocolitica.
Figure 1. The spot42 system
System design
The aim for the killing group was to design two different constructs - one with a secretion tag and the bacteriocin, colicin Fy, and the other with an sRNA system for inhibition of the toxin when not in proximity of Y. enterocolitica. However, at first we wanted to insert our final construct into Lactobacillus via a shuttle vector. Since Lactobacillus is a probiotic we could use our system in a real scenario if one gets a Y. enterocolitica infection in the gut. The final construct would consist of J23106-B0034-USP45-CFY and a construct for the sRNA spot42. The sRNA spot42 already includes a promoter.
Two different secretion tags were used. PelB for E. coli and USP45 for both Lactobacillus and E. coli. Two Anderson promoters were chosen, J23106 (strong) and J23116 (weak) for the colicin Fy because we wanted to find a balance, where E. coli would not die from stress (due to too high expression) or its self-produced toxin. In order to characterize our colicin Fy we wanted to purify our sample so we could see the protein on an SDS-page. To do this, a His-Tag was required for an IMAC column purification. Therefore we also built the constructs with a 6x His-Tag.
We designed the colicin Fy according to the Freiburg assembly standard, biobrick 25. This would allow us to fuse our protein with the secretion tag without having to consider the stop codon from the scar of SpeI and XbaI from the biobrick 10 standard.
Silencing RNA system design
The silencing RNA system or sRNA system was also one of the primary aims for the killing group. We designed and modified the sRNA system from Team Uppsala iGEM 2012, called spot42. The spot42 was redesigned to sense our USP45 sequence and bind to it. We call our modified part, Spot42_US"

Biofair
As a part of human practices, we had conducted a small science fair and a social awareness campaign called the Biofair in a local park in collaboration with Team REC_CHENNAI.This was necessary to dispose the common misconception amongst the people that genetically modified organisms are generally harmful and hence their products should not be released in the market. To do so we put up a stall and interacted with the public about the pros and cons of GMOs and how rDNA technology can be used to produce safe GM products.At the end of the day we asked them to fill out a survey form, the results of which are shown in the pie chart below
In addition to  this, we explained about iGEM , synthetic biology and our previous iGEM project with the help of charts to illustrate an example of how a real life problem can be solved using synthetic biology. A large faction of the people who visited our stall was children. We also conducted simple and interesting  science experiments. It was a very fun filled evening and we were able to reach out to a large number of people and also managed to bust some of the common myths about GMO’s.
Schools
Human practices is a key component and the most exciting part of any iGEM project where teams consider the many ways that their research can impact society.One of the most efficient ways of spreading knowledge is by teaching. Hence we decided to visit some schools in our locality to teach the students about the field of synthetic biology and how iGEM plays a major role in promoting this field.
At first we visited Bonne Nehru Higher Secondary School where we taught the students about the basics of microbiology and molecular biology. This sparked their interest in the subject and they were very eager to learn more about it. Therefore, we also organized an one day workshop at our institution to teach them simple  microbiology techniques.
Next we went to Sri Vivekananda Matric and Higher Secondary School where we taught simple synthetic biology concepts  to high school students.To make the session more"

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment"

La biologie synthétique a le pouvoir de changer certains paradigmes de notre société tel que notre conception du statut des êtres vivants.
Si nous privons des bactéries de leurs fonctions ""inutiles"" pour qu'elles produisent ce dont nous avons besoin, peut-on toujours les considérer comme des organismes vivants ou sont-elles devenues des machines ?
Pour aborder cette question, nous avons adopté une approche artistique car nous pensons que le Bio-Art est l'un des meilleurs moyens de susciter des débats avec les citoyens. Nous avons créé un organisme-concept qui pourrait refléter ces interrogations : nous avons modifié Escherichia coli pour qu'elle produise une odeur de citron et aussi simuler son processus de maturation. Un mélange de bactéries et de milieu de croissance sera coulé dans un moule qui  sentira, mûrira et ressemblera à un citron. Mais ""ceci n'est pas un citron""- ou cela l'est-il ? Avec notre réalisation nous lançons une invitation à la réflexion sur les futures opportunités et limites éthiques de la conception d’êtres vivants.

Imperial,2014,Team:Imperial#The i in iGEM_-_-_TEXT.html," English Proficiency index, while Japan falls 26th out of 60 (EF English Proficiency Index 2014).
The Language
Another dimension of the inter-nationality of iGEM is the different languages represented in the competition. In the last 5 years, at least 20 different languages are represented. The usual, widely spoken internationally, are English, Mandarin, Spanish, German and French, while some less widely spoken languages, such as Finnish, Kazakh, Nepalese and Hungarian have made appearances.
The dominant language of the competition is English, with about 40% of the participants coming from English-speaking universities. That means that 60% of the participants come from different lingual backgrounds. The second greatest presence is Mandarin (spoken by Chinese and Taiwanese teams) and there is a strong presence of Romance and Germanic languages (Spanish, French, German, Dutch), coming from the European and Latin American participants.
Insight into the finalists
We had a chance to speak to all but two of the non-English speaking finalists in order to get a better insight into the challenges of the language barrier. The overwhelming majority of the successful European teams (examples include Paris Bettencourt, Groningen, Bielefeld and TU Delft) have noted that their teams include many international students. Classes are taught in both the language native to their university and English, with students offered a choice on the language of their thesis or having to write in English (Valencia). In cases where courses were not taught in English (Bielefeld), seminars that included both home and international students where Anglophone. Additionally, due to the composition of their research labs in some certain cases communication between the team members is in English. Speaking with a former member of a past team of Slovenia gave us quite a different picture compared to the rest of the European teams. As explained to us, the team was made purely of home students with Slovenian being the language of communication within the team. The majority of the material at their university has been taught in their native language, although the teaching material was in English, exposing the students in English scientific writing. Additionally, their advisors where all Slovenian PhD students that carried the majority of their studies in the native country. It needs to be noted though that when asked, that the team members were able to communicate their projects in English with ease. That could possibly be explained by Slovenia’s high ranking in the PE English Proficiency Index (10th place).
When we spoke to the Asian teams, they painted a different picture. The teams are composed exclusively by home students (in the case of ZJU"

J: If we are to use GMOs, this might be contributing to the life sciences sector in general. Therefore, we wanted to ask you how, currently, the life sciences sector is contributing to the Scottish economy, and also what the aims are of the SNP regarding the life sciences and synthetic biology sectors. Does it want to enhance it or what kind of support would be given, if any?
JE: The Scottish government is committed to promoting sustainable economic growth across a range of sectors, of which the life sciences is one. The ambition for Scotland is to grow the sector over time. It has been identified as an area for future expansion and economic growth. The economic footprint that life sciences represent is significant in Scotland. If you take even just one section of it, the ‘pharma’ related business in Scotland, which isn’t just pharmaceuticals, but also contract research organisations that are doing clinical trials and biopharmaceutical companies who are doing early stage research. That part of the sector alone would have a significant economic footprint of, I would reckon, about 3-4 billion pounds, and around six thousand jobs, although you would need to check that. That’s just one snapshot of the economic contribution. I think, more generally, we have got medical devices, and we have got medical diagnostics. All of that together is creating a hub of activity. I’m just trying to think of some examples of that. The American pharmaceutical company, called Wyeth, which is now part of Pfizer, they made an investment into Scotland. I think, between themselves and the Scottish entrepreneurs, the Economic Development Agency in Scotland, the total investment was something like 34 million pounds. 50% of that came from Scottish enterprise, 50% came from the company. What that investment was designed to do was to bring together the NHS [National Health Service], the Universities and industry, to fund research into a number of disease therapy areas, where there is a need for new treatments. That involved the four medical schools, the Universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen…
J: So the major universities in Scotland.
JE: It involved the geographical health boards in those areas, bringing all that together. As the research progressed, the universities would receive milestone payments for the research. That’s perhaps an illustration that you can do very good research but you have to be able to commercialise it. And if you’re taking products to the market then you need the industry input to"

The first operon is regulated by tetracycline induced promoter Ptet and acts on Zymomonas mobilis's amino acid biosynthetic pathway to divert pyruvate to the amino acid intermediates. The second operon is regulated by constitutive strong promoter Peno or Pgap to enhance the expression of kdcA to decarboxylate 2-keto acids to aldehydes and further divert it to isobutanol by Zymomonas mobilis's own alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) This part is a isobutanol production module constructed in non-model organism Zymomonas mobilis and expected to be suitable for other microorganisms.

Collaborations
The depth of study in contemporary science has meant that an individual or team’s knowledge ‘base’ is becoming increasingly more specialised. As a result, no individual team or person can tackle problems in the most efficient way on their own – and so it is collaborative efforts between teams that pave the way for scientific progress. International collaboration is particularly valuable, as it exposes teams to completely new ways of thinking about a problem. We, the UNSW iGEM team, want to sincerely thank all our collaborators – you have all made us think about our ‘problem’ in new ways.

Athens
Team Visit
A member of our UNSW team also met with the NTUA (Athens) team between the 16th and 20th of July in Athens. The Athens team gave us a tour of their workspace at the Athenian Pasteur Institute, where we shared protocols and techniques regarding staining using Ethidium bromide in protein gel electrophoresis, as well as their unique method of casting agarose gels. Furthermore, during our meetings we discussed potential issues we may have with our project such as the covalent of the prefoldin to the enzyme with the Tag and Catcher mechanism may chemically alter the enzyme thus inhibiting action. After further research, this was dismissed due to previous literature on the Tag and Catcher systems proving otherwise. After this visit, there was continual discussion online, with the teams sharing relevant papers and international grant opportunities they had found. We provided suggestions to help them with expressing proteins.
Paris Bettencourt
Project and Modelling Collaboration
We reached out to Paris Bettencourt after discovering that their project also involved enzyme scaffolding, keen to discuss the ideas and issues with our projects. We spoke with Paris Bettencourt over Skype on the 11th of July and both teams made helpful suggestions for the other’s project extension. We also discussed the types of models we planned to use with our scaffolds. Bettencourt asked for project"

We have succesfully constructed the modeling of project of USTC 2009 iGEM team. Due to various reasons, the result will be shown in our final release of our software as a demo. This work could perfectly illustrate the features of our software. It include many novel biological process, such as  quorem sensing, multi-compartment, and cell killing to death. There are more than 100 reactions in total, which is almost impossible to model manually, which, in turns, shows great power of our software.
To have a first look, we provide a screenshot of the results about single compartment which contains plasmid (shown as below)

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Centre of Delft is the perfect place. The museum turns the Delft University of Technology inside out and allows you to see the role technology and science plays in society. The Science Center invites the public to participate and contribute to its development.
This year the newest addition to the exhibition of the Science Centre will be our 3D printer   completely made out of K’NEX. This printer is quite special, because it is an exact copy of the K’NEX   3D printer we used for printing with bacteria. Since the original has been in contact with bacteria, we   decided to make an exact replica. The other objects of the exhibition are also result of years of   research, teaching, graduation assignments and competitions entered by TU Delft students and   scientists.
In the spirit  of the Science Centre, we want to inspire children by letting them design their own imaginary bacterium through their own creativity. In order to achieve this, we set up a workshop about synthetic biology. We designed the workshop in such a way that every future iGEM team could use our format if they want to.
If you are interested in our workshop design, please send an email to M.Post@student.tudelft.nl or M.vanderDoes@student.tudelft.nl

The Future Plan
We strongly hope to popularize and transform our achievements in lab, and benefit more fish farmers in China and even the world. In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.

SCRaMbLE: Improve Resistance to Heavy Metal Ions
OVERVIEW
After doing relevant literature reading, we found that yeast’s tolerance level of ambient copper and cadmium ions has a threshold concentration, approximately 3mM and 0.5mM in SC culture media respectively.
In order to increase yeast strains’ inherent tolerance of copper or/and cadmium ions in their growing environment, we used this cutting-edge biological technology—SCRaMbLE, which stands for Synthetic Chromosome Rearrangement and Modification by Loxpsym-mediated Evolution, to obtain yeast strain with better tolerance to heavy metal ions .[1].
We constructed three yeast strains namely 079, 160, and 085. They all have a plasmid containing the CRE-EBD sequence and different nutritional labels[2]. 079 and 160 strains have a URA3 label, 085 strain has a HIS label. After proper induction and screening, we successfully obtained mutated 079, 085 and 160 strains that have a manifest growing advantage over control groups when cultured in SC solid media which contain 0.14 mM cadmium ions or 4.8 mM copper ions. We named those mutated strains with increased tolerance capacity of cadmium ions S1, S2, S3, and S4, and as for copper, S5, S6, S7, and S8.
In order to characterize their increased tolerance of copper or/and cadmium ions, we designed and conducted"

Our modified toxins did not display the desired effect in the lysis experiment, or when the growth curves where analysed. However, we believe that this may be due to the fact that the Ssp1 and Ssp2 warheads may not be compatible with our construct. Ssp1 and Ssp2 are very small proteins and therefore may not work well when attached to our large truncated colicins. However, the beauty of our concept is that warheads can be readily added to the colicins, therefore different combinations can easily be assembled in order to achieve the desired result. In future we would plan to characterise the toxicity of a purified version of our colicin. As a next step we would like to clone a predicted pore forming warhead (POW) onto colicin Ia. POW is believed to have homology with colicin Ia and therefore may be more likely to work.

We were able to narrow the focus of our project by concentrating on producing overexpressed antibodies that could be secreted and purified easily. By allowing simplified antibody purification, we could make improvements in the time it takes to go from demand to detection. This method seeks to go beyond the bench by allowing others in both academia and industry to obtain complexly folded proteins easily. This collaboration with Covance also guided our Economic Analysis, as we sought to determine the major limitations of antibody production in the biopharmaceutical market.
Public Health Implications
Salmonella, the cause of gastroenteritis, poses potential risks of mild to life threatening infections.  In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that food-borne Salmonella infections cause 1.2 million illnesses yearly, with more than 23,000 hospitalizations and 450 deaths.  The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimated that Salmonella cost the nation about $2.65 billion a year [3]. Consequently, detecting and treating pathogenic Salmonella is important to food and health industries [1].
Environmental samples, food products, and organisms are all tested for Salmonella.  Current detection methods require culturing samples on selective media for preliminary identification that must later be confirmed using biochemical and serological testing.  Biochemical indicators include fermentation of glucose, negative urease reaction, lysine decarboxylase, negative indole test, hydrogen sulfide production, and fermentation of dulcitol.  Serotyping examines for flagellar (H) and somatic (O) antigens.  Salmonella can also be detected using an ELISA, where the Salmonella antigen is immobilized, bound with specific antibodies, and washed to remove any proteins or other bound antibodies.  The result is a visible signal that quantifies the amount of Salmonella antigen present [2].  The cost of the antibodies required in an ELISA can be reduced by using our OsmY purification system.

However the Bacillus subtilis on this plate contains NO pGFP-rrnB DNA; instead it contains water (also added at a later stage). As it contains NO pGFP-rrnB DNA, there shouldn't be any growth on this plate because untransformed B subtilis doesn't have resistance to chloramphenicol. If there is growth then the Bacillus cells might have inherited the resistance randomly. Hence this plate confirms that only transformed Bacillus subtilis can become resistant to chloramphenicol.
Plates 3 and 4 are LB + chloramphenicol plates which contains overnight solution from tube 1 plus the other solutions added during the transformation process (including more MM competence medium and starvation medium). Not only does it contain Bacillus subtilis cells but it ALSO contains the pGFP-rrnB DNA. If the Bacillus cells have become transformed by pGFP-rrnB then they should grow on chloramphenicol plates as they should have acquired appropriate resistance. On plate 3 50 microlitres of the competent culture was added where as on plate 4, 200 microlitres of the competent cultures were added. These varying concentrations just mean that there should be different amounts of colonies on both plates. Hence these plates confirm whether the Bacillus subtilis cells have been transformed by pGFP-rrnB on the basis of chloramphenicol resistance.

Mission Statement
We at fishPHARM believe sustainable and efficient aquaculture is one of the best ways of providing a growing global population with the food it needs to thrive. The overuse of antibiotics on today’s fish farms is detrimental to both the consumer and the aquaculture industry. Outbreaks of bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD) and lack of efficient preventative monitoring systems are real issues that affect the productivity of fish farmers today. We make it our mission to produce antibiotic-free treatments for BCWD, design and manufacture effective and safe drug delivery methods for aquacultured fish, and design and manufacture farm monitoring systems for the purpose of disease prevention and general fish well-being. With these initiatives, fishPHARM will help aquaculture around the globe attain a more sustainable position for food production.
Project Overview
Cornell University is situated in the heart of the Finger Lakes region of Upstate New York where a diverse array of salmonid fish call home. Unfortunately, the region has been impacted by a series of bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD) outbreaks, severely reducing the number of fish available for recreational fishing and local aquaculture. BCWD is a potentially lethal bacterial infection of salmonid fish species caused by the pathogen Flavobacterium psychrophilum. Fish suffering from BCWD develop skin lesions that effectively renders the fish inedible and unviable. The disease is not only found in Upstate New York, but also has been cited in other fish farms and hatcheries where fish are raised in close quarters. In fact, other American fish farms have reported instances in which over 30-45% of trout raised have been lost due to BCWD [1]. The grave economic and agricultural consequences of BCWD are unresolved by current means of treatment consisting of antibiotics. This year, Cornell iGEM has developed fishPHARM: a comprehensive prevention and treatment plan that uses the tools of synthetic biology to combat BCWD.

Escherichia coli DH5α Electroporation transformation protocol
In this protocol we make electrocompetent cells and then transform them. This protocol is based on the Eppendorf application note for Escherichia coli DH5α.
Most of this protocol is supposed to be done between 2 and 4C, so its important to prepare the items and move quite quickly through the steps.

Step 1) Take 2 new/sterile 50ml  falcon tubes and add to each 10ml of sterile LB broth.
(there is usually an autoclaved 1 L duran flask of LB in the fridge, use 20ml from that and transfer to tubes under the flow hood)
Step 2) inoculate the 2 falcon tubes from DH5α stock using a flamed loop.
Step 3)  Incubate at 37 °C with shaking overnight, or for 8 hours
Step 4) It should look something like this

Put required items on ice
The cells need to be kept cold during the procedure. Therefore the cuvettes and falcon tubes should be placed in the cold store of the freezer before starting;
It is also useful to have ice cold RO water, chill before starting

Saftey
Biosafety is probably the most controversial issue in synthetic biology. Being responsible to everyone, 2015 XJTLU team took variety of measurements to promote the safety in the lab. We reached an agreement and drafted a lab policy. We used low hazard strains to minimize the potential risks of our project.
Policy
(Sorry for only Chinese version.)
The policy not only includes the main clauses in safety guideline of laboratory but also add a few special requirements as well as some tips. For instance, “having a good mood” is documented as the top one because keeping your mind clean, clear, positive and free is usually a good way to ensure the correctness and safety of experiments. In order to guarantee the implementation of the policy, we chose one of our team members as a supervisor.

← Interviews Industry Interviews →
Initially, the goal of our policy interviews were to understand how our biocontainment  method might fit into the current framework of legislation and regulation. However, we soon discovered  that the current institutions and policy did not allow for a comprehensive regulation of synthetic biology,  using biocontainment, decreasing the barriers to implementation. Many of these interviews inspired,  informed, and refined many of our deliverables, including the iGEM pamphlet, policy proposal, and the  Open Bio Labs safety guidelines. Many of the concerns expressed by these individuals, both scientific and  ethical, also affected the design of our biocontainment method and the experiments we decided to run.  Lastly, many of these experts cited an expressed need for effective and cheap biocontainment in order to  further advance the field through policy.
Hank Greely
We interviewed Hank Greely, Professor of Genetics at Stanford School of  Medicine, early on in our summer of research. As our first interview, we didn’t have a  clear or succinct idea of what we wanted to take away from talking to professionals  about our project, but we did know we wanted to make a difference in the area of  synthetic biology policy. More specifically, we wanted biological containment to be a  topic that was discussed more frequently in the scientific community because we believe  that a lack of clear biocontainment guidelines and regulations hinders the expansion of  the field. We also wanted to gain feedback on our project while we were still in the early  stages of planning our experimental design.
During the interview, we asked him several questions about his opinions on the  Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues and its relevance to modern  synthetic biology.  He believes that changes will need to be made in the near future, but  he does not believe that change will occur to the coordinated framework until the first  large problem occurs. With this approach, the government is avoiding exactly what they  started the Presidential Commission for: to prevent problems from occurring by  addressing possible concerns before the technology is actually accessible. The idea was  to stay ahead of the new biotechnology, but he was led to believe that this would not be  the case.
Next, we asked him about biocontain"
Tianjin,2018,Team:Tianjin#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"acterial, instead use the yeast two-hybrid system to characterize the KaiABC circadian clock system.
We selected three pairs of periodically binding proteins, KaiC-SasA, KaiC-CikA, and KaiB-KaiC, as the ""prey"" and ""bait"" of the yeast two-hybrid system, respectively, to construct fusion proteins with activation domain(AD) or DNA binding domain(BD) of Gal4 protein. Taking for example the KaiC-SasA couple, we assembled three gene expression cassettes of KaiA, KaiB, and AD-KaiC onto the pRS413 plasmid named pABaC, and assembled other three gene expression cassettes of CikA, RpaA and BD-SasA onto the pRS415 plasmid named pCiRbS. Other plasmids involved were pbCiRS (the recombinant pRS415 containing cassettes of BD-CikA, RpaA, SasA), pbCRCi (the recombinant pRS413 containing cassettes of BD-KaiC, RpaA, CikA), paBAS (the recombinant pRS415 containing cassettes of AD-KaiB, KaiA, SasA). When the two plasmids are successfully expressed in yeast, that is to say, when the KaiABC circadian clock system successfully operates, KaiA binds to the CII subunit of KaiC during the subjective daytime, stimulating the autokinase activity of the CII subunit, resulting in the phosphorylation of CII subunit. Residues Ser431 and Thr432 are phosphorylated in turn, during which SasA binds to phosphorylated KaiC,  allowing AD and BD to be spatially close enough to activate the promoters Gal1 promoter, Gal2 promoter that regulate downstream genes. When KaiC phosphorylation is complete, the KaiC protein undergoes loop stacking, which causes the binding site of KaiA to be blocked and the binding site of KaiB to be exposed. At the same time, KaiA detaches from KaiC, and KaiB binds to KaiC, stimulating its dephosphorylation. KaiB has a competitive relationship with SasA, which means that SasA falls off from KaiC, causing AD and BD to move away from each other and the related downstream genes not to be started.
In the experiment, we have used the restriction enzyme ligation method, Gibson assembly method and yeast homologous recombination method successively to construct the plasmids mentioned before. Since"
USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#model features_-_-_TEXT.html," inducer. So its properties are changed, and it is not the original promoter any more. This is an example where binding changes the properties of node. Since we do not store all the possible property alterations within one part, the solution is to replace the old part with a new part that stores the correct properties.
Available nodes can be both a part on a chain or a node of binding site, which leaves a lot of possibilities in constructing complicated binding structure. Again, there are no restrictions, but parts of compartments are not suggested to appear in a binding structure.
The Basic Assumption
The basic assumption of Chain-Node Model is that a part ALWAYS carries its properties wherever it is placed in an instance of Chain-Node Model. This means no matter how complicated the complex is, you can always keep track of the location and properties of every single part. By letting complex inherits its parts’ properties, the assumption saves modelers from rewriting the structure and function of each new complex. However, we should address that the assumption is not suitable for all circumstances. For example, under this assumption, a fusion protein will carry the properties of the fused proteins, which is not true in many cases. A fusion protein may not remain its old properties and even have new properties that none of the original parts have. In this case, our suggestion is to define the fusion protein as a new part. So it is suggested that users choose different strategies of describing the same thing in Chain-Node Model base on different situations, instead of modeling everything in the same way.
Examples
With great power there must come great responsibility. In order to use the powerful Chain-Node Model correctly, please have a look at a few examples we presents.
Example of a species: E.coli cell
In MoDeL, the cell of E.coli is described as a species with only one part of E.coli(see Figure 1). Since the concept of part has been extended greatly, living cells can be described in the same way other species. Compartment belongs to “Non-sequence”, so it is suggested that E.coli only exists as a one-part-species.

Example of a species: pLacI*:LacI4 and its tree structure of binding.
Here is another example of template species with more complicated structure.(see Figure 2) In biology, LacI tetramer (or LacI4) can bind with promoter pLacI as a repressor. When bond with LacI4, pLacI is repressed and its transcription"

we have only made a deep research on genetic engineered bacteria with copper bio-senso coupling ribB which can produce riboflavin when added copper in MFC anode medium. As for parts with other ion sensor, we just made them to be the formation of Biobrick.
3.
In our study, we've designed a novel MFC system. For anode strain, we've cloned a copper sensor sequence coupling with ribB into E.coli BL 21. The genetically modified bacteria is able to detect Cu 2+ and produce riboflavin to boost electrical generation. As a result, MFC peak voltage can reflect Cu2+ concentration. Phosphate Buffer'PBS'with 100 mmol/L potassium ferricyanide was packed into cathode chamber.
We aimed to build a quantitative monitor system of Cu2+ via measuring peak voltage, and finally found the interralationship between peak voltage and Cu2+ concentration. We concluded an empirical formula for our devices:
Peak voltage in MFC as genetically modified E.coli were treated with different amount of Cu2+.
We can deduce the concentration of Cu2+ in water by measuring peak voltage in MFC.
In a range of copper's low-concentration, the peak voltage rose with the increase of concentration of Cu2+. However, because of toxic effects of heavy metal to bacterium, when the copper content in water is over a certain concentration (about 2 mg/L) the peak voltage decreased as the concentration rises.

Following a 45 second heat-shock at 42O, cells were then placed on ice for 5 minutes and then combined with 1 mL of LB broth followed by incubation at 37OC for 1 hour. 100uL of each reaction was then plated on LB agar plates containing kanamycin. Plates were incubated overnight upside-down at 37OC.
Plasmid recovery and gel analysis:
For gel analysis of Cld-containing plasmid candidates, 3 white colonies were selected from the each of the Cld(SP-) and Cld(SP+) plates to inoculate overnight cultures. Next day, Plasmids were mini-prepped from 2 mL of each culture using the QIAprep Miniprep protocol (QIAGEN). The purity and dsDNA concentrations of the extracted plasmid samples were assessed  by spectrophotometry (NanoDrop).
For gel analysis 5uL of each miniprep was digested for 1 hour at 37OC with 1U (0.1uL) of Bsa in a 20 uL reaction containing Cut Smart buffer (1x). 4uL of load buffer was added and 10uL of each was loaded onto a Tris-acetate 1% agarose gel. Gene Ruler 1KB ladder (Thermo) was used as the molecular size standards. The gel was then stained with ethidium bromide and the photographed on a UV light box.
Gene Sequences:
We obtained our gene sequences for Cld(SP+) and Cld(SP-) from the Arizona State University Collegiate iGEM team. We provided them with both our expression plasmids in addition to primers designed to sequence the forward and reverse strands of each gene cassette. The sequence we obtained the Cld(SP-) forward strand as shown below precisely matched our designed G-Block sequence detailed in Gene Design .  In two independent sequencing reactions (Shown below, Fig. 5;  Seq-4 and Seq-5). The reverse strand sequence was of poorer quality and is not displayed. By comparison, the sequence of Cld(SP+) showed a single G to T substation corresponding to an Ala to Ser substitution at position 78 of the polypeptide chain (not shown). Based on our subsequent observation that Cld(SP+) protein was non-functional, it was not submitted to the registry.

Provided there is an increasing demand for enzymes in global market, it is safe to say there is also an increasing demand for protein engineering solutions. Also, the global protein engineering market is expected to reach $3.09 billion by 2025, according to a 2017 report by Grand View Research.
Our solution
Our team is ready to take the first steps into the new era of enzyme engineering. We believe we can accelerate the creation of novel enzymes immensely by:
Using our CAT-Seq technology to immensely advance the pace of novel catalytic biomolecule by enabling the swift exploration of sequence-function space.
Applying the vast sequence-function data to our developed Reaction Generative Adversarial Networks in order to accurately predict novel enzyme activities.
We have achieved the proof of concept of our project, therefore we already have a strong starting point from which can seek further research and development improvement.
With our proposed solution we can specialize in two main areas:
1. Unique enzymatic product development for a particular company. For example, this may be a fully finished and optimized single or multiple enzyme solution. After the product development is finished, customer would receive full development process information and appropriate enzyme sequences.
2. Service-type business solution. Companies which require optimization of their currently used product synthesis route or fundamental enzyme or enzymatic pathway research would have the possibility to buy this type of service from us.
Startup Competition by Agency for Science, Innovation and Technology
In spring, Agency for Science, Innovation and Technology (MITA) in Lithuania has held a startup competition called “Searching For Innovators”. We have participated in this competition with our CAT-Seq and ReactionGAN systems. Of course, at spring our project was in design stages, yet the motivation and ideas we had on how we could solve the current problems of novel biological part creation has left the judges a huge impression.
For this reason, we have Won the “Searching for Innovators” competition! The prize was a year long support in the from of active Mentoring. MITA will now help us establish a business, consult us in the topics of business strategy, finance, marketing and other.
That said, a high-technology startup that we plan to become after the iGEM competition would most benefit from accelerating in the international startup accelerators in hubs that are focused around Life Sciences and Biotechnology, and that is what we plan to do after the iGEM!

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM"

Figure ??shows the multiple sequence alignment of the seven synthetic T-domains and the native indC T-domain.  After the generation of the T-domain amino acid sequences, the OPTIMIZER web-tool( http://genomes.urv.es/OPTIMIZER/ ) was used to obtain the corresponding DNA sequence. E. coli K-12 was set as strain for codon optimization and most frequent was chosen as codon option. The generated DNA sequence was cured from internal RFC10 cutting sites and CPEC cloning overhang required for the T-domain swapping into the ccdb construct were introduced. The synthetic T-domains were ordered at IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, Iowa). In order to obtain sufficient amounts of DNA, the synthetic T-domains were amplified via PCR.  IndC-hybrid constructs of the native IndC with exchange of the native T-domain by the synthetic variants were assembled using CPEC and the indC-ccdB construct as backbone. The synthetic T-domains were amplified for CPEC using the same primers as for the native indC T-domain.
Table 4: Overview of primers that MAY be utilized for backbone linearization: The reverse primers (rv) differ in the ribosomal binding sites they introduce: BBa_J04450_B0034-RBS_ATG_rv contains the ribosomal binding site B0034, BBa_J04450_B0029-RBS_ATG_rv introduces the ribosomal binding site B0029 which is weaker than B0034. Note that the 5' overhangs (underlined) of the reverse primers (rv) already include the start codon (depicted in bold) of the coding sequence to be introduced as insert into the corresponding backbone. The resulting expression cassette will be driven by the Plac promoter (R0010).

Figure 3 Test for the surface display efficiency of autotransporter.
A, the fluorescence of intracellular expression of mEos and surface display of mEos via autotransporter before and after cell lysis. B, the fluorescence of intracellular expression of mEos and surface display of mEos via autotransporter under the super-resolution microscopy(型号). Arrows: dotted distribution pattern of surface displayed mEos
In the cell lysis experiment we firstly adjusted the OD600 of all the interest overnight cultured bacteria to 1.0 and then lysed the cells using Ultrasonic Cell Disruptor. The results (fig.1A, 2A, 3A) showed that after cell lysis followed by centrifuge, both the precipitation and supernatant shows relative strong fluorescence signal in intracellular expressing GFP or mEos cells, while the signal was stronger in supernatant than in precipitation in surface displaying GFP or mEos cells. To further confirm this result, we removed the supernatant and observed that the signal in fluorescent protein surface displayed cell fragments was stronger than or the same as the intracellular expressed ones. This suggests that the surface displayed fluorescent protein were anchored to the outer membrane and being precipitated with the cell fragment, while the intracellular expressed fluorescent protein were solved in the supernatant.
From the microscopy examination(fig.1B, 2B, 3B) we can see that the intracellular expression of GFP or mEos displayed the rode-shape of E.coli, while the signal of surface displayed GFP or mEos showed the dotted pattern around the cells(as the arrows indicated), which suggests that the fluorescent protein was gathered and distributed at the surface of E.coli. Comparing the three kinds of surface display system we found that autotransporter showed the best potential of surface display among the three under the current construction(fig1,2,3).
From the autotranspoter surface display system, we found several interesting phenomes. One is that the longer and bigger the bacteria are, the more obviously the dotted distribution pattern around the bacteria could be seen(fig.4). One explanation was that the long bacteria have bigger surface area to let the displayed fluorescent protein depart from each other, while in the small bacteria, the surface displayed fluorescent protein were too crowded to show the dotted pattern. Another explanation could be that the long bacteria is more mature than the small one. In the small bacteria, the fluorescent protein was just generated but not transported to"

Using principles from statistical mechanics, we developed a completely new enzyme reaction function and simulated the breakdown process in a way that correlated with our wet lab results.
Our model allows us to take a look at the mechanism of this enzyme and gain insight into the reactions which eventually break down DHT.
For more information about our models, click here .
What’s next?
Our plans in the future consist of examining our product on model mice for androgenic alopecia (male pattern baldness) as a proof of concept. We would like to utilize this model to prove that our combined solution for this condition can actually show results (in-vivo). If this succeeds, we will continue on to perform human trials.
We strive to open a standalone startup which will take our concepts forward.
We also believe that our new application of utilizing the human microbiome (genetically modify it for a specific cause ) is a promising new way to treat different conditions.

Through these events we have met many contacts. At the ETEB, AITF, OSLI, and BioAlberta events we met numerous industry contacts that have been essential in spreading the word about our small startup. We also met professionals in law, business structure, marketing, and intellectual property through the SynBioBeta and Banff Venture Forum that have been essential in getting us to the stage we are at now. Presenting our technology at the SB 6.0 conference was an amazing opportunity for our group to gain some validation of our ideas, and the positive feedback we received there was invaluable.
Biological Safety and Containment
Through conversations with industry in both 2012 and 2013, we’ve realized that safety and biological containment for our product will be a big priority if we want to see it adopted. Many investors and potential end-users had significant concerns about how we would ensure that our organism does not enter the environment. Although our final product makes use of a closed chamber where samples are injected, preventing our organism from entering the environment, there were still concerns that we would need to implement additional layers of security.  As such, we have designed several different components of containment in order to minimize any chance that our organism could ever escape. Through our work in 2012 , we have developed multiple ‘killswitch’ mechanisms. These include restriction enzyme based mechanisms as well as auxotrophy-based systems. As well as these measures, our system is designed such that there is only an applicator to the system, making use of a one-way valve. This makes the organism inside inaccessible to both the user and the environment. This"
Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," the function of the protein. As we performed the SAMURAI method, we encountered some problems, troubleshooted these and found solutions. Our main problem was the annealing temperature of the oligos introducing the mutations in PCR. After increasing this temperature, everything worked perfectly. We had now created a mutated version of the original BioBrick (BBa_I13502), compatible with all RFC assembly standards. We named this BioBrick BBa_K2835000 . This part was ligated into the plasmid pSB1C3 by making use of the restriction sites in the BioBrick prefix and suffix (EcoRI and PstI). Transformation into TOP10 E.coli followed, whereby colony PCR showed the expected size of the SAMURAI insert in two out of four colonies (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Agarose gel showing the products from the colony PCR. Colony 1 and 2 have a SAMURAI insert of the same size as the original BioBrick BBa_I13502 (WT in the figure), which is expected after a successful SAMURAI procedure. Colony 3a and 3b do not contain a SAMURAI insert.
To express the SAMURAI product and prove that our mutations did not affect the protein function of mRFP1, we assembled our improved BioBrick with a strong constitutive promoter, BBa_J23119 (designed by team Berkeley 2006). The same assembly was performed with the original BioBrick (BBa_I13502) for experimental comparison. After several failed attempts to accomplish this with 3A assembly, we decided to try out a different approach. Instead of trying to assemble three different parts, as in 3A assembly, we simply PCR amplified our improved BioBrick and ligated this PCR product (digested with XbaI and PstI) into a pSB1C3 vector from the Distribution Kit already carrying the chosen promoter (BioBrick BBa_J23119) (digested with SpeI and PstI). The following transformation resulted in red colonies on the first try, with the red color indicating a successful expression and assembly. See our lab book for a more detailed workflow.

High probabilities of pollution in the medium.
How to use Arabidopsis thaliana?
Successful germination and plant growth requires appropriate soil moisture, nutrient levels, light intensity, humidity, and temperature. If any of these are compromised, A. thaliana will respond by flowering early and dying prematurely and producing little leaf mass for experiments. The plants can also be stressed by overcrowding, fungus infestation, or insect infestation. All these factors must be conscientiously monitored to ensure reliable data obtained from experiments using these plants. Maintenance of soil moisture is imperative for successful seed germination.
The optimal temperature for plant growth is 25°C, with lower temperatures being allowable;"
WPI_Worcester,2016,Team:WPI Worcester#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," silencing of other genes if the targeting sequence of system is mutated, causing further potential problems with the cell.6 The last stage kill switch that could be applied can be best described as a scorched earth policy and should only be considered if the DNA being added to the target cells results in the development in cancerous cells. The kill switch could code for membrane proteins that signal the host's immune system to target the infected cell for apoptosis, or produce ion channels that disrupt chloride ion levels in the cells, causing their death.7 This kill switch could cause the affected cells to die before any life threatening conditions occur. The most notable downside to this kill switch is that, if the kill switch DNA gets added to non-target cells, then it will cause unwanted cell death in cells that could cause serious harm to the patient.
Another option to address a cancer type mutation in the target cell DNA, is the use of a marker. By including a section of DNA that produces an extremely small amounts of GFP or another biomarker, if the cells become cancerous and are mass producing proteins, the heightened levels of biomarker could both indicate the presence of a problem and indicate which cells are cancerous. The downside to this concept is that, the biomarker would have to be added to a section of DNA known to be over expressed in cancer cells for it to function as a cancer marker. Additionally, if the marker gene is overexpressed due to some other reason (such as a minor mutation) it would signal a false positive for a problem.8
In terms of delivery, the DNA containing the kill switch can be either administered to the cells in the same package as our gene editing system, or could be administered to the cells later if the need arises. Keeping the killswitch DNA with the gene of interest DNA ensures a high probability of the kill switch being present in the cells along with the gene of interest. This would allow for faster silencing of the gene of interest if needed. The downside to this plan is that, if the gene of interest is mutated, the kill switch DNA may also be mutated along with the gene of interest, potentially making it useless. The other option is adding the kill switch DNA to the cells later, when it is required due to a malfunction of the editing system that bypasses its tetracycline control. This allows the kill switch to not be activated until it is in the cells and protects it from any mutation. It also prevents the possibility of the kill switch being activated prematurely or unintentionally. However, by administering the kill switch later, there is a no guarantee that of the gene of interest will be silenced"

Waterloo,2011,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," of making this construct is detailed in RFC53. Below is Figure 1 through Figure 3. They illustrate the order of parts in the design and the trans-esterification reaction that results in a function GFP:
Figure 2 shows the experimental design of the sequence immediately following transcription. It contains a constituent promoter, RBS Ribosome Binding Site), GFP1, IN1, in-frame stop codon, IN2, GFP2 and TT. The dotted lines and scissors indicate that the introns will be spliced out of the sequence at these points, however, the introns are self-excising.
Figure 3 is a representative view of the sequence folding in order to catalyze the trans-esterification reaction, however, there are many hairpin loops actually formed. This is the process of post-transcriptional modification. Specifically, Group I intron splicing events utilize a guanosine nucleotide to bind another sequence and dislodge the 5' site, then the cleavage initializes another splicing event with the remaining hydroxyl end to dislodge the rest of the RNA sequence and ligate the remaining exons. The remaining fusion protein code is different than that of the primary transcript.
Figure 4 shows a non-disruptive ligation scar and active GFP after the self-excision of IN1 and IN2. This is the modified RNA transcript prior to translation..
2.2 CONSTRUCTION MAPs AND RFC 53
As per RFC 53 convention, enzyme digestions are followed in the particular order outlined below. The standard procedure makes this technique reproducible, therefore, more easily extrapolated to other applications. Compared to other protein fusion methods, this design facilitates additional regulation within necessary guidelines. However, the embedded post-transcriptional modification in this design is a complication to consider in simpler designs where regulation at this level is not necessary. As such, unnecessary bulk in plasmid vectors is known to add to metabolic load and decrease replication rate compared to non-plasmid carriers.

In our human practice, we want to achieve a complete exploration process. In this process we need to enhance our project and to promote our project to the world. We mainly based on the following principles:
1. Extensive investigation
So as to better achieve the value of the project, we need to listen to more suggestions from the community. As the saying goes: no investigation, no right to speak.
2. Positive exchanges
Not only to show the world our works, but also to have a certain exchange of interaction with the world, we want to get good feedback.
3. Targeting the market demand
iGEM is not only a competition, but also a good project. In order to complete projects successfully we need to understand people's interests, which will help us target the market.
4. Pioneer the future
It’s essential for us to establish a system of Human Practice system, and we can obtain a lot of gains from this system. In addition, the system can be used by other teams in the future.
5. Education
Educate responsible engineers.
Our human practice focuses on the safety, rationality and value of the society. From the beginning, we wanted to find the problem in the daily life. We visited a lot of communities, and interviewed some well-known experts and scholars in the area, and also went to a lot of well-known domestic companies to communicate. We got a lot of good feedback. In the process of human practice constantly on our project has been improved.

INTERVIEW WITH MEMBER OF MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA Dr. Wei Yang.
After we interviewed the specialists who are famous in the food and sweeteners area, the current situation of sweeteners was getting clearer in our mind. Generally, most of them have the main shortages of high calories and bad taste even though they might be very sweet. We based the human sweetness receptor on our design and hypothesized to construct the signal conduction pathway in the yeast. And the most important thing is biology safety. In our project, the laboratory strains we used are routine strains,"

Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," varieties the public has access to. Due to the climate in Southern Alberta, the agriculture industry here utilizes 65% of S. Alberta’s total fresh water consumed making this a very important resource for the economy. With over 40 crop varieties supported by the irrigation systems involving 50 reservoirs, any infestation of invasive species or contamination of the water with biological control agents would have a debilitating effect on the industry. If an infestation of zebra mussels colonized any part of the system, the entire network of reservoirs and over 8,000 km of pipelines would be at risk. The value of the irrigation network is estimated to be worth $3.6 billion and the cost to replace the existing infrastructure could be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Additionally, the current method of controlling zebra mussels involves dumping KCl into the water supply and the turbidity of the water would have a severe impact on certain sensitive life stages of crop development.
Sweta Gupta, Pharmacist
Be clear on what components are in your system
We interviewed Sweta Gupta, a pharmacist and manager of Wal-Mart pharmacies. She said that within Wal-Mart’s repositories, they do dispense biologics and that what is available from their distribution centre is how they choose what is available on their shelves. She suggested that our system would need to have clear stability information and the components of the reaction would need to be indicated to determine if there are any allergens present. Overall, this interview informed us that we would need to ensure our system would have to come in a stable form and identified a potential safety issue.
Regulatory Landscape
This year we explored the regulatory landscape within Canada regarding protein nanocompartments. Overall, the legislation shows that protein nanocompartments themselves are not high risk. However, when thinking of the applications of PNCs and the cargo choice, more regulations will apply for the user as Canada regulates based on the end-product and not the technology used to make it. This exploration was guided by our discussion with the Public Health Agency of Canada.
