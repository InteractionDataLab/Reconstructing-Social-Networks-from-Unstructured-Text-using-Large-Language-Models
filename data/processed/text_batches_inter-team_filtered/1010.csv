Genome modification of E. coli using recombineering and CRISPR/Cas9
Introduction
This protocol is adapted from Jiang et al., 2015. It assumes a version of pTargetTet targeting the correct locus of the E. coli genome has already been created, as well as a donor DNA that include overlap regions and the gene to be inserted. For information on the design and creation of the sgRNA-producing pTarget, see Selection of the sgRNA and modification of pTarget.
Materials
E. coli strain containing the pCas plasmid.
pTargetTet targeting the locus to be modified.
Donor DNA: gene of interest flanked by two 500-bp overlaps, or an ssDNA for deletion.
LB, Kanamycin, Tetracyclin.
Arabinose 10%.
Chilled sterile ddH2O.
Sterile PEP tube.
IPTG 0,1 M.
Procedure
pCas has a thermo-sensitive origin of replication. All steps until pCas curing should be incubated at 30°C.
Day 1
Start a 5 ml pre-culture of TOP10 pCas in LB-Kanamycin. Incubate it overnight at 30°C without shaking.
Day 2
Competent cells
Start a culture for transformation by inoculating 40 ml of LB-Kan with 400 µl of pre-culture. Incubate in a 250"

Experimental Procedure
Mice
We got an ICR mice from the SLAC laboratory animal(http://www.slaccas.com/product/Index.asp?MainClassId=10&SubClassId=11).
 
Cell Culture
iPS cells were maintained on feeder layer of MEFs. The iPS cells were maintained in DMEM contain 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1ng/mL doxycycline, 0.01% LIF.
We used the 13.5-days-pregnant mice to isolate MEFs from its uteri. Wash the embryos with phosphate-buffered saline(PBS). Cut the heads and mince the remained bodies with scissors. Add 0.25% trypsin and incubate in 37°C for 7mins in the tubes. After trypsinization, the medium(containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) was added and pipetted up and down to help the tissue dissociation. Cells were collected by centrifugation(1000rpm for 3mins at room temperature) and resuspended in fresh normal medium. We used the 150mm dishes at 37°C with 5% CO2 to culture MEFs.
 
Retroviral Infection
We used the plasmid from Tongji iGEM team. It is TetO-FUW-OSKM from addgene. This is a lentiviral plasmid for tet-inducible expression of mouse Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and Myc for iPS cell generation.
The protocol is similar with
iNSC and Neuron’s protocol.

2. Inflammatory sensor
Engineered bacteria could be an ideal way to treat IBD. First, we need an appropriate sensor to                     sense the inflammatory signal and initiate the release of the drug. After comparing the                     inflammatory sensors used in some iGEM teams, we selected the inflammatory sensor based on nitric                     oxide molecules used by ShanghaiTechChina_B 2016 team . Nitric oxide is a natural signaling molecule                     of inflammation, and the concentration of intestinal inflammation in patients with IBD is                     significantly increased [1]. It has been reported that the average concentration of nitric oxide in                     the rectum of normal people reaches 60 nM, while in patients with IBD it reaches 5.5 μM, nearly 100 times higher than that of the former [2]. Therefore, the nitric oxide molecule is an ideal input                     signal for engineered bacteria, allowing the engineered bacteria to function only at the target                     location, thereby avoiding inappropriate output.

OUC-China,2012,Team:OUC-China#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEM are from MIT parts registry. Because there are antibiotic resistance genes on the plasmids, bacteria carrying the plasmids may recombine genes with other bacteria. This can result in bacteria with resistance to many antibiotics, so we pay special attention to transgenic bacteria. The transgenic bacteria to be eliminated need to be sterilized by autoclave, and the garbage is dealt with alone.
The strains we use in this project are Planktothrix rubescens and Escherichia coli. In the studies about Synthetic Biology, Cyanobacteria and E. coli have been widely used. Some commercial strains, such as Top 10 strain, have been proved harmless to the human body. Although many species of Cyanobacteria and E. coli are toxic to human beings, the strains we chose are nontoxic. All the experiments are done in the laboratory, and the bacteria can’t be taken out of the laboratory. Our work will be able to decrease the possibility of biosafety problems of the public and the environment.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
As for biosafety and laboratorial safety, our college has been formulated according to laboratory safety management regulations-laboratory safety system, which is aimed at our iGEM laboratory, iGEM team member experiment rules and laboratory management rules. In order to promote safety education in college, under the promotion of the students, the school has set up the compulsory course ""experiment equipment use procedures and laboratory safety"" for all freshmen. At the same time, our laboratory has established a complete safety management system, designed to ensure safety during the project progress in the laboratory, and to eliminate hidden dangers of the lab. As for waste in the experiment, our college has a special waste recycling mechanism to avoid the outflow of hazardous waste. Besides, the People’s Republic of China issued a document “Laboratories—General requirements for biosafety” (GB19489-2004) on April the 5th 2004. It can be viewed at here !
To further strengthen our laboratory safety management, we had been dedicated to Qingdao institution of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology Chinese Academic of Sciences professors The professors provided advice about the safety management of laboratory system, hoping to make improvements on our own safety management mechanism based on their advice and practice system. Also, we hope that the experts of the institution will make an assessment on the safety of the experimental project and make suggestions to ensure the safety of the biolab.
In order to let more members be aware of the importance of biological safety and lab safety,"

In practice, scaled versions of standard kernel functions are used,       which are of the form (15).
$$       K_h(x)=\frac{1}{h} \cdot K \bigg( \frac{x}{h} \bigg) \;\;\; \text{(15)}       $$
Importantly, the scaled functions inherit the kernel function                         properties, but are either broader or narrower. The degree to which the shape of                         a kernel function is stretched or squeezed depends on the scaling factor h,       which is why it is called the bandwidth, see Figure 6.
Figure 8
Epanechnikov kernels using different bandwidths. Click to enlarge.
This parameter gives us the                         freedom to define how far the influence of an agent reaches and how smooth the       resulting density function looks like. An example is given in Figure 7, where       100 agents were sampled from a normal distribution. The red dotted line       indicates the true underlying distribution, while the blue line is the       kernel density estimation calculated using different bandwidths. The left graph       shows a undersmoothed (small bandwidth) KDE, which oscillates wildly.       The right graph on the other hand is oversmoothed (large bandwidth),       leading to a misleadingly wide KDE.
Figure 9
Kernel density estimation using different bandwidths. Click to enlarge.
In summary, using kernel density estimation we can express the agent density       in the form of (16), providing the appropriate input for the PDE model.
$$       \rho(x)=\beta \cdot \sum^N_{i} K_h(x-x_i)       \;\;\; \text{(16)}       $$
The extension to higher dimensions is called multivariate kernel density      estimation and is rather non-trivial since the bandwidth is then defined      as a matrix instead of a scalar, which allows for many more variations      on the same basis kernel function. A detailed analysis of multivariate      kernel density estimation will not be given here. It suffices to       say that for our 2-D hybrid model we used the simplest      possible bandwidth matrix, which is the identity matrix times a constant.
PDE to Agent-Based
The final component of our hybrid model is the mapping      of the PDE model to the agent-based model.      The latter model works with discrete objects that      have continuous coordinates, meaning that"

Silver Medal: mGEM Human Practices
Behind research lies an intrinsically human element – no discovery is made in a social or political vacuum. This year marked extensive development for mGEM’s Human Practices team, as we sought to address the gap between our project’s lab work and the transfer of scientific knowledge across communities. As our Wet Lab and Dry Lab subteams created diagnostic assays for antimicrobial-resistant strains of the notorious hospital-acquired infections, C. difficile and E. coli, Human Practices sought to understand the potential impact of this technology. Antimicrobial resistant infections thrive within healthcare settings, so we focused our efforts on the burden of C. difficile and AMR in the Canadian healthcare system on local, provincial, and national levels.
Our research began with compiling literature reviews on the ethics and policies surrounding synthetic biology in healthcare, as well as the statistics representing the expansion of C. difficile and AMR as a pressing issue in Canada and internationally. We then chose to interview national experts and organizations to help us understand differing perspectives within AMR, the need for rapid diagnostic assays, how to modify our project in order to best suit those needs, and the translation of scientific knowledge to facilitate public awareness and education.
Discussion Paper
Our interviews spanned six months, and we had the opportunity to speak with national stakeholders in AMR and C. difficile. Throughout this consultation process, we developed insights at various levels of the biomedical technology development pathway. This experience was particularly helpful to understand the complexity of bringing a clincial technology to market- let alone one grounded in novel scientific principles, and biological engineering. We wrote a discussion paper synthesizing our qualitative data, with the goal of presenting the overarching challenges in antimicrobial resistance and C. difficile diagnostics, and how pursuits in synthetic biology may fill those gaps. You can find our discussion paper here.
Below are summaries of our consultations with these industry experts and policy makers.

Riboswitches the natural relatives of aptamers have been used in several projects for example Cambridge 2012, Goettingen 2013 and also Bettencourt 2015. Hammerhead ribozymes have been discovered by several teams as handy tools (Peking 2011, Fudan 2012 and MIT 2011) and DTU Denmark 2014 worked with the Spinach aptamer. Although functional RNA has been used in some iGEM projects DNA or DNAzymes have rarely been mentioned before. Our project this year aims to modularize and standardize all these and many more parts. With our new BBF RFC 110 we simplify the work with RNA and thus want to encourage future teams to also dive into the world of RNA. By the addition and modularization of many DNA parts we want to stress to possibilities DNA possesses.
Figure 9. HRP-mimicking DNAzyme
HRP-mimicking DNAzyme folds into a G-quadruplex and assembles a hemin inside. IT catalyzes the reduction of H2O2 to H2O and thus lead to turn over of classical HRP substrates.
By providing the community with tools for different applications, we contribute a foundational advance in the work with functional RNA. Not only is the system highly modular and therefore predisposed for standardization and usage in Synthetic Biology, the software developed by our team enables scientists to create aptamers and aptazymes de novo. Thereby we open up the world of functional nucleic acids to the entire Synthetic Biology community. Dive deeper now!

The R/G_FP+B0034 look correct, but the R/G/B_FP+term does not look right.  It almost seems as if the fluorescent protein was never inserted and just terminator was there, given the insert band length.  I extracted all of the parts anyways, but given the DNA quantification of the RFP and GFP + term, I only used BFP+term to ligate with an RBS.  As for the R/G_FP+B0034, I combined this with pTet (R0040) as it is our strongest constitutive promoter.  The ligation reactions were then transformed.

The history of science and technology is a science about the emergence, development and regularity of science and technology. Because of its interdisciplinary comprehensiveness and research on the development of science and technology, it is recognized as a powerful tool for scientific education. After the 1940s, the social function of science became increasingly prominent. Thomas Kuhn proposed that the history of science is an important bridge connecting science education and human culture. He proposed that in the process of science education, strengthening the education of the history of humanities and science more than any other aspect of science determines our imagination of the nature of science and the role of invention and discovery in the development of science and technology. In the middle and late 20th century, the public's thinking about science triggered by Rachel Caison's Silent Spring made scholars at that time aware of the need for the scientific community to let the public know what the truth of science and technology is. Michael R. Matthews believes that the best way to promote science education is to combine science education with the historical and philosophical dimensions of science. When the public masters the basic knowledge of science, they understand the diversity of science and the nature of science. After that, most of the theoretical and practical operational aspects of science education can be solved very well [2].
As the ancient Chinese proverb says, to make great process, it must rely on the history first. The development of synthetic biology is the same. In 1978, Szybalski commented in the journal Gene that restriction enzyme technology will lead us into a new era of synthetic biology after Daniel Nathans, Werner Arber and Hamilton Smith discovered the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of DNA restriction enzymes. This is the first time that the development of synthetic biology has been proposed in the academic field [3]. From 1978 to 2018, synthetic biology has gone through forty years of development. Its concept has gradually enriched and technology has been increasingly advanced. As a result, research fields have become more in-depth and results have emerged endlessly. But the public is still very unfamiliar with the term ""synthetic biology"", and know little about the ideas and logic behind it. Therefore, it is a significant work to sort out the development history of synthetic biology and present it to the public through scientific exhibitions.
As the top competition in the field of synthetic biology, the iGEM competition represents the vision and"

For the rate equation involving [P], we need to add both contributions from the sender and receiver systems and only take a single decay. In the lab，one can ""simply"" (Biologists clearly agree with this statement) put the sender and receiver to recreate the AimR-AimP system with biobricks. In order to build a reporting system，we replace the aimX into GFP.
The equations of this model read:
Attention:
1. [P] denote the concentration of peptide of AimR-AimP system , [aimR] and [gfp] respectively denote the concentration of aimR and gfp, [CP] denote the peptide of AimR-AimP system and aimR complex. [R+] represents the concentration of the molecular which was formed by the dissociation of the promoter of the AimX gene.
The remaining symbols are defined in Table 2.
Table 3 Definition of symbols used in the recursion equation
Analysis and Results:
As it’s shown, in the early stages of the experiment, extracellular signal molecules increased with time, but soon the signal molecules increased to a bottleneck. Into the late experiment, the signal molecules continue to decrease, and ultimately reach a fairly low level, making the signal molecular curve to form a first increase after the trend.

The tendency of this curve above matches well with our experimental data. And this crest-like shape of the curve agrees with previously published results[7].

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.
Dynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gomp"

Overview
The cold resistance BioBricks - or CryoBricks - we've developed for our project are classified as basic or composite parts. Composite parts are further grouped into finalized parts, containing a promoter, RBS and coding region, and construction intermediates, containing either a promoter and RBS, or an RBS and coding region. Note that some of the parts listed below were submitted to the registry by other teams. Our own parts are coded K538###. Some of them are submitted as physical DNA, where others are theoretical submissions that never got past the planning stage.
Basic Parts
We use 3 different types of basic parts in the construction of our CryoBricks: promoters, RBSes, and protein coding regions. More detailed information about their purpose can be found on the basic parts page.
Promoters
Based on literature study and safety considerations, we had planned to incorporate four different promoters in our project. The selection comprised the lac operon's promoter (pLacI, BBa_R0010 ), two arabinose-induced promoters (pBAD derivatives - strong, BBA_K206000 , and weak, BBa_K206001 ) and the hydrogenase II operon's promoter (hybB, BBa_J45503 ). While the selected promoters are relatively well characterized, little to no information is available about the effect of low temperature on their activity. For our project, investigating this effect would have been of great value to fine-tune protein expression at different temperatures. Unfortunately, due to facing many difficulties with assembly, we weren't able to characterize the promoter activities, and we ended up working with only two of the selected promoters: pLacI and the strong pBAD promoter.
RBSes
Many iGEM teams before us have characterised the strength of one or several ribosome binding sites, and this information is valuable for the same reasons as characterising promoter activities: fine-tuning protein expression. Again, no information was available of RBS activity at different temperatures. We would have liked to carry out"

16s rRNA PCR protocols for bacterial identification
16s rRNA PCR protocol
Pick a single colony freshly struck  into 10 μL of sterile RNAse and DNAse free water (purchased from Gifco®), in a PCR tube.
Fresh colonies (grown that day) work best, but they can also come from 4°C.
Incubate at 95°C for 10 minutes.
2 μl can then be used directly for PCR but the solution can also be stored at 4°C for a few days.
The NEB Quick-Load® Taq 2X Master Mix was used in the following master mix (notice that the 6X loading dye is already add to the Dream Taq used in this protocol):
The following PCR protocol was followed : The extent temperature was chosen according to the PCR product length.
The following primers were purchased from IDT, stocked at -20°C at a 100 μM concentration.
Gel Electrophoresis using SYBR safe
Preparation of the Gel (50mL)
Mix 0.5g of agarose with 50mL of a 0.5X TBE solution in an Erlenmeyer.
Heat the solution in a microwave until the liquid becomes totally transparent, avoid boiling.
Let it rest a few minutes so that you can manipulate the Erlenmeyer in your hand without pain.
Add 5μL of SYBR® Safe (10000X) and mix gently until the solution homogenizes.
Pour the liquid in a gel mold with the desired number of wells and wait 20-30 min (or until the gel is solidified).
Put the gel inside the electrophoresis machine and pour TBE 0.5X until the gel is totally submerged.

#4: Regularly Defrost Your Freezers
Defrosting your freezer can improve cooling efficiency and free up space to store more samples. Defrosting should be done once a freezer has 3/8"" or more of ice buildup . [ 2 ] Freezers that aren't properly defrosted can have trouble closing securely and work harder to keep the interior temperature at an optimal level. Regular defrosting preserves the operational lifetime of your freezer and ensures the security of valuable samples .
#5: Sharing is Caring
Sharing equipment with other labs can cut energy consumption in half - think of the difference in energy cost between one -80C freezer and two. Keeping an inventory of shared space helps with organization and record keeping as well. Further, sharing equipment and space opens the door for collaboration with other labs . Try sharing with other labs!

Presentation & interaction
Minghao Zhou and Yineng Chen take responsibility on the speech and question time. At the beginning of the speech, different from other five teams, we stressed the importance of participation of children themselves and illustrated the rules of quiz part that any parents would not be allowed to help their children. This strategy successfully drew those children's attention and let their parents know the meaning of popular science part. Minghao Zhou delivered the information about formaldehyde existence and effects of over criteria. Then, Yineng Chen helped kids to learn the knowledge in the comics, playing a role of the instructor in the comics, which aimed to help those children to have a deeper understanding. In order to test the achievement of the speech, we used the special answering pattern. Student who raised his hand fastest could have the opportunity to answer the question. Surprisingly, we are shocked by their ability of accepting professional knowledge. Those young children could raise their hands even without second consideration. Some questions even reached a level of high school knowledge, which must be extremely difficult for kids under 10-year-old to solve. However, everyone seemed to be confident about their answers, and finally solved all the questions we prepared.
Picture7: Our team member is giving the speech to the general public
The patience and enthusiasm of those small kids totally exceeds our imagination. After the speech, several parents consulted me about our team and IGEM. We explained their confusion patiently and were happy to see their advancement. The most impressive one was a mom of a elementary school student. She told us that his son was really interested in synthetic biology and our group project through this activity. She wondered how we were able to organize such a big activity independently. We told her about the challenges we met and she really appreciated the fruit we got through our own efforts.
Summary
After these 3 human practices, we realize something we haven't thought before. Actually, our values are contained in all the things we have done during our way of IGEM. Along our journey, we made huge social impact by using high school students' power: we called for public awareness and inferred the focus we should highlight in promotion campaigns through the survey analysis; we brought information of IGEM to those parents to make more people know synthetic biology in the first propaganda; we gave children a lesson to popularize harmfulness of formal"

Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
Last year, I already participated in the iGEM competition and I had so much fun. Working in a self-organized team having other motivated students with innovative ideas, leads to many intense discussions. However, one of  the greatest springs of joy in teamwork like this and the reason for participating again is the time we spend together laughing.

Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
Having been on exchange to the University of Waterloo, I learned how important it is to have own ideas and to talk about the realization of those. Hence, I believe the IGEM competition gives us science students not only the opportunity to do so, but moreover allows us to get in contact with other people who are on the same page. By being part of an IGEM team I hope that I’ll gain some knowledge, get to know other science junkies and make some amazing experiences.

Promoter, Repressor and Inducer Specification
Promoter name: tetp (Tet repressible promoter)
Length: 54 base pairs
Strength with:
Weak RBS (BBa_B0032): 5.6 - 517.5 (+17) RPU
Medium RBS (BBa_B0030): 25.5 - 2323.1 (+259.5) RPU
Strong RBS (BBa_B0034): 39.6 - 4041.5 (+247.8) RPU
(Chen & Wang, 2014)
In gram negative bacteria, TetR represses tetp which regulates tetracycline resistance by driving the expression of TetR and TetA, the latter of which codes for a tetracycline-magnesium complex that pumps tetracycline out of the cell.
Repressor name: TetR (Tet repressor)
Part Length: 685 base pairs
Structure: Homodimer of alpha-helices
Binding affinity: To tetp, very light, 0-1 µl/ml has been shown to cause a 5 order of magnitude change in fluorescent protein production
The TetR repressor exists in 2 states: silent and active. In the absence of inducers, the active state of TetR binds to the TetO1 and TetO2 operator sites of the tetp promoter, thus inhibiting transcription (Lederer, Takahashi, & Hillen, 1995). In the presence of inducers, however, TetR undergoes allosteric rearrangement and switches to its silent state, resulting in its release from the promoter, thus allowing transcription to take place (Aleksandrov, Schuldt, Hinrichs, & Simonson, 2008).
Inducer name: aTc (Anhydrotetracycline)
Binding Affinity: (to TetR) Ka ~ 109 M-1
Effective range: 250 - 25000 ng/ml
In our project, anhydrotetracycline (aTc) was used to induce tetp driven expressions. aTc is a derivative of tetracycline, tetp’s native inducer, which has shown stronger binding affinity to TetR ("

A noteworthy phenomenon that occurred during one of the microscope tests, was when a solution of 17-β-estradiol dissolved in DMSO (concentration 10-5 mg/ml) was added to the UERT strain suspension, and completely halted the bacterial movement, but several minutes later the bacteria regained viability. This did not occur when tried on the control strain.

In attempts to understand and repeat this phenomenon, a range of estradiol concentrations was tested but none of them succeeded.
Outlook
Although the concept of this idea seemed promising, the PctA-Tar and NarX chimeras had more potential to succeed, due to their structure similarity to the native Tar chemoreceptor (they all contain HAMP domain, which is located invariably at the C-terminal end of the last transmembrane segment). Both mentioned chimeras were built using their own HAMP, rather than Tar's native HAMP. In contrast, the hERɑ does not contain HAMP region, thus its chimera was built using the Tar’s native HAMP. We believe that this is the main reason for the chimera failure, and our results support this assumption. For example, in the modeled 3D structure, it is clear that HAMP region is problematic, as it is clear the HAMP misplaced. Furthermore, the GFP results also fit this assumption, as the chimera did not localize to the membrane, probable due to the HAMP.  Lastly, most of the reported chemotaxis receptors naturally contain a HAMP domain. According to the literature, that area is important for regulating the coiled-coil interactions mediating the signal propagation, which further supports our assumption. (2,5).
To conclude, further research is needed in order to overcome the obstacles faced in this attempt of generating a new chemoreceptor which reacts to estrogen derivatives.  The main problems and a way to overcome them are as follows:
* The estrogen derivatives used were soluble only in hydrophobic solvents, which are lethal to bacteria. The use of hydrophilic estrogen derivative or other non-   lethal solvents should solve this problem.
* The 3D model indicated of the incorrect folding of the newly designed receptor. A new design"

Result
Integrating four models of each block, we obtained completed result about signal transduction in single cell. The result was shown as follow (Fig. 16).
Fig. 16． The result of RFP intensity under different concentration ligand Our modeling result exhibited that different concentration of ligand could result in different RFP intensity, which demonstrated that our system could response to the different signal strength specifically. And it also demonstrated that our system could work in a single cell in theory.
Yeast growth model
Purpose
After constructing the model of signal transduction in a single cell, we considered to combine single cell model with the growth of yeast to simulate our system’s practical condition. So in this part, we looked forward to construct a simple model to describe the growth of yeast cells and provided some bases to the next step.
Method
Practical data measurement
We refered the model established by Imperial College 2016. This model was used to describe the growth condition of two kinds of cell which are competitive in a limit culture.
We re-proposed some hypotheses to fit our system.
1. The condition of cell was divided into two states, activated and non-activated, and there is no conversion between two states. Each state of cell consume the nutrition independently.
2. Only the activated state could combine sweetener.
3. The nutrition in culture was limited.
4. Each group cell had same growth condition.
Then we set the ODEs as following:
(The parameters of this model were listed in Table 5)

Easy DNA amplification and transcription
Amplification of DNA, which follows the isolation, is possible by Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA). This isothermal alternative of a PCR reaction, can be applied at constant temperature. In this way, no thermocycler is required.
The RPA reaction was tested on pSB1T3, a plasmid with a tetracycline resistance gene, following the RPA protocol. We used the designed primers IG0016 and IG0017 , with an expected amplification product of 167 bp. After purification of the samples ( PCR product purification ), the samples were checked on a RNA-gel ( RNA electrophoresis ). These results can be found in Figure 12.
Figure 12: Target DNA made from pSB1T3. The target DNA was made by RPA.
We successfully amplified a part of the tetracycline resistance gene from pSB1T3. RPA is thus applicable for amplifying DNA at a constant temperature, even though pipetting and mixing all compounds together might require some practice.
During the RPA reaction, a T7-polymerase binding site can be added to the target DNA by special designed primers. By adding T7-polymerase the DNA can be transcribed into RNA simultaneously.The combined reaction of RPA and T7 polymerase was tested to amplify and transcribe a part of the tetracycline resistance gene present on pSB1T3. First, the DNA was amplified and transcribed into RNA following the RPA+in vitro transcription protocol. We used the primers IG0016 and IG0017 , designed with a T7 promoter tail. The expected RNA product was 145 bp. After purification of the sample ( RNA  isolation ), the sample was checked on an RNA gel. ( RNA electrophoresis ), as can be seen in Figure 13.
Figure 13: Target RNA made from pSB1T3. The target RNA was made by RPA and in vitro transcription at 37 °C.
DNA amplification and in vitro transcription can be combined to obtain the required target RNA. Again, pipetting and mixing all compounds together requires some training, meaning that we need to come up with a solution to reduce the number of pipetting steps.
Combining DNA isolation, amplification and transcription
The next step was to combine the DNA isolation step with the consecutive amplification and transcription step. Therefore"
Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Part Collection_-_-_TEXT.html,"ptide cleavage site against tryptophan, a proteolytic activity could be assumed caused by the clearance observed. Contrary to our former beliefs, it could now be deduced that exchanging tyrosine doesn’t result in a change of activity. Consequently, tyrosine in the pro-peptide cleavage site is not essential for the activity of subtilisin E. Unfortunately, we were not able to prove the principle of our project regarding tyrosine in the pro-peptide cleavage site, as it seems to be not essential for the proteolytic activity. Thus, exchanging tyrosine against a photo-labile, non-canonical amino acid more precisely ONB-tyrosine will not influence the activity of the enzyme. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .
K2020006
– mutated expression system for subtilisin E in E. coli (Y77X) This part is a variation of the BioBrick K2020005 . In opposition to the exchange of tyrosine77 against tryptophan, the named tyrosine was exchanged against an amber codon, the least used stop codon in Escherichia coli. The codon TAT of tyrosine77 was substituted with TAG, which codes for ONB-tyrosine, if the corresponding tRNA/synthetase pair is added. So tyrosine will be exchanged against ONBY in the pro-peptide cleavage site of the enzyme in the presence of the needed ONBY tRNA/synthetase pair. By irradiation with light, this non-canonical amino acid can be converted to natural tyrosine in the pro-peptide cleavage site of the enzyme and the cleaved off photo-labile group. Thereby, the protease will reach its activity just by shining light on it. Caused by the mutation in the pro-peptide and not in the direct subtilisin E gene, the actual position of the modified tyrosine was counted from the beginning of the pro-peptide compared to common annotations counted from the N-terminus of the actual enzyme. Unfortunately, we were not able to execute all of the experiments that we planned due to a lack of time. But as our proof of principle of exchanging tyrosine against a larger amino acid namely tryptophan showed no difference in the activity compared to our working subtilisin E expression system , tyrosine77 in general not influences the proteolytic activity of the enzyme. And the replacement of tyrosine against ONBY will not cause an inactivation of the protease."
Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," less than 30ppb. Currently all chemical sensing devices with the exception of a gas chromatographer fail to detect ethylene at a concentration less than parts per million. Any device searching to replace traditional gas chromatography must have the capability to detect ethylene levels at this low level, or will be redundant in this context.
Stability
As this biosensor relies on the function of genetically engineered cells, immobilising them in a biosensor must allow them to remain stable. The immobilisation structure itself must also not deteriorate over time or due to exposure of unfavourable conditions.
Response Time
Biosensors are limited by the amount of time cells take to carry out the necessary processes to express the sensing and detecting proteins. Introducing mutations, or potentially increasing the strength of the promoter can manipulate this.
Technology Selection
Current Technology
There are two main methods of measuring produce ripeness. The first is to use gas chromatography to measure the rate of ethylene emanation as a proxy for the stage of ripening. This is highly accurate and highly sensitive, albeit very expensive, non-portable, and complex to use. This involves manually collecting a gas sample of air from inside a controlled produce storage room or shipping container, and loading it into the gas chromatographer for an output reading to be generated. The second method is on the other end of the spectrum in every way. Cheap, inaccurate, time-consuming and cumbersome, our team saw firsthand during our site visit to Fresh Produce Group clusters of workers manually squeezing samples of fruit from each shipping palette to assess their ripeness
This is a skill, which, according to Avocados Australia, is not taught specifically, but gained from years of experience. Neither methods allow for complete assessment of an entire shipment or stock of produce, and neither are elegant or practical. There is a clear need for a more streamlined, convenient, and reliable method of measuring ethylene levels to assess fruit/produce ripeness.
Product Design Introduction
As explored in the Government section of our Human Practices portfolio, there are many regulations that exist both here in Australia and internationally surrounding the application and production of GMOs. Additionally, our Outreach practices also exposed our team to the widespread concerns and apprehension about GMOs and their potential safety issues.
From curious parents accompanying young children at ‘Science in the Swamp’ to retired professionals at the Ku Ring Gai Rotary presentation, the main point of concern derived from the idea of genetically modified living cells being in such close proximity to fresh produce.
Whilst this does seem like a mountainous flaw in the objective of our project, it need not be. Rather, it provides our team"

Fudan_China,2017,Team:Fudan China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," After the transient induction, integrase is expressed and completes the inversion. We can acquire the stored information in multiple ways, such as PCR or sequencing. Due to the unidirectional catalyzation manner of serine integrases, the storage of the information is not rewritable in common circumstances. However, with directional factors, the recombination reaction can be reversed, thus making rewritable memory devices possible11. Integrase-based memory device has been adopted to build more complicated system like state machine3, 12 and counter13. Memory device using several orthogonal serine integrases to record multiple events was also developed in 20144.
Figure 3 | Three recombination reactions catalyzed by integrases (serine integrases). a, Inversion of DNA sequence; b, Deletion of DNA sequence; c, Integration of DNA sequence.
Memory device that genomically encodes analog signal using beta-recombinase in cell population was successfully built in 201414(Fig.4). Beta-recombinase recombines ssDNA to its homologous sites on the genome. After building a retron with the ssDNA homologous to the desired site and making it inducible by certain inducer, we can retrieve the information of the inducer by simply detecting this homologous site. More inducer means more ssDNA. And more ssDNA means higher chance that recombination will take place in single cell of the population. So it can store not only the existence of the induction, but also strength and duration. If the site is on CDS of a reporter which the recombination of the ssDNA can mutate or recover form mutation, we can easily measure the information stored in DNA by measuring the reporter.
Figure 4 | Cellular memory device based on Beta-recombinase which can be induced by two signals.
Some interesting works have been done with CRISPR, which creates new memory devices. Self-targeting guide RNA(stgRNA) directs Cas9 to where stgRNA itself is encoded on the genome5. Similar to other memory devices based on DNA level, Cas9 mutates DNA, which changes the sequence of future stgRNA. Newly-transcribed stgRNA will still target itself. By controlling the expression of Cas9 using customized inducer, events such as inflammation in human cells can be continuously recorded and stored. Much more excitingly, memory device using Cas1-Cas2 complex is also created6.
The potential usage of cellular memory devices
The ideal cellular memory devices are able to record stimulus exposure in the DNA circuits of the cells and express desired gene. This feature"

Starting a New Team
Early on this season, we got to bring our iGEM love and experience to Consort Alberta. Through workshops both in Calgary and Consort, as well as frequent Skype meetings, we (in collaboration with the Calgary Entrepreneurial iGEM team) helped Consort launch their first ever high school iGEM team. In addition to teaching lab techniques and how to use the registry, we helped the team to brainstorm and troubleshoot their project. The team had a great year, even bringing home the award for 'Best Human Practices Advance' at the High School Jamboree.

We had a lot of fun working with the Consort team, especially helping them brainstorm ways to overcome many of the hurdles that they faced. As a brand new iGEM team in a rural high school, they had no access to any of the equipment or materials necessary for even basic molecular biology experiments. They were keen and motivated though, and we were able to help them come up with some creative DIY solutions for their labwork. We also spent some time helping them brainstorm how to incorporate human practices into their project. All in all it was a very rewarding experience and we definitely learned a lot form it.

Building with Biology
We recognized that while our research was foundational and not immediately ready for any particular applications, it was still important to consider downstream uses and to engage in constructive dialogue with the public. We were able to accomplish this by collaborating with Wellesley on their museum exhibit prototype, and found a similar way to impact the wider community this summer by participating in a unique museum education opportunity called ""Building with Biology"". This was a pilot event hosted by 8 museums across the country, including the Museum of Science in Boston, in order to teach museum goers about synthetic biology and spark informed dialogue between scientists and the public.
We worked closely with Museum of Science coordinators, local research scientists, and even the Wellesley and MIT iGEM teams to lead different synthetic biology activities that could spark public discussion. The Museum of Science coordinators allowed us to learn about different prototype activities, and let us each pick a few activities to run on August 1 and 2, 2015. We went to an initial museum training, and learned not only about different activities but also how to engage the public, how to start dialogue, and how to properly run a museum exhibit. Oftentimes, scientists come across as condescending to members of the public when they speak about science, so we wanted to avoid this in order to best interact with museum visitors.
The discussions that we sparked with museum goers  revolved around either big concepts in synthetic biology (synthetically producing biodiesel, engineering crops and food, creating new genetic therapies, etc.) or what synthetic biologists do in the lab on a regular basis (plating cells, using genetic recombination techniques, pipetting, etc.). We primarily focused on introducing synthetic biology and addressing any questions, comments, and potentially any misconceptions that museum visitors had.
Through this experience we got to work with visitors of all ages! We were stunned and impressed with the knowledge and curiosity that younger children expressed. They really understood a lot of complicated analogies, such as cutting and pasting genes together or packaging DNA into viruses like “delivery packages”. We also initiated some important ethical conversations with parents, such as"

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#LindaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," project is going to be like and what they are going to be working on for this summer. Then, I pretty much gave them a lot of resources and have them figured it out themselves. I realized that I allowing my student a lot of opportunity and independence, because I trust that they can handle the task and that if they have any questions, they will come asking one of us. This is a lot of responsibility, and it’s all about learning how to learn. I suppose.
It’s interesting that I was in their shoes, and in a couple of years, they are going to be in mine. I wonder where I will be in the future.
July 5: Codeeee
Today, I got through quite a lot of code. I was stuck on dynamic javascript but I was able to solve it earlier this morning after starting from the beginning. For the most part of the day, I looked up cool css/ javascript, and tried to make the website look better. I still have a lot of work, but I have to get it all done today (cause the deadline for our progress report is tomorrow). It’s a lot of fun. But thinking back, I’m not sure exactly what makes a good website and all. So here we go! More research!
July 6: Almost there?
Well. I got most of what I needed to do done. But I still haven’t nailed the user design quite right. So I’m back to researching what looks pretty and what not. So in lab today, everyone were all pretty nervous because we’re kinda behind schedule. User studies are supposed to be done this past week, but most of us haven’t finished coding. Though each of us has made significant improvements, we’re really not quite there yet. Hopefully, by next week, we’ll be able to formulate it all.
July 9: Better Front End
In order to design a better UI for our datasheet, my task today was to research on what other orgs/ people have done. I looked at A TON of websites (like 10 or so), and analyzed them fairly in depth. Because not only do I need to learn how to organize a lot of information so that it is easy for the user to access it, but also have to make it look pretty so that the user would want to use this program again. After looking it up, I came up with a couple of designs that I will present to my peers/ mentors tomorrow. Most of the ideas are from these databases, and I hope to combine all the things that I like about them into our database/ datasheet. I"

For a more in-depth analysis on which experts we spoke with and how they influenced our project, please see our integrated human practices page . We have written a collaboration proposal to Oxford Nanopore Technologies, as we are currently using their next generation sequencing platform as part of our detection workflow. Our proposal was received warmly. The relevant research department indicated that our proposal is of interest tothem and would fit well within their plans.
Our second step
Our second step is to gather enough funding to continue development.     In our project thus far, we have been supported by many institutions and companies who have made development up to this point a reality.
To cover future development costs, we can apply for a grant, or we can request backing from other funding sources, such as companies and institutes with budgets for research.      We choose to apply for a grant of 20.000 euros from the Partnership of Clean Competition (PCC). The PCC has supported anti-doping research since 2008, spending more than 17 Million US Dollars in support of innovative science. They received our application enthusiastically, and advised us to aim for the larger grant with an average of $225.000 without maximum. This second application is in preparation by the Brouns lab (TU Delft), our supervising lab, whose members are eager to continue our work. The Delft Sports Engineering Institute is willing to support us in this effort with their vast network in the professional sports world as well as with a financial contribution.
Our third and fourth steps
Our third and fourth steps are to develop and demonstrate a method that is efficient and properly scientifically validated. We have experienced great progress during the course of our project. Please see our results page for more information on our scientific achievements. What remains is to ensure that development will be continued in the future. After iGEM, our project will be continued by the group supervising us (the Brouns lab, TU Delft), with a perspective for funding through the Partnership for Clean Competition collaborative. Regardless of this grant, they will continue with one highly important part of our method: the targeted sequencing method based on our innovative Transposase-dxCas9 fusion protein . With this method effective and validated, a complete method for gene doping detection is possible.
Our final step
Our final step is implementation by convincing the WADA Laboratory Expert Group of the efficiency and scientific validation of the method. Taking into account the time needed to be awarded the PCC grant and to optimize our experimental protocols, we aim to convince this group to implement our method within three years.

In a separate experiment, we also attempted to grow Ganoderma lucidum (a strain of fungus) directly on Arthrospira platensis (a species of cyanobacteria). A separate flask of Anabaena provided the oxygen supply. Unfortunately, we have thus far not been successful in showing measurable Ganoderma growth. We believe the Arthrospira culture which was being used as feedstock for the Ganoderma may have had too much water, and the Anabaena culture may also have been too dilute. Future experimentation will hopefully yield more optimal results (one of our mentors, Chris, was indeed successful in growing mycelia on Arthrospira.)

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

User Interface
The UI is an intuitive web application that enables the user to interact with TERRA. The interface is designed so that it takes the necessary experiment information from the user and sends it to the device. The user will enter how many outputs their microfluidic chip has, the flow rate on the microfluidic chip, and properties about the fluid itself (density, continuous vs droplet, etc.). Given this information we are able to use our TERRA droplet predictive model to calculate a dispense time. The user can then select which wells each output should be dispensed into. This information is sent to the Arduino and enters the back-end software components. The video below demonstrates how an experimenter would use the UI.
The UI is able to facilitate communication between the user and TERRA through the use of Peripheral Manager, a daemon that runs on the workstation and facilitates communication between cloud-based applications and hardware connected to the workstation. This communication link uses WebSockets, a communication protocol that enables two way communication between the browser and server. Peripheral Manager takes advantage of this protocol for serial communication with the Arduino.
Designing the User Interface
When initially designing TERRA our team knew that we needed some sort of platform for the user to interact with our system. During the designing and testing phases of the individual hardware components, a simple Serial Monitor was enough to communicate data via a microcontroller. However, a Serial Monitor is not an ideal platform for users to interact with devices, so we decided to create a user-friendly web application to use as the user interface for TERRA. In addition to the UI, the website also contains full assembly instructions, component descriptions, and other any other relevant documentation for the user to access. The goal was to create a one-stop website for users to help streamline their experience.
The first step during the UI design process was to plan how it would look and create the static page via HTML/CSS/Bootstrap. The initial design, pictured below, was the first iteration of the UI. On the left side the user would enter information about their experiment, such as the number of outputs and the vessel they plan to use. They would then configure each output by"

Hearing is an essential way for us to interact with the outside world. It is the most elementary communication tool for forming the societies. However, there are 360 million hearing-impaired people around the world, accounting for 5% of the world’s total population. [1]
Suddenly, the audible world comes to an end. Demonic buzzing replaced the ambient sound I have been hearing for years.
Fan Jiang [2]
Despite this serious situation, hearing loss is still categorized as ""incurable"" for most of the patients. [3]
The physical causes of hearing loss are complicated. Human hearing system is a complex pipeline with both mechanical and neural components. While the mechanical part can be repaired by surgical processes, treatments for sensorineural hearing loss remain highly experimental and ineffective. [4]
One ingenious invention, namely the cochlear implant, greatly changed the landscape for the treatment. This tiny device directly converts sound into electronic pulses recognizable by the cochlear nerve endings, the structure that passes audio information to the brain. However, such device significantly increases the probability of bacterial meningitis, among other drawbacks. [5] We cannot hesitate to wonder, ""What if the bulky electronics can be replaced by a layer of engineered cells?"".
Research Summary
Compared to recent accomplishments in engineering cells sensing light and chemicals, namely optogenetics and chemogenetics, there is little systematic research on engineering cells with capability of sensing sound.
Other cells, such as blood vessel cells, could sense mechanical shear force. Other mechanical sensing(MS) ion channels can help us sensing mechanical stimuli such as touch. [6] We hypothesize that it is possible to use synthetic biology approaches to engineer non sensory neuron to detect different aspects of sound, such as frequency and intensity. Our project is consistent of three aims:
Establishing systematic characterization tools to analyze the response of CHO cell to mechanical signals;
Establishing engineered CHO cell lines with synthetic circuit containing mammalian mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel or transient receptor potential channel 5 (TRPC5), and quantitatively characterize the different"

RCSB PDB
RCSB PDB (Protein Data Bank) provides the data of structure of protein or other biomolecules. Key feature of data from PDB is structure. NCBI or Uniprot provide the sequence of proteins, but it does not show us their 3D-structures. With the structural similarity between FGF binding domain of FGFR and single chain antibody 16A1, we can ensure that the replacement of FGF binding domain with 16A1 to detect MPT51 is appropriate.
Site URL: http://www.pdb.org/
Tools
During our project, we processed much bio-information. It is not easy to process that massive information manually, so we used many bioinformatics tools for our projects. We marked restriction sites to select proper restriction enzyme, searched the nucleotide which codes query peptide sequence to find the coding region of certain genes, virtual-translated given nucleotide sequence to check if our sequence codes expected protein, and predicted and aligned structure of single chain antibodies with FGF binding domain of FGFR to check single chain antibodies are structurally similar to confirm that replacement of FGF binding domain with single chain antibodies is appropriate. We used BioEdit to mark restriction site, BLAST to find the coding region of certain genes and to compare similar proteins, Transeq for virtual-translation, Modeller for structural prediction of single chain antibody, and Matt for structural alignment between single chain antibodies and FGF binding domain of FGFR.
BioEdit
BioEdit is the program for displaying biological sequences. It displays different amino acids or nucleotides in different colors to allow its users to check the change between sequences. It has many simple but useful functions. We used BioEdit for marking the restriction sites on given sequence to select proper restriction enzyme, which does not restrict coding region of gene. Other functions of BioEdit like phylogeny making or front-end of ClustalW are not used in our project, but they are also useful.

BLAST
BLAST is the alignment search tools for protein or nucleotide sequences. There are five modes of BLAST; blastn (nucleotide to nucleotide), blastp (Protein to Protein), blastx (nucleotide to protein), tblastn (protein to nucleotide), and tblastx (translated nucleotide to translated nucleotide). We used tblastn to find the location of coding region of given protein and blastn to find"

TetR - LacI - RFP System
Description
Our second readout system contains LacI in addition to TetR and RFP. TetR is still induced by a constitutive promoter, then LacI is under Ptet regulation and RFP is under Plac regulation. LacI plays the role of an inverter, in order to measure directly TetR-Ptet interactions: if TetR binds to Ptet, LacI is not expressed, so RFP is not repressed and is instead expressed. Here, TetR mutants with a higher binding affinity for Ptet will result in higher levels of RFP expression. There will be a direct proportional link between RFP expression levels and TetR binding affinity, which is more convenient that the inverted readout obtained in the TetR-RFP system.
Here also we have a two-plasmid system: TetR and LacI are placed on the pSB3K1 Pconst-TetR Ptet-LacI plasmid whereas RFP is on the J61002 Plac-RFP plasmid. You can read more about these plasmids on the plasmids details page.
Experimental validation - with wild-type TetR
As discussed above, our second readout system is based on both TetR and LacI. To validate our construct, we repressed the two transcription factors sequentially with ATC and IPTG, respectively. Details of these experiments are given"

St_Andrews,2011,Team:St Andrews#switch_-_-_TEXT.html," attacking host cells).   So, as long as there are a sufficient concentration of acidic phospholipids to facilitate the interaction, the AMPs should be able to bind to either leaflet.  We also contacted resident biomolecular scientist Dr. Peter Coote, who has authored several papers on AMPs, to provide advice on this subject.  He confirmed our theory that acidic phospholipids were imperative for the interaction between bilayer and peptide to occur, and agreed that intracellular protegrin-1 production should, at least hypothetically, cause cell death.
Dr. Coote also provided us with gomesin, an AMP structurally analogous to protegrin-1, for use in testing our kill switch theory.
Experiment Planning
We devised two sets of proof-of-concept experiments: one to ensure that our kill switch was functioning, and the other to test how it would work within a drug delivery context.
As our kill switch functions by killing cells, an obstacle we came across was how exactly to measure for cell death.  Our first attempt was devised with inspiration from the 2010 Berkeley iGEM team (Berkeley, 2010), where they used light absorbance as a proxy for cell death, with the idea that an intact cell will absorb more light than one that has burst due membrane disruption.  An increase in optical density would correlate to cell growth, while a decrease would correlate to cell death.  We also acquired gomesin, an antimicrobial peptide with an analogous structure to protegrin-1.  If we could add gomesin extracellularly in one population, activate our protegrin-1 kill switch intracellularly, and show that both E. coli populations were dying in a similar, if not identical manner, we could provide that as evidence of our kill switch functionality.  Weeks 6-9 were spent testing varieties of the protocol below.
pBAD Strong/Protegrin-1 Proof-of-Concept Experiment Protocol
Unfortunately, what we had not foreseen was the digestion of arabinose by the naturally occurring arabinose operon, providing energy for the cells to grow.  These newly grown cells replaced the cells lost to protegrin-1 production and our absorbance kept increasing, masking the cell death we hoped to see via kill switch activation.  We tried to integrate this into the experiment by measuring the rates of growth at various arabinose concentrations compared to a no-arabinose control, but we decided that the data was not sufficient to show kill switch activity.  In order to reduce growth, in subsequent experiments we replaced"

Uppsala,2014,Team:Uppsala#Project Sensing_-_-_TEXT.html,"In graph 1.C., we did not observe any induction  This implies that our customized version of the yenbox fused with the promoter J23113 did not work as intended. It seems like the activator YenR could not recognise nor interact with the yenbox due to the changes made in the last two bases of the yenbox. It should be tested to redesign this part so that the yenbox is not fused to the promoter but just simply put beside it without any overlap. If the induction is not extremely distance dependent, that might work better. Otherwise, you could try to find other promoters, were the first two bases match with the two last bases of the yenbox, so that we don’t have to modify the yenbox.
These kind of constructs were also constructed with a blue fluorescence protein (BFP) that were also transformed into cells already containing one of the YenR constructs J23110-B0034-YenR ( BBa_K1381005 ), J23102-B0034-YenR ( BBa_K1381006 ) or J23101-B0034-YenR ( BBa_K1381007 ) on the backbone pSB1K3. They were then plated and restreaked together with a non-fluorescence containing reference and a base level reference without any YenR. These plates were used to see if the induction could be seen in UV light, with the naked eye. Unfortunately, as you can see in fig. 1 below, this was not the case. The color could be seen, but there was barely any difference in the intensity of the different cells.
It should also be mentioned that we did an attempt to create bigger constructs containing the characterisation constructs with the yenbox coupled to GFP and the YenR constructs (yenbox_promoter-B0034-GFP-terminator-promoter-B0034-YenR). But for some reason these assemblies did not work. After some troubleshooting we came to the conclusion that it was too stressful for our bacteria to produce both BFP and YenR on the same high copy plasmid or that these constructs were not stable in E. coli and got rejected or mutated by the cell.

Une partie de nos biobricks ne sont que des assemblages de briques déjà existantes dans le registre du M.I.T..
Pour les autres, il s'agit d'une séquence de localisation nucléaire (DTS), un facteur spécifique au cellules souches (SCF) et une protéine de capside du phage lambda synthétisée à partir de son propre génome. Cela n'implique donc pas de nouvelles problématiques de sureté.

Sûreté en laboratoire
Nous n’avons pas de département sureté dans notre école. Cependant il existe un comité qui est chargé de valider tout nouveau projet dans le laboratoire qui nous a accueillis.
Lors des diverses expériences, un strict confinement physique de nos micro-organismes a été observé et toutes les règles en vigueur dans le laboratoire ont été suivies. (Manipulation sous hotte pour les substances dangereuses, stérilité des contenants, trier les déchets, déchets contaminés rejetés dans les poubelles biologiques…)
Les bonnes pratiques de laboratoire pour la manipulation des souris ont également étaient suivies. (Renouvellement des litières, respect de l’animal, réduction du nombre d’animaux utilisés…)

These temperatures are then cycled, so you get 25-30 cycles of denaturing, annealing and extending. During each cycle, you double the amount of DNA that you started with, meaning that this is a very efficient technique for amplifying.
Applications
In the lab, DNA amplification is important for increasing your DNA concentration for future reactions. When we received our DNA stocks, they were at concentrations that were far too low for decent transformations, meaning that we wouldn’t have been able to achieve appreciable results if we used the DNA as it was. By amplifying it, we were able to make our DNA go further, saving money, and get more meaningful data from our bacteria.
Outside the lab, PCR is still important. One interesting application is in forensic science. At crime scenes, there are often very few pieces of evidence which point towards who performed the crime. Finger prints can be very useful, but sometimes there aren’t any. However, often you can find some biological trace of the criminal, such as blood, or skin cells. These contain the DNA of the criminal, which, if it can be sequenced, can point the finger towards the culprit. However, the DNA present at the crime scene will be at very low concentrations. The solution? It needs to be amplified! The scientists doing the PCR need to be very careful in this situation though, because if their DNA gets into the sample, they could be implicated in the investigation.

UTI-INSPIRED, BIOFILM-TARGETED MICROBIAL WEAPONRY
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infectious human diseases in the world, with some 150 million cases occurring globally per year. It is also the most common cause of hospital-acquired infections in the developed world, accounting for approximately 40% of documented cases in the United States in 2009. On average, UTI accounts for more than 1 million hospitalisations and $1.6 billion in medical expenses each year in the USA alone.
Uropathogenic E. coli is the leading cause of UTIs. It is responsible for 80-85% of community-acquired UTIs, whereas for hospital-acquired UTIs, other bacteria such as P. aeruginosa also play a significant role. Among the UTIs acquired in the hospital, about 75% are associated with the use of urinary catheters, tubes inserted into the bladded through the urethra to drain urine which in 1 in 4 hospitalised patients end up receiving.

The docking scores of trimmed wild type spCas9 in PyRosetta to the 64 PAM variants
As can be seen in the figures, the trimmed Cas9 pdb performs just as well at predicting dockings, while signficantly reducing run time.
Mutant Cas9 PAM Affinities show Mixed Results
The next step in developing the tool was recreating mutants with known PAM specificity. The VQR and EQR mutants developed by Kleinstiver et al. were obvious choices for verify in silico modeling. However, the docking produced mixed results. While the expected NGA/NGAG PAMs did rank highly for binding affinity, the simulation incorrectly identified NGG and NAG PAMs as binding with equal affinity.
However, a simulation of the R1333Q/R1335Q mutant attempted by Anders et al.
failed to distinguish between different PAM site, just as the experiment did.
Framework and Future Work
Proposed Tool
The software used for this project includes: PyRosetta used for protein design and analysis, PyMOL for protein visualization, as well as 3DNA and UCSF Chimera for structural analysis.
Our developed guide to PyRosetta and PyMOL on Linux, Mac OSX and Windows can be found on the documentation of our github wiki .
Future Work
Naturally, the next step in the progression of the project would be to rationally design a novel Cas9 protein with respect to the generated non-canonical PAM sequences, and to test the binding of the novel Cas9 DNA complex in order to achieve a completely in silico designed protein that has the ability to recognize a novel PAM sequence.
For this project, the interaction between Cas9 and the PAM region was ensured by further specifying physical fields such as the angle of torsion, degrees of freedom with respect to movement of the ligands, and repacking which allowed for the optimal conformation of the newly mutated protein so that conditions were ideal for binding. We hope to eventually include the Gibb's Free Energy value obtained from the interaction, as well as additional fields imposed mutation protocol by using other methods available such as the usage of a Task Factory and improving on the stringency of our current mutation script that implements the built-in mutate base function.

Tianjin,2017,Team:Tianjin#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," HO gene or create a pathway functioning as single gene regulator. Eventually, we landed on the Gal1 promoter first, for its convenience and efficiency. As we read in R. Scott McIsaac’s work, their rapid, tunable, single-gene specificity control system of single gene in yeasts has given us much impression. Therefore, we decided to use this system as one of our pathway designs for the expression of HO gene.
GETTING THE CHASSIS
Aiming to achieve MTS for environmental use, it is essential to make sure that when theMATa locus has DSB(double strands break) cleaved by HO, our type-a (MATa) yeast can only become type-α (MATα). Therefore, we used a Ura-tag to replace the HMR(a) domain in chromosome Ⅲ. In this way, the HMR will no longer be the donor for the homologous recombination in the repairing process for MATa cleavage. After selection, by homologous recombination, we deleted the Ura-tag for further usage. We selected the target colonies(SynⅩdUra)  via 5Foa plates.

CONSTRUCTION of SYSTEMS
1) Gal1 System
In this pathway, we chose Gal1 as our promoter for the expression of HO gene, CYC1 as the terminator, and PRS416(with Ura-tag) as our vector. As for segments ligation, we design the cutting sites for the Bsa1 enzyme in each part, hoping to achieve seamless ligation of these three parts.
We adopted the PCR method to amplify the Gal1-part and CYC1-part from a Gal1-Vika plasmid we had used in our former lab work. We designed specific primers for this procedure. After PCR, the Gal1 has the cutting sites for SalⅠand BsaⅠon both ends, and CYC1 has that for BsaⅠand BamhⅠon both ends. Meanwhile, the HO gene was obtained by gene synthesis, flanked by specific hangtags for BsaⅠto be cohesive with Gal1 upstream and CYC1 downstream. Thus, we have built our composite part (GHC).
After the ligation, we transformed the E.coli for the augment of the PRS416 plasmid with GHC. (GHC-416) And eventually, we transformed our SynⅩ-dUra for the GHC-416 to get our target yeasts"

Project Overview
Inspired by the need for a simple, inexpensive, and portable means of toxin detection, Brown University’s Team Toxipop wanted to create a biosensor that utilizes a novel method to detect the presence of a toxin in a solution of bacteria. After a great deal of brainstorming and research, our team finalized on a design for our project that interfaces both biological and electrical systems.  Our design is primarily based on a list that our team compiled of ideal bio-sensor guidelines:
Biological
Uses minimal biological machinery
Direct induction of system by inducer creates a sensitive system
Versatile construct
Engineering
Compact and user-friendly system for sample analysis
Economically feasible
Minimal biological machinery
Our biological construct consists of three interacting proteins under the control of a single promoter.  Such a simple construct increases efficiency and minimizes sources of error in the system.
Direct induction of system by inducer optimizes sensitivity
The triggering of the lysis gene cassette is directly influenced by inducer presence, creating a sensitive system that should maintain a constant gain.
Versatile construct
The simplicity of our construct lends to its versatility.  The promoter controlling the lysis cassette can easily be interchanged, optimizing our system's potential to detect several different types of toxins and other substances.  For example, a mercury-induced, arsenic-induced, or lead-induced promoter, all of which have been introduced by iGEM teams in the past, could be placed in control of the lysis cassette, creating three separate and specific toxin detection systems.
Compact and user-friendly
The physical bio-sensor envisioned by our team would be hand-held, consisting of a small compartment of bacterial cells with electrical probes fixed in this compartment.  The probes feed information to a simple circuit within the sensor which monitors changes in the current of the bacterial solution and outputs that change via a simple LED light signal (See the ""Application"" below for more details)."

XJTU-China,2018,Team:XJTU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Would you mind adding sweeteners to the food?
5.  D-psicose is a nature sugar with low energy and good taste. Would you like to add it into your food or drink?
We received a total of 1121 questionnaires, and most of our respondents are the young and middle-aged people.
After analysis , we found that everyone buys things subjectively without choosing sweeteners. However, more than half said they would mind the use of sweeteners and want their food to have sugar and low energy.
D-psicose is a natural and healthy sugar, yet little is known about it by public. This sugar with a sweetness of 70%-80% of sucrose, and with low calorie as well as possible positive effect on diabetes. So, when are asked “do you want to buy if D-psicose is added to the food”, about half of them choose ""Yes"". Therefore, we believe that D-psicose is promising to be used in food and will have huge market in the future.
Market analysis summary of D-psicose
Based on the survey, we summarized the current beverages on the market and counted the sweeteners used in them.
Show or hide the table
Advantages and disadvantages of various sweeteners compared with psicose.
Show or hide the table
By investigating the types of sweeteners in different beverages, we found that most soda drinks use a variety of sweeteners and most of the sweeteners currently used are not as sweet as sucrose. Besides, they can cause dangerous side effects to the human body. In contrast, D-psicose has high sweetness, low calories, and no known side effects, which may be a healthy sweetener. This proves that D-psicose has great advantages in entering the market.
The price of D-psicose on Amazon is $12.88, while in China, D-psicose is currently not sold as a sweetener. However, according to our company visits, market professionals told us that d-psicose under 20,000 yuan/ton can be accepted by the market. If D-psicose is added to the beverage as a sweetener, a price of 10 yuan/bottle is acceptable in the market.

Measurement of parts
BIT-China collaborated with Team Tianjin in the measurement of their parts.
They send their sample of K1361007 to us, in which CsgA, the major subunit of curli fiber modified by twin 7Xhis tag, is under control of a strong constitutive promoter BBa_J23100. And the K1361007 was arrived in company with a parallel part where BBa_J23104, a relatively weaker promoter, replaced the BBa_J23100. In order to find the better fit of promoter, we measure the cell growth curve of each part and Bradford protein assay was adopted to monitor the total quantity of secrete protein in matrix.
Cell growth curve of BBa_J23100 and parallel that a relatively weaker promoter was used to control the CsgA secrete level.
This figure shows the absorbency of secrete protein in culture between K1361007 and parallel. No significant divergence was found.

Communication
Our Team
As an interdisciplinary team, we quickly realized that we needed to find effective ways to communicate complex concepts and ideas from each of our disciplines - biochemistry, engineering, biology, chemistry, and law - to other members of the team with no more than a lay background knowledge. Doing this enabled us to take advantage of our different knowledge and perspectives, bringing a new angle and fresh approach to the work in each of our fields, and allowed us to use our combined knowledge to tackle problems which we would not have been able to address individually.
This sharing of knowledge and ideas is essential not only within successful iGEM teams: our interdisciplinary group is, in this regard, a microcosm of society at large. Dialogue between scientists and non-scientists must be two-way, understanding and willing to listen on both sides.
The lack of this mutual communication has caused massive problems for areas of science, biotechnology in particular, in recent years.
The Knowledge Deficit Assumption
The so-called 'knowledge deficit assumption', according to which public objections to science are based on lack of understanding and misinformation, is no longer an adequate explanation to brush off widespread concerns about synthetic biology. As the below pictures show, it is true that there has been a certain degree of hysteria in the public response to genetic manipulation.
However, in the 21st Century, scientists have to take some responsibility for education and explaining science in an accessible way, avoiding psychobabble without dumbing down ideas. If this has been achieved, there is then a responsibility to take the views and concerns of the public seriously - as we found on a small scale within our team, in a society of individuals with a wide range of different expertise can offer different perspectives and may be able to spot flaws or potential problems in the bigger picture which a reasearcher, immersed in the minute detail of a project, has not considered.
Opposition does not equal miscomprehension; a well-informed public may legitimately conclude from the information they have absorbed that the risks of a certain project are unacceptable or outweigh the benefits. Equally, support does not equal understanding; it is important to ensure that where the public do back a development, they do so having made a full assessment of the benefits and risks, with realistic expectations and to the likely benefits and limitations of the science.  With this in mind, we thought about methods of communication our team had found useful during the course of our summer project"

In future years, companies that are interested in supporting mammalian synthetic biology research in iGEM can help develop a “MammoKit”, which could include a starter cell line, media, trypsin, and TC plates. One example of a company interested in supporting mammalian teams across is Agilent Technologies, who offered a cool vector assembly kit to all iGEM teams this year. They developed an easy way to create mammalian expression backbones (in addition to E. coli and yeast) and even sent us their free starter kit this year! This gives us some promise that companies would be receptive to such an idea.
In addition to a “MammoKit”, teams would need the know-how to use these resources effectively. Our team made an effort in this area, as we have documented our detailed protocols and experimental pipeline for working with HEK293T cells. We hope that future teams that work with this cell line help improve these protocols, and also that other teams working with alternative chasses can make their protocols and experimental pipelines available as well.
Parts
We previously discussed how part availability and submission can be difficult for mammalian teams.
While the MammoBlocks method proposed by MIT iGEM 2010 and 2011 is a great first step for a suitable mammalian part submission method, this standard may not be practical for all mammalian chassis teams. Gateway cloning is proprietary technology from Invitrogen, and asking teams to use these backbones and reagents is costly.

Although, current BioBrick submission requirements have been the foundation of the iGEM registry, it may be possible to tweak the criteria so that it is more suitable for larger parts. For example, requiring only one enzyme site in the BioBrick prefix and one site in the suffix (rather than 2 in each) could turn BioBrick part submission into an easier requirement to accomplish. With an easier submission requirement, mammalian teams (and teams with larger parts in general) may be more likely to submit their parts to the registry, since these will more easily follow requirements. Although this solution would eliminate the ability to assemble parts using BioBrick cloning, there are other, new ways to clone parts that do not require BioBrick assembly or restriction enzyme requirements - for"

Synthetic biology pave the way to engineering the natural bio-systems and helping us broaden the way to making use of resources. International Genetic Engineered Machine Competition as the only one national competition we can take part in as undergraduates, it provide us not only a great chance to get to know this brand new field but also a platform to communicate with the worldwide students.
1. 2nd iGEM Conference
As we are the first team of Nanjing Agricultural University, we tried to communicate and collaborate with more team and exchange our idea this summer. We came to Taiwan on August 3rd to 7th to attend 2nd iGEM Conference at the Nation Chiao-Tung University. During the conference, we shared our idea and communicate with more than 20 research teams and several software teams.
2. Cooperation with CAU_China and WHU-China
Cooperation is an important element during the project. With the help of WHU-China for offering us Streptococcus thermophiles which contain gshF and dCas9 protein, we cast our idea more efficient.
Besides the help of WHU-China, we also have a tight connection with CAU_China.They offer our team the protocol about gene synthesis, which helped us a lot about GSH part. As we have done lots of experiments about detecting florescence intensity to verify the function of our device, we give our protocol about the method to quantized the expression of GFP, our team members Xu Xuan is familiar with this experiment, he also give some suggestions their project about rpaⅠ. Via frequent communication and disscution, we both gained progress and excellent suggestions.

DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," require assembly and introduction of large expression cassettes and multiple markers. For example, the NRPS responsible for cyclosporine synthesis in Tolypocladium inflatum is encoded in a single CDS of 45.8 kb [19]. Amplification of 45.8 kb nucleotides is not feasible with standard PCR techniques and would be considerably expensive to synthesize by cheap error-prone DNA synthesis methods.
We hypothesized that NRPS directed evolution targeting using the Stachelhaus code could lead to improvement of NRP drugs. We proposed that the recent advantage in oligo mediated recombineering (MAGE) using short single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) can be applied to generate this diversity.
Oligo mediates recombineering
Recombination-mediated genetic engineering or recombineering  utilizes homologous recombination to facilitate genetic modifications at any desired target by flanking the mutated sequence with homologous regions. One system for recombineering in E. coli is the λ phage derived λ Red, consisting of the genes encoding three proteins, Gam, Exo and Beta. Gam prevents degradation of linear dsDNA by inhibition of nucleases, Exo degrades dsDNA in a 5'-3' direction yielding ssDNA, and Beta facilitates recombination by binding to the ssDNA [20].
Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE)
Wang et al. developed a method for rapid and efficient targeted evolution of cells through cyclical recombineering with ssDNA (oligos) in E. coli. Using this automated method, they showed more than five-fold improved lycoprene production in E. coli in three days [21]. Through MAGE it is possible to simultaneously target many different loci or target the same locus with a pool of multiple and/or degenerate oligos. By using multiple oligos targetting the same locus, it is possible to generate a library of mutants varying only at the target locus in a short amount of time. The genetic variation in the population of cells will be a function of the degenerate pool complexity and combinatorial arrangements of the modifications at different loci [21,22].
The MAGE protocol utilizes the λ Red recombination system in combination with a temporary inactivation of the mismatch repair system [22]. As MAGE utilizes oligos, only the Beta protein of the λ Red system is required. When E. coli is targeted with single-stranded oligos, Beta stabilizes them inside the cell and facilitates homologous re"

To characterise the light promoters, we developed two novel reporters, LOV2 and iLOV.  These reporters have numerous advantages over GFP derived fluorescent proteins, such as their small size and, in the case of iLOV, the ability to quickly recover from photobleaching.  Another key advantage of the reporters LOV2 and iLOV is their ability to function under anoxic conditions.  This unique ability was particularly desirable to our team due to our work with biofilms.  We are using biofilms to engineer functional 2D and 3D structures using our light responsive constructs.  Bio-photolithography has many applications, including the creation of structures for tissue engineering and manufacturing nanodevices.
2.) 3D printing for structure fixation/encapsulation
The second component of our final product is structure fixation/encapsulation. For this we have chosen colanic acid, which is an exopolysaccharide that is naturally produced by E.coli  in order to protect from acidic environments. Colanic acid was previously worked on by the 2009 Imperial College London team, and its production can be overexpressed using biobricks of the transcription factors RcsA and RcsB.
3.) The controlled modular synthesis of a variety of products
A key component of DISColi is flexibility in manufacturing.  Taking advantage of the modular nature of synthetic biology, our engineered bacteria will be able to produce a variety of useful compounds simply by inserting the genes for the desired compound into the system.
This would mean the ability to use different wavelengths of light to select your desired product from a single precursor molecule.  As a proof of principle of manufacturing in response to light, we have been working with the carotenoid pathway.  In 2009, Cambridge submitted a number of biobricks involved in this pathway.  We have improved this by synthesizing the fourth gene, crtY, in the pathway and testing it under a pBAD promoter.
We believe it is vital to include a constant interaction with the public throughout our project. We aim to accomplish this through the use of regular Vlogs and personal Blogs. Uniquely, we have also created a daily time-lapse, with the hope that others can gain an insight into life in the lab.  Check out the rest of our wiki to"

SKLBC-DGSYZX,2015,Team:SKLBC-DGSYZX#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," software and experiment of synthetic biology. At this meet-up, we also showed our projects with each other, after which we got lots of useful advice and knew experience in iGEM from the three laboratory teams’ members.
Experiment train    2015 August 7th- 9th
Our project is about an online panel app, with which the scientists and non-scientists can easily design their gene circuits in the same model. As a new high school team, we do not have solid knowledge about synthetic biology. Even though we can acquire a concept about synthetic biology by self-learning, we still need an intuitional sense about how the molecules interact in the experiment operations. During August 7th- 9th, we had a three-day experiment train and got a better understanding of synthetic biology from team SCUT-China. With the help of experiment, we believe we can make a greater User Experience in our project.
Gene circuit library
In order to help the iGEMers create more amazing circuits easily, SCUT-China suggested us to added remarkable designs of iGEMs’ teams to build up a gene circuit library, during which we can test our app and gain some novel idea with the library. However, gathering the gene circuits is a hard work for us, because we have to read the projects of previous iGEMs’ teams and we lack experience of designing gene circuits. Therefore, members of SCUT-China finished reading the projects and used the panel app to complete the construction of gene circuits library, after which they gave us a feedback to help us improve our panel app.
Course design
It is a collar work for us to design the course by ourselves so SCUT-team offers to help us collect the information about synthetic biology and simplify the knowledge point. Actually, it’s a brilliant idea which helps us learn synthetic biology easily and save time at the same time.
Collaboration with other software teams
We also cooperate with other software teams. We create a cooperative function with SKLBC-China team. By scanning the QR code, we can view the biobricks that have been stored up in the wechat ID through the project WeiGem 2.0 of SKLBC-China. The function not only links wechat and personal computer, but also connects the two high school teams.

Once fused into tumor cells, KRAS siRNA will be released, targeting and destroying KRAS mRNA. In this way, the expression of KRAS will be potently shut down. In theory, the delivery of KRAS siRNA to tumor cells will be achieved, whereas non-specific uptake of KRAS siRNA in other tissues will be avoided. As a consequence, the inhibited expression of KRAS oncogene will repress the proliferation of tumor cells, ultimately presenting therapeutic effects on lung cancer.

Tokyo Tech
While working on our screening model, we found out that Tokyo tech is using similar techniques. Their topic this year is to develop an affordable kit to detect Dengue virus and predict its serotype. Although we have very different goals, both of our teams have faced the same problem of ELISA being too expensive to put into practice. In our online meeting, we conversed about the pros and cons of different modeling techniques and the issues that come up when we do not use ELISA. The discussion with them inspired us in improving our project, and we have maintained contact with them ever since. We hope that the meeting was just as useful for them and wish the best of luck for their project.

On the basis of our research, we developed practical guidelines for research projects concerning synthetic biology, some of which we ourselves  applied during our iGEM project. Evaluating all perspectives, we developed flexible and easily applicable multi-faceted guidelines for research   concerning synthetic biology, such as the incorporation of expert committees relevant for the project, as well as possible dual use concerns.  The complete and comprehensive Report on Chances and Implications of an Expanded Genetic Code (ChImp Report) can be   accessed here .
Conference on Expanding the Genetic Code
From the beginning, we knew that our project is multi-facetted, and that we would need the insight and expertise of experienced scientists. Therefore, we organized our own open workshop, “EGC: Expanding the Genetic Code”, on August 4th 2017 to obtain some advice and tips for our work. We did not just intend to broaden our horizon regarding the possibilities and challenges of our project, but also to get feedback and help from external experts in synthetic biology.
Figure 1: Excerpt of the program for our workshop EGC: Expanding the Genetic Code.
While the CeBiTec has an excellent reputation as a center for genome research and biotechnology, there is no research related specifically to the expansion of the genetic code. Scientists from the CeBiTec and from Bielefeld University were invited to our workshop. Since there is just basic research on this topic in Bielefeld, the staff benefited from our conference, and gave us very positive feedback regarding the workshop. Moreover, we invited interested students to increase the popularity of iGEM and the knowledge about synthetic biology on the campus of Bielefeld University.
After the official part of the workshop, we had an intense exchange with two of our invited speakers. Iker Valle Aramburu (EMBL Heidelberg, Germany) received a degree in Biochemistry at the University Basque Country, Spain and his MSc in Cell Biology at Heidelberg University. His field of study includes Physical Chemistry, Chemical Kinetics, and Biochemistry. His presentation dealt with “the plasticity of FG-Nucleoporins and NTR interactions”. Due to his experience with small molecular FRET, Mr. Aramburu gave us pointers for our analyzing tool.
