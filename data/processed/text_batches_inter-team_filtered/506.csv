Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#HumanPractice#GermanArmedForces_-_-_TEXT.html,"ynthetases, which can synthesize a peptide of choice. The very nature of this project meant that we were confronted with safety issues all web developers face, as well as by issues specific to the biological underpinnings of our software. The latter overlapped in many cases with our considerations throughout the wetlab projects.
Any web application has to deal with diverse attacks of malicious intent. Dealing with these was simplified by using Django, a stable web framework. Such frameworks try to trivialize common tasks in the work of a web developer and of course safety issues fall into this category. For example, Django provides a mechanism for [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/contrib/csrf/ protection] against cross site request forgery attempts, in which a malicious site can cause actions in the server by using the credentials of a logged-in user. The Django development team also uses a very strict [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/ process] for dealing with new security issues in a timely and safe fashion by initially fixing these through private, confidential channels. Once the patches have been applied, the security issue is publicly disclosed, so that server maintainers can update to the latest Django version. As an example, this September a set of [https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2013/sep/15/security/ security releases] were issued by the Django development team in order to remedy a problem with denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Of course, after being informed of this release, we immediately updated the Django version running on our server to the latest one.
A second issue arising during web development, is the safety of a user's confidential data. Again Django provides an in-built authentication system which encrypts the password of all registered users using PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2). Beyond the Django security features, we also used a password protected storage server for the MySQL NRPSDesigner database.
In regards to the biological background of the NRPSDesigner software, we were particularly troubled about not leading a user astray with the organisms suggested for the cloning, especially in case they were not of the S1 safety level. This is particular important in the case of NRPS, because many interesting NRPS such as Pyoverdine, a fluorescent siderophore, are produced by pathogenic microorganisms (e.g. ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''). As of the European wiki freeze, the NRPSDesigner database includes only S1 organisms. Nevertheless, as in the future the database may be expanded with S2 organisms, we intend to handle such cases"

Afternoon Lab Meeting
Pigments:
Vio operon needs to be changed and designed by us ... good idea to include inducable promoter (as suggested by DNA2.0) and optimise codon usage/remove restriction sites. *Characterisation - we were having problems triggering melanin and violacein pigment production in liquid culture.  Suggestions include going ahead with solid media extraction, and to trigger pigment production in liqiud culture to grow in media with more stable forms of ampicillin to ensure no overcrowding due to lack of selection, grow them longer and make sure they get enough oxygen.
Look into different hosts with mutli-drug efflux pump components knocked out to attempt to contain melanin with in colonies so it doesn't diffuse on the plate.
Make up strains and stocks of EVERYTHING and organise storage
retransform violacein and melanin into Top10, make glycerol stocks
also, transform violacein and melanin into MG1655 strain to see if we get better pigment expression
Evidence suggests that the efflux of melanin from bacterial cells may be controlled by multi-drug transporters endogenous to e. coli [2]
The acrEF transporter referenced in the paper targets indoles for explusion from the cell - melanin (or di-hydroxyindole) could thus be a potential substrate for this transporter, which shows a broad range of export products
The acrAB transporter is also implicated in the efflux of a large variety of molecules, from dyes to antiobiotics [3]
Knockouts of these transporters may contain melanin within the cells, preventing diffusion into the surrounding media and allowing a pixelated production of pigment
Looking to the future, pyocyanin diffusion out of the cells (which may prove to be a problem from inspection of Pseudomonas expression of the pigment) may also be limited by one of these deletions in a multi-drug transporter
Suitable strains containing the knockouts were later requested from Philip Oliver of the Cambridge Genetics Dept.

UIUC-Illinois,2012,Team:UIUC-Illinois#Notebook#MeetingNotes_-_-_TEXT.html," meeting on Friday. Used the new nuclease free water (which appears to be working well!) Have to order new primers for the PUF-binding YFP construct. Will be gone Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Barrier to ordering Uros’s tethers - doesn’t have the mutant sequence from Dr. Wong.  - Divya - replated transformations of WT PUF biobrick, Isiah did a colony PCR that might have been successful but will redo it tomorrow. If it is confirmed, the PUF biobricking is complete. Will be continuing on with the Washington characterization tomorrow, talked to Jin’s lab about GCMS.
Monday, 8/6/12  - Angela, PUF - sequencing results are not back yet. Perhaps the concentration was too low. Cotransformations have been performed and obtained colonies. The first protein test was inconclusive, but the colonies don’t fluoresce.... perhaps the YFP has become degraded. Ended up characterizing E0030 by mistake, because out of nowhere it works. Will be working on lac Z characterization as well.  - Anthony, PUF - did a protein gel to analyze WT PUF expression. Under arabinose, it looks that there is not much expression. Transformed into BL21 to see if that works better. Will test DH5a once more, and if that yields the same result than the BL21 will be used. The problem could be the T7 promoter.  - Arabinose problems - Angela researched LB and it’s very rich, probably has arabinose. So will need to use M9 instead because it won’t have arabinose.  - Asha - completed all the interviews for human practices, will work with Divya to tie human practice to publicity. Will go home and edit videos like crazy =)  - Divya - working on an article for the daily illini. Will be trying to coordinate a practice session that will also function as a seminar for critique. Will invite IGB, general public, and BioE department. Also, quad day!  - Divya, characterization - ran a control of the GCMS today. Need to confirm that the controls worked. needs someone else to run the rest of the tests on the GCMS tomorrow. The tubes are all prepared and it’s really easy. It will take about an hour. Adi will take care of it.  - Adi - is now updated with the PUF project, and now needs a PHAT project update. Needs them to work on the business plan.  - Bob - has been helping"

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#Results-content_-_-_TEXT.html," caused by the use of different promoters on fluorescence emission and thus on GFP expression
Figure 5: Effects caused by the use of different promoters on fluorescence emission and thus on RFP expression
The observed results were expected due to variations in promoter and backbone. The pSB1C3 is described as a high-copy plasmid, whereas pSB3K3 is a low-copy plasmid. High-copy plasmids occur with a high number of copies inside the bacterial cell. This can be observed in fluorescence emission data wherein the construct GFP0, consisting of a low-copy plasmid with a stronger constitutive promoter showed substantially lower amounts of GFP expression compared to GFP1, which consisted of a high-copy plasmid with a strong constitutive promoter (figure 4). The same tendency could be observed for RFP (figure 5). RFP0 being GFP0 red fluorescent counterpart also expressed much lower amounts of RFP compared to RFP1 consisting of a high-copy plasmid, and RFP driven by a strong constitutive promoter. Beside the backbone, the promoter as well had a strong effect on protein expression. The fluorescence emission being relative to the amount of expressed protein showed higher values in constructs with GFP or RFP under the control of a strong constitutive promoter rather than a weak constitutive promoter.  Therefore, protein expression was dependent on two main factors: (a) strength of the promoter and (b) copy number of the plasmid. Both affected the fluorescent protein yield substantially. The comparative analysis furthermore showed that a weak promoter resulted in fluorescent protein expression than a low-copy plasmid. Thus it can be concluded that the right choice of promoter is inevitable for high protein yields.
Comparison of GFP and RFP – Extra Credit
For a comparative analysis of GFP and RFP expression both fluorescent proteins were tested under the same conditions. Therefore, we first constructed all correspondent analogues with RFP instead of GFP as protein of interest. Furthermore, the fluorescence emission of GFP and RFP were determined after identical cultivation and measurement conditions. As shown in figure 5 observations similar to GFP were made for RFP expression. The fluorescence emission and thus RFP yield is affected by the promoter strength as well as varying backbone. A high-copy backbone as well as a strong promoter (RFP1) resulted in the strongest red fluorescence. The copy number of the plasmid had a similar effect as already observed in GFP expression and led to a lower RFP yield. The strongest effect was caused by the promoter strength. The weak constitutive promoter led to the lowest fluorescence emission in RFP as well as"

Knockout designs in our project
Pex 9
Pex9 is a recently discovered import receptor for PTS1 proteins, which is induced by oleate and is an import receptor for both malate synthase isoenzymes Mls1p and Mls2p. In order to get a completely empty reaction room, a Pex9 knockout was designed to prevent unintended protein import.
Pex 31 & Pex 32
It has been shown that knockouts of Pex31 and Pex32 leads to an increased Peroxisomal size, but additionally the membrane permeability was affected ( Zhou et al. 2016 ). This effect can be used as a tool for engineering membrane permeability by knocking out or overexpress both genes. A knockout would lead to an increased permeability and one could think of an opposite effect in case of overexpression, but this has not been shown yet.

We fused INPNC and MVN together to anchor MVN on the outer membrane. MVN is oriented outwards into the medium to recognize and bind to the specific cyanobactera cells. We added a 10 aa flexible protein domain linker in between to make sure that MVN and INPNC can function separately without much mutual interference. The fusion protein INPNC-MVN is expressed under a library of constitutive promoters including BBa_J23106, BBa_J23105, BBa_J23114, BBa_J23117 and BBa_J23113. We also designed our E. coli to express GFP at the same time. The E. coli cells were later co-incubated with M. aeruginosa and observed under the fluorescence microscope afterwards. The fluorescence of GFP and chlorophyll A can help mark our E. coli and M. aeruginosa so that we could identify the binding effect later.
Figure 3. Schematic representation of the binding reaction between E. coli and Microcystis aeruginosa. INPNC anchors at the outer membrane of the E. coli and displays MVN on its C terminus. Linker1 is the blue strand between INP C-domain and MVN . MVN has one Man &#945(1 &#8594 2) Man binding site which is a typical component in the LPS of the M. aeruginosa. E. coli and M. aeruginosa are bound together by the intermolecular force.
In addition to this E. coli - M. aeruginosa binding assay, we also designed two additional tests. One test is a direct binding assay with M. aeruginosa and purified MVN protein to prove the binding ability of MVN directly and the other test is a rTEV protease digestion assay to estimate the amount of MVN oriented outwards. Detailed information will be described in the Results.

We carried out a binding assay using purified MVN protein and M. aeruginosa to test the binding ability of the MVN produced by our E. coli. A similar MVN binding assay has been carried out by Kehr, J.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," Vilnius University to make synthetic biology a part of study programmes.
3. The third thing we want to focus on is developing a society with qualified scientific workforce in synthetic biology. We are eager to encourage students to turn to life sciences and especially to synthetic biology. We need to ensure that next generation of scientists are well equipped with wide range of opportunities so more people would be encouraged to seek career related to synthetic biology. To achieve this goal, we not only have to fulfill the first part of our vision - to raise interest of synthetic biology in the society - but also to show specific ways in pursuing such a career. We believe that the collaborative spirit between academia and industry could help us. That said, in addition to previous actions we are planning to:
Establish a stakeholder map for students who are interested in synthetic biology but are not familiar with career options in the field.
Establish a mentoring programme for students in life sciences, wherein the academia and industry professionals would share their experience and guide students as well as their future.
The first steps
Soon after the establishment of the new strategy and goals, we have started to accomplish our short-term goals which include educating general public on synthetic biology topics. First, we have discussed the field of synthetic biology on the national radio. We talked about what the synthetic biology is, what can it bring and what are the biological and ethical concerns that people should discuss and be aware of.
Together with Microbiology Society we have hosted the first International Microorganism Day (IMD) in Lithuania. We shed some light on how we work with bacteria in the laboratory and how synthetic biology comes in the picture. Participants of the event had a chance to engage in the practical activities and lectures on how we can use microorganisms to get new biological parts and use those parts to create new complex systems. This first international Microorganism Day event in Lithuania was a lot different than the events happening all over the world as it contained a separate Synthetic Biology section.
However, educating the general public is not enough. We believe that synthetic biology introduction to Life and physical science students is an even more important thing to do, in order to spark their interest in biological engineering.
To achieve that we have established an ongoing cycle of lectures on various synthetic biology topics. The goal of this cycle was to familiarize students with the engineering concepts and how to apply them for biological design. Students have a chance to get to know successful examples of biological design and how to integrate fundamental knowledge in various areas into designing a biological system. We have already held the first 2 lectures in which many Life and Physical science have actively participated.
During the first lecture we have"

In both of these positions I learned cell and molecular biology techniques that I use to further my research on regulation of development in yeast. Synthetic biology is fascinating to me in that it has led researchers to discover systems that we didn't know existed in bacterial cells and use them in interesting ways to ask important questions in other cell types. Working with the iGEM team is of interest to me because I like to be involved in guiding students as they pursue their research into areas of gene regulation. I am so amazed and impressed by our iGEM group members as each student brings an interesting set of skills and perspectives to thinking about this project. Team work and communication are the core to generating new ideas!
Jamie Cook
Graduate Advisor
My name is Jamie Cook and I am one of Dalhousie’s iGEM team mentors. I am a new master’s student at Dalhousie University, and I am interested in bacterial-host interactions. I just recently graduated from the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton with an honours degree in biology, concentrations in microbiology and molecular biology, and a minor Psychology. I am very interested in synthetic biology because I believe it is a greener method to produce chemicals compared to previous methods, which generated harmful by-products. I also find it fascinating how we can use bacteria such as E. coli, and use them as mini factories to generate desired chemicals.

Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," attended a tabling event where girls could chat with us about our experiences in biological, chemical, and computer engineering - all of which are components of the work that we completed through our iGEM projects. We also spoke to them about our past projects.
Second, we hosted a lab tour for students who showed specific interest in biological or biomedical engineering. During this portion, we went into detail about our project timeline, the biological principles behind this year’s project OxyPonics, the uses of all of the laboratory equipment, and what made us want to enter engineering. Our team also has the unique culture of being very student driven, which has let us explore what interests us most in the problems we tackle and engineering solutions we develop. The young women who visited us said they felt inspired to pursue biological engineering. They were determined to break boundaries in the different fields of engineering.
Prefreshman Summer Program
Every year, Cornell Office of Undergraduate Biology hosts a science outreach program for the incoming freshmen on campus who are part of the Prefreshman Summer Program (PSP). A variety of engineering project teams, such as iGEM, and undergraduate scientists give lab tours and participate in a panel discussion where the incoming freshmen can learn what it is like to work in a lab and how to get involved in science on campus. We showed freshmen around our lab, including specific equipment and their purposes, talked them through what iGEM is and what our past and present projects are, and answered any questions they had about how to get involved in science at Cornell. Many of the pre-freshmen showed great interest in joining a project team or doing research on campus.
Summer Institute for Life Sciences - hosted by Cornell Office of Undergraduate Biology
Every summer the Office of Undergraduate Biology at Cornell University runs summer events as part of a program called the Summer Institute of Life Sciences. At the end of the summer, there is a culmination symposium. This year our team chose to give a 10-minute presentation at the seventh annual SILS symposium. This opportunity to share our work on OxyPonics with the Cornell community and visiting summer student researchers also gave us a chance to get valuable feedback from professors during the question and answer session. We also were able to learn about some really cool research other students were working on!

Proof of Concept
The TALEs are a very fundamental part of our project this year. In order to have a functioning system for E. coli detection, we need to have proteins that will successfully recognize and bind our DNA. However, before we can actually create and use TALEs to bind to E. coli DNA, we need to have a proof of concept. On the iGEM parts registry we came across TALEs that the Slovenian team synthesized for a previous project. TALEs are very large proteins and take a long time to design and synthesize. Therefore, we decided to use these TALEs to test our system. We also saw this as an opportunity to use and build upon parts made by former iGEM teams. Thus, we ordered their three TALEs: TALA ( BBa_K782004 ), TALB ( BBa_K782006 ), and TALD  ( BBa_K782005 ).
We used TALA( BBa_K782004 ) and TALB ( BBa_K782006 ) to build our constructs and test our system, as it requires the use of two different TALE proteins. To test our TALEs, we had to synthesize the target sequences that they would recognize and bind to. We constructed a series of target sequences in order to test the binding affinity. Some sequences were directly corresponding with the TALE protein sequence, while some had certain base pair alterations. These mutations will allow us to test the binding affinity of the TALE when it encounters a non-exact target sequence. In this way, we can determine how specific these proteins really are and how they"
HUST-China,2015,Team:HUST-China#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," conditions of strains domestication and little of their research involves integrating favorable properties of different species by means of synthetic biology. Thus, it’s meaningful to spread the idea of synthetic biology to more researchers in the interdisciplinary field and offer them a new perspective in their study, which is also conducive to popularize synthetic biology.
In addition, there are also challenges in the development of new technologies. The safety issue and supervision system must be ensured in the applying of synthetic biology technologies. To achieve these goals, instead of concentrating on short- term economic benefits, we must have a long-term vision in the development. There is still a long way ahead for synthetic biology to go, and we hope to constantly make our effort on it.
Project-in-action: meeting with other iGEM teams
While promoting our project, we also attended several conferences and shared ideas with iGEM teams from different universities and countries.
Meetup in Wuhan
iGEM teams from WHU, HZAU and HUST held a seminar in Wuhan University, during which we exchanged ideas about the progress of our projects and discussed existing problems. We also reached the consensus to establish Wuhan iGEM Committee in the future and held conferences and Science Fair at regular intervals to spread the idea of synthetic biology.

2015 iGEM conference held by NCTU
NCTU iGEM conference is the largest and the most experienced iGEM conference in Asia. During the conference, we were able to share our ideas with teams from different Asian countries, and they also gave us many valuable suggestions. The iGEM team leader from SYSU suggested us to enlarge the scale of our microbial silt reinforcement study, such as applying it at the Loess Plateau which is the upstream region of the 2nd longest river in China, the Yellow River. This region is facing severe problem of soil and water losses in long time. Those new ideas gave us a new inspiration for our future projects and we appreciated the help from all iGEMers!

The vectorization
Vectorization principle [1]
The delivery of a therapeutic molecule to an organ, a tissue, or a cell constitutes today a major challenge. From the beginning of the century, the scientist Paul Ehrlich was already dreaming about « magic bullet » able to transport an active principle in a specific way to its action site. Today, Paul Ehrlich’s dream is nearly real thank to pharmaceutical vectorization development.
Several active principles present, indeed, physico-chemical properties (hydrophily, molecular weight etc…) not in favor of the biologic barrier transit. This barrier separates the administration site from the action site. Other active molecules bump into enzymatic barrier which lead to their degradation and their fast metabolism.
In a general way, it is necessary to notice that barriers are very complex systems made of several elements (epithelium, endothelium, cell membrane) and several components (mechanical, physico-chemical and enzymatic barriers). The therapeutic concentration obtained at the action site is only possible to the detriment of an important loss of medicine to other tissues or cells which leads to important toxic effects and sometimes prohibitive.
Moreover, biotechnologies development gives the access to recombinant proteins and cloned genes, in high quantity. In a same way, progress in organic chemistry on support permits oligopeptides and oligonucleotides creation. These molecules are, probably, the base of tomorrow medicines: highly selective in a molecular way, they lead to endogenous metabolites, which mean non-toxic. However, physico-chemical characteristics and biomimetic of these molecules makes them hard to administer. They are"

Lab 1
At another early morning start, the Labpats began by digesting yesterday’s PCR. Next, they looked at the plates from the motility test, and were pleasantly surprised to see that they looked as expected and grew nicely. They were also able to conclude that the toothpick method worked a lot better than the drop method, as the motility was clearly shown by the expanding non-motile colonies. Aftwards, they made a gel for the PCR digest, ran the gel, and cut the bands. Finally, the students grew up the backbone-RhlR from yesterday’s plates.

On Thursday the 12th, the RX lab students commenced their day by heading to base where they began work on multiple projects. Jonah and Max grew up culture to use for the cinnamaldehyde testing which would occur the next day. Peter, Chris, and Travis took the iGEM Interlab liquid culture samples and worked to patch all 32 samples and freezing down 8 of the samples in the -80 oC freezer (1 from the NEG Control, 1 from POS Control, and 1 from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). A portion of this frozen down culture will be used for the following day as part of the Interlab protocol.  The team then headed to UES where they discovered that a few of the biofuel companies that Chris had contacted had emailed back with information. One wanted to have a conference call with the team, and another wanted to publish an article about the iGEM team, which Jason offered to write.  The students emailed the companies back to try set dates for these appointments. They also continued work writing the lyrics.

TAS_Taipei,2015,Team:TAS Taipei#wetlab_-_-_TEXT.html," with genetically modified products. Given this information, we imagine that the public would be fearful of using biopharmaceuticals where living bacteria is used either in or on the body. We wanted to design the least invasive and most socially acceptable method of drug delivery: a topical solution where bacteria (our chassis) is prevented from entering into the body, and the only thing delivered is the GzmB inhibitor.
We envision two different drug delivery methods, for either localized or general treatment. Localized treatment focuses on topical delivery of our inhibitor ACT3m into targeted inflamed areas through a bandage (Figure 14). On the other hand, general treatment of the entire body can be achieved using a cream (containing our inhibitor; Figure 23).
Control of GzmB Inhibitor Device
Since we want to design topical prototypes for our drug delivery, we first needed to make sure that contact with skin doesn't directly activate our temperature-senstiive promoter. We still want to retain control of when to start expression of our GzmB inhibitor. The skin temperatures of different areas were measured using an infrared thermometer.
Average temperatures for different areas are shown in Figure 13. The overall average temperature is 33.35 ⁰C, which is safely below the activation temperature. These results demonstrate that contact with skin will not activate the device directly, and we can still control its expression by application of a heat pack.
Figure 13. Average skin temperatures are below the activation temperature of our temperature-sensitive promoter. Average skin temperature was collected using an infrared thermometer gun. 100 individuals were measured for the skin temperatures of their forehead, arm, palm, neck, and knee.
Localized Treatment: Bandage
Figure 14. Cross section of bandage prototype design. Our bandage uses a semi-permeable membrane (dotted blue lines) to keep bacteria (green) growing on a thin piece of LB agar (yellow interior). The pores of the membrane are small enough to prevent bacteria, but allow our final GzmB inhibitor, to pass through.
Our first prototype focuses on localized conditions (such as wounds), where a bandage may be applied to deliver our GzmB inhibitor. Because we want to keep bacteria outside of the human body, we needed to design a prototype that would retain bacteria inside our bandage (Figure 14).
We decided to use a semi-permeable membrane with pores small enough to retain the bacteria within our bandage, but large enough to allow proteins to diffuse through. Since the size of E. coli is 0.5µm x 2µm, we used a mixed"

The similarity between all five mussel foot proteins is that they contain a certain amount of tyrosine. The exact amount of tyrosine relates to the final function of the protein. Tyrosine is namely the compound gives adhesive properties to the protein. After hydroxylation of tyrosine, by tyrosinase and additional required compounds, an extra hydroxyl-group is added to the benzene ring, which will lead to an active catechol-group.  (Haemers, 2003) The catechol-groups in the DOPA can form strong bonds with catechol-groups on adjacent DOPA molecules.  The internal strength of the mussel glue (so called cohesion) is based on the amount of cross-links between polymer chains of the individual adhesive proteins. The “free” catechol groups, thus those which do not cross-link, determine the adhesive properties of the glue. (Waite, 1985) (Pizzi, Mittal and Dekker, 1994)
The five mussel foot proteins seem to differ on one hand by the content of DOPA present in the protein and on the other hand the presence of the other residues. The other residues determine par example if the protein is able to form disulphide bonds etc. (Haemers. 2003) During our project we focus on mfp5, since this mussel foot protein has the highest content of DOPA, which is beneficial for our StickE. Coli.
Biofilms
Using the term biofilm, matrix-enclosed bacterial populations can be described. This extracellular matrix, which is also referred to as slime, is a complex formation, containing a wide variety of compounds such as extracellular DNA, proteins and polysaccharides . There are numerous bacterial species which form biofilms. Usually, the structure of a biofilm consist of more than one bacterial species. As one can understand, this all together makes formation of and the structure of a biofilm extremely complex and difficult to control and regulate.
On the other hand, the “idea” of biofilms could be very useful for many applications in industry for example  water-treatment facilities. As a result, in our project we aim to completely control the attachment and detachment of cells on substrate. Therefore, we will give Escherichia coli a simple, effective and controllable mechanism for binding on surfaces, namely binding by"

We sequenced BBa_K797002 and confirmed that stop codon did not appear when we used it in Standard and 3A assembly. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a target protein, we constructed plasmid of plac-RBS-TorA-GFP-DT and introduced it into E.coli. After that, we observed the TorA-GFP-fusion-expressing cells (Fig.2-3) suggesting that the TorA-GFP fusion was successfully expressed. This meant RBS in our TorA signal worked well and stop codon didn't appear after assembly.

Kil protein enables proteins to go through outer membrane
Fig.2-5 Kil protein makes holes on outer membrane.
With Tat secretion pathway, FT protein can be transported into the periplasm. Next, FT protein needs to move to the outside of E.coli. For secretion, we used kil protein, which is derived from λ phage. Kil protein makes holes in the outer membrane of E.coli. So in our project, we introduced kil gene into E.coli. But the function of outer membrane is essential for E.coli to survive. Overexpression of kil gene, therefore, causes cell death. For this reason, we must check whether kil gene is harmful or not under our condition.
Kil protein had no significant effect on E.coli's growth
We made the construction plac-RBS-kil-double terminator, whose backbone is pSB3C5. After culturing for 18hr at 37℃, we removed the supernatant, and diluted it to OD600=0.1. Then we resuspend it. And then, we added 0/0.001/0.01/0.1/1mM IPTG to each. While culturing again at 37℃, we measured OD600, which indicate the density of E.coli. The figure below shows the results"

Magnetotaxis
Magnetotactic bacteria are gram-negative, motile (by means of a flagella) bacteria. Each one forms a string of intracellular magnetic grains, known as magnetosomes.
Figure 1: Transmission electron micrograph of Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum showing the magnetosomes inside the bacteria. Bar equals 1 micron. [1]
The term magnetotaxis, used to describe the motion of the bacteria in the direction of the magnetic field, denotes the magnetic field effects, solely, on the direction of the bacteria, and not on the speed of the bacteria.
Naturally occurring magnetotactic bacteria will instinctively travel in the direction of the geomagnetic field. It controls the bacteria in the same way as it would control a compass needle, aligning them both to magnetic north pole. [2]
Although the magnetic field forces the alignment of the bacteria, they experience no further magnetic force. All of the propulsion is produced from the flagella force.
The shift of the bacteria towards the magnetic field lines is controlled by the strength of the magnetis field and the magnetic moment of the bacteria. The probability of a moment making an angle between theta and some small increment added on to theta is:
where m = bacteria magnetic moment, B = magnetic field strength, k = Boltzmann constant, T = temperature in Kelvins and where the denominator is the total number of magnetic moments and there is a factor of 2*pi*radius^2 cancelled out.
This equation can be used to generate a distribution of the angles that a group of bacteria make with the magnetic field direction. As shown in the graph below [3] :
This distribution is known as the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Sampling from this provides a more accurate representation of the motion of the magnetotactic e. coli in BSim.
BSim allows the user to control the magnetic field strength, B and the magnetic moment, m of the bacteria.

A further six 1.5 mL tubes were put on ice; 21 μL of nuclease free water was added to three tubes, and 1.7 μg pSB1C3-J23100-sfGFP plasmid DNA from the same stock solution was added to the remaining three. Tubes containing DNA were made up to 21 μL with nuclease-free water. CFPS master mix (29 μL) was then added to all tubes, which were vortexed and transferred to a 96-well plate. The plate was incubated in a BMG Labtech Fluostar Optima at 370C for 4.25 hours with fluorescence readings (excitation: 485 nm, emission: 510 nm) every 15 mins. Figure 3 shows that over time, fluorescence intensity increased in systems with DNA encoding for sfGFP compared to systems with no DNA. Hence, the system had CFPS activity.
Figure 2: Plasmid map for pSB1C3-sfGFP. Construct is standard biobrick part BBa_ K515105.
Figure 3: Negative corrected fluorescence for E. coli BL21 extract-based CFPS systems. Each data point is an average of 3 replicate reactions, and error bars represent +/- standard error.
Design Stage 1
Previous research has shown that the concentration of certain salts in the CFPS supplement premix are crucial for maximal protein synthesis activity (Yang et al. 2012). A Design of Experiments approach was used to determine which of the four salts (magnesium glutamate, potassium glutamate, sodium oxalate, and ammonium acetate) are the most important using the JMP software. A classical screening design was created with all four salts as continuous factors and CFPS activity as the response to be maximised. A concentration of ‘0’ was used as the lower limit for each factor, and the concentration used normally in CFPS supplement premixes was used as the upper limit. The main effects screening design was then used to generate the experimental design.
Table 2: Table of reactions performed according to the DoE salt supplement screening design. CFPS reactions contained concentrations of each salt supplement according to the table above. The pattern column shows whether a salt was present (✔)  or absent (X) from the system.

Waterloo,2011,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," be spread within a hospital but also within the community, there are quite a few demographics that would gain value in understanding the benefit of the Staphiscope.
Hospital Setting
At least 2% of patients in hospitals or health-care facilities are likely to carry a strain of Staphylococcus Aureus that is resistant to antibiotics such as Methicillin. The following individuals are susceptible in contracting an MRSA infection:
Individuals who have weak immune systems
People receiving kidney dialysis or cancer treatments
Individuals who have been hospitalized or have had surgery over the past year
MRSA within the Community
Patients who are discharged may have an inactive form of MRSA that remains colonized in their system. Thus, those who live within the community are still at risk of acquiring and suffering from antibiotic resistant Staph infections that are relatively more virulent. MRSA has been detected and acquired by healthy people in both institutionalized and individual based settings. The following individuals are susceptible in contracting MRSA in the community:
Day-care facilities or facilities in which equipment of personal items are shared
Military bases
Individuals who get tattoos
The Strategy
In the field of synthetic biology, there is an unrecognized paradox that hinders the level of interdisciplinary communication between the scientific and non-scientific community. The stigmas built outside the realms of a scientific community grow at a greater rate than a scientist’s ability to answer the plethora of questions surrounding the regulation, safety and potentiality of these synthetic biology technologies.  Another problem lies in a scientific institution’s inclination to address the ethical concerns surrounding their synthetic biology technology or process. Generally an individual who has not be previously exposed to the field, will construct an ethical judgement proceeding the phase where a company is about to commercialize their product. At this critical stage of a company’s product plan, stakeholders are reluctant in addressing these ethical concerns as it may discourage their ability to advance and innovate their existing technology.  Regardless of the threats that these ethical judgments have previously imposed, there is a necessity in developing an approach in which the end result is an internationally renowned sense of public acceptance and support.  “Without public support and understanding of research into synthetic biology, both funding and regulation are unlikely to support significant scientific advances” (Gaisser, et. al, 2009). To address this issue, an expert committee in Europe supported by the New and Emerging Science and Technology programme set out a roadmap that outlines the four interconnected attributes that will instil a sense of public acceptance within the non-scientific community. These four attributes are:

David puts a lot of                             effort in the human practices group by organizing various events and activities for the public.                             He is a very sociable person who is not shy to contact people from other teams or the professionals.                             It is really a good thing to have him in the human practices group!
Our Advisors
Luna Eresta JAYA, Luna
The Good Teacher.
Luna taught us a lot of useful wet lab skills on our lab training                             tutorial. She often makes sure our team know where we are focusing and will guide us to the right                             direction. Especially for human practices, she always gives amazing advice to modify our plans.
Ka Man TAM, Sabrina
One of our best advisors that we are pleased to have.
She has taught us so many                             things in the lab and also in theory. She gives us advice from the very beginning of the project                             throughout the whole journey. Her advice on the project design and troubleshooting helps us to                             make our project better.
Tze Wing MAK, Tiffany
Our IT backup.
Tiffany knows well the importance of the wiki page. She gave us                             a lot of useful tips and helped us tackling technical problems. She appears to be very serious,                             but once she warms up, she has a pretty silly side too. She likes to call the iGEM girls ""Dua                             eng"" (which means ""sweetheart"" in Thai)
Mike DOROTHEA, Mike
The past secretary from last year's team.
Mike keeps us on a good manner for recording                             meeting minutes as well as all the public documents. She is a perfectionist who will make sure                             we follow the right nomenclature in all publications and annotate gel photo correctly.
Kar On CHENG, Karen
Our Lab Guider.
Karen ensures we do our lab work properly. She is very patient                             to our questions, always raises and gives useful suggestions to all the module groups and the                             auxiliary group. We are very pleased to have her!
Shek Chun LOI, Danson
The Elder Brother.
From what Katie have said, Danson ""looks so old that was thought as a postgraduate"".                             However, he is actually a nice advisor that he answer our questions and gave suggestions. He                             often gave advices that guide us into the right"

Entrepreneurship
The Fine Arts Department at the School of Visual Arts is well poised with it’s own Bio Art lab. In the lab environmentally friendly soil analysis products are being investigated to replace existing, often toxic, products available on the market. SVA’s Bio Art’s initial product, constructed in conjunction with our own multi media installation, Soiled, is a microfluidic cartridge. It is a portable device geared towards the urban gardener for testing nutrients in soil samples.
The Opportunity
LaMotte is the leading firm involved in soil analysis. Customer loyalty has been gained as a result of it’s consistent quality products as well as the limited competition offering these services.
Development stage I of Soiled reduced volumes of test chemicals by utilizing a spectrophotometer to provide digital, precise readings in parts per million (ppm) of levels of nutrients. The prototype device is a portable stage and is designed to be compatible with a range of smart devices and their cameras.
Development stage II is intended to replace most of the toxic chemicals used in current soil tests with biosensors that are environmentally friendlier. A software update will be introduced in order to provide more precise readings of nutrient levels in soil tests.

08/09/2015
Congo red liquid assay: After induction of 24 hours at room temperature the following results were acquired. The strains were ΔCsgA_pSB1C3_CsgA and  ΔCsgA_pSB1C3 induced with 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3% rhamnose, in duplicate.
11/09/2015
The plasmids pSB1C3_CsgA_Spytag_RFP-mut and pSB1C3_BC_M were isolated from overnight cultures. They were then sent for sequencing.
Western blot was done to see if quantification of amount of CsgA_His could be reached.
Cultures were grown 09/09 overnight of ΔCsgA_pSB1C3_CsgA and  ΔCsgA_pSB1C3_CsgA_His in 2mL LB+CAM. The cultures were then diluted to an OD600 of 0,05 on the 10th of september. The cultures were then grown for 1.5 hours at 37°C. The cultures were then induced with 0, or 5% rhamnose, and induced for 5 hours and overnight at 30°C. After incubation the cells were spun down for 20 minutes at 4000 rpm, at 4°C. The pellets were stored in the freezer at -20°C. They were resuspended (11/09) in 4mL LB. The OD600 of the cells were measured and centrifuged 15 minutes at 4000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in sample buffer to obtain an OD600 of 10. The cells were then heated for lysis, at 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 32000 rpm at 4°C. The supernatant and pellet were stored separately at -20°C.
The teeth experiment were analyzed, after 44 hours of induction, with Typhoon. The teeth were separated from the attached bacteria by vortexing with ethanol. The amount of attached bacteria were checked using the plate reader.  The experiment was repeated twice.

Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

Store
For each PCR product a gel electrophoresis is made to make sure that the PCR product has the correct size.  7-10µl loading buffer is added to each 50µl PCR product and the samples are run in 2% agarose. The Gel electrophoresis were set on 75V for 30-60 minutes (according to the length of the product).
Purification of PCR Product
Materials
GFX PCR DNA and Gel band purification Kit from GE healthcare is used to purify the PCR product after gel electrophoresis.
Preparations
Ethanol is added to the Wash Buffer 1 and the label is marked. Store in airtight container.
Procedures - GE healthcare protocol
Sample Capture
A DNase-free 1,5 ml eppendorf tube is weighed, and the weight is noted.
By using long wavelength (365 nm) ultraviolet light and minimal exposure time, the sample in the gel is visualized. A clean scalpel is used to cut out an the sample from the agarose gel. The agarose gel band is placed into a DNase-free 1,5 ml eppendorf tube and weighed. The weight of the agarose band is calculated.
10 μl Capture buffer type 3 is added for each 10 mg of gel slice. Never use less than 300 μl Capture buffer type 3.
The Capture buffer type 3-sample mix is mixed by inversion and incubated at 60°C for 15–30 minutes until the agarose is completely dissolved. The sample is mixed by inversion every 3 minutes
For each purification a GFX MicroSpin column is placed into a Collection tube.
Sample Binding
The Capture buffer type 3-sample mix is centrifuged briefly to collect the liquid at the bottom of the DNase-free 1,5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
Up to 800 μl Capture buffer type 3- sample mix is transferred to the assembled GFX MicroSpin column.
The sample is incubated at room temperature for 1 minute.
The sample is centrifuged for 30 s at 16 000 × g. The flow-through is discarded.
Repeat the sample binding until all sample is loaded.
Wash and Dry

Hello, I am Mark Shen, come from BFSU-ICC. I have always considered as a science student, which is also the reason why I dropped economics after one year of working, and chose to be study biology as a new subject. It seems that books and basketball will always follow me in school-a bottle of water as well, but the main thing I do back home is to focus on improving my knowledge of different aspects.  There are two reasons why I have become one part of our iGEM team: recommendation from my friends, and my preference to this project. I have then become a part of the Wiki team, which means I had to learn HTML5 and JavaScript. Even though it is a hard time, but I am still glad I got over through it.

2016: Officials Fear Some Olympic Athletes Might Be Altering Their Genes To Cheat In Rio
Sarah Everts reported for Chemical and Engineering News that officials planned to test 2016 Rio athletes' tissue samples for markers of gene doping. The most likely subject of a genetic hack appears to be the gene that codes for EPO. Therefore, this gene became what the officials planned to test for. ( Letzter et al. 2016 )
Athletes at Rio Olympics Face Advanced Antidoping Technology
According to the International Olympic Committee’s medical and scientific director, Richard Budgett, samples collected in Rio will be tested for gene doping at some point after the games, even though the test hasn’t been run during the Olympics itself. ( Everts, 2016 )
2017: Doping Control Analysis at the Rio 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games
The EPO gene is mostly expressed in renal cells, from where the EPO protein is secreted into the bloodstream. The identification of any concentration of EPO DNA sequences  in blood however, are considered a positive result for gene doping within current detection methods. Considering the growing concern over gene doping, as well as the EPO availability of new molecular biology tools, the Brazilian Doping Control Laboratory (LBCD) implemented, improved, and validated 2 amplification assays for EPO cDNA using the real-time PCR instrument QuantStudio12K (Thermo Fisher, São Paulo, Brazil). All work was performed with WADA-certified reference material for EPO gene doping within a range of 1 to 4000 copies of reference material spikes and EPO gene-doping-positive samples. However, in view of the absence of interlaboratory tests among the laboratories accredited by WADA, the analysis was not performed on the Olympic samples; it was only performed on samples selected exclusively for research. ( Pereira, et al. 2017 )

Fig 2.Binding of chlorophyll to MZHWK  complex as shown by green pellet on left indicting chlorophyll has associated with insoluble pellet fraction (Tube 1, from left). Corresponding  soluble fraction is shown in Tube 2. In contrast, chlorophyll does not associate with the Cas9 control cells with the majority of the chlorophyll   remaining in the soluble fraction following centrifugation (Tube 4, far right) and is not found associated with insoluble pellet fraction (Tube 3).
To investigate the function of this complex, as suggested by    Prof Willows and Prof Chen, we performed a chlorophyll binding experiment on MZHWK fractions (used in Fig 1 SDS-PAGE). The majority of the    complex was found in the insoluble pellet fraction (Fig 1. lane 4). We tested chlorophyll binding by mixing the insoluble membrane pellet    fraction with purified chlorophyll, and we observed that the pellet turns green, while an unrelated inclusion body remains white; the supernatant   of the unrelated protein control remains green, while the MZHWK supernatant turns clear. This provides evidence that the MZHWK protein complex    binds chlorophyll."

Did we include and design features to reduce risks?
The project does not currently include any risk-reducing features, beyond what is usual lab practice (genes on plasmids, antibiotic susceptibility, debilitated e.coli strain).
If the project was expanded to an industrial scale, our organism could be made susceptible to a specific antibiotic, perhaps one that is already a part of water sterilization procedures.

Yeast as a Chassis
Escherichia coli is often used as the model prokaryotic organism. Similarly, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is often considered to be the model eukaryotic organism. S. cerevisiae is just one species of budding yeast, but it has been used for baking and fermentation since antiquity. Human use of yeast is thought to have begun over 7000 years ago¹.  In fact, S. cerevisiae is commonly known as baker’s yeast or brewer’s yeast, and the scientific name cerevisiae derives from an archaic word for beer.
S. cerevisiae (from now on referred to yeast for short) is classified as a fungus or mold. Although yeast is a single-celled organism, it shares many of the characteristics of other eukaryotes including a nucleus, cytoskeleton, and all of the major membrane-bound subcellular organelles. Also like E. coli, S. cerevisiae has been extensively characterized and, in 1996, its genome became the first fully sequenced eukaryotic genome.²
Figure 1: Budding yeast cells expressing different markers to track division. This process of division is called budding because when a yeast cell replicates, smaller daughter cells pinch, or bud, off the mother cell.¹
Below are some more advantages of using yeast as a chassis:
Yeast cells can be easily cultured and have a doubling time of around 90 minutes at 30°C.
Homologous recombination can be used to delete old genes or add new ones when transforming yeast.
Yeast has been adapted for use in both aerobic and anaerobic large scale culture.
Since yeast is a eukaryote, it shares many of the same complex internal structures found in plants and animals but without the high percentage of non-coding DNA found in more complicated eukaryotes.³
Our team decided to use yeast as our chassis for all the reasons listed above, but more specifically because several of the genes for the enzymes we chose to evaluate were isolated from the genome of termites and different fungi. Since we wanted to express genes taken from eukaryotic"

To provide necessary nutrients to the immobilized cells, potassium citrate solution is further replaced by LB medium according to encapsulated cell strain requirements.1,2
Physical containment protocol
Results
We obtained nice beads which are properly jellified and measure about 3 mm as expected.
Alginate beads of bacterial culture
The silica monolith was obtained only when we let it in contact with air.
Alginate beads with few silicate at their surfaces containing bacterial culture
Conclusion and Perspectives
We have succeeded in creating a physical containment for bacteria which is cheap, fast to build and should prevent unintended contacts between GEOs and the environment. Further experiments are recquired in order to test such system. It will be interesting to see if bacteria do not escape from the silica monolith and if they can survive inside it. The Aachen team suggested us different devices to measure the growth rate. The first one can be used to determine biomass concentration using capacity measurements.3 The second one measures growth rate using an optical detection system that is based on measuring the intensity of back-scattered light from bacterial cells suspended in liquid culture.4 A modeling of the physical containment has been made.

UC_San_Diego,2017,Team:UC San Diego#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," Approach for Our Project
Rationale
Although we were curious to see how the implementation of the modified ROBUST method would affect the overall goals of our project, we also realized that there were ethical ramifications to our approach. Therefore, we decided to discuss potential drawbacks and ways to address them. We also wanted a non-research but still scientific perspective that would allow us to acknowledge some of the larger challenges in synthetic biology. Thus, we met with Dr. Reuther, an associate lecturer at UCSD who actually teaches a class based on synbio principles.
Exploration
In our discussion with Dr. Reuther, he also expressed wonder at the goals of our project. However, he cautioned us about some of the drawbacks of using a xenobiotics approach:
Toxicity to host organism
Concern about environmental release
Lack of predictive modeling regarding intermediate metabolites
In addition, he cited that one of the biggest challenges in synthetic biology was the lack of standardization and well-characterized parts. Although the Registration Center of Standard Biological Components contains more than 5000 parts, most of them have only preliminary levels of characterization, thus raising the possibility of an inaccurate description.
From the perspective of an educator, he also suggested that we could use our project as an opportunity to get students more excited about synthetic biology. He noted that although there are a number of biology textbooks, they all follow the same pattern of information, leading to redundancy and lack of creativity.
Deliberation
We confirmed that an accidental release of tagatose-producing cyanobacteria would not pose a sizable environmental risk. In fact, we also modified the genetic constructs to address Dr. Reuther's first concern regarding a mechanism control toxicity from potential. We included a potential riboswitch in the BioBrick construct because it allowed the cyanobacteria to stop producing tagatose when concentrations of substrates and intermediate metabolites became unmanageable.
Point 8: Consultation with the Vlachos Group at the University of Delaware
Rationale
After constructing the metabolic pathway to theoretically enable cyanobacteria to synthesize tagatose starting with naturally present sucrose as a beginning point, we knew that within the time frame, the furthest we would probably get is confirm that the cyanobacteria had produced tagatose as a proof of concept. Therefore, we wanted to get insight from the Vlachos Group about ideal detection methods.
Exploration
In our discussion with one of the postdocs, we realized that our initially proposed method of engineering biocatalysts to bind to tagatose and emit a fluorescent dye was unnecessarily complex and expensive."

Yutian Zhang
Hello, I’m Yutian Zhang, a junior student of College of Life Science, Wuhan University. I fell in love with biology When I was a high school student. I was ravished by the mystic reactions in human body. I almost like playing all sorts of ball games that I could contact, such as basketball, tennis , table tennis, football and so on. IGEM gave a precious opportunity to get on with a lot of outstanding schoolmates and get closed contact with the advancing synthetic biology. For my personal reason, I didn’t finish my job as expected. But I really enjoyed the experiences when we discussed and conducted the experiments.
Wei Hong
As far as I see, Science is the only thing that rules the world. Since my 5-year-old birthday, I have kept trying my best to learn science ,and that becomes one of the reasons why I chose to be a scientist.
To be a scientist! That is my dream and I have been working hard on it for almost 20 years.
That’s me! Wei Hong ,a person who is keen on science .I joined this team to get myself an opportunity to do my own design and turn it into reality.
There’s an old saying in China, A true warrior would never be afraid and he will overcome every obstacle on his way to victory. I believed in this and I know, practice makes perfect. And my dream will come true!

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#ImprovePart_-_-_TEXT.html," metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

As we were really tired after 8 hours in a small car, we were happy that the team from SDU welcomed us with a relaxed day of playing video games and eating pizza after a short tour through their university and laboratories.
Eating pizza... yummy!
The next day we started the more serious part of our cooperation by presenting our iGEM projects to each other. The main purpose was to determine whether any critical information was missing in our slides and whether other teams were able to understand our project. We hope that this examination will help us to improve our ability to express our project ideas at the jamboree at MIT in a short period of time. After the presentations held by each team we started an inspiring discussion and critically reviewed the experiments and results shown by the other team. This debate was aimed to identify gaps in the setup of experimental strategies, in order to be able to redo few experiments with new controls.
At the end of our meeting ideas came up to actually control certain experiments of each group at the laboratories of the other team. With this helping of the partner team we want to secure the reproducibility of our scientific results at another location, done by other people. For this purpose we tested the quality of <partinfo>K343006</partinfo> from the SDU team by quantifying the percentage of different plasmid confirmations (ccc, oc and linear) using CGE ( Experience ). In return the Danish group characterized our <partinfo>K389016</partinfo> according to size and function.
Presentation and discussion
Besides our hard work in Odense we also had a lot of fun with the Danish team. Later that day, we went for a trip in the Old Town of Odense and tried Danish specialties like Danish hot dogs and liquorice ice cream. In preparation of our trip to the US the Danish team invited us to a bowling night the last evening.

Things we did this week
The new mail address is ready to use ( igem@tue.nl ) for PR and sponsoring. After an interesting mail from the other Dutch iGEM teams, we went to a meeting in Amsterdam about the Discovery Festival. It's a festival where science meets art and is organized at Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Eindhoven. Since Friday, we have our own office in the renovated building 'Ceres' at the campus of the Eindhoven University of Technology.
Progression in the lab
Since all the BL21 pYES3-plates were empty, we have to redo the transformation. The one colony grown on the yeast pYES2-plates will be analyzed. The old E. coli containing R- and G-GECO proteins were cultured from the plates, so we can isolate the plasmids for long term storage. To find out whether the yeast contains the red GECO, a culture is put up. Furthermore, we decided to postpone the test of the device on the yeast cells.
We determined the spectra with a Trisma buffer and concluded that the fluorescence of the GECO decreases again when the calcium concentration is increased. This is contradictory to what we expected. It seems that the GECOs we have in the freezer are already statured with calcium, so adding more CaCl2 solution will only dilute the sample, after which fluorescence decreases. A drawback of using CaCl2 is that it affects the pH of the mixture. The solution is to purify the proteins again, this time by washing with EDTA to drain away the calcium and adding calcium through calcium acetate in a MOPS-buffer afterwards."
Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," directly brings us closer to our ultimate goal, which is the decrease in resistance development and the improved physical health of horses.
Survey Analysis
When we had chosen to create a worm buster, we wanted to see if there was a market for this kind of product. To gain knowledge about the market we conducted a market analysis together with the human practises group. The modeling group worked with creating a analysis program that could use the information from the market analysis and see if correlations could be found between different variables.
Future Possibilities
The small strongyles’ larger cousin, Strongylus Vulgaris, is the most pathogenic parasite in horses, posing a significant threat[1]. They, like small strongyles, live in the grass and and infect the horse after being ingested [3]. During the different larval stages inside the horse, the parasite enters the intestinal blood vessels as a part of their life cycle [4,10]. Because of this, they generally can’t be targeted by deworming drugs or detection methods and can cause major problems for domestic animals [7].
Due to this, an efficient diagnostic tool that can be applied to grass samples are necessary to prevent ingestion of large strongyles. This is why we looked into the possibility of a second worm buster targeting large strongyles could be possible in the future.
Figure 6: Large strongyles.
Symptoms
When the worms migrate into the arteries they cause inflammation in the arterial wall and induce the formation of blood clots. When a small blood clot forms it may form an embolism which can detach and travel in the bloodstream until it reaches and blocks smaller blood vessels. This prevents oxygen and nutrient supply to surrounding tissues and may result in colic [13]. This can cause problems in the animals, with the worst case scenario being death [3].
Having these parasites is obviously a huge problem and there is great need for methods that can detect the parasites before ingestion, preventing infection. This makes the need for the second worm buster even larger.
Current Methods for Detection
To be able to count either small or large strongyles, the current methods require growing their eggs from samples and counting them.  The disadvantage is that this method only works for adult strongyles that have already laid eggs! This technique only makes it possible to detect strongyles after the infection which is a huge disadvantage! Other methods for detection, such as using an ELISA test or a PCR based method are expensive and require a high level of expertise [11, 12, 16].
In conclusion, the current need is a simple detection method which could be applied to grass samples to be able"

Tec-Monterrey,2018,Team:Tec-Monterrey#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"R gen regulated by a constitutive promoter. This segment was ligated to BBa_K381001 which contains a Pyear promoter and a GFP reporter gen. Pyear is inhibit by the presence of NsrR which is natively produced by the bacteria. Under this condition no fluorescence is expected. Still is reported that under this condition, there is leaking activity that produces GFP. An over expression of the NsrR protein was proposed to overcome this problem. The presence of nitrate inhibits the NsrR protein from interfering with the promoter. This improvement intents to give the fluorescence response greater sensibility to nitrate ion. This characterized part is an improvement of a previous part for Gold requirements. The characterization of this part can be found in the Demonstrate segment.
Parts Collection
E-coding design a set of composite parts that enable the recording of stimuli from environment and culture conditions in the bacterial genome. The SCRIBE system together with the CAS1-CAS2 complex enables the integration of any designed sequence in the CRISPR-array. The project expects that the following collection of parts can be used in any type of bacteria for molecular recording of events. In this case, all experimentation was base in strain .BL21 (DE3) Further experimentation in other types of strain is encouraged.
Cas1-Cas2 cassette with wild type proteins for integration in the bacteria CRISPR array
Cas1-Cas2 cassette with tag proteins, Flag and HA respectively, for rapid identification of protein production and activity of integration.
RT-His cassette for the production of a retrotranscriptase with a histidine tag. Cassette involves for the production of the desired sequence for integration of the genome and analog for the stimulus in measurement.
NsrR cassette for the production of NsrR protein to reduce leaking activity in the Pyear promoter that leads to GFP production. This cassette is used primarily to sense the presence of nitrates in the environment.

Immobilization Tags
To achieve a covalent immobilisation of the different enzymes to an agarose membrane we chose three different immobilisation tags. All of them consist of two peptide chains which specifically bind to each other in solution and yield a covalent bond. For immobilisation purposes we used the SpyTag, the SnapTag and a split intein engineered from gyrase b of Synechocystis spec. PCC6803.
SpyTag
The SpyTag-sequence was taken from the iGEM registry and consists of a small peptide chain, called SpyTag, and a bigger protein-like structure, called SpyCatcher. Both BioBricks were created by Team TU-Munich in 2013 and can be found under the identifiers BBa_K1159200 (SpyCatcher) and BBa_K1159201 (SpyTag). The short SpyTag polypeptide (AHIVMVDAYKPTK) was C-terminally fused with 6-aminohexanoic acid as a spacer, followed by a carboxyfluorecine labelled lysine residue and a cystein residue for binding of the SulfoLink. With this we achieve a fluorescent marker in our peptide to yield an indicator for correct immobilisation of the SpyTag to the target protein or the matrix. Because of the cystein residue at the N-terminus of the SpyTag, it can be covalently bound to a matrix via SulfoLink ( for further information about the SpyTag have a look at our page about synthetic peptides ). In order to immobilize our enzymes, they were C-terminally fused to the coding region of the"

Due to its extracellular structure, a biofilm can act as a protective barrier for associated cells against various adverse conditions and can aid in the communication between cells(Foley & Gilbert 1996). Cells within a biofilm are frequently found to be more resistant to antimicrobials compared to planktonic cells (Simões & Vieira 2009). Moreover, the EPS serves as a bridge between cells, promoting intercellular communication that may facilitate cells’ (or the biofilm's as a whole) adaptation to changing environment (Davis et al. 1998).
These traits make the elimination of biofilms a challenging concern in a wide range of fields, especially in the food, energy, and biomedical industries1. Pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 and Staphylococcus aureus will contaminate food products, microorganisms in biofilms will catalyze chemical and biological reactions causing metal corrosion in pipelines and tanks, and biofilms reduce heat transfer efficacy if it becomes too thick1 (Mittelman, 1998).
The Experiments
Constructs
Since Caulobacter crescentus has a G/C rich genome (over 60%) and both esp and dspB coding regions are G/C poor, we had the sequences codon optimized for expression in Caulobacter.
We were also interested to see the difference of gene expression in Caulobacter between the wild type and optimized genes, and we wanted to make the wild type esp gene available for other synthetic biologists to use. Therefore, we acquired the wild type esp gene from Staphylococcus epidermidis by PCR.  We obtained our wild type dspB gene from the University of British Columbia.
The promoters we used were Pxyl, PrsaA and BBa_K081005, all functioning at a relatively high efficiency in both E. coli and Caulobacter. Pxyl is a xylose-inducible promoter that originates from Caulobacter; PrsaA is a strong constitutive promoter also native to Caulobacter that is responsible for initiating transcription of rsaA; BBa_K081005 is a strong constitutive promoter that was designed by the 2008 iGEM team from the University of Pavia.
We knew from previously published reports that as few as 80 amino acids of the C-terminal end of RsaA function as a secretion tag for heterologous proteins. However, a larger secretion signal can increase the efficiency of secreting heterologous proteins, so we cloned the C-terminal 120 amino acids"

Laboratory biosafety manual Third edition says as follows:
Guidelines for the surveillance of laboratory workers handling microorganisms at Biosafety Level 1
Historical evidence indicates that the microorganisms handled at this level are unlikely to cause human disease or animal disease of veterinary importance. Ideally,however, all laboratory workers should undergo a pre-employment health check at which their medical history is recorded. Prompt reporting of illnesses or laboratory accidents is desirable and all staff members should be made aware of the importance of masintaining GMT.
Guidelines for the surveillance of laboratory workers handling microorganisms at Biosafety Level 2
1. A pre-employment or preplacement health check is necessary. The person’s medical history should be recorded and a targeted occupational health assessment performed.
2. Records of illness and absence should be kept by the laboratory management.
3. Women of childbearing age should be made aware of the risk to an unborn child of occupational exposure to certain microorganisms, e.g. rubella virus. The precise steps taken to protect the fetus will vary, depending on the microorganisms to which the women may be exposed.
Biological Safety Cabinets
Laboratory biosafety manual Third edition says as follows:</p> <p>
Biological safety cabinets (BSCs) are designed to protect the operator, the laboratory environment and work materials from exposure to infectious aerosols and splashes that may be generated when manipulating materials containing infectious agents, such as primary cultures, stocks and diagnostic specimens. Aerosol particles are created by any activity that imparts energy into a liquid or semiliquid material, such as shaking, pouring, stirring or dropping liquid onto a surface or into another liquid. Other laboratory activities, such as streaking agar plates, inoculating cell culture flasks with a pipette, using a multichannel pipette to dispense liquid suspensions of infectious agents into microculture plates, homogenizing and vortexing infectious materials, and centrifugation of infectious liquids, or working with animals, can generate infectious aerosols. Aerosol particles of less than 5 μm in diameter and small droplets of 5?100 μm in diameter are not visible to the naked eye. The laboratory worker is generally not aware that such particles are being generated and may be inhaled or may crosscontaminate work surface materials. BSCs, when properly used, have been shown to be highly effective in reducing laboratory-acquired infections and cross-contaminations of cultures due to aerosol exposures. BSCs also protect the environment.

The construct was further assembled with σX generator BBa_K1379006 to give BBa_K1379005 .
PcomFA promoter was assembled with the promoter measurement kit BBa_E0240 to give the PcomFA Measurement Kit BBa_K1379003 in plasmid pSB3K3. The construct was further assembled with σX generator BBa_K1379006 to give BBa_K1379007 .
Qualitative characterization was performed by comparing intensities of GFP signals from colonies of E. coli DH10B strain holding the PcelA and PcomFA Measurement Kits with and without the σX generator under a fluorescent macroscope with UV filter. Measurement kit for standard reference promoter BBa_J23101 , BBa_I20260 was used as a positive control; BBa_E0240 was used as the negative control for background fluorescence.
Quantitative characterization was performed following the protocol described in “Measuring the activity of BioBrick promoters using an in vivo reference standard” (Kelly et al., 2009). E. coli DH10B strains holding the constructs with or without σX generator respectively were grown to mid-log phases. GFP intensities and cell densities were then sampled every 30 minutes for 5 consecutive time points to obtain growth rates and GFP synthesis rates. The GFP synthesis rates were then compared to that of standard reference promoter BBa_J23101 measurement device BBa_I20260 to obtain the Relative Promoter Units (RPUs). For subtraction of background fluorescence, pSB3K3 holding BBa_E0240 was measured alongside. The measurement was done with 3 replicas.
Figure 2. PcelA has 0.53 RPU and PcomFA hsa 1.21 RPU when paired with σX generator.
PcelA and PcomFA was measured in reference to BBa_J23101 constitutive promoter with and without σX generator BBa_K1379006 . RPU shown was calculated from 3 replicas.

Slovenia,2008,Team:Slovenia#Notebook#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html,"3% FBS. Then we fixed the cells 10 min at room temperature by adding 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were washed two-times with PBS + 3% FBS. Cells were then stained with primary antibodies (mouse anti-HA antibodies, Invivogen, final concentration 0.08 mg/ml) 40 min at 4°C and then with secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse IgG-PE, Beck.Coul., final concentration 0.01 mg/ml) for 30 min at 4°C. After that we washed cells two-times and analyzed them on flow cytometer.
 
CYTOKINE TESTING
 
For detecting production of cytokines upon cell activation with DNA TLR vaccines we used real-time PCR and an Multiplex Fluorescent Bead Immunoassay (Bender MedSystems) for quantitative detection of human cytokines by flow cytometry.
HEK293 cells were seeded into a 12-well plate and transfected with the indicated DNA TLR vaccines or wtTLR plasmid controls. 24 h post transfection the DNA TLR vaccine transfected cells were lysed for RNA extraction and positive control (wtTLR-vector transfected) cells were stimulated for 4 h with the corresponding ligands (LPS and poly(I:C)) and then lysed for RNA extraction. Supernatants from the same cells were collected for the Flurescent Bead Immunoassay.
 
MULTIPLEX FLUORESCENT BEAD IMMUNOASSAY
 
Supernatants were collected from cells as described above and analysed using the FlowCytomix Human Basic Kit by Bender following manufacturer's instructions and flow cytometry. Briefly, beads of different sizes and spectra addresses are coated with antibodies reacting with each of the cytokines being detected in the samples. The two different bead sizes make in possible to detect up to 20 analytes in a single small volume. Next a biotin-conjugated secondary antibody is added to the bead-antibody-cytokine complex, and binding is detected with streptavidin-phycoerythrin with flow cytomety.
 
REAL-TIME PCR
 
 
Real-Time or quantitative PCR has become a popular technique with which to obtain insight into the complexity of the immune response. The easy detection of cytokine mRNA transcripts in a limited number of cells where the corresponding protein could barely be measured is the major advantage of the technique. Real-time PCR is so called because the amplicon accumulation can be directly monitored during the PCR"

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

1.4 Result Analysis and Prospect
    According to the results of sequencing, actual sequence is identical to designed sequence, which testifies the validity of formulation (appendix 1). In lipase functional test, there is relatively obvious phenomenon under IPTG abduction (Figure 11), which testifies the function of gene.
    Hence, using this reformed lipase can erase the grease cover on relic surface, and we hope to use OAH reconstruct relic surface.
    Meanwhile, recombinant lipase can be widely used in any field for de-greasing, for example, the de-greasing process of steel surface, pre-treatment of high-fat food disposal, etc.
    This research project only recombines the lipase without optimising it according to temperature fluctuation, abduction concentration. We hope our project is helpful in every field.

Mathimatical models
    Since there is no one had done the same experiment as ours before, we assumed the growing pattern is similar as E.coil CVCC249.
    We got the data of this kind of E.coil from a doctoral dissertation,Comparison of Growth Kinetics and Physiological Characteristics of E.coil CVCC249 under both Batch and Continuous Culture by Huaiqiang Zhang, at page34. We used the logistic function data in this form, which is K=1.937 and r=0.550, and we assumed that N0=0.1( since N0 is initial population of E.coil, we can just simply set this data).
    According to logistic function , we can get the bacteria population-time function:(see Figure 1)
        f(t) = 1.937/(1+(1.937-0.1)e^(-0.55t)/0.1)         f(t) = 1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55"

The Future Plan
We strongly hope to popularize and transform our achievements in lab, and benefit more fish farmers in China and even the world. In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.

Although we have transformed three plasmids into BL21, the result was undesirable. We found that DH5α may be more suitable for our vector, so we decided to transform the plasmids into DH5α one more time.    Later we constructed 1A3 GFP, colE1＋GFP, sfGFP, colE1＋sfGFP, and aiiA/ndh pSB3T5, so we transformed all these plasmids into DH5α for our new work of construction.
