Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#PolicyAndPractices#artificialcell_-_-_TEXT.html," discussion about the concept of life in synthetic biology is a complex and wide-ranging field, where the difficulties of a definition lie just in the diversity of life. It is noteworthy that the researchers themselves are trying to find a suitable explanation, as it is an objective of synthetic biology to create new life (Deplazes / Huppenbauer 2009). Here is a brief description how researchers are trying to define life or alive.
After a minimal definition each organism is alive, which has an independent genome, has a cellular membrane structure and a sustainable and autonomous replication system (Endy 2005; Toepfer 2005).
The autopoiesis theory acts on a philosophical assumption when developing a concept of life. Living organisms differ from non-living organisms by ""[the fact that they are] the product of their organization […]. There is no separation between producer and product. Being and doing [of an] autopoietic unity is inseparable, and this constitutes their specific type of organization"" (Maturana, Varela 1987). Consequently, the products of synthetic biology would not been self-caused, but organized externally by humans. Consequently, following this train of thought, scientists will never succeed in producing an autopoietic system synthetically. The human as manufacturer of the genome states himself as the creator of the organism. The postulated unit of producer and product can never be succeeded. The organism remains heteronomous by the determination of the genome by man.
This logical problem with the autopoiesis-theory in synthetic biology leads to restricted and modified applicability of the theory. Thus, the following discussion will concentrate on the definition of life first illustrated and includes the autopoiesis theory in restricted form, as this will gain importance in synthetic biology for future developments.
After consideration of the machine concept and definitions of life it is evident that the organisms named ""living machine"" are by no means machines but living organisms. Today synthetically engineered organisms satisfy the minimum requirements of reproduction, metabolism and evolution. The term ""machine"" emphasizes the intended machine-like function. The organisms are alive but perform a machine-related purpose.
The claim of the synthetic biology is to create living organisms, which act simultaneously as a machine. The synthetic biology changes the definitions of living organisms and aims to abolish the separation between life and machine. It follows that the discussion with this term is not regarding the definition, but rather an ontological problem.
The term suggests a utilization of life with the pure focus on the control and goals of the humans.
On the one hand the term ""living machine"" generates an ethical problem, for the reason"

In the commercial part, we analyzed the feasibility of Termite Terminator, evaluated the cost and more importantly, made the promotion part to smooth future consumers' acceptance of our product (see: Commercial) .
Additionally, we imagine what Termite Terminator may become and where it may go after its action in termites' guts. Additionally, we consider possible consequence of the device application. So, we specially made a Safety Tree (see: Safety) . Future application shows that Termite Terminator has more future potential to make more positive changes to the world (see: Future) .
Collaborate
An important but sometimes underestimated part of iGEM is the applicability of the created product. Collaboration with Synenergene helped us to think beyond the scientific possibilities of our project and place it in a social framework. We think deeply about more aspects throughout the project. The answers to these questions were all considered and combined in the application scenario where we explore how our product is going to be used and produced and the challenges involved. Additionally, we presented Techno-moral vignettes, focusing on the potential wider impacts of our application (see: Synenergene) .
This year, we helped H4Z (Hangzhou No.4 Highschool)to get started in iGEM, helped HZAU with modeling and provided BNU with two important gene circuits. In Jul 19-24, we attended in the Asian Conference in the National Chiao Tung University (see: Collaborate) .
This year, ZJU-CHINA attaches much more importance on Human Practice. The theme is INFLUENCE. We focus on the influence of our project: how could it perfectly interact with the world. We focus on the influence of synthetic biology: a series of public promotion has been made to develop public recognition of synthetic biology and safety issues. We focus on the influence of a vital principle: from nature for nature. In the process of Human practice, we tried our best to interact with the world, appreciate nature and thus improve our project.

Ensuring environmental safety
After discussions with several professors and industry experts, we also realized that we needed to find some method of containment in case the microbes were mistakenly released into the environment. Therefore, we decided to implement two steps: (1) We wanted to use a salt-induced promoter because this could function as a potential on-off switch, and (2) We introduced a flag tag that would turn off tagatose production if concentrations of intermediate metabolites became too large for the cyanobacteria to handle
3A Assembly and Genetic Manipulation
After we were done with each individual BioBrick construct and validated the enzymes via DNA sequencing and confirmation, we then decided to use 3A assembly to combine all the different enzymes into a single larger gene fragment.
Focus 4: Using a co-culture bioreactor design
Purposes of a Co-culture design
In order to have an industrially relevant solution, we also knew that we had to address the question of food vs. fuel. One popular trend in biofuel production, in particular, has been to use cyanobacteria directly for production. Combined with the idea that E. coli can be used for biofuel production (as shown by recent yields of ethanol and isobutanol), we decided that having a co-culture system would allow us to have a self-sustainable system since one organism could produce the feedstock and one of them could use that feedstock as the starting point of bio-production.
Considering the Parameters of Sustainability
At this point, we started considering the lifecycle of our proposed platform. We realized that the key to having to a successful platform would be to have a viable bioreactor design. After many consultations with local businesses involved in bioprocessing, we decided to use single-use, disposable bioreactors in order to keep small-scale operations and work at a reasonable rate. We also decided that in order to further reduce downstream production costs, we should genetically engineer the export of tagatose so that the microbes can keep producing without needing time for harvesting, which leads to decreased efficiency and increased costs of production.Click to learn more in the applied design section of our project.
Expanding Scope of Implementation
One potential application of our project is that standalone,  is provides a large-scale production method for unconventional carbon sources, some of which have nutritional value and additional health benefits. The current market for alternative synthetic sweeteners struggles with production scale issues, and the first phase of our platform can"

BIT-China,2016,Team:BIT-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Find out the initial thresholds by measuring RFP intensity
(4) Provide experimental data for modeling part
Part Design
The gene circuits are shown in Fig.3.
Fig.3 The gene circuits of threshold device.
(1) Part:BBa_K808000 AraC-PBAD is used to control the expression of inhibitor proteins, The concentration of inducer arabinose is regarded as an input signal, and the red fluorescence intensity controlled by in-promoter is the output.
(2) Two combinations of inhibitor and in-promoter are selected to prove the concept of plasmid quorum sensing. Due to the limit of time, we measured 1-2 circuits. [see inhibitor mechanisms]
(3) RFP is used as an indicator since it's easier to quantify compared with the killer gene.
(4) The inducible promoter PBAD and the in-promoter express towards different directions, a terminator B0015 is added between the two promoters.
We assume that:
Different concentrations of arabinose will induce inhibitor with different concentration of inhibitors.
The high concentration of inducers can simulate high concentration of plasmids due to the same effect of producing more inhibitor proteins.
By adding different concentration of arabinose, we can measure the fluorescence intensity of RFP and find out the relationship between the arabinose and RFP intensity and the initial thresholds under the control of certain inhibitor proteins.
Second step
In order to find out the concentrations of inhibitor under different concentrations of arabinose and use the results to derive the threshold of plasmids number in the constitutive circuit. Inhibitor is replaced by RFP and induced based on the same condition. The concentration of inhibitor can be represented by measuring the fluorescence intensity of RFP.
Goal
(1) Represent the concentration of inhibitor by measuring the fluorescence intensity of RFP.
(2) Derive the threshold of plasmids number in the constitutive circuit
Part Design
The gene circuits are shown in Fig.4.
Fig.4 The gene circuit constructed to find out the concentrations of inhibitor induced by different concentrations of arabinose.
We assume that:
More arabinose added, more RFP expressed which can stand for the concentration of inhibitor, and vice versa.
Fig.5 The relationship between the concentrations of inhibitor and plasmid number.
Thus we could find out the relationship between the concentration of arabinose and inhibitor.
Third step
We use plasmids with different copy numbers to simulate the concentration of plasmids losing on different levels. Three kinds of plasmids, pSB1k3 (100~200 copies),"

Safety
Safety should be a cornerstone of every project, taken into account during every phase. For this reason the Dutch Governmental Institute for Public Health and Environment (RIVM) has challenged us to participate in their Safe-by-Design assignment. The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate how our team has taken safety into account throughout our project, in every aspect. Of particular importance is the human practices part, where our ideas get taken outside the lab and into the world surrounding us. Of special interest is the iterative process, where the direction of the project is adjusted based on input from stakeholders and experts in relevant fields, safety and ethical guidelines, and considerations regarding the upscaling of our project. We have had 2 Skype meetings with staff members of the RIVM, and using their tips and guidance we made some more adjustment. The final product, an infographical timeline describing the iterative process of our project, is pictured below.
Stakeholder Analysis
Porter Analysis
To investigate our position and opportunities on the market, we performed a Five Forces analysis. Here, we looked at the strengths of our buyers and suppliers, substitutes for our product, competition and new entrants. The results indicate that we have a beneficial position in relation to our suppliers as there are multiple sources of cellulose. However, the buyers have a high switching cost, which is a potential threat to our technology. For new entrants, a large amount of prior knowledge is needed to enter the market, which is one of our strengths. The substitutes of our product are different kinds of plastics, but as the plastic market is large and specific, this is not a great threat.
For buyers, production scale is very important

The young, Groningen based biotech startup EV Biotech offered to  collaborate with us in many aspects. Represented by Linda Dijkshoorn, Agnieszka Wegryzn and Sergey Lunev, EVBiotech was present at multiple meetings with our subgroups. Linda had fantastic tips about structure and organisation, and helped us to set up a SCRUM way of working. Agnieszka is an expert on modelling and helped a great deal with the flux balance analysis. Sergey helped us to set up the concept of a continuous bioreactor. Over the summer we had ten meetings to discuss our progress on the project. Next to technical help, we also profited greatly by gaining access to the big network of EV Biotech. As a special honor, we were invited to the official opening of the new EV Biotech office.

Figure 4: A Schematic representation of vector pET28a. Note that the vector has a constitutive LacI expression cassette. B BL21 DE3 cells holding the empty pET28a vector at 10mM IPTG. The vector is obviously nontoxic to cells even at high concentrations of inducer. C Decreased viability of BL21 DE3 cells harboring vector pET28a-RMF wild type at 1mM IPTG and 10mM IPTG.
For our genetic experiment, we took advantage of two properties of the pET expression system. The pET expression system shows an extremely low degree of leaky expression and is therefore ideal for expression of toxic genes. In order to increase repression of lac-controlled expression in absence of inducer, the pET vector series contains a constitutive LacI expression cassette encoding a lacI gene that is identical to the lacI gene provided by the registry as part I763026 and can therefore be converted by simple site-directed mutagenesis into the LacI IS mutants we set out to study. In order to find out whether the LacI IS mutants were able to rescue a BL21 DE3 cell harboring the mutated pET28a-RMF plasmid at even elevated concentrations of inducer, we subcloned RMF into the expression vector and subjected the expression vector to site-directed mutagenesis. In addition, we tested the impact of empty plasmid and pET28a-RMF with wild-type lacI on the viability of cells at elevated IPTG concentrations.
In order to perform this genetic experiment, we amplified RMF from E. coli strain DH5-alpha DNA using forward primer 5’-cgcggatccgaaaacctgtattttcagggcaagagacaaaaacgagatcgcctg and reverse primer 5’-ccgctcgagttattaggccattactaccctgtcc (reaction setup was 35ul water, 10ul Finnzyme Phusion HF buffer, 1ul 10mM dNTPs, 1ul 25uM forward primer, 1ul 25uM reverse primer, 0.5ul DH5-alpha genomic DNA, 0.5ul Finnzyme Phusion Hot-start polymerase; thermocycler program was 98C for 3min"

Dalhousie,2017,Team:Dalhousie#ScienceSam_-_-_TEXT.html,"ators have to bridge a fine line between giving too much info and making it jargon-y versus trying to make conclusions more relevant than they are. Where do you think that sweet spot lies? How do you step away from talking about FACS and calling it a ‘cell counter’[on Instagram]. How do you make it more palatable? My philosophy is not to teach people science facts. I think its pretty useless- that’s not true it is useful but I think a lot of people do it. And I think its not valuable for the reader, for someone who is never going to work in a lab is not going to need to know what FACS is. What is useful for them is to teach scientific ways of thinking. Instead of saying FACs counts cells, I can say I am trying to identify a stem cell, before testing it any other way, and its going to shine a light and I can count it. That’s how I know I have a stem cell if it shines a bright light from the protein. You then instead show them what your using the technique for and why that’s interesting. So that I’m hoping you can start to train or condition people that ‘oh if someone’s saying they know they have a stem cell, I wonder how they know, I wonder if they counted fluorescence or cells that are shining bright’. I say that and then I have people messaging me the next day asking me if my cells were red. “Did you see your red cells?”. To me that’s so much better, they know what I’m looking for, they know what goes into finding a fact. The fine line for me is don’t talk about the technique, talk about the value of it. Teach people what goes into finding a fact instead of teaching that fact. That’s a great answer. I don’t care about teaching science, I care about teaching about research, what goes into scientific method because its beautiful. All of us in science love it, so we should share it. Kind of the same question maybe, or might have the same answer. Science, especially the science we do such as cell and systems biology, can be very reductionist, focusing on solely on one part of a much larger system within a much larger system. What do you think is the key to get the message across? I speak specifically to how you’ve been able to take such a complex topic like brain stem cells into the “grandma cell” which is very easily accessible. Even for me, I’m in viruses so I know nothing about the brain, its made neuroscience more accessible to me which is really cool. How"

GOLD HUMAN PRACTICES
Interviews
This year, a major aspect of our human practices were the interviews that were conducted by members of our team. We had the chance to interview Dr. Ed Pryzdial, who is a scientist from the Canadian Blood Services, Dr. Bruce Ritchie from the hematology department from the University of Alberta, as well as an expert from St. John’s Ambulance. All three of these interviews provided vital feedback that directly affected our course of thinking for the design of our product.
Canadian Blood Services
We were able to get in touch with Dr. Ed Pryzdial, a scientist with Canadian Blood Services and the Associate Director for the Centre for Blood Research at the University of British Columbia. Aside from his work with Canadian Blood Services, some of his specializations are in coagulation and blood proteins. His knowledge would provide us with insight into any potential problems we might run into.  We received comments about the design of our construct from him. He told us that using the whole fibrinogen molecule would result in issues when it is used in combination with the snake venom component due to the size differences between the two. This input lead us to find a small, four amino acid fibrin peptide chain to combat this problem. He also gave us comments about the safety of our system. He thought it might be interesting if we tried to engineer our protein, Cerastocytin, to turn it off. He thought that a solid matrix might be useful to prevent diffusion of the venom outside of the wound. Like Dr. Ritchie, he commented that creating a fusion protein with human and snake components might result in an immune response and the formation of antibodies. If antibodies did form, this would cause issues for repeat use of our product. This information made our team realize how our product could only be used on a one time basis. However in serious situations, our product would still be useful if it meant saving a life. Overall, Dr. Pryzdial’s comments gave us many things to consider"

The experiments started with the amplification of DelH executed by Johanna Meichsner, which turned out to be one of the most challenging parts of our project. Johanna proved to be extremely resilient to recurrent setbacks and her power of endurance gave a great example to the whole team. Florian Schmidt, Sophie Rabe and Nils Kurzawa took care of the plasmid assembly of the remaining genes from the Del cluster. After DelRest was successfully amplified, Florian Schmidt and Sophie Rabe worked as well on the assembly of the DelH plasmid and the gold precipitation by delftibactin. Sophie Rabe was furthermore responsible of proteins assays, delftibactin purification and MICRO-TOF, Florian Schmidt established the protocol to dissolve electronic waste. All of them were extremely dedicated and cloned day and night.
Ilia Kats cloned the pIK8 plasmid and all prior plasmids necessary for the establishment of the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway. He performed all steps of the cloning procedure of these plasmids from primer design up to electroporation and screening.
Here we want to give a special thank you to our advisors Dominik Niopek, Katharina Genreith and Fanny Georgi for their great help in planning of the cloning strategies and introducing us to the world of primer design! Thanks to Fanny for helping with electroporations any time of the day (or night).
NRPSDesigner
The software-core-team consisted of Konrad Herbst, Ilia Kats, Nikolaos Ignatiadis, Julia Schessner and Nils Kurzawa. They worked together on the implementation of the NRPSDesigner software and the establishment of the respective database. Additionally, Joshua Sachs, Anja Riedel, Julia Schessner and Philipp Walch contributed to the maintenance of the database. Furthermore, administrator Ilia Kats was in charge of our internal wiki and server. All of the software geeks mentioned above worked on our sub-software project iGEM42. The advisors Hannah Meyer and Tim Heinemann helped not only with the NRPSDesigner, but also with motivating the entire team. A big thanks to Hannah for bringing all these yummy cookies and to Tim for helping to eat them!

Cornell,2015,Team:Cornell#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," over oxytetracycline, an antibiotic used to treat BCWD, because abuse of such chemotherapeutic agents fosters resistance among targeted pathogens [8]. In fact, a study conducted between 1994 and 1998 among Danish trout farms recorded an oxytetracycline resistance rate of between 60 and 75 percent of Flavobacterium colonies sampled [9].
Bacterial resistance to agents such as amoxicillin, florfenicol and sulfonamides has also been reported, largely due to the organism’s ability to form extremely hardy biofilms [9]. fishPHARM thus constitutes an effective circumvention of the issue of environmental antibiotic resistance: by eschewing the use of any chemical agents, we prevent the formation of more dangerous pathogens.
Furthermore, fishPHARM has the potential to be a more reliable, enduring solution, as it would be more difficult for Flavobacterium psychrophilum to develop any evolutionary countermeasures to such a system. It should be further noted that agents such as amoxicillin have uses in medicine, and that encouraging the development of strains resistant to such drugs could have deleterious consequences for human health.
Comprehensive Risk Assessment
Overview
It is tempting as scientists to think that we can treat risk assessment as we would treat any other scientific protocol - that with a few key steps and critical considerations, we will always end up with the right answer. However, assessing risk, particularly for environmental projects, is not that simple. Thinking about potential impacts and risks often turns up more questions than answers, and it is difficult to know where to start. For this reason, we have employed three approaches to risk assessment. The first was developed by Cornell’s Environmental Health and Safety Department, pertaining specifically to work with recombinant organisms. The next was developed by the Environmental Protection Agency as a general environmental risk assessment and modified by both the Woodrow Wilson Center and our team for use on our synthetic biology project. Finally, we strived to embody the design principles set forth by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues. Each approach has its limitations, but all of them have helped to inform our project design, research practices, and considerations for further development of our project.
Environmental Health and Safety (EHS)
Cornell’s Environmental Health and Safety Department lays the groundwork for determining safe research practices on campus, and greatly informed our own safety protocols . They specifically suggested the following risk assessment criteria for researchers working with recombinant organisms.

Of course, there are also the lab missions which  will practice the following:

Lost Proteins
Retrospective Notebook: This entry was not written on this day, but derived later from working notes I made that day.
I filed a support request with Linden Labs (the company behind Second Life), but with some sixty thousand users online every day I didn't imagine that the TetR object that got lost yesterday would be a high priority. This was a decently large setback.
Not wanting to wait around for my work to rematerialize, I wound up rewriting the changes I had made since the last time I had saved. I also got to work on a new version of the stayput script... with a new provision to stop objects from floating away more than a short distance! Lesson learned.

Today:  Novus Biologicals and TransAlta emailed me back and said they’re unable to sponsor iGEM. Novus said that they’re a small company and they have donated the amount that they set aside earlier. I called TransAlta and they said they like our project but due to the economic crisis, they had to cut down their budget; they’re only funding on-going projects within their own companies.
I sent a thank you letters and asked for contact from 10 companies who were unable to help us. I also sent Noreen Schultz (Ab Community Relations Coordinator) from Company 1a breakdown of our budget and a project description  (just as she had asked) after she didn’t quite understand the science behind our project. I showed Thane the description and budget breakdown before sending it.  I emphasized that we’re not looking for something big, any donation will be greatly appreciated by the team. I’ll follow up with her on Monday, July 27th.  I also followed up with the following:

The performance of Chinese teams in the medals
The gold, silver or bronze medals are awarded based on the quality of the project. All teams can achieve any one of these medals. After analyzed the increased number of Chinese teams in iGEM, we want to know the performance of Chinese teams in iGEM. We retrieved the medals data from the iGEM website. We found that the performance of Chinese teams is extraordinary, especially in the undergraduates group.
The total medals, especially the gold medals increased from 2007 to 2016 among Chinese iGEM teams. In 2007, the 5 teams got 5 gold medals, but in 2008, no gold metals. In 2016, there were 37 gold medals among Chinese teams, which indicated that the Chinese teams performed very well in the iGEM. To further get a glimpse into the performance of Chinese teams in iGEM, we analyzed the ratio of gold, silver, bronze and no medals among Chinese teams. We found that the gold medal ratio of Chinese teams had 3 troughs. They were 2008, 2011 and 2014. From 2011 to 2013, there were regional jamborees. From 2014 to 2016, all the teams participated in the Giant jamboree, but the high school teams were not awarded medals until 2014. We found that from 2011 to 2013, the gold ratio increased from 39.1% to 65.9%. From 2014 to 2016, the gold ratio increased from 40% to 50.7%. The analysis told us that Chinese iGEM teams can quickly adapt to the changed situation and judging criteria to get better results.

The tissue vector first function is to deliver the cell vector in the targeted organ. If the liberation is too early, the cellular vector has less chance to reach the interested cell. Alone, the cell vector is eliminated by the organism, but in the tissue vector, it is safe.
The tissue vector possesses three interesting and identified tropisms. The DVS offers a therapeutic application for lungs, spleen and liver pathophysiologies. The tissue vector can target these organs, implant them, and develop inside of these tissues, until receving the delivery signal of cell vector .

Delivery system of the cell vector
An implanted system in bacterium permits to control expression and then cell vector liberation.
This control system by doxycycline, implanted in tissue vector is made by two elements:
- A synthesis plasmid of LacI , controlled by doxycycline.
This first plasmid code for LacI repressor under the control of the repressed promoter (pTET) . pTET activity, and then LacI expression, depends totally on the doxycycline fixation on the TetR repressor.
- A LacP/O operator is implanted in the cell vector genome and controls the gene expression via control expression of phage repressor .
LacI is attached on phage genome LacP/O promoter , inhibiting its repressor expression.
Repression of the cell vector expression is achieved constantly by a phage repressor. In presence of doxycycline, phage repressor is inhibited, promoting cell vector expression.
Delivery system permits the cell vector to be maintained inside the tissue vector under the control of doxycycline. The M. avium monitoring and the realization of statistic way to determine the propagation kinetic are essentials. These information permit to determine injection times. Doxycycline injection causes the cell vector release which lyses the tissue vector and diffuses in the targeted tissue.
Back to top
To summarize…
... DVS possesses a tissue vector having the following characteristics:
- Low pathogenicity, so low toxicity,
- Immune system resistance, so low clearance,
- Tissue targeting, so first specificity,
- Cell vector synthesis and delivery.
These characteristics, specific to DVS , give solutions to recurrent issues, of specificity and elimination by the immune system , meet by vectors .

Overview
As part of our sequence verification method, we need a means to quickly and accessibly classify sequenced DNA as natural EPO genes, artificial EPO genes, or other DNA. We created a software tool in R, an open-source programming language that can be augmented with packages that are convenient for working with genomic data ( R core team, 2015 ). The tool can perform the classification for any gene based on comparison of the input sequence to a custom database. Our database contains natural sequences with variations corresponding to misreads, and artificial sequences with codon mutations around exon-exon junctions. Natural genes do not have exon-exon junctions, which allows their distinction from artificial DNA. Our tool calculates alignment scores, based on which an input sequence (fasta file or typed sequence) is classified using the k-nearest neighbor machine learning algorithm ( Torgo et al., 2010 ). The database accommodates every new artificial EPO DNA that is analyzed. In this way, evolved EPO gene doping sequences update the database resulting in ever-increasing accuracy. The second branch of software we developed is able to find a minimal set of guide RNAs (gRNAs) to detect the plethora of variations that can be made to a gene. The repository to our software can be found here .
Figure 1. Schematic of our software tools. The input is a DNA sequence received from our targeted sequencing step, which is classified using our sequence classification tool. If it is classified as gene doping and not in our doping sequence database yet, we add it to this database. If the sequence codes for a new amino acid sequence that other sequences in the database do not code for, it is passed on to the gRNA generation tool. Passing the sequences from the sequence classification tool to the gRNA generation tool"

Codon Optimization
The genetic code is a degenerate one; there are more 3-part combinations of nucleotides than there are amino acids. The topic of codon optimization-that is, the cell's preference for one codon sequence over another in translation-has been heavily researched in an effort to determine the optimal genetic sequences for an organism. This project looks at the effects of repeated amino acid sequences of varying lengths and codons and their effect on the cell.
Codon Optimization
Sample navigation menu:
Overview | Design | Results
Background
All of the proteins around us, with few exceptions, are made up of 20 fundamental building blocks of life - amino acids. Different arrangements and combinations of these basic building blocks give us the diversity of proteins that we see. Messenger RiboNucleic Acids (mRNA) is in essence a ""photocopy"" of DNA that codes for a gene. mRNA carry codons, which are groups of three bases that code for a single amino acid. There are 64 possible combinations of codons (4 x 4 x 4 = 64), but these combinations are degenerate, so there can be more than one codon that codes for the same amino acid.
The Problem
We have mentioned how these can be a number of codons that can code for the same Amino Acid, and subsequently, a number of tRNA molecules that can carry a given Amino Acid. In nature, and in many organisms, only a select few of these tRNA and codon combinations are used instead of all sequences that code for the same amino acid. This is called codon bias.
The Objective
Our goal for this project is to see which codons are preferred, or biased. We also want to investigate if this bias can change over time, different circumstances, or stresses.

BBa_K2705006 : PgltAB-lacI-Pgrac-TetA
Design
In our work, promoter PgltAB ( BBa_K2705000 ), promoter Pgrac ( BBa_K2705002 ), lacI ( BBa_K2705001 ) gene and tetA ( BBa_K2705003 ) gene were composed to build up the PopQC system. (See Figure 1.) The function of PgltAB is documented in BBa_K2705000.
Fig. 1 Design principle of PopQC for high yield of γ-PGA. PopQC system selects non-genetic high-performing cells, which finally leads to high producers outcompete the low producers. In specific, we use the promoters PgltAB and Pgrac, lacI gene and tetA gene. The tetracycline efflux protein TetA, which responds to intracellular glutamate concentration via the promoters PgltAB and Pgrac,. These promoters respond to the LysR family regulator GltC and the lactose repressor LacI, separately. With tetracycline, high producers will dominant the population.
In Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3, there exists the glt operon, which is responsible for intracellular glutamate synthesis (See BBa_K2705000 for more details about PgltAB). TetA is a tetracycline resistance protein [TetA(C) inner-membrane-associated protein] (See BBa_K2705007 and BBa_K2705003 for more details about TetA).
With a specific extracellular tetracycline concentration, when intracellular glutamate-precursor of γ-PGA-concentration of the individual is low, GltC level will go up, which activates the PgltAB to express lacI. LacI furthermore represses Pgrac and as a result, represses tetA expression. On the contrary, for high-producers, the concentration of intracellular GltC will go down, which represses the PgltAB to express lacI, and the tetA expression is not affected. Therefore, high-producers will synthesize enough amount of tetracycline"

The “human” part of designing an iGEM project
Current methods of chemical synthesis from petroleum derived chemicals have led to great environmental disruption and continue to be a strong contributor to global warming. It has also become increasingly clear during the recent decades that the raw material of this process, crude oil, is not a resource that is renewable within a viable timeframe. Biosynthesis of complex molecules and chemicals can be regarded as one of the most promising technologies capable of replacing current production strategies. Large-scale biosynthesis is already a viable industry: acetic acid, citric acid and ethanol are examples of chemicals widely produced using this process. Furthermore, complex molecules such as enzymes are almost exclusively produced using industrial fermentation.
Due to the promises that this field holds, it was clear that this is what our iGEM team wanted to focus on. An important part of the project is to consider how our project would affect society. To name a few, there are ethical, social and safety aspects to consider when attempting a biosynthesis-oriented project, our integrated human practices has been a major part of the design and formulation of our project. The following text covers some of these issues and how they were considered, discussed and dealt with during the design and development of the project concept.
Integrated human practices
Few areas of science have caused such an intense public debate as synthetic biology, especially for its application in the food industry. Though the scientific community at large agree that GMOs and the methods of synthetic biology can be used safely, the public debate continues. A recent letter addressed to the UN, describing the safety and need for GMOs, was signed by over 100 Nobel laureates spread across several scientific fields [1]. However, that is not to say that the debate should cease only because some people agree. On the contrary, it should be elevated and taken seriously by all. This discussion ought to be based on the facts, while arguments based on emotion and dogma should be put aside."

iPhone: an important tool in biology research
In our human practice, we aim to investigate how an iPhone aids biologists in the lab.
 
  It is expected that the sales of iPhone and iPad will over 170 million. And the number of software in APP store has been as high as 700 thousand already. All these facts have shown us that the era of mobile information is coming. We can already feel the changes coming with it in the fields of communication, business and so on. Expecting to be one of the future researchers, we want to know what changes it will bring to the research in the future, especially in the field of synthesis biology.
  Now, let us tracing back the history, and see the connection between biology research and scientific computing tools.
1. The birth of computer   In 1980s, IBM created the first personal computer. Since then, PC has spread rapidly, and bioinformatics was born with the trend. This in turn promoted the development of molecular biology.
2. The network technology   E-mail and newsgroups have become the major communication tools of biology study. And the protocols used in the network have provided many new methods for biological information integration. And the biological database system is also developing.
3. Database technology, data mining techniques, mass storage technology   Bioinformatics database has a complex data structure, a complex data organization and a rapid growth in the amount of data. The development of computer network as well as artificial intelligence has helped to improve the ability of biological information processing.
  So we can see that the development of synthesis biology is tightly connected with the improvement of the scientific computing tools. Now we have enough confidence to expect the coming of mobile biological information processing.
  When we are making such assertion, at the same time we have studied the software about synthesis biology on app store, to prove our words are not empty.
  The study above is mainly about the data, but how many software are really practical and user-friendly? Let’s take the most influential journals"

Due to the modelling, the higher the histamine concentration is, the faster yeast will respond and so is the protein degradation rate. So we made a prediction that the EGFP expression rate would positively correspond to histamine concentration in a certain time period after histamine induction.
Based on the above assumptions, we chose to induce the modified yeast already cultured to logarithm phase in medium lacking His, Trp, Leu and Ura. Then a histamine concentration gradient was made by adding a diverse range of histamine solution to the culture medium. According to medical research, the histamine concentration in normal human blood is around 30 ng/ml to 60ng/ml, while in allergic people, this concentration would reach 100 ng/ml or even more. We set three group of histamine concentration: 0 ng/ml as control group, 50 ng/ml to simulate the normal concentration and 200 ng/ml to simulate allergic concentration.
According to the test of reporter plasmid, we estimated the expression peak would be between 5 to 10 hours, so we choose 5h, 8h and 11h as three time points to run flow cytometry.
One thing worth mentioning is that due to the low concentration of yeast, we could only set 10 group so as to meet the criterion concentration of FCS.
The group set is as follow:
Table 2. The sample loading order
The concentration of yeast is around 100000 cell/ml (measured by OD600). We pick 10000 events inside the gate for each sample during FCS.
The FCS result is as follow:
Fig.8 The relative fluorescence intensity of histamine induced yeast
From Fig.8, we can see that at 5 to 8 hours’ culturing, the EGFP expression rate is positively correspond to histamine which certify our theory. When we judge each concentration group separately, it can be assumed that 50 ng/ml and 200 ng/ml group both reach its peak during 5 to 11 hours’ period. The degradation rate of each group is also positive correspond with histamine concentration, since at 11h, the expression level of every induction group has fallen, and the expression rate appears to be rather negative correlated to histamine concentration.
Considering the fact that the reaction time we had estimated for our allergy test kit is around 4 to 5 hours, it turned out that the modified yeast could indeed distinguish between allergic state blood serum and normal blood serum.

We used the flat iron, iron, and blow dryer. Iron worked best. See pic below!
Nelly worked on her adhesives. She tested BIO-PSA 7-4101 and 7-4301; however, both tests failed. What she did on her first test was she applied a thin film of adhesive on the release liner and let the heptane evaporate. She waited for 20 minutes, but the adhesive dried completely that it lost its adhesive properties. She tried the second time and she waited for heptane to evaporate for 5 minutes. The adhesives still contained heptane. She would run tests again tomorrow for 10 and 15 minutes.
Friday, July 29th
Had our weekly meeting. See timeline for what we have to accomplish next week.
David contacted 3M to ask them to create a crude prototype so we have a better idea what the patch should look like.
Nelly did rounds of her adhesive testing assays. She found that the BIO-PSA 7-4201 will be the best adhesive for our current purposes. BIO PSA 7-4101 dries up quickly as when it was applied, it lost it adhesiveness. BIO PSA 7-4301, on the other hand, dries up very slowly, which also explained why it is less viscous than the other adhesives. This means it is dissolved in more heptane. In the pic below, Nelly was holding onto the release liner, the other layer was our membrane. The adhesive was successfully stuck to the membrane.
Recommendations:
Use of rolling pin for more uniform adhesive distribution.
Wait 1.5 minutes for the adhesive to dry up once spread as film before attaching the membrane.
Test on pork skin. Design assays for quantifying amounts of adhesive we need to apply, optimal temperature for drying, etc.
More prototypes next week!

UB_Indonesia,2014,Team:UB Indonesia#backup_-_-_TEXT.html," our great idea!
UB IGEM TEAM is on progress in developing C3P (Cervical Cancer Care Program) as the theme to give solutions for cervical cancer cases. Starting from creating a rapid test tool using HPV DNA which is integrated with the software, creating a high antioxidant tea for preventing efforts, and creating a kit for selecting potential anti-cancer herbs.
We try to make an idea to build a new prototype for early detection to cervical cancer, especially caused by HPV 18 and HPV 16. We construct a new specific TALEs that can bind to our target sequences and we called it TALE 1 and TALE 2. In order to make sure the presence of DNA  from HPV 16 and 18, we need reporter which connect to detector.  Fluorescent protein usually used as reporter gene to study about gene expression. It will be connected to detector using linker. When the HPV DNA is bind to detector, blue colour will appear in the second strip. The Intensity of colour will be detected in our software and we can determined the risk level of cervical cancer disease. Dark blue colour show that the amount of  DNA  from HPV 16 and 18 is high and indicate the patient get severe cervical cancer.
Beside that, we try to take the advantage of tea plant. Tea plant (Camelia sinensis) has catechin compounds that contains antioxidants.  Catechin family that most effective used as antioxidant is Epigallocathecin gallate (EGCG).  Based on research in vitro or in silico, EGCG is able to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells because stop over-expression between L1 HPV 16- EGFR (Epithel Growth Factor Receptor) bond but there are few of EGCG content in tea plant. Based on these problems, we would to over- expression EGCG by knockdown non-compound EGCG gene, so hopefully the content of EGCG on tea are more prominent.
SCT (screening Cancer Therapy) is a kit which contains of hela cells as cervical cancer cells and it was designed to screening the plants that have compund potentially for cervical cancer therapy. Herbs that potentially as a therapy of cervical cancer in the kit are marked by the absence of green or red colors, while the negative results are marked by the emergence of green or red in the kit. The kit is expected to provide convenience to the researchers in the field of cervical cancer and cervical cancer effects can be mitigated with natural compound that not a lot of side effects.
From all of above, we bring C3P (Cervical Cancer Program)"

During my years of clinical training, I truly understand the influence brought by intestinal diseases to our patients. For example, the recurrence of the disease seriously affects people's health and lives and aggravates their economic conditions.
Intestinal microecology is the research hotspot in recent years. However many pathogenesy of intestinal diseases is still vague. I’m greatly interested in studying inflammatory bowel disease from the perspective of intestinal microecology.
Q: We really hope to learn more about the classification of intestinal lesions from the perspective of medicine.
A1: The first classification of lesions in digestive system is mainly based on dissection, including esophageal diseases, gastroduodenal diseases, small intestinal diseases, colon diseases, anorectal diseases, liver diseases and biliary and pancreatic diseases.
Actually, each disease from different splanchna can make a sub-classification, like congenital disease or genetic disease, inflammatory diseases, tumor diseases, infectious diseases, metabolic diseases, etc. Also there are other symptoms of gastrointestinal involvement caused by some certain disease. For example, immune disease can cause the gastrointestinal involvement.
A2: There are four types of lesions in digestive system : esophageal and gastric diseases, intestinal disease, liver diseases and biliary and pancreatic diseases. Intestinal disease includes infectious intestinal disease, inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic bowel disease, autoimmune enteropathy, medical bowel disease and tumor enteropathy.
Q: As an outstanding doctor, you must have participated in many major discussions of operations on patients and intractable cases. We would appreciate it if you can offer us some details about some cases caused by inflammatory intestinal disease and patients’ following development.
A1: Inflammatory intestinal diseases is an important type of intestinal disease, which is one of the priorities of our work here at Department of Gastroenterology. There are mainly two types of inflammatory intestinal diseases: ulcerative colitis and  Crohn's disease.
The target organ of ulcerative colitis(UC) is colorectal mucosa mostly, which means that inflammation is limited in mucous layer. The main clinical symptoms are abdominal pain, diarrhea and blood stool with mucus and pus. Most of cases are chronic and recurrent, and a little of them is fulminant. We treat mild-moderate patients with 5-aminosalicylic acid(5-ASA) preparation. If the patient is not sensitive to 5-ASA, we give them glucocorticoid. If the patient is also resistant to glucocorticoid, we add imuran(AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine(6-M"

The killing ability of warrior1 is rather weak. The weakness is partly because that warrior1 kills itself, and partly because it does not effectively kill beggar2. This result is consistent when our orthogonality test, as the orthogonality of warrior2 is quite well, but the orthogonality of warrior1 is not very good.    In order to solve this problem, we have to modify our gene circuit so that warrior 1 does not kill itself and at the same time, effectively kill beggar2."

With the advances of the pharmaceutical companies, the use of hormonal contraceptives has increased in the female population. In Brazil, about 79% of women use a contraceptive method, being 35% of the hormonal kind. This has generated a greater release of EE2 in the environment.  Also, there has been a greater worldwide consume of several other products containing estrogens, such as other pharmaceutical products, cosmetics, pesticides, plastic packages, and others. The effects of this increased consumption can be seen in the rivers and other aquatic environments. In Brazil, the concentration of estrogens in some cities is alarming.
Estrogens Dangers
Ecotoxicity
Once they are so biologically active, the presence of estrogens in the water can directly interfere and cause harmful effects in the life cycle of many living things. In this context, fish are the most investigated, since they can be affected by the lower concentrations of EDC, thus been used as indicators of environmental changes.  Among the most serious consequences of estrogens is the decrease in growth and reproduction rates, related to the reduction of the reproductive system and even the feminization of the males. Both in fish and in amphibians and birds, these effects can be analyzed through biomarkers such as vitellogenin (VTG), a protein normally found only in females, whose production is stimulated with the presence of sex steroids.
Toxic effects on humans
There are no conclusive studies to prove the toxic effects of estrogens on human health through environmental exposures, which can be attributed to the marked difficulty in demonstrating a causal relationship when the process of endocrine disruption is addressed. Even so, it is known that there are numerous possible adverse effects on human health, especially related to changes in the endocrine system. These include effects on the female reproductive system - sexual differentiation, ovarian function, increased risk of breast and vaginal cancer, polycystic ovaries and endometriosis - and in the male reproductive system - reduced sperm production, increased risk of testicular cancer, and of prostate, infertility, and alterations in hormone levels of the thyroid.
One of the estrogens with the highest risk of toxicity is the Bisphenol-A (BPA) plasticizer. Therefore, due to a worldwide concern about the presence of this compound in plastic packaging, a report was organized by the United Nations (UN) in 2010:

For that, they have to be convinced   aptly. Team: Do  you  think  that  our  product  can  be  easily  incorporated  into  the  food  quality  control   industry, given the available practices in that field? what industries can we target? Professor Mishra: yeah, concept­wise, it appears OK. But still those people need to know the exact   details of how it works, the pros and cons, disposal issues (if any), which are the substrates on   which it works best and several other factors. The stability and user­friendliness of the product   are of utmost importance while deciding its integration into the market. You can target the local   companies manufacturing analytical instruments at first...they are the ones which  can try and   introduce  your product at a  small level and then increase  your influence gradually. Eg. Alpha   moss, Novozymes, Fox, etc.
Professor Ritwik Kumar Layek
Some of our team members had a discussion with Professor Ritwik Kumar Layek of the Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering Department of IIT Kharagpur. We concluded that there are some enzyme parameters and other enzyme reaction kinetics data which has to be searched from existing literature.
We got to know about some platforms from where we can build our concepts on system engineering and mathematical modelling. This discussion gave us a good review from the perspective of a professor of Electronics background, which was very beneficial. We convey our sincere thanks to him and really appreciate his help and efforts.

Workshops
Institute of Genetic Engineering (IGE):
The workshop at IGE was aimed at spreading the concept of synthetic biology and awareness about   iGEM. The students were quite enthusiastic and were eagerly interacting during and after the   workshop. We also got a chance to visit their labs and see their work. Most of the students were   new to the concept of synthetic biology and hence, were curious to know about its aspects and   scope as a research field. Our workshop was followed by a presentation by an M.Sc student of that   college, on the topic of synthetic biology only. After the two presentations, we had a fruitful   discussion with the students and the professors. They were appreciating our project and were giving   valuable suggestions. We told them that we wish to see an iGEM team from their college within the   next few years. They were quite welcoming regarding the participation in"

Dr. Samuel Yu is currently the Associate Director in the Health, Safety and Environment Office of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Prof. Yu is also an Adjunct Associate Professor of School of Public Health and Primary Care, Faculty of Medicine, Chinese University of Hong Kong.
Ms. Christine Chiu is currently the Senior Specialist in the Health, Safety and Environment Office of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).
Prof. Tom Richard is a faculty of Agricultural and Biological Engineering in Penn State University. He is also a director of Penn State Institutes for Energy and Environment.
Dr. Samuel Yu, Ms. Christine Chiu and Prof. Tom Richard have all worked as judges for human practice in previous years. Interviewing them helped us broaden our perspective of human practice and also our understanding of the purpose and impact of human practice in iGEM. We hope that by incorporating the content of the interview in our Human Practice Handbook future iGEM teams can have deeper understanding of objectives of Human Practice and develop better projects.
Interview with Human Practice Judges from Within Our Institution
To find out more about Human Practice from the judges’ point of view, we contacted the past human practice judges in our institution and scheduled an interview with them. We started the interview off by asking how they would define human practice. Dr. Samuel Yu and Ms. Christine Chiu defined human practice as everything beyond the technical aspects and also as a “promotion of iGEM and synthetic biology using different tools”.
During the interview Dr. Samuel Yu and Ms. Christine Chiu mentioned several times that they are looking for a novel and creative project. They also emphasized that the process of how you get to the product of human practice project is important. Also, they chose governors and young students as the most important target audience. Moreover, we discussed about some worthwhile areas to be explored in human practice and the prospect of"

Oxford,2016,Team:Oxford#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," BBa_K1758324 is also incorrectly labelled.
When we designed this part we flipped the CueR and the constitutive promoter to face the opposite direction on the opposite strand i.e. so they were divergent. We also had to remove the 5'UTR, which Bielefeld found to increase expression, because it was too AT rich to be synthesised.
Unfortunately, every attempt to amplify this part from the synthesised sequence we received from IDT resulted in the same two point mutations in the sfGFP region of this part making it non-functional. To compare this promoter system to the others we designed, we used our parts with chelator-sfGFP fusions instead of the sfGFP which we expected to have similar behaviour.
Conclusion
Over the course of the summer we have successfully created and submitted 13 sequence-confirmed BioBrick parts, 8 of which have been characterised. Through our experiments, we have been able to examine the copper-sensitivity of a variety of promoters integral to our Cure. In addition, we have tested the chelating-ability of our copper chelators with a variety of different assays. Although these have not all been successful, through a collaboration with Cardiff we have been able to obtain preliminary data suggesting that MymT may be able to successfully lower the intracellular copper concentration. We have also obtained promising preliminary data relating to the delivery of substances to the small intestine via alginate-chitosan beads.
In conclusion, over the course of the summer we have successfully managed to produce an initial proof of concept for our idea and have contributed to our understanding of these systems, in addition to investigating a treatment that addresses the needs and concerns of the patients themselves.
Future
To further develop our project, we would hope to carry out a number of further experiments to allow us to generate something more than a proof-of-concept model. Primarily, we would hope to properly characterise the copper-chelating ability of Csp1 and confirm its localisation in the periplasm by redesigning the TAT sequence. Additionally, we would carry out further experiments to refine our delivery system.
Once the system was able to successfully operate in E. coli DH5-α, we would hope to express it in a strain that more closely mimics the bacteria of the gut. More information on a potential future chassis choice can be found on our safety page .
Finally, the design of our system went through many iterations over the summer. One of our most ambitious designs was based on logic gates that would provide an additional safety mechanism. We would love to test this system."

Reaching Out to the Community
WSSC Visit
We went to the Patuxent Water Filtration (WSSC) in Laurel, Maryland. The purpose of this visit was to obtain an industrial outlook on methods of water purification and the deleterious effects of metal contamination in drinking water. In light of the events that occurred in Flint, Michigan with widespread lead poisoning, it was emphasized to us the importance of pre-emptive corrosion treatment in pipelines (using small amounts of orthophosphate).
From this visit, we were introduced to the various steps in the water filtration process beginning with flocculation, followed by sedimentation, granular filtration (anthracite coal), and UV sterilization for cryptosporidium. Similarly, the implication of our metal detection project is to give high school students an idea of what the entire water filtration process entails, why metal detection matters on a large scale and how metal detection plays a critical role in the purification of water. Using what we learned from this visit to the WSSC, we hope to integrate a component for metal detection in water into the overall lesson plans.
We also learned about the effects of front-end chlorination during the filtration process which leave trihalomethanes (THM) byproducts in the water, components that were suspected to be carcinogens.
Manganese dioxide coating on filtration systems to prevent corrosion, but manganese leeching causes discoloration in water. While the water may be clean (according to the standards in place), from the business perspective, consumers will not want to purchase this water simply because it is not visually appealing. This is a problem for filtration plants because in order to introduce a manganese dioxide coating into the system, they would need to shut off the water to that system and allow for the coating to form. This coating takes upwards of 7 days to form, which is an issue for business.

« I was impressed by the energy of the whole team and I hope that my students will pick up on this. They enjoyed the day and they had a taste of the ""real life"" of bioengineer and synthetic biology. »
Jean-Pierre Lardet - Biology teacher
In september, our team invited two groups of high school students to come to EPFL, in Lausanne. The first group was a swiss German class from Bern (25 students), who came for one hour to attend a general presentation explaining the basics of synthetic biology, the iGEM competition and our project. The second group was composed of 4 classes (80 students) from our region, Canton de Vaud. They spent the whole day with us, receiving a complete theorical and practical overview of synthetic biology.
Before their visit, we sent both groups a quiz (13 multiple choice questions) about synthetic biology, and also asked them about their opinion concerning GMOs. We wanted to know more precisely how much they had already learned at school about synthetic biology, and what were the important points that had to be brought up during the presentation. At the end of the presentation or at the end of the day (respectively for the Swiss-German or local students) we asked them to complete the quiz again, to compare the number of right answers.
High school students during our presentation
General presentation
We did the same general presentation for both groups. The presentation had three parts. The first one was about iGEM, the modalities and principles of the competition, the number of participating teams, the contribution of each team, etc. The second part was about synthetic biology and, after talking about common lab techniques and procedures, we talked about the third part, our « BioPad » project.
This was all we did with the Swiss-German students. The local group discovered other aspects of biology through activities we had organized during the afternoon. For these, we divided the group in two; one sub-group went to our lab to participate in the workshops, the other went to a class room to do the mini-iGEM projects, and then we switched the groups so that everyone went everywhere.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," use around 80.000 barrels of oil in the world per day (Index Mundi, 2015) . As described, this is very environmentally unfriendly and furthermore fossil resources are not unlimited. Therefore, most people do agree that we have to take measures in order to promote renewable energy sources and to limit the use of fossil resources. However, the price of oil has almost halved in the last 5 years, which makes it a very cheap and therefore attractive energy source nowadays (Index Mundi, 2015) .
Solar panels with regular encapsulation layers
To protect the photovoltaic cells of a solar panel, solar panels require an encapsulation layer. They are mostly made from glasslike materials and they generally decrease the efficiency of the solar panels. The price is currently lower than the price of the microlens arrays.
Chemically produced microlens arrays
While the other forms of potential compaction are all substitutes, chemically produced microlens arrays can be considered as a direct competitor. The chemically produced MLAs are very environmentally unfriendly and expensive. The price can rise to hundreds of euros per cm2. However, it is expected that the price will decrease when the production volumes increase. Another drawback of the chemically produced MLAs compared to the biologically produced MLAs, is the size of the microlenses. The biological microlenses, with a size of less than 1 µm, will probably be smaller than the chemically produced alternatives.
Conclusion
We have compared the 4 alternatives in the field of price, efficiency, sustainability, the influence of the alternative on the environment and the acceptance among the public. The results can be found in Table 2.

Pricing and Promotion
Pricing
The pricing of our microlens arrays will depend on the benefits, type of relation and the volumes. It is announced that the increased efficiency of the solar panels is the main benefit for the customer.  Our goal is to get a strong buyer-supplier relationship with a limited number of customers or even one specific customer. We will use the pricing by customer benefit strategy to determine the selling price of the microlens arrays for every single customer.

Uppsala-Sweden,2009,Team:Uppsala-Sweden#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," simply the expression for the change of substrate  concentrations over time, that is influx minus outflux. If we assume constant substrate concentration as in #2 the change in product concentration is given by influx substrate ks minus outflux through other paths than ethanol kt*s. Rewritten this yields equation (c).
(b & c)
Where ks is the rate of substrate formation (flux of the glycolysis), kcat is the maximum number of enzymatic reactions catalyzed per second for the intoduced pathway, kt is the rate constant for the loss of substrate to other pathways, in our case primarily to the Krebbs cycle, Km is the substrate concentration at half the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) and s is the substrate concentration.
Having the Km and Kcat values (obtained in literature) gives e0 from the level of product formation, rewritten equation (c).
(d)
3. Having e0 and letting kt go towards zero gives ks. kt can be assumed to approach zero provided that the Krebbs cycle is the main native consumer of pyruvate and that the inhibition of the PDC is successful. Gives a rearranged equation (b).
(e)
4. Assuming ks to be constant within the interval and assuming steady-state (ds/dt = 0) and rearranging to a 2:nd degree equation which is easily solved numerically.
(f)
S is a function of f(x,y) where x is proportional to e0 and y is proportional to kt through the fitting constants A and B which are determined by measuring the substrate (pyruvate) concentration at different levels of enzyme concentration and inhibition of the PDC. In other words this correlates with the activity  of the promoters for the ethanol construct and the PDC inhibiting construct determining the two main outflux paths for pyruvate respectively. These are then the two factors we can change in the system by using two different inducible promoters.
The solution to the equation (f) gives a negative square root as the second answer which can be disregarded as both A and B are always positive and negative substrate levels are not physically acceptable.
(g)
Measure for different x and y (activity of the two promoters) and fit the function to data through A and B.
Integrating (c) gives the final expression for product levels dependent only on the activity of the promoters, given our assumptions are reasonably correct. The assumption that we don't have any product (ethanol) at t=0 gives D=0

Repressilator
01  Background
      Repressilator is the                                     necessary                                     and basic part of our project, which ‘grant’ the four melatonin-synthetic enzymes                                     (actually COMT) periodically expression pattern.
      Repressilator was first construct by Michael B.                                     Elowitz & Stanislas Leibler in 2000. As                                     a well-characterized synthetic circuit, it is designed to help understand naturally                                     occurring oscillating networks and remarkably precise and robust dynamics shown in                                     many                                     biological systems, for example, the circadian clock.                                     Just like the name ‘repressilator’ indicate, the circuit actually is built from the                                     combination of (three) transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any                                     natural biological clock, they inhibit mutually to achieve an oscillating pattern,                                     (A B                                     C A); in other words, each of the downstream gene is controlled by the previous                                     repressors. The protein half life of the repressors and the induction threshold of                                     the                                     promoter mainly contribute to the oscillating pattern and period.
      In the original ones the reporter is built in                                     another plasmid and co-transform into the                                     E.coli. pSC101 is choosed for the backbone because of its low replicating number. In                                     2016 researchers do some modification work for the both plasmid and E.coli starin.                                     Reporters are inserted into the repressilator plasmid and fuction simutanously as                                     trition sponge because triple reporters have exactly the same promoters of                                     repressors                                     elongating the period of reaching induction threshold for the repressors and                                     diluting                                     repressor effective concentration referring to the number of proteins binding with                                     the                                     operator sequence in the promoter.(Fig1)

      To some extent, original repressilator can                                     exhibit a                                     wide range of dynamical features"

Nathan is a great reflection of our team: he shines trough his transdisplinarity. His studies at Ecole Polytechnique are centered around physics but for our project he did multiple things from labwork to the scenario. His greatest perks are his oral skills: Nathan is an outgoing extrovert and he is a great speaker. Also he is always in a good mood and the life of the party, so if you feel like it don't hesitate to offer to go for a beer afterwork: he'll be up for it!

Mutant TetRs
In vitro Main | Why TetR? | Mutant TetRs | MITOMI Data | In-vivo & In-vitro outline
Strategy
Having done a litterature search, we decided to focus first on mutating some key amino acids rather than going for random mutations. The most important residues seem to be the V36, E37, P39 and Y42 ones.
We used two distinct strategies to create these mutants:
Site-specific mutagenesis , which consists of both a plasmid amplification step with forward and reverse primers containing the targeted mutation and a selection step (enzymatic digestion of the methylated dsDNA)
PCR-induced mutagenesis , which specifically amplifies two halves of the gene of interest from a linear template and introduces a mutation in one of them, followed by a stich-PCR to join the two halves and add the necessary extensions.
The plasmid that we used had a C-terminal eGFP fusion to the TetR, while the linear template had a C-terminal His-tag. The promoters added were SP6 in the first case and T7 in the second.
Mutants obtained
Here is a list of all the mutants we created, their characterization statut and a link to their respective PartsRegistry page.

FJNU-China,2018,Team:FJNU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," About the impact of broad-spectrum antibacterial, the doctor pointed that our armpit area is small, and sterilization is only local sterilization, which will not cause too much impact on the flora on the skin.
 
Cosmetics company
    Also, we went on a visit to cosmetics company. We learned about that current antibacterial products are usually chemically synthesized, the process of which is complex, costly and cause certain environmental pollution. Rose spice is traditionally extracted from rose with low yield, now is mostly produced by chemical synthesis, which produces unwanted by-products and environmentally unfriendly. Comparatively speaking, our PLA and 2-PE are considered as nature and safe by European and U.S. food agencies, and what we produced with synthetic biology is more environmentally-friendly, nature and safer. After listening to our introduction, the sales manager believes that our rose-scented bacteriostat have certain economic benefits and broad market prospects.     In addition, here we got closer to emulsion manufacturing process, and have got some guidance for our applied design. They fully affirmed our vision of making deodorant lotions and provided us with the formula for making this lotion. (More details on our Applied Design page)
Investigation
Questionnaire
    It is very important to integrate societal considerations throughout the design and execution in our project, towards our vision of a healthier, greener and sustainable world. In the early times of our project, we designed a questionnaire and distribute it online and throughout our activities. The participants reached over 200 at the age of 18 to 55 years. After analyzing the data, we found that, the majority of people are eager to have a better product to deal with harmful bacteria and unpleasant smells in life, for that they think there are some shortcomings of the products on the market. 63% of people have a more positive and non-objective attitude toward applying safe bacteria to the skin.(Click here to see our questionnaire )
Alternatives of PLA
    To evaluate how our project affects the society, we try to make a functional comparison about our rose-scented bacteriostat and like products on the market. After market research, we chose a kind of hand sanitizer with jasmine fragrance and one kind of soap which is typical on the market as comparison. We exposed the prepared plates to the laboratory for 12 hours and then applied the same amount of these three products on the plates. They were observed after 12 hours of incubation in the same environment. We obviously found that the soap of such brand has a relatively weaker antibacterial effect than the other two products"

Still Colliding Objects
Retrospective Notebook: This entry was not written on this day, but derived later from working notes I made that day.
I was still encountering problems with the collisions that I was using for my messaging system. Using collisions to trigger interactions between my molecule objects is unavoidable, that's just the only way for it to work: they hit each other! Finally, I settled on the system I'm still using now: since it's impossible to determine just what an object has collided with, objects that care about interacting with others now broadcast their name and position to all objects that might be interested on collision. If, for example, a Promoter receives a collision message from an RNA Polymerase, it's up to the promoter to determine whether the RNAP is allowed to bind, and then whether it is close enough to the promoter to connect.
Also began to encounter problems with objects having multiple copies of the 'stay put' script, each in different prims within the object. One could end up in the unintuitive situation of clicking a multi part object several times, but failing to change its state. Fixed this problem by having the multiple stay put scripts in a single object message each other to stay synchronized, so that when one click makes the object physical, all the other scripts know that the next click should make it nonphysical (despite not receiving the first click themselves).

UChicago,2014,Team:UChicago#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"ations of Dam, EmrR, and MutT into IPTG-GFP, all of which look good. Yay, first real biobricks!
Wednesday
The cell line we’re using to make competent cells (XL1-Blu) that we’re trying to grow up is growing up faster than we expect, so we made a growth curve for how the OD changes over time. Did colony PCRs on attempted ligations of various mutators (Mut L, MutS, DinB, DnaE, MutY) into TyrR, but they all looked bad. Ligation fail.
Thursday
We made competent cells today finally, and transformed some test plates to make sure they actually work. We redid the PCR to verify the mCherry plasmid, which again looked bad, so we’re just going to retransform mCherry just to be safe.
Friday
Success! Competent cells are actually competent after about 12 hours of growth. They look possibly pink, just as expected (since the plasmid they’re transformed with expresses RFP)
Week 8 8/4 - 8/8
Monday
Resuspended and transformed mcherry+lva from the distribution kit again. We've been using this a lot and looks like we’re running pretty low on this! Let’s hope the transformation will succeed and our glycerol stock will be fine! Also transformed the sequence verified IPTG+GFP plasmid and those with EmrR, Dam and MutT for later use in the mutation rate analysis.
Tuesday
Transformation yesterday seems ok! Since there are a few colonies on the negative control, we restreaked the transformed colonies just to be sure. And finally, the long-awaited MIC determination test was done today! As a preliminary experiment, we plated saturated, 1:100 and 1:10000 dilutions of XL1-Blue cells onto cam plates with various rif concentrations.
Wednesday
The restreaked colonies grew! Promptly checked the colonies by colony PCR and made overnight cultures of them for miniprepping.
Only less than 5 colonies grew on the 5ug/ml rif plates, and none on the other plates! This is unexpected, as there should be as many colonies as the plain LB plates in the lower rif concentration plates. Looks like there’s gonna be more rif experiments!
Thursday
As we accidentally added an extra RBS overhang in our AroF primer, we PCRed out AroF again using our new primer without the overhang. The gel looks good! Let's miniprep it!

E. Coli
Pyruvate Decarboxylase & Alcohol Dehydrogenase
JC:  The EnzyChrom Ethanol Detection Kit was used again to test ethanol production in s70/PDC/ADH in NEB Iq E. coli cells.  The cultures were grown over 24h with the addition of 2% glucose, to test the effects of glucose on E. coli growth.  With these constructs, 0.02% Ethanol was detected.
Bay Laurel Thioesterase
MT: The sequencing results of sigma 70/ BTE in pSB1C3 showed a succseful clone and is ready for submission to iGEM.
A Free Fatty Acid Assay was done on the BTE with sigma 70 promter in Iq cells. The samples were also ran through a Gas Chromotagrapher to determine concentration of C-12 fatty acids. ( For more specific results please look in Enymology section.)
Cyano
ThiE/GLF:
VG:The sequencing data for GLF was checked and confirmed the presence of GLF in pSB1C3. Thus, we will submit the DNA as a part to the iGEM Registry of Biological Parts.
A temperature gradient from 50-70C was run for a PCR reaction of GLF.  This gradient did not yeild satisfactory results.
AGP/INV:
Procedure: PCR amplification was used to linearize the agp/vector backbone. Three PCR attempts were made using either ""back-to-back"" primers (i.e. AGP_KNR forward and KN_AGP reverse) or INV_AGP forward and AGP_KNR reverse primers. PCR was executed with an initial annealing temperature of 60 degrees C and verified on 0.7 % agarose gel at 13.8 V/cm.
Results: The electrophoresis indicated that the agp/vector was not linearized by PCR. No band was observed at the expected size of agp+topo vector of 4268 bp.

XJTLU-CHINA,2015,Team:XJTLU-CHINA#Team_-_-_TEXT.html,"hou Wang, a XJTLUer major in biology science, and that’s my first time participating in iGEM competition. In this amazing team, I really enjoy the time spent with other team members during our project. As a team member, conducting experiments is my major task in which caution and preciseness keep in my mind all the time. iGEM is a gate for me to formally enter in research field. I don’t want to struggle for gold medal but rather build relationships and learn incredible knowledge as well as recognizing how “things” are created from parts by measures of synthetic biology. We strive for perfection with our wisdom and capture the everyone’s light of wisdom to perfect perfection.
Wang Zixu
My name is Wang Zixu, a member of XJTLU igem team. You can also call me William. It is a great honor to take part in this competition where I learned a lot about synthetic biology and made lots of new friends.
Yinsiyi Wang
Hello, everyone! I am Yinsiyi.Wang, a photographer in XJTLU-CHIAN iGEM team. Although I am an urban planning graduate and I know iGEM is synbio competition, however I still can help our team in human practice part. I take picture and video to record our work in summer. I am very happy to join them and also I want to make new friends in Boston. Giant jamboree I am coming!
Tianhua Zhai
Hello everyone! I am Tianhua.Zhai. I am a biology student in Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, which is an international and novel university in China. This year I join the iGEM-XJTLU team to fight for the gold medal in iGEM competition. I am responsible for writing our wiki and supporting lab group in our team. Also, I work for human practice to let public know iGEM and synbio. iGEM is a fantastic and challengeable competition, I feel really excited and pleased to participate in it. I would like to learn how to work in a team and make true friends. I believe that there is no royal road to science, and only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summits.

PhD in Developmental Genetics
After spending all his life in the city, Gabrielius simply hates the idea of sleeping in a tent.                      However, to our surprise, recently he moved to the German countryside to pursue his PhD dream.                      It turned out to be a right choice after he magically made every wet lab experiment work in                      iGEM. Outside the lab, Gabrielius nailed every single sport branch and was the single worthy                      opponent of Simas at foosball. As a prize for remarkable performances, Gabrielius used teams’                      budget to rent cars for his own needs for half a year.

In view of internationality while being born in the Belarus,                      living and mentoring foreign students in Lithuania, planning the future in the USA, it is safe                      to assume she is the „i“ in „iGEM“.

Ieva is the junior-mom of our team. She knows exactly how many spoons of coffee and how much                      milk everyone prefers in it. Ieva sleeps like a mother of a newborn - approximately not at all.                      Although power-naps of total unconsciousness are her specialty as well. We should be thankful                      for such womanliness and charm she has, because one of her suitors is creating a model for our                      project. While she may seem harmless, years of rowing a canoe built her inner strength to                      wrestle Gabrielius, yet nothing helped against her dreadful fear of phages lysing her cells.

Topics app
In the topics app the main element is the entry box, where the user can enter a term to find, which works very similar to the entry box for team name filter. The text turns red when there is no exact match in the meshterms assigned to the teams and otherwise black. Those teams exactly matching the searched term are again displayed in a tabular format. The filter function currently is exactly the same as for the methods, but has to be altered, to also allow for typing mistakes, case unsensitivity and partial string matches. Here we also added a list of the top 10 topics.
Data update and completion
There were many automatic and manual corrections done on the data. These included synchronisation of track and award naming, as well as some double or missing awards.
Name synchronisation
The naming of the tracks and awards was not conserved over the years, but basically kept the value they had. One example is the extension of the 2007 Energy track to the Food or Energy track in 2008. The same applies for other compined tracks, but there were also minor differences, that needed fixing, as for example medals starting with upper or lower case letters. Most of these were solved using regular expressions, when converting the data from JSON to R. See table 23.2 for all synchronisations made.

Imperial_College_London,2010,Team:Imperial College London#Brainstorming_-_-_TEXT.html," making the population number oscillate around this arbitrary threshold. This might be done by some clever use of quorum sensing systems acting on survival, growth or resistance genes to influence the performance of bacteria depending on the population density. However this construct would be evolutionarily unstable, as bacteria that lost the ability to self regulate growth would inevitably proliferate and out compete the functional bacteria.
Safe biofilms
We came up with similar approaches to making biofilms safer, for example by making the bacteria interdependent. This might be done by promoting cell survival via quorum sensing systems, so bacteria that become detached from the biofilm would die shortly after. This might make them safer for the environment, limiting their spread, as well as for use in medicine, preventing tissue invasion.
Cell state reporters
This idea was to monitor cell activity which might be useful for scientists in many situations. We proposed the use of cell state reporters to quickly give visual information of the activities or phase the cells are undergoing. This might help to maintain a healthy population and to determine whether population grows anaerobically or aerobically. Furthermore it could be used as a warning signal when cells undergo undesired/stressful phases and to examine if the cells grow in synchrony. Many different regulon systems could potentially exploited for this purpose including without limitation:
Ntr and Nif system that detect ammonia limitation
Arc and Fnr system that detect anaerobic conditions
The SOS and response to UV light
Sporulation in response to starvation and the heat shock response
Use of system specific promoter, enhancer or repressor elements could be used to create a system that gives feed back in the form of different fluorescent proteins to the degree to which the system is activated and by extension about the environment the cell is in.
Biofuels
We spent some time thinking about new ways in which bacteria could be used to produce biofuels, as well as trying to come up with more substances that could be used as biofuels, rather than relying on petrol, ethanol and simple sugars too much. Initial ideas included without limitation the use of octopine or nopaline from the T-DNA of Argobacterium. However ultimately we did not find this an exciting enough project to pursue.
TV screen
We thought about enhancing the iGEM project of the Valencia team 2008 who built a black and white bioscreen using yeast cells with voltage gated ion channels to produce a colour change. We considered implementing colour in this system to create a simple bio-TV. However the project would have been too similar to the original project so we dropped it quite early through our project development"

This scripts include jquery, bootstrap, parallax, phpmailer and revolution slider.
Valencia Polytechnic university Quality Software Professors from the Computation & IT department have collaborated with our team for the application of some usability standards based on similar commercial tools and ISO/IEC 9216 usability controls. The fact of using MEAN technology with REST enrouting supports us in usability, as by using this enrouting, the differentiation from what the user is doing in which moment is stressed out, allowing that future incidences to be processed by user’s assistance online center easily with a screenshot or a programme route. So the incidence could be detected and situated.
The code is documented by Airbnb style guides, a mean web standard which allows easy code maintenance for developers.
Scoring System
It will only be considered as a possible target the DNA sequence on the gene which meets the both following conditions:
The target ends with the PAM -NGG
The target starts with a G 20 nucleotides before de PAM
Thus, a good target will be the one which matches with the search of a G-20-GG sequence. For one of the score criteria it is mandatory to know which nucleotide follows the PAM, so every sequence matching with the pattern GXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX will be stocked in a list. Moreover, those sequences located so close to the start or the end of the sequence whose primers cannot be designed will be automatically discarded in this step. Once all possible targets are found, they will be processed with the scoring system, whose source code is shown below:
//1. PAM criteria 1.0
For all the possible targets, if the first nucleotide after finishing the PAM NGG is a T, we assign 10 point and a 1 in the score around, if not, 0 points are assigned.
//1. PAM criteria 2.0
For all the possible targets, if they are at the beginning of the gene, more points will be obtained, if they are found in the first tenth of the gene, they are going to obtain 50 points in the global score and 1 position point, if they are found in the first quarter part but not in the first tenth, half of the points will"

Figure 1: Summarizing parts that we built for each of the components of our system. For our detector, indicated in green, we built different TALE proteins that we characterized using nitrocellulose and immuno based assays. To find out more about our detector click here . We submitted two new reporters-- ferritin and β-lactamase and characterized these proteins individually. To bring the detector and the reporter together we used a linker by using E coil and K coil.
Characterization of  New Parts Submitted to the Registry
Submitted two new reporters to the registry: Beta-lactamase ( Bba_ K1189008 ) and Recombinant Human Ferritin  ( Bba_ K1189008 ). We submitted these parts alone, with 6-his tags and lacI inducible promoters and fused to TALE-A (Slovenia 2012). In addition, we submitted Recombinant Human Ferritin with E coil dimerization domains in order to be used as a modular scaffold ( Bba_K1189018 ).
Expressed Ferritin ( Bba_ K1189008 ), which possesses 24 subunits, and showed successful chemical conversion of our expressed protein into Prussian Blue ferritin. We also showed that this part could feasibly be used as a reporter in a nitrocellulose test-strip system as well as in solution.
Expressed and purified beta-lactamase both with and without TALE-A ( Bba_ K1189007 ) and ( Bba_ K1189031 ) and characterized the functionality of these Biobricks as a reporter using both pH and ampicillin"

Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With"

E. coli W Sucrose Metabolism Experiment
In the application of our project, PowerCell would grow alongside and support a productive microorganism strain such as E. coli W. We were thus interested in seeing whether E. coli W could grow in the conditions generated by PowerCell. This meant culturing on minimal BG-11 media with added sucrose to simulate secretion by Anabaena.
Growth of our E. coli W varies by amount of sucrose (there was no 200ul plate for 80mM sucrose)
Based on literature (Niederholtmeyer, et al,2010) and correspondence with Mr. Ducat, we predicted that our Anabaena culture would produce no more than 8mM of sucrose. It would be difficult to support substantial E. coli growth on such low levels without a means of concentrating sugar via in the bioreactor design.
E. coli W colonies on BG-11 agar + 60 mM sucrose
Initially we attempted to compare growth on BG-11 + sucrose with liquid cultures. However, multiple attempts yielded no appreciable change in O.D. after several days of incubation. We suspect that this was because E. coli growth was too small to detect via spectrophotometer.
Next, we moved to agar plates as a more sensitive means of detecting cell growth. E. coli W with Amp resistance were grown, washed and resuspended in PBS to eliminate residual LB media, and streaked them on BG-11 Amp+ plates with varying concentrations of sugar (5mM, 10mM, 30mM, 60mM, and 80mM).
The cells were incubated at 37C and observed regularly before colonies appeared on the fifth day. Visible colonies were observed on plates with sucrose concentrations as low as 5mM. These data suggest that, with the sugar secreted by PowerCell expressing cscB and no additional metabolic engineering, it is possible to support another organism.

Effects of pH and Temperature on HB-EGF Binding
Effects of pH
Figure 31.The Estimated Graphs for DT-Vero Cells Binding (Auth’s Personal Data)
Since the base literature on the effects of pH to the HB-EGF binding is limited, the consensus of the best temperature for the binding process will be elaborated on our own experimentation, meanwhile the literature result in temperature of 4°C for binding process graph is shown above, in which the shape of the graph follows Langmuir-Hill principle. The final regression of the data utilizes the modified version of Langmuir-Hill equation, in which the team combines both trial and error and iteration method to achieve the highest R2.
TAR-Binding Kinetics
Effects of Temperature
Since the literature reference of pH influence on the binding process is also limited, this is the analysis and our consensus regarding of the pH effects.
In smaller pH (more acidic), the rates of dissociation is faster; nevertheless, once the pH is below 5.3, there will be no change in the rate since the intoxicated cells have already broken (lysis).
In the human epithelial tissues, the intoxicated cells will not be destroyed although the pH is 5.3 as the environment temperature is close to 37°C.
For research insight, the recommended temperature for testing binding rates is 25°C with range of pH between 5.6-5.9.

Paris_Bettencourt,2015,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Continuity_-_-_TEXT.html,", we performed the same PCR on the pure fragment that have been used for the assembly.
This way we ensured that the cassette was present in its entirety in the chromosome.
Sequencing of the Lox Array
To investigate whether unexpected recombination occured within the LoxP sites due to homologous recombination, we performed Sanger sequencing on the first part of the integrated cassette, where the Lox Array is. This way we could make sure that it was still intact and contained no PCR-induced mutations.
Impact of the Lox array on the transcription
The Lox array was the most difficult region to construct. As it is a very repetitive sequence with numerous dyad repeats, it is tedious to synthesize, amplify and assemble. That's why we created biobrick BBa_K1678005 . It contains the promoter followed by the four orthogonal Lox sites. We sequenced this biobrick to confirm that it contains no mutation.
We characterized this new biobrick's function by assembling it in pSB1C3 with the part
BBa_K516030
which contains a RBS, the mRFP coding sequence and a double terminator. For comparison, the biobrick
BBa_J23119
was assembled with the same mRFP cassette on the same vector.
As in prokaryotes the 30S subunit of the ribosome binds directly to the RBS, the LoxP array does not theoretically interfere with translation. It can however interfere with the transcription.
During the transcription, the RNA polymerase has to go through the LoxP array, which is made of repetitive sequences that are likely to form a hairpin. We show that this has an impact on the transcription efficiency (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, p-value < 10-6). However, it still allows for strong protein expression as the average expression level was equal to 91% of the expression level of the BBa_J23119 promoter. The fraction of RNA polymerases that go through the Lox array should be more than enough for our design.
Characterization of the promoter followed by the four LoxP sites.
Using standard biobrick assembly, three plasmids were constructed and transformed into E. coli:
The promoter directly connected to the mRFP sequence (RBS + ORF + Terminator),
The promoter connected to the Lox array, connected to the mRFP sequence,
The promoter alone, without any fluorescent proteins as a negative control.
The cells were diluted to an OD600 of 0.01, grown to exponential phase and"
DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," regulatory parts have a look into the switch section.
One important feature of the switch is the strength of the promoters. For the switch to work properly we need promoters of equal strength. To solve this problem we utilized a synthetic promoter library , enabling us to generate a library of promoters with a wide variety of different strengths.
Characterizing phage regulatory mechanisms
The main regulatory parts of the switch are the repressor/antirepressor system from the Gifsy phages and the anti-terminator system from lambda phage, see Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6.
Figure 4: Graphical presentation of the repressor part of our regulatory system from the Gifsy phages.
Figure 5: Graphical presentation of the anti-repressor part of our regulatory system from the Gifsy phages.
Figure 6: Graphical presentation of the anti-terminator part of our regulatory system from the lambda phage.
As a proof of concept for the regulatory mechanisms, we constructed plasmids that were able to test the regulatory mechanism and strength of the two systems. We used low copy number plasmids and fluorescent proteins as reporters. For more information about the experimental setup and characterization results of the Repressor - Anti-Repressor system please click here and for the Terminator - Anti-Terminator system please click here .
The key parts of the regulatory systems have been tested and are available as BioBricks through the parts registry. See the parts page for a list of available parts.
Conclusion
We have shown that the Gifsy repressor system has a sufficient tight expression and control to be used in the future construction of biological switches.
We have set up the frame work for testing anti-terminator function, but further characterization is needed before it can be applied in standard regulatory systems.
Furthermore we have designed and demonstrated the functionality of a Synthetic Promoter Library, compatible with the BioBrick standard. We have also developed a standard for integrating a BioBrick compatible Synthetic Promoter Library in bacteria in order to fine-tune the expression of BioBrick parts and devices.
We hope that this work will inspire future teams to take up the challenge of constructing a genetic bistable switch. They can easily benefit from the new DTU Synthetic Promoter Library standard and our submitted BioBricks.

When we asked if they had a product in the form of our kit if they would buy it? 83% answered positively (fig 2), suggesting the feasibility of manufacturing the product also for other nutrients that cause sensitivities.
fig 2: Percentage of people who are interested in purchasing our product
It is important to emphasize that the common treatment for food allergy is to avoid eating the same cause of allergenic; this fact requires no small expense for the purchase of supplements. If you could find suspected foods containing allergenic substances in food it may be easier to cope with avoiding and reduce the costs of food. 
The survey data showed that ten people (15%) of all survey participants are celiac patients.
100% of celiac patients who responded to the survey claimed that there is great difficulty not only in dealing with the prevention of eating but also in routine life. All patients without exception argued that the cost of gluten-free food is very high in relative to other foods. 
100% of patients claimed that the educational system does not address patients with celiac, food offered to all students is the same irrespective of celiac patients or students with other allergies.
Since the number of celiac patients in the first survey was quite small, we decided on a more extensive survey addressed solely for celiac patients. The survey was published on social networks and on the Israel Association of celiac patients.
The purpose of the second survey was to investigate the feasibility of the kit we are developing for celiac patients. The kit is intended for celiac patients and is supposed to detect the presence of gluten in food. The survey was conducted through the sharing and publishing on social networks and on the Israeli Celiac Association.
170 patients suffering from celiac participated in the survey, 142 females and 38 males.
The ages range from 2-76 years.
Most of the survey participants feel that celiac disease to some extent restricts them in their lives (fig 3).
fig 3: Does gluten sensitivity limit your daily routine
This data indicates the need to make celiac patients be less concerned and create a situation with minimal dealings with the disease. We believe lowering prices and providing an easy possibility to check for the presence of gluten in food will ease the life of celiac patients immensely. Further on in the survey we found strengthening of this speculation:

Warwick,2016,Team:Warwick#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," The advantages of using paper-based sensing over in vivo are the ease of use, stability and cost, however, if our system is used in clinics in developed areas, these benefits become secondary to concerns over sensitivity. An in vivo detection kit would be more easily tuneable for sensitivity than an in vitro paper-based kit, on the basis that it is more easily analysed under imaging and assay techniques, with the loss of ease of use and affordability. In developed areas, and when used by appropriately trained professionals, the benefits regarding sensitivity when using in vivo detection outweigh any negative aspects.

We compiled information about possible part sequences to use in our project and ran them through the Parts Registry to see what we can and cannot submit as our own parts. We then created several different sequences of one of our main parts, PETase until we decided upon an optimized mutant version that was recently discovered in April 2018. We created some rough sketches of what our complete plasmid would look like. In lab, we created competent cells out of E. coli strains MG1655 and BL21(DE3).

We discovered that our parts were too large to fit on a single plasmid, so two were developed. One uses pSB1C3 as the backbone, and the other uses pSB3K5.We decided to have one plasmid have the PETase and MHETase enzyme sequences while the second plasmid would have sequences for glycolaldehyde dehydrogenase, glycolaldehyde reductase, glycolate oxidase, and malate synthase.

We emailed the researchers about the optimised PETase and did more research on previous teams who had tried to solve the plastic problem the world faces today.

We had a meeting with Jessica for feedback on our schematic. She saw a problem with having the same RES on both ends of the spacer, because then the spacer could be added in either direction, and our sequences would not be consistent. Moreover, the sequence is very short, which will be difficult to insert into a plasmid in terms of efficiency.   We realized overnight that there was an RES in the middle of the constitutive promoter-RBS-GFP construct we were going to use from Jessica. So we re-designed the schematic to work around this RES using site-directed mutagenesis.
Week 5
Day 21, July 15
We spent the first half of the day trouble-shooting on our design schematic, confirming the proper sequences of our parts, and then designing promoters one by one together.
Day 22, July 16
We prepared for our meeting with our advisors by drawing a final schematic, and compiling a list of primers. Our advisors informed us that to simplify our design,we should construct primers with two restriction sites. This way we can just use the Biobrick methodology to construct our dual-state promoters. We set to work re-doing our primers in this manner in the afternoon. We also met with a representative from IDT, who was very helpful in providing us with $250 worth or free oligos, as well as t-shirts, lab notebooks, and nuclease-free water.
Day 23, July 17
Jessica informed us that we should be checking the temperatures and GC contents of the portion of the primer that anneals to our target. Before this, we had been checking and adjusting the temperatures of the entire strand. This means we need to re-do all of our primers.
Day 24, July 18
We performed a transformation with pSB4A1 from the kit (Kit Plate 5, Well 21D) to practice transforming a plasmid. Past iGem teams have had trouble properly extracting the DNA from the kit.
Day 25, July 19
The 7/18 transformation did not work. So we ran the same plasmid alongside a positive control using pL plasmid to check our technique.

To induce this stress, we turned on the buttons of our SmashColi microfluidic chip at a pressure of 25 psi. We imaged chambers before stress and after stress (10 min after button activation). A drastic increase in signal was detected !

Characterisation of the pBAD promoter and folding ability of GFP fused to CpxR
This construct aimed to evaluate the expression of our construct and the characteristics of the arabinose promoter in E. coli by fusing a superfolder GFP protein to CpxR. The sfGFP was chosen because of its higher intensity compared to GFP.
Not knowing if CpxR would react the same way if sfGFP were attached to the N or C terminus, 2 biobricks were built, one with each of the orientations: BBa_K1486002 (N terminus) and BBa_K1486005 (C terminus) .
We tested both constructs CpxR-sfGFP and sfGFP-CpxR on a plate reader to characterize the pBAD promoter, measuring the sfGFP signal in function of the arabinose concentration. We also measured the signal in a microfluidic chip. You can see in the graph below that the signal is increasing as the concentration of the arabinose increases. The construct with sfGFP at the C terminal lead to a higher GFP signal.
Characterisation of the split luciferase
Split luciferase complementation assay using CheY and CheZ chemotaxis proteins
CheY and CheZ are two proteins involved in the bacterial chemotaxis pathway. It has been shown by split luciferase complementation assay that these two proteins are not interacting in presence of chemoattractant, but start to interact in absence of chemoattractant or presence of chemorepellent. Based on the work of Waldor 1 Laboratory, we wanted to redo the experiment to test our own splits, with firefly ( BBa_K1486055 ) and renilla ( BBa_K1486054 ) luciferases.
As shown in the graphs (fig.1A and 1B), we didn't observe a high signal for our assay. However, the signal being higher than the blanks, it is an encouraging sign that the splits luciferase can be used for other experiments of this kind. A possible explanation for these results is that we didn't completely get"
SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"1155/2012/386410 <. As both bacteriocins and silk are proteins, we can incorporate bacteriocins into the silk polymer through gene-manipulation. We, and the iGEM team of Stockholm , performed MIC-tests to quantify the effect of our bacteriocins against resistant pathogenic bacteria. The tests show that purified bacteriocins were quite effective as growth inhibitors. For further information about bacteriocins, read here .
Spider silk was chosen due to its angiogenic properties and proliferative effect on keratinocytes (skin cells), which is not seen in the traditional used gauze Fredriksson, C., Hedhammar, M., Feinstein, R., Nordling, K., Kratz, G., Johansson, J., . . . Rising, A. (2009). Tissue Response to Subcutaneously Implanted Recombinant Spider Silk: An in Vivo Study. Materials, 2(4), 1908. <. The silk is produced natively by Nephila clavipes via repetitive coding sequences of the major silk components, MaSp1 and MaSp2 (Major Spidroin 1 and 2). In order to obtain the ability to create silk, these repetitive regions have been introduced into the E. coli via a plasmid. Synthesizing repetitive sequences are troublesome, and is difficult to do through the iGEM standard 3A assembly, due to multiple scar-sites. To avoid scar-sites we tried to synthesize the silk with the protocols provided by the 2015 iGEM team from UCLA , because they succeeded in producing spider silk from bacteria. The method allows the creation of a hybrid silk consisting of bacteriocins and spider silk. For further information about the spider silk, read here .
Poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a biosynthesized polyester, belonging to a group of biodegradable plastics called polyalkanoates (PHA). PHB is non-toxic and has a high oxygen-permeability JAMBUNATHAN, P. & ZHANG, K. C. 2016. Engineered biosynthesis of biodegradable polymers.

The combination of different promoters and ribosomal binding sites have previously been shown to positively affect the yield of PHB. The yield has further been increased by the introduction of the pantothenate kinase BioBrick. By introducing a PHB secretion system into an E. coli strain, we can possibly"
