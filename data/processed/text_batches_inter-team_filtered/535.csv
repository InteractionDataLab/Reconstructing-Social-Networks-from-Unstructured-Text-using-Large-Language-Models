PREDCEL Protocol
1. Introduction
Phage Related DisContinuous EvoLution (PREDCEL) is a batch method to perform directed evolution adapted from PACE standing for Phage Assisted Continuous Evolution.
2. Material
Respective bacterial strains, usually E. coli, with Mutation Plasmids (MP), Accessory Plasmids (AP), and if necessary further plasmids, like Complementary Plasmid (CP)
Phages carrying the Selection Plasmid (SP)
2YT medium
Glucose stock solution (final concentration: 100 mM)
Arabinose stock solution (final concentration: 100 mM)
Phage buffer solution (10 ml 1 M Tris; pH 7.5; 10 ml 1 M MgSO4;
4 g NaCl; 980 ml ddH2O)
Flasks, all common sizes
Centrifugation tubes (2 ml and 50 ml)
Table top centrifuge (minimum 6000 g are required)
Centrifuge (minimum 3750 g are required)
Incubator
Freezer, -80 °C
Fridge, +4 °C
3. Procedure
As it is important to prevent phage contaminations at any time, all of the following PREDCEL steps has to be performed with filter tips, and benches must be cleaned with 10% H202 (pay attention with handling!) or another suitable solution for phage inactivation. If practicable, use UV light on benches and in incubators to sterilize after and before your experiments. Step 1: Prove MP and AP to work
After successfully transforming your AP and MP plasmids into your bacterial strain (see transformation protocols), but before starting your PREDCEL run, make sure whether your AP and MP work is essential for the success of the intended directed evolution process or not. If yes, follow the instructions of AP testing and MP testing. Step 2: F+ strains
Make sure the used strain carries the F-Pilus plasmid as it is required for proper M13 phage infection. Thus, use a bacterial culture showing a positive result in Step 1, and plate it on a tetr"

In order to improve it and incorporate it into our Next vivo system we have codon optimized for use in E. coli and attached a C-terminal hexahistidine tag with a serine glycine linker for easy purification. We have also optimized EF-Ts to be overexpressed in BL21 DE3 gold cells by putting it under the control of a T7 promoter ( BBa_I719005 ), RBS ( BBa_B0034 ) and double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ).

Rational behind improvements: BBa_K1906004 encodes exclusively for the coding region of EF-Tu. In order to improve it and incorporate it into our Next vivo system we have codon optimized for use in E. coli and attached a N-terminal hexahistidine tag with a serine glycine linker for easy purification. We have also optimized EF-Tu to be overexpressed in BL21 DE3 gold cells by putting it under the control of a T7 promoter ( BBa_I719005 ), RBS ( BBa_B0034 ) and double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ).
Our Part:
MS2 Coat Protein
Original part: BBa_K2109108
Submitted by: Lethbridge 2016
Designed by: Andy Hudson
Rational behind improvements: This year we utilized the MS2 coat protein (MS2BP) in our purification strategy of tRNA and ribosomes. As such, we expressed and purified MS2BP along with our tRNAPhe construct. From this we concluded that MS2BP expresses, binds to Nickel Sepharose affinity column, and binds the MS2 hairpin as designed.

Uros Kuzmanovic
My name's Uros Kuzmanovic, a Junior studying Molecular and Cellular Biology. This is my first year at iGEM where I seek to not only learn the applications and procedures of synthetic biology, but also collaborate with bright individuals to design a novel project. This blurb feels too impersonal to state something personal, but something too impersonal would be uninformative, quite the conundrum. If I could, I would sit down and have coffee with you. All the best!
Adi Malik
Adi is a Junior in Bioengineering, and the Corporate Director of this year's iGEM team. He joined iGEM because of a deep interest in biotechnology, genetics and engineering. He also has an interest in business and entrepreneurship, and is spearheading the effort in this year's entrepreneurship division. All in all, he believes iGEM provides a unique opportunity to develop something, with fellow undergraduates, that can have a tangible, positive impact on the world of synthetic biology. Aside from iGEM, Adi is an undergraduate researcher and consultant with Illinois Business Consulting. He enjoys playing the guitar, running, playing basketball and figuring out creative ways to waste time.
Isiah Ramos
Isiah Ramos attended highschool at the Illinois Math and Science Academy in Aurora, IL. He is the Lab manager of the 2012 Illinois iGEM team. His major is Agricultural and Biological Engineering, and he intends to focus on Nanotechnology. He hopes to one day research genetics in order to understand genetic disorders and how to treat them
Cara Schornak
Cara Schornak, a freshman in MCBH, is excited to be on the 2012 Illinois iGEM team. She hails from the St. Louis, MO area, and is proud to bring her own diversity to the team. Cara first became interested in biology in general when she was a freshman in high school. She was inspired by the Punnett Square’s ability to predict the phenotype of the offspring of two individuals and was later drawn to epigenetics through a NOVA science episode. The field of synthetic biology also intrigued her after she heard about J. Craig Venter’s work in California and his tenacious work ethic. Cara worked for approximately two years at Washington University in St. Louis as a laboratory assistant in Dr. Doug Chalker’s lab. There she met her greatest inspiration, a Mr. Scott Horrell, who became her mentor and adviser"

Protocol
Measure 100mL of 1x TAE buffer
Transfer buffer to 125 mL flask
Weigh out enough agarose to make a 1% gel (in our case 1.0 g of agarose was the right amount)
Transfer agarose to 125mL flask
Melt agarose in microwave until solution is almost boiling, stirring every 15-20 seconds (should be around 2 minutes)
Allow agarose to cool (do not let it cool to the point where it is hard)
Add 5 μL of Red Safe to the cooling agarose
Assemble the gel pouring apparatus by inserting gate into slots
Allow gel to cool until flask can be handled comfortably
Place comb in the gel rig
Pour agarose into gel tray
Allow to solidify. While the gel is solidifying prepare the samples. Add your sample and 1 μL 10x Loading Dye, 4 μL of DNA and 5 μL of water
Pour 1X TAE over gel so that gel is covered by a 3-5mm buffer
Load samples into lane (Don't forget to load a 1kb+ ladder into one of the lanes)
Hook electrodes to gel apparatus
Run the apparatus at 100V for 30 - 45 minutes (make sure to watch that the dye"

Constructs
For the LovTap experiment we use the constructs which are already available in the PartRegistry: <partinfo>BBa_K322999</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K191003</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K191004</partinfo>
We fused a constitutive promoter (<partinfo>BBa_J23108</partinfo>) in front of the LovTap-Reporter construct BBa_K322999.
New read-out system
Due to the fact that we observed problems with the RFP output of the reporter due to bleaching, we switched the system.  As a new output we use galactosidase and measure with a Miller Assay. Also we fused an Inverter in front of the lacZ gene so we have an activation of the transcription, if LovTap is binding to the trp promoter. With this new system we are able to measure the activation of LovTap upon blue light exposure with an increasing galactosidase activity.

Chaque type de vecteur a des propriétés qui lui sont propres, mais chaque type possède également des problématiques. La technologie de vectorisation a de nombreuses problématiques récurrentes, spécifiques ou non à un type de vecteur.
Haut de page
Les problématiques de la vectorisation [13,14,15,16,17,18,19]
Aujourd’hui six problématiques majeures restent non résolues :
- Stabilité,
- Toxicité,
- Ciblage/spécificité,
- Passage de la membrane,
- Système immunitaire : résistance ou furtivité,
- Industrialisation.
La stabilité est un problème ne concernant principalement que les nanoparticules lipidiques. En effet les autoassemblages lipidiques tels que les liposomes ne sont pas stables dans le temps. In Vivo, ce type de vecteur s’agrège ou se disrupte, libérant alors son contenu. Certaines molécules, comme le cholestérol, peuvent améliorer leur stabilité, mais ils restent les vecteurs les plus fragiles et donc les moins protecteurs pour le principe actif.
La toxicité est une problématique d’origine double. Elle peut être issue d’une potentialité, de certains vecteurs, à devenir incontrôlables ou elle peut être issue des méthodes de fabrication de certains autres vecteurs. Les virus sont certainement les meilleurs vecteurs, mais ils sont aussi les plus dangereux. La potentialité, même pour les virus défectifs,  qu’ils se répliquent sans contrôle dans l’organisme d’un patient, est importante, cela étant dû au phénomène de recombinaison génomique, très fréquent dans ce type de particule biologique.
L’autre problème de toxicité provient des méthodes de fabrication des nanoparticules. L’utilisation de solvant organique pour leur conception est potentiellement dangereuse pour le patient, car même avec les étapes d’éliminations, la dose de solvant organique injectée n’est jamais nulle.
Le ciblage est une problématique étrange, censé être un avantage technologique apporté par la vectorisation, le ciblage est"

The Problem
Quorum sensing (QS) is a type of bacterial communication, a system of communication signals synthesized and received by different bacterial species. Little is known about how this and other microbial sensing systems operate in nature (Decho 2010).
AHL molecules are not completely system-specific, as crosstalk can occur between systems-this causes problems with developing functional genetic circuits
AHL quorum sensing is used to regulate factors such as virulence and biofilm formation, potentially activating pathogenic bacteria
Brief Summary
Quorum sensing (QS) is at the foundation of a wide range of high-impact bioengineering efforts such as creating new biosensors and health monitoring devices while providing a toolbox of reusable genetic components that can be plugged into circuits at will (Kwok, 2010). QS involves systems of bacteria that use sender and receiver molecules to communicate gene expression when the bacteria reach optimal densities. In doing so, quorum sensing allows bacteria to express specific genes at a high population density that results in beneficial phenotype expression.There are many different types of QS sensing molecules and in this research we will be working with a type of chemical signal called acyl-homoserine lactones (HSLs). When these signals are received by the surrounding bacteria, the signal is transduced. Creating genetic circuits is done by characterizing genetic sequences that perform needed functions and combining them into devices that are inserted into cells (Kwok, 2010).
A major problem in engineered systems is crosstalk. This is when different species of senders can activate a noncanonical receiver's promoter. When QS pathways operate without communication between unwanted cells, the pathways are orthogonal and potentially viable options for bioengineering new synthetic circuits. A sender is defined as cell that expresses AHL synthase, while a receiver is a cell that includes an inducible promoter that initiates transcription of a gene and regulator controls the expression of one or more genes. Researchers want to find systems that are completely orthogonal, in efforts to enhance efficacy while maintaining specificity [7]. The application of defining cross-talk might lead to more sophisticated intracellular communication [7].  In addition, these circuits may then be engineered to detect specific combinations of input signals that could"

Overview

Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and other information, please also put it up on the part page.
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary_-_-_TEXT.html," initiatives this year. Roll over the boxes to see each of them!
Initiative
We took the initiative with the oil sands industry and established a dialogue between industry experts, academics, and government representatives. Through these talks a roadmap for the use of synthetic biology in the oil sands was established, focusing on biosensing and bioremediation.
Interviews
As an undergraduate team, we spoke with experts in various fields, including the oil industry, tailings pond management, biotechnology, law, and politics to gather various opinions on our project. How useful is synthetic biology in a tailings pond environment? What design considerations should we include in our project to improve security? What legal policies must we consider before implementing our project?
Design Considerations
Since safety is the driving force behind our project, we need to ensure the physical design of our biosensor and bioreactor would contain and manage the bacteria to minimize the possibility of their escape. We needed to build devices that would ensure the safety of both the user and the outside environment during their use. Click here to learn more!
Killswitch
Both FRED and OSCAR are designed to operate within enclosed environments. However, since safety is our highest priority, we decided to design and implement a killswitch in both FRED and OSCAR as an extra layer of security. The killswitch aims to destroy the genome using two powerful non-specific nucleases in the unlikely event that bacteria escape into the environment. Click here to learn more!
Safety
Click here for our safety page! Here we detail all the safety procedures, certifications, and approvals we have from our University to allow us to work this summer.
Community Outreach
iGEM Calgary partnered with a number of different associations to engage the general public about science and synthetic biology. Click here to see what we've done this summer!
FRED
FRED is our Functional, Robust Electrochemical Detector. FRED is responsible for detecting and measuring naphthenic acids (NAs) and is able to produce an electrochemical signal that can be measured. FRED can be used to measure toxins in tailings pond samples within minutes, without having to ship them to an off-site lab for testing. Click on FRED to learn more!
Detecting
FRED is our star detective, working around the clock to detect toxins roaming freely in tailings pond water. FRED is known for being a little unorthodox in his methods namely by using a measurable electrochemical signal rather than colored or fluorescent reporters. Using his transposon library FRED gets clues about the genetic elements that will activate in the presence of toxins.

Stochastic Switch Cloning Strategy
We have the following cloning strategies for testing our construct.
Cloning strategies: Stochastic switch
The following is the clone manager file for our synthesised brick; using clone manager it is easy to simulate digests and ligation reactions, in order to make sure the enzymes you use in the will give the result you expect.
The stochastic brick fragment is to be cloned into the integration vector pGFP-rrnB. This is because plasmid DNA is very unstable in bacillus. From pGFP-rrnb it will integrate into the 168 chromosome at amyE. We can clone the fragment by cutting pGFP-rrnB with EcoRI and NheI, cutting the fragment with EcoRI and NheI, and ligating.
pGFP-rrnb
We also need to clone the brick into a BioBrick compatible vector for submission to MIT. Digesting the fragment with EcoR1 and Pst1 and ligation into a EcoR1 and Pst1 cut biobrick vector will do this.

Cambridge,2011,Team:Cambridge#Society#Questionnaire#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," to improve their effectiveness.
To this end, a short online questionnaire was designed and distributed by the Cambridge iGEM team in 2011, with the aim of creating a ‘census’ of the students who have taken part in iGEM teams over the past 8 years of the competition’s history. With over 60 respondents, we have amassed a sufficient amount of data to make some valid analyses; although we do urge caution against drawing any broad conclusions about the competition, since our sample is only a statistically insignificant “”% of the population size. However, on an individual scale, we do believe that we have a lot of interesting tales to tell.
We would like to thank the many iGEM team supervisors from around the globe who have helped us to get in touch with these alumni, and without which this study would not have been possible.
Notes
The respondents were not required to complete the survey, and so not all applicants responded to every question - as a result, the total number of respondents varies for each question.
We assume familiarity with the iGEM competition in the remainder of this report. If necessary, you can find out more about iGEM on their website, at ung.igem.org.
On our graphs, we refrain from using percentages and deal with raw figures instead due to our small sample size. In this way, we wish to make it evident when our data may be more anecdotal than statistically significant.

The target population of the iGEM outreach initiative was sampled for this study - this consisted of the ‘alumni’ who initially took part in the iGEM competition as a student team member from 2003-2010 inclusive. The iGEM alumni who participated in our research were linked to the survey (hosted on www.esurveyspro.com) via various routes, including direct email contact as well as Twitter, Facebook and our iGEM wiki page.
We attempted to focus on alumni who participated in the earliest years of the competition, since their careers would be more likely to have progressed further after taking part in iGEM than more recent participants. Unfortunately, it was difficult to get in contact with students from 2003 and 2004, since it was only in 2005 that iGEM existed formally in its own right, as opposed to being an option within the internal IAP (independent activities period) programme at MIT.

We followed the procedures from a “DIY ALDH2 Deficiency Testing Kit” given to us by TAIES. This simple test just requires placing a bandage soaked with 75% ethanol on one’s forearm for 7 to 10 minutes. If the skin under the bandage turns red, the person is tested positive for the deficiency (this test is about 70% accurate).
We went around Taipei to pass out our fliers about ALDH2 deficiency, perform free bandage tests, and ask people to fill out our survey (we even went to the Apple store and put our survey up on their display phones!).

MEDIA OUTLETS
Spreading Public Awareness
To raise awareness of ALDH2 deficiency to the general public, we reached out to media outlets. In our immediate community, we published an article with Blue and Gold, our school newspaper. To extend our impact outside our school community, we reached out to Today News, the Global Views Commonwealth Publishing Group, and The News Lens International. After corresponding with them, these news outlets published articles about ALDH2 deficiency and our team. Through International Community Radio Taiwan (ICRT), we were also able to speak about the common misconceptions surrounding ALDH2 deficiency over the radio!

Taiwan Alcohol Intolerance Education Society (TAIES)
TAIES, a non-profit organization founded by Dr. Che-Hong Chen, aims to educate the general public about ALDH2 Deficiency. In March 2018, TAIES and the Taiwan Federation of Medical Students co-hosted a 2-day workshop for over 80 student participants from different universities.
There, we learned about ALDH2 deficiency, including information such as alcohol consumption rates, the prevalence of ALDH2 deficiency throughout Asia, the origins of this disorder, the toxicity of acetaldehyde and the health risks that come with the deficiency, and the limits of alcohol labeling (warning labels). We heard from many experts, both scientific and political, on talks related to alcohol and ALDH2 deficiency, and we had the opportunity to learn from former alcoholics about their experiences and views of the deficiency. With this information, we developed various ideas for our human practices. For example, hearing about the limits of current alcohol warning labels, we composed a policy brief to encourage the development of more stringent labeling regulations. (Attended by Emily"

Overview
Our team used mathematical model to solve two problems in total.
A. Predicting the efficiency of integrase in vivo. It confirmed the feasibility of our circuit when we designed it.
B. Simulating the diffusion process of the repressor and trying to get a reasonable solution of the differential equations to interpret the leakage of integrases when our wet lab experiment went wrong.
All the results is calculated on MATLAB or Mathemetica.
First part [ Details ]
In this part, we set up an original model of DNA recombination by integrase, the reaction function goes as follows:
Figure 1.1 | “PB” is the attP and attB sites of DNA, and “LR” is the recombination product, attL and attR sites, which are direction-changed, of the DNA. PBI is the complex of DNA and 4 integrase molecule. LRI1 and LRI2 are two kinds of complex which are conformationally distinct from PBI. The “single arrow” represents the reaction which can reach rapid equilibrium with the equilibrium constant over it. The “double arrow” represents the slow reaction with the reaction rate constant over and below it. “K(bI)” is the equilibrium constant. “k(+r), “k(-r)”, “k(+syn)”, “k(-syn)” is the reaction rate constant. The site direction change occur in the second reaction: “PBI” to “LRI(1)”.
We use “PB” and “LR” to represent the sites of DNA being recombined or not separately and “Int” to represent the integrase. The others represent the intermediates.(figure.1)
Regulating all the reaction process by appropriate mathematical functions, we figure out the efficiency of the integrase recombination in vitro, where there is no substrate production, dilution and degradation.
Then, we get the figure1.2 to interpret how the recombination rate changes over time. And as the graph shows, the transformation rate can reach almost 80 percent within 0.5 hour approximately. It confirms the possibility that our circuit based on the serine integrase possesses the capacity to make regular response to the"

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"-Norma Plot (Figure 2 and 3) to determine which factors were having the most effect on CFPS activity. It should be noted that predictions for non-primary factors (i.e. interactions) may be inaccurate as they were forced-orthogonal. Considering the primary factors, magnesium glutamate was found to be the salt supplement with the largest contrast value, followed by potassium glutamate. This suggests that these two salt supplements were the most important. Sodium oxalate had a lower contrast value than either of the two glutamate salts, and was considered to have moderate importance in terms of CFPS activity. Ammonium acetate had an extremely low contrast value, suggesting that it may be unimportant for enhancing CFPS activity.
Figure 2: Contrast Values for CFPS Salt Supplements: Bar chart of contrast values for each term in the CFPS salt supplements Main Effects Screening Design generated by the JMP software. Contrast values were used as an estimate of a factor’s effect on the response. Interactions (*) were forced orthogonal.
Figure 3: E. coli Half-Normal Plot for Salt Supplements: Half-normal plot generated by the JMP software from data collected according to the salt supplement screening design. Blue line is the Lenth’s Pseudo-Standard Error (PSE). Primary terms are shown on the plot as circles (•), other terms are shown as crosses (+).
Surface Response Designs for Salt Supplements
The DoE software, JMP, was used to create a surface response design (SRD) for the three salts which were found by the screening design to have the most effect on CFPS activity (magnesium glutamate, potassium glutamate, and sodium oxalate). Ammonium acetate was kept at the default concentration and was not varied. Four SRDs were created using JMP; Central Composite Design-Uniform Precision design (CCD-UP), Box-Behnken (BB), Central Composite Design-Orthogonal (CCD-O), and Central Composite Design (CCD). The design diagnostics feature was used to compare the designs (Figure 4). Specifically, the colour map on correlations, power analysis for each factor and interaction, D, G, and A efficiencies, average variance of prediction, and number of reactions were compared to determine which design would be used. The colour map on correlations shows how correlated two terms are (red is highly correlated, blue is highly un-correlated). The more correlated two terms are, the more difficult it is to determine which is responsible for the effect on the response (Anderson & Whitcomb, 2010). As would be expected, in each design, terms"

Jan-Christian Raabe
Our very own Nicholas Flamel
Jan is graduate student of Chemistry and supported the chemistry division by developing a synthesis method for Nor-Pyochelin. He had great fun working with Martin in the Lab, not only due to the fact that they often had a completely different perspective on how everything should work. In completing the Nor-Pyochelin he delivered the most important substance to our further research, the key ingredient to our philosopher´s stone.
Martin Borowski
AKA Morowski
Our only true Muggle who has no clue of the wizard world he is working in. He started studying chemistry back in the day because he was actually interested in the stuff you learn at school. The turning point, however, was in the third semester. While extracting with toluene, he thought to himself: ""Why not use toluene-d8 instead? Higher density means more weight and more gains!"" From that moment on, his life goal was to become the most bulked-up scientist to stand in a lab. Fascinated by this idea, he started swapping normal solvents for deuterated first. Then, he began incorporating denser solvents (and, of course, the deuterated versions) into his reaction work-ups. Afterwards, he bought four 5 L round bottom flasks, connected them with glass pipes, filled them up with 13C37Cl4 and got his first set of dumbbells! This is, however, only his first step towards building great body mass. Future investments will include even denser solvents (CD2Br2), larger flasks and flasks made from lead crystal.
Everything is possible, you just gotta believe.

We participated in several collaborations with teams from Europe and South America. The iGEM team from Marburg carried out an InterLab study with Vibrio           natriegens to show the potential of this organism to increase the speed at which new findings in synthetic biology can be generated. Another collaboration we had was with the Unesp Brazil team. Thanks to our experience with modeling we were happy to help them improve on their own modelling part. Finally, we had a collaboration with the iGEM team from Utrecht . They engineered the Tar receptor to establish different sensing thresholds. The intellectual exchange helped us to improve on our own project.

Furthermore
, we found some mismatch cases in our sequencing result. Here are a typical mismatch result.
There is the partial sequencing result.
Figure 2.1.4 Partial sequencing result of mismatch
We tried to understand why we got this wrong sequence. We checked our part and 2012 Freiburg's project. And we found that the the mismatch sticky ends appearing in original sequence are GCTC and ACTC. What similar sticky ends! Here are the two components in the mismatch sequence.
Figure 2.1.5 The process of generating mismatch
So the sequencing result proves that similar sticky ends can mismatch when T4 ligase exists. This result enlightens us on improving TALE construction parts.
2012 Freiburg's parts have seven sticky ends:
TGAC,GCTC,CTTG,GCTT,ACTG,CCTG,ACTC
Inpired by BLAST algorithm, we calculated the similarity of each other sticky ends.
Figure 2.1.6 Strict rules score table
The higher score, the higher similarity, and the higher possibility of mismatch.     The table shows that more than 30% of pairs’ score is equal to 3, which means that the possibility of mismatch cannot be neglected.     Even if we employed the relatively loose rule to calculate the similarity, we still found that error rates cannot be neglected.
Figure 2.1.7 Loose rules score table
So how to solve this problem?
Our team designed seven new sticky ends which are theoretically better than original version. For more information please go to TAL Improvement page!

Cooperation with USTC wet team
It's always a good experience working with our wet team through the whole summer. During the process of iGEM 2010, we learn from each other and help each other to achieve more! This year we cooperate with USTC team in modeling and human practice. Read the following sections for more details.
Modeling
This year the team of USTC focuses on the construction a Host-cell-free Reaction Chamber using Synthetic Biology methods. We help them to visualize an artificial organelle of capacity. For more details, please refer to our wet team's modeling page .
Human Practice
This year, we also had close collaboration with USTC wet team on human practice, for the simple reason that none of us is biology major and we had to resort to biology major fellows for professional advice. Besides, we had several activities together; we presented several campus lectures promoting both synthetic biology and IGEM, and we started our IGEM community together. The collaboration with them not only enhanced the quality of our work, but improved the biology knowledge of our own.

Penn State & Warsaw Team
This year Penn State iGEM team created a survey about Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) in Agriculture. The survey included questions about where and when GMOs should be used, GMOs containing a lysis device, and other questions dealing with the use of GMOs. USTC Software iGEMers are happy to be participants in the survey, and we wish a good result will come out! We also help team Warsaw fill out their survey forms.

Trip to Calgary aGEM 2014
On September 13, 2014 we made a trip to Calgary to present our iGEM project, “Darwin's Metals”, at geekStarter/Alberta Innovates Technology Futures, hosted at the University of Calgary. This annual gathering of Canadian iGEM and BIOMOD teams provided us with effective constructive feedback on our presentation and our scientific theory from a panel of North American iGEM judges, before the major international iGEM 2014 jamboree in Boston on November 1st.
Our Darwin's Metals project received praise from the judges for the clearly defined mining problem we are attempting to create an iGEM solution for, our original concept, biotechnological feasibility, and environmental and economic relevance. Another much appreciated element of our project was our proposal to introduce additional functionality to the BIOBRICK registry. Our suggestion was to introduce a tracking feature to monitor the sustainability of individual BIOBRICKS, tracking each new application and sequence change for popular BIOBRICKS with demonstrated histories of development and successful implementation within industry. This particular proposed “Human Practices” effort was well-received because the current BIOBRICK registry doesn't provide means for tracking evolution of the “most sustainable” BIOBRICKS as they are altered under the direction of different iGEM teams and research labs over many years.
Constructive criticism mainly revolved around the performance issues surrounding our last-minute-prepared presentation, mainly related to transitions between presenters, and particular slides with communication issues. We also received advice on the different stages of our project, and how we could arrange our project into modules of successive experimental stages. One significant remark on our theoretical model (during a chalkboard elaboration of our intended chemical floatation context) inspired us to reconsider the prioritization of sinking versus floating of targeted minerals.

Integrated Human Practices
Project LEO has great potential power to improve resource sustainability. For example, LEO has the potential to boost biofuel production by alleviating fitness costs associated with producing xylose isomerase, contributing to  a cleaner energy economy. However, we found that our lab practices while developing LEO were unsustainable: leaving gel boxes on, constantly throwing gloves away, and forgetting to close the fume hood sash. We were wasting huge amounts of energy and resources. For example, leaving a fume hood open adds up to as much energy as 3.5 large U.S. households over the course of a year1.   In search of ways to make our work more environmentally friendly, we sought out  green lab practices, and used these practices to guide our own experimental design and decision making. Moreover, inspired by the positive impact these practices had with little effort, we engaged with other scientists in an effort to promote sustainable lab practices.
Integrated Human Practices
Labs are major energy consumers
Taking inspiration from the prospect of using Project Leo to improve biofuel production, we set out to make our lab more environmentally-friendly. Using resources such as myGreenLab , we educated ourselves on major sources of waste in labs. At the same time, we connected with Sustainability@BU, an organization at Boston University dedicated to reducing the university's environmental footprint. Specifically, we learned about Sustainability@BU's efforts to pilot a Green Labs Initiative on campus. Labs are major sources of waste and energy consumption on university campuses, because of the equipment and facilities they require.    For example, laboratory autoclaves use about 45 kWh of electricity per day - about the same as 2 large U.S. households2.
Leveraging the combination of our own online research with information from Sustainability@BU's pilot studies on Green Labs, we brainstormed several ways to align our work in the lab with eco-friendly habits to reduce waste and conserve energy. But what could we hope to accomplish as a team of 3 undergraduates?
Every decision counts
Although we weren't in a position to affect decision-making on equipment purchases and updating facilities that would reduce our lab's impact, we could easily change our own behavior to reduce our contribution. At the core of our efforts to change our"

3. Unsolved ethics: Is your project suitable for supervillains? In this workshop the participants could discuss the ethical impacts of their projects and reflect on additional steps which could be taken to make their ideas more acceptable by the general public.
4. Funding the fun: The road to Boston In this workshop the participants could discuss how they went about to making the journey to Boston possible. Some important questions that were discussed included the amount of money required, the type of sponsorship obtained from companies and how to approach them in the best way.
5. After iGEM: Unexpected applications In this workshop the discussion focused on how to make the projects available to the community and also if they could have any additional applications other that what the teams had already thought of.
The workshops were divided into two sessions of 1 hour each, and the participants got to sign up for the two workshops that they found to be the most interesting. This part of the NiC was very well thought out and provided many interesting ideas on improvements that can be made, both for the teams and on the iGEM management’s side of things.
Following the workshops, the prestigious prize ceremony was held, announcing the winner of the all-time first Nordic iGEM Conference. Our congratulations go to the Stockholm iGEM team who managed to claim the Golden Pipette. After an amazing dinner, it was time for the Bar Crawl. This was a really fun opportunity to get to forge deeper connections in a relaxed setting and at the same time discover the beauty of the Uppsala University nations. The Bar Crawl was a great ending to an amazing day, which had been full of new experiences and meetings with really wonderful people.
The last day all of the participants could take it easy and enjoy a sightseeing tour of the town of Uppsala. The NiC ended at midday and it was time to say goodbye to all the people and new friends we had met during the weekend. We want to thank Uppsala and Stockholm for a really great event as well as all the other teams who attended for being awesome. We hope that NiC go on to become an annual event and we look forward to seeing you all in Boston.

Input Parameters
The k-NN algorithm ( Torgo, 2010 ) takes a training and testing set as input, where the training set is the database. The most important input parameters are:
$Cl1$ is a vector with classification labels, in which the number of elements match the number of classes in the training data set. This means that this vector contains elements corresponding to the amount of classes and the amount of corresponding elements to be classified in these classes for the training data set. In this case $cl1$ is a vector of factors that are ‘false’ for the first $45$ elements of the normalized_score matrix, meaning classified as gene doping, and ‘true’ for the subsequent elements, meaning not classified as gene doping.
$k$ is the amount of nearest neighbors taken into account per point to judge the classification.
Less than $k-l$ contradicting votes are allowed. By setting $l=0$, we make sure that sequenes will only be classified as one of each group when all k nearest neighbors of that sequence belong to the same category.
Extending the Database
We opened up our sequence classification tool to people lacking bioinformatics knowledge by the creation of a Graphical User Interface that can be used to input hand-typed sequences. These sequences are then stored in an Excel file and can then be run through the subsequent stages of the program. Alternatively, users can load fasta files, the general output of sequencing systems.
Based on the input coming from loaded sequences, the alogrithm accommodates new gene doping sequences it finds into the database. Thereby, the tool can evolve with the sequences designed by gene doping creators.
Computation Time
Accurate alignment algorithms are generally computationally intensive. Our algorithm also runs every input sequence along the sequences in the expanding custom database. Therefore, computation time may increase in time. At present, it takes approximately 10 minutes to run the code for 5 input sequences on 4 parallel processor cores when the workspace has been downloaded. Complete running without workspace takes around 1.5 hours on 6 parallel processor cores. To speed up the running time, we therefore include the basic workspace. The code checks whether the core elements in the workspace are present and determines what parts to still run based on this. Also, we included packages for parallel core running ( Calaway, R., 2017 , Weston, S., 2017 , Calaway, R., 2018 ). In the future, we recommend complementation of the code with a pattern recognition based sequence choice to align with to prevent extreme increases"

No.If our dream come true,the users do not need to do any experiment,so no risks might arise.
b) Does your project currently include any design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design any new features to minimize risks? (For example: auxotrophic chassis, physical containment, etc.) Such features are not required for an iGEM project, but many teams choose to explore them.
No.

SynBio Intro
Plasmid Construction
A goal of synthetic biology is to standardize the form of genetic components to prevent structural elements of components from changing with reactions. It provides a standard method of assembling genetic components using specified prefixes and suffixes. Prefixes include EcoRⅠ and XbaⅠ; suffixes include SpeⅠ and PstⅠ.
The recognition site of XbaⅠ:
(Figure 3)
The recognition site of SpeⅠ:
(Figure 4)
The same cohesive terminus enable them to connect with each other. However, after the combination, neither XbaⅠnor SpeⅠis able to recognize this sequence. Through this way we could achieve the goal of building BioBricks.
We can see from the picture(Figure 2) that there are 4 standard restriction enzyme cutting sites:  EcoRⅠ, XbaⅠ, SpeⅠ,PstⅠ.
(1) As we will use pstⅠto be the restriction cutting site of terminators, if we want to ligase GFP to the plasmid, this restriction cutting site should be mutated.
The recognition site of PstⅠ:
(Figure 5)
The recognition site of AflⅡ:
(Figure 6)
Since AflⅡis similar to PstⅠ,they just have 2 different base pairs, we used these primers:
PtoA-F
5'-CCACCTGACGTCTAAGAAAC-3'
PtoA-R
5'-CTTAAGCGGCCGCTACTAGTA-3'
to mutate the vector.
(2) After the mutation succeeded, the next step is to connect sequences of GFP & RFP to the vector. These sequences were built by PCR extension.
To digest GFP sequence, we used SpeⅠand AflⅡ. We also digested the vector with the same restriction enzyme cutting sites. During the process of"

We assume that the half life of every RNA is same.
Basically, we gave positive value to initial concentration of arabinose, and gave zero to other initial values. We also conducted another simulation that positive values were given to other initial values  to make sure that the initial state makes little difference to the result of simulation.
We applied two ideas to imitate genuine environment in living E. coli instead of just solving the differential equation. First one is introduction of Gaussian noise into simulation. In real bacteria cell, the rate of transcription and translation is not constant and it fluctuates a little. To examine the influence of this fluctuation to the result of simulation, we added random numbers that follow normal distribution to transcription and translation rate every step of Euler approximation.
Second one is introduction of delay of transcription and translation. For instance, it takes some time (put this as s hours) to synthesize one molecule of mRNA. Therefore, the increase rate of concentration of mRNA at T hours does not depend on a concentration of sigma-factor and anti-sigma-factor at T hours, but on at (T - s) hours. Similarly, it also takes some time (put this as t hours) to synthesize one molecule of protein from mRNA. Therefore, the increase rate of concentration of the protein at T hours does not depend on concentration of mRNA at T hours, but on at (T - t) hours.
Consequently, we adopted abnormal Euler method which calculates the concentration of each substance at T, using concentration data of s or t hours ago. s and t are also parameters.

We used FSEOF to identify gene amplification targets.
FSEOF is a technique to identify what fluxes increase, when beta-carotene flux is enforced to be a certain value. This is done, by incrementally increasing the beta-carotene production flux from zero towards its theoretical maximum, then under the constraints, optimize growth rate. As we increase the enforced production flux, and solve for the other fluxes, some of these fluxes will increase, while other will decrease. The assumption is, if we amplify the genes associated to the reactions whose fluxes increase, we can force the product and growth rate to couple. The FSEOF is introduced in Choi et al.'s paper from 2010 4 .

（1）On June 20th ------- Yakult   Location: Wuxi, Jiangsu
    At Yakult, we understand the great benefits of probiotics for human health. Yakult's live probiotics have strong acid resistance. Because of company secrets, we can't know how its acid resistance was improved. It is known that it is screened from many strains, which gave us some inspiration.
（2）On June 29th ------- Meiji   Location: Suzhou, Jiangsu
    First, we watched the propaganda film of Meiji and learned about the company's products, market and corporate culture. Then, we visited the company's workshop under the guidance of the staff. The streamlined production made us feel the advanced technology of the company. After discussion with the marketing staff, we learned that Lactococcus lactis has a large share of the probiotic market.
（3）On July 9th ------- Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Limited by Share Ltd   Location: Zibo, Shandong
    Firstly we went to Xinhua pharmaceutical company. At this company, we learned that most of their current drugs are still relatively common drugs, and they are also used in the traditional way of taking drugs. However, some drugs need to be prepared in the form of coating, and need to control the time and dosage, which is not very convenient. Also, the granules are relatively large. We have initially explored the possible application of our project in pharmacy, such as making a live vaccine, etc. They gave affirmation, especially in the safety, and also proposed some problems, which is also the problem we need to solve in the future.
（4）On July 10th  ------- Shandong Vland Biotechnology Co. Ltd
    Later, we went to Vland biotech company to discuss the problem of frozen stress in the process of microbial fermentation and preservation and transportation. Although protective agents can be added to reduce the harm of acid stress and frozen stress, the advantages of Lactobacillus lactis in anti-acid and anti-freezing are self-evident. And they raised the issue of safety, not only the safety of the bacteria, but also the emissions of the natural environment, and they encouraged us to add a suicide mechanism, which was consistent with our idea, so we considered the suicide mechanism in the design of subsequent experiments.

More mini prep and qubit was carried out. The QuickChange (QC)Multi kit was used today instead of the Q5 kit which had not been successful.  This kit is different in that up to 5 sites can be mutated at once, we are using it to swap three  separate base pairs in one EcoR1 site and two Xbal sites within the pKD4 plasmid. It involves three   forward primers and three reverse primers being added to separate PCR reaction tubes.
Also today we began using the MoClo cloning technique to make codon optimized KillerRed and killerOrange parts. The resulting PCR product was transformed into the S171 E.coli strain.

P65-TraR
AHL Sensible Eukaryotic Switch
We decided to use p65-TraR (Neddermann P. et al., 2003), kindly provided by Dr. R. Cortese's group, as a eukaryotic genetic switch sensible to AHL-OXOC8. This chimerical protein is composed by a portion of the human p65, a NLS signal and the whole TraR. (Fig.1)
Figure 1
The gene received by Dr. R. Cortese's group doesn't fit the RCF10 standard because it presents several EcoRI, PstI and XbaI restriction sites (RS) inside the coding sequences. Based on this evidence we decided to design a new p65-TraR that would fit the RCF10 standards in terms of RS inside the coding sequence and the presence of Prefix and Suffix. In this way the BBa_K553023 has been generated. DNA2.0 performed the P65-TraR gene synthesis and optimization for the expression in mammals systems.
Figure 2
The P65-TraR in our system represents the most important element because it makes possible the communication between the two kingdoms. Using the TraR protein it can recognize both AHL-OXOC8 and the TraBox region and thanks to the NLS signal and the p65 it can migrate in the nucleus, where it acts as an eukaryotic trans-activator.

We created the smallest markers that could still be detected on the screen, and then began incorporating them into the app.
6/11/2015: Day 9
Today we simplified our code to match the “Bac to Mars” idea that we had shared with Romie and Anja.  Now, the starting screen appears with five bacteria with “empty” plasmids.  When you click on the bacteria, it increases in size and a text box appears with information about the bacteria.  Once you tap on the bacteria with four different markers, a new plasmid pops up of four different colors based on what markers you used to tap.  The text-box then pops up, listing the markers’ codes of the colors within the plasmid.
We also brainstormed possible plasmid token/physical representation ideas-- as of now, we are thinking of some large, donut-shaped object with spots for physical representations of different genes to fit in, like a puzzle.
We then hit a few dead ends in terms of technical stuff-- the screen sometimes has trouble recognizing the markers correctly/at all, which can be problematic in the future when the users are creating their customized plasmids.  In addition, we wanted to incorporate a TextEditWidget where a keyboard appears on screen and users are able to name their own bacteria, but for some reason the interface crashes upon inspection.  We sent a few questions to one of the Cornerstone engineers and are eagerly awaiting his response so we can proceed!
6/12/2015: Day 10
We had a very productive morning creating another possible interface, that allows users to choose the gene that they want to insert into their plasmid-- we began with a fun “flavor” example.  Users can drag a fruit representing their favorite flavor into a flask, which represents extracting a flavor-gene from the fruit and eventually showing it as a physical object that the user can place into their plasmid.
We then had a quick Google Hangout check-in with Romie and Anja to show them the two applications.  They seemed pleased, and I’m definitely excited to meet with them in person on Monday!
6/15/2015: Day 11
We began today with an ethics workshop where we discussed the fundamental guidelines and foundations of ethics in scientific experiments.  The lecture was mainly focused on plagiarism- its definition, its use with or without the"

Results of Sequencing and Colony PCR
PCR showed that rtTA and GFP were both present.
Sequencing showed that GFP was in the backbone, not rtTA
rtTA was probably not in the backbone and was floating near the colonies instead, so when we picked up the colonies for Colony PCR, we also picked up the rtTA with them.
Will use Backbone set #2 in Jessica's box along with Derrick's PRM1 and PRM2 backbones from 6/09/14.

Repressilator
Repressilator
The repressilator is a synthetic genetic regulatory network designed to exhibit a stable oscillation shown via expression of GFP (green fluorescent protein). The work is reported by Michael B. Elowitz and Stanislas Leibler in their work at 2000. They constructed a system of three genes connected in a cyclical negative feedback loop so that gene A represses gene B, which represses gene C, which represses gene A. The implementation of this idea used a low copy plasmid encoding the repressilator, and the higher copy reporter, which were used to transform a culture of Escherichia coli.
Parts assembling: the top assembling is the construction used in our software and the bottom one is the toggle switch design in their work.
We construct a model to stimulate the behavior of repressilator, the results are showed as following:
The meanings of the legend used in the figure are demonstrated as follows: [14 (lacI153)4] refers to the binding product of four lacI protein molecules, [12 (CIlam154)2] refers to the binding product of two CIlam protein molecules, while [10 (tetR154)2] refers to the binding product of two tetR protein molecules. The system exhibits oscillation behavior after initial time of 86000, the concentration of (lacI)4, (CIlam)2 and (tetR)2 changes periodically as the function of time. To be specific, the concentration of (tetR)2 increase when the concentration of (lacI)4 declines due to the remove of repression. And the concentration reaches the peak level when the concentration of (LacI)4 reaches its lowest level. Then the concentration of (tetR)2 decreases while the concentration of (CIlam)2 begins to arise because the repression from (tetR)2 is gradually relieved. Noted that the concentration peak level of (CIlam)2 and (tetR)2 are nearly"

Interview About How to Create a Comic with Anya Kim
Our Team Member, Kyleakin, got to sit down with a fellow comic book creator, Anya Kim, to learn about the process of creating and presenting a science comic. Anya received her Bachelor’s Degree in Neuroscience and Spanish at the University of Iowa. She was involved in a program called the Latham Science Initiative. The goal of Latham was to teach students how to communicate their research as well as scientific concepts. Anya created her comic, “Brains! A Close-Up of What is Going on Inside Your Head” for this program and it has gained fame all around the University and beyond. Anya is currently studying abroad in Barcelona, focusing on Microglial and Huntington’s Disease. She will be attending Johns Hopkins University in their joint MD/PhD program.
Because we wanted our comic book to reach younger audiences who might not know much about science or be interested, we asked Anya who she made her comic for. She made “Brains!” for elementary school aged children. She intentionally left the comic book black and white so that it could be colored by the children. She said this was a huge success when she had the opportunity to hand it out to kids.
Kyleakin also asked what hardships Anya encountered along the way and what the most challenging part of creating a comic was. Anya said printing was extremely expensive and that’s what was limiting for her project. For us, we considered doing a digital copy of our comic. I"

""I object to violence because when it appears to do good, the good is only temporary. The evil is does is permanent.""
Safety was one of our top priorities during our project design and accomplishment. So we took it seriously and strictly followed the safety rules.
Safe-project Design
Chassis
In our project, we chose non-pathogenic strains of E.coli—DH5α, BL21 to perform our molecular cloning and protein expression separately and they were worked inside a class 1 laboratory.
We also use mammalian cells—293T and HeLa to test our system. And all cell experiments were operated in the biosafety cabinet which we would use UV light to sterilize both before and after usage.
Parts
The parts contained in our project are mostly commonly used expression control units and that are used widely by worldwide researchers, so they will not raise any safety issue. At the same time, E.coli and cells transfected with our project were strictly controlled. Once they are no longer needed, they will be autoclaving and abandoned immediately, so that there won’t be any contamination to the environment.
Safe Lab Work
Safety training
The whole team attended a serious of safety lectures and passed the laboratory safety knowledge test , where we learnt how to use experimental apparatus properly and how to deal with potential dangers as well as sudden accidents in labs. We also took tests to qualify our ability before getting into the lab.
Lab arrangement
Our lab is divided into two areas—wet lab and the bench. So we can keep our computers or other stuff there avoiding being contaminated.
Clothing
We’re required to wear lab coats, gloves whenever in the lab. There’re also two kinds of gloves in the contaminated and uncontaminated areas which could not be mixed."

Brasil-SP,2014,Team:Brasil-SP#Results#Sporulation_-_-_TEXT.html," triggers the replace of spore core's huge depot of dipicolinic acid and cations by water. This effect triggers the hydrolysis of the spore's peptidoglycan cortex by one of two redundant enzymes. The completion of cortex hydrolysis and subsequent germ cell wall expansion allows spore core hydration. These results in resumption of spore metabolism and macromolecular synthesis.11 Understanding this process we can choose when and how our product will start to work.
     However, it isn’t so simple. There are different individuals in the population, with different propensities to germinate. Together, the activation status of the spore, level of germinant used and the number of germinant receptors that are triggered by the germinant influence the intensity of the signal to germination. Spores that germinate slowly are known as superdormant.The use of different pathways (above mentioned)is a good approach to promote the superdormant germination as well. A big germinate percentage is important to the right work of our device12.
     Another important reason to explain our choice is that we use in our circuit membrane proteins from gram positive bacteria. Because of the different characteristics of the cell membrane of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, probably our circuit will not function in an organism such as E. coli. Thus, in addition to all the advantages presented, we were also forced to adopt a different chassis than we're used due to the circuit that we chose to build.
What we did
      Here you can see all our protocols, including the Microbiology ones. We acknowledge to LMU-Munich team 2012 for making available the protocols in which we based ours. In our project, we used the Bacillus subtilis PRD 66 [IFO 13722]  (ATCC 19659) strain.
note: we also received a Bacillus subtilis donation (strain PYT9) from the Phd. André Pulshen (Chemistry Institute/ University of São Paulo). In the near future, we are planning to test this strain as a chassi as well.
1. Growth and sporulation
First step was to grow our chassis. Bacillus subtilis grows quickly at Luria-Bertani medium (agar or broth) and it was used to propagate our cultures.

Project Outline
  3.1 Basics
Advantages and basic principles of using magnetic fields
In order to control E. coli remotely, we decided to use magnetic fields because of a few key reasons.       First, magnetic fields allow to control the cells by an external force field which means that cells do not have to be directly treated or media conditions have to be changed as it is the case in many chemotaxis assays.       Second, magnets are widely spread and electro magnets easily built as you can see in this video:       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzXRFp0DDrU       The accessibility and safety of magnetic fields opens up the field for new innovation and ideas using remote controlled bacteria.        Third, magnetic fields do have a high energy density and are way more viable to transfer energy than other energy fields like electrical fields. However, the magnetic moment of an atom is the product of of the atoms orbital angular momentum and its electron spins. Atomic magnetism is based on unfilled electron orbits.       Nobel gases and alkyl halogenide are non-magnetic or “diamagnetic”. Other elements like metals may have an increased magnetic moment as long as their electron orbit are unfilled,"

These new biological systems are first carefully designed with computer simulations. Then they are built in the real lab by using existing BioBricks and creating new ones. During the 2-day jamboree at the MIT in Boston on November 8th and 9th, all teams present and defend their project for a variety of awards .
During the competition, every team documents their project in a wiki, as another goal of iGEM is to promote the sharing of information and know-how in an ""open source biology"" . Likewise, the newly created BioBricks are documented and sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts a few weeks before the jamboree.

Fig.ω2 Fixed antibody pattern
If we define a \(θ_2\), which represents the effect that we would like to achieve when                         immobilizing an antibody, it is generally the antibody concentration that can disrupt the                         percentage of gray that the liquid crystal reaches our defined full brightness. At this time,                         there is also a relation (6):
$$[R_T]=C_2exp[Qt]+P\tag{6}$$
When the reaction is sufficient, it is assumed to be \(t_0\). For the relationship between the                         reaction \(\beta\):
$$K_a(1-\theta_2)[R_T]=K_d\theta_2$$
$$\theta_2=\frac{[R_TA']}{[R_{T0}]}$$
Combining relation (4), we can get relation (7):
$$\frac{[R_{T0}]}{A_0}=\alpha+\frac{\beta}{C_1+n}\tag{7}$$
Among them, \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) have a large correlation with \(\theta_2\), but have little                         correlation with \(\theta\). From our experimental data, it can be given that \(\theta_2\) meets                         our requirements when it reaches 0.5~0.7. Under the preconditions, relation (8) and Fig. 4 can                         be derived:
$$\frac{[R_{T0}]}{A_0}=K\theta_2+b\tag{8}$$
Fig.4 The relationship between the optimal ratio of antibody                                 antigen concentration and θ2
When we determine the residual antigen concentration and time relationship when fixing the                         antigen and the residual antibody concentration and time relationship when immobilizing the                         antibody, we can use this model to give the optimal concentration ratio for immobilized antigen                         and antibody by combining the given \(\theta\) and \(\theta_2\).
At the same time, it can be concluded that the proportional relationship is closely related to                         our expected \(\theta_2\), and there is no clear relationship with our expected \(\theta\).

We conducted a game called “FRET ME”, which was an outdoor group game based on the theoretical support FRET of our project. Apart from that, we have compiled the Chinese version iGEM brochure to let more Chinese people know about synthetic biology and iGEM. We distributed our postcards and badges as souvenirs to members from other teams. As for education, we gave some lectures about the iGEM and synthetic biology inside our school, mainly for the freshmen and sophomores. Also, we help the SUIS_Alpha_Shanghai to build their own iGEM LAB, giving them rough ideas about their experimental design and guided them finish the interLab experiments.
iGEM club
This year, ECUST took part in the iGEM competition for the first time, and there are still many students in our campus who have passion for synthetic biology but have no platform or guidance to participate in such contests. Therefore, to set up an iGEM club in ECUST is of vital significance and necessity and this is exactly where we started.
FRET ME
As the main principle of our project, FRET is an interesting and useful theory. But it may be a bit obscure for undergraduates, especially those who don’t major in biology. Considering that spreading scientific knowledge to non-scientific people is another aim of iGEM, we came up with an innovation activity called FRET ME, aiming at making the concept of FRET easier to understand.

Gifu,2017,Team:Gifu#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," “Hiire”. Brewers do “Hiire” after they bottled their sake.
In the early of Showa period, the new yeast which can make good smell such as the sixth yeast was picked, isolated and pure-cultured. And by the time, most of the devices for measuring has appeared. During the W.W.Ⅱ, the production of sake declined because of rice shortage. After the war, reconstruction of sake brewers started every places.
・The phenomenon of “Hiochi”
Growing of Hiochi bacteria in sake and bacterial pollution of seishu is called Hiochi. After the phenomenon of “Hiochi” , seishu became cloudy and take on peculiar odor by producing acid inside of it. Hiochi bacteria is high resistant to alcohol so they can grow in seishu. Hiochi bacteria can be separated to hetero type and homo type by the style of fermentation. Furthermore, they can be classified by whether they need mevalonic acid when they grow. Hiochi bacteria are a kind of Lactic acid bacteria and cannot grow except for sake because  they need mevalonic acid produced by Koji for living.
How to make sake
① Seimai, rice polishing
Japanese Sake breweries mainly utilize sake-brewing rice which is only used for making sake. As a first step of brewing sake, brown rice of the sake rice is polished to exclude the germ and the surface fraction. They contain abundant proteins, lipids and inorganic substances. These ingredients are negative factors for sake because taste and the color can be rough. Also without highly polished rice, deterioration of sake is accelerated easily. Therefore, the center of rice grain called shinpaku is basically used in production of sake. Shinpaku is also called pearl of rice from this reason.
② Seimai and Shinseki, washing and soaking the rice
After polishing the rice, Nuka, rice bran powder and foreign matters are washed away as these substances have a bad effect on the final quality of sake. Following this process, the rice is soaked carefully. Measuring the time at this stage is necessary to make the amount of absorbed water appropriate. Koji, culture of a special species of mold on rice can easily grow on the rice.
③ Steaming and cooling the rice
The rice is steamed for approximately one hour. Steamed rice is cooled gradually and sufficiently.
④ Seikiku, making koji
One of the most important processes is making koji, Aspergillus oryzae is mainly used for propagating koji mold. In koji-muro"

Figure 2: General Overview of the North American Oil and Gas market and the Global Waste Water Monitoring markets.
Each of these monitoring sites is required to take multiple samples in the surrounding areas on a quarterly or annual basis. The overall number of sites for air, water, and ecosystem quality taken from the Canada-Alberta Oil Sands Environmental Monitoring Information Portal. Information from the Joint Canada-Alberta Implementation Plan is found below:
Figure 3: Number of sampling stations in the Alberta Oil Sands area broken down by water (blue), ecosystem (green), and air (orange) monitoring.
Monitoring is broken down into air, water, and ecosystem quality. Our technology can be applied to over 50% of the total number of monitoring sites. The largest portion of interest is dedicated to water monitoring in tailing ponds and various acid-sensitive lakes found in the oil sands and surrounding areas. We have evaluated that our technology however, fits not only into most of the water monitoring regulation but also a vast majority of the ecosystem monitoring requirements.  The number and type of monitoring sites that our technology could be utilized with is identified below:
Figure 4: Sampling stations for water quality (grey) and air/ecosystem (green) showing the percentage of monitoring sites our technology could be applied to.
In total, more than 500 current water and ecosystem quality sites are prime opportunities for our technology to transform current monitoring regimes. Our general toxin sensor technology has vast applications which can meet growing needs for on-site monitoring at these sites. As these needs are expected to grow substantially by the year 2015, this makes the development of our technology in-line with the expectations for market growth dictated by the government.
Figure 5: Monitoring sites dictated by the Canada Alberta Implementation Plan from the years 2011 and the expected increase in sites by 2015.  Orange dots represent air quality monitoring which our technology cannot presently be applied to.
Figure 6: Regulatory sampling sites required to be monitored by the oil and gas industry in the year 2011.
It is important to note, that while there are currently approximately 500 sampling stations which are mandated, each site performs sampling in multiple locations more than once per year. As an example, the Athabasca tributary monitoring program (a part of the Regional Aquatic Monitoring Program - RAMP) may have approximately ten or more distinct sampling locations surrounding a site which are monitored as often as once per month. Other sampling locations such as acid-sensitive lakes, may only be monitored a few times per year.

Southwest Union
Having deep cooperation with Southwest Union(iGEM meet-up in southwest China) last year, we viewed the meet-up an important role in our early-stage, thus, as soon as our project got mostly shaped, we discussed with SCU-WestChina about holding the Southwest Union meet-up of 2017. Together with the SCU-WestChina, SCU-China , UESTC-China and SICAU-China, we have an overall assessment of the safety and feasibility of our project and the latest trend of iGEM competition including the newly added judging terms, etc. What matters most was that all teams exchanged information and built a deeper relationship.
CCiC Conference
As the competition approaches, the Central China iGEM Consortium (CCiC) conference was hosted by Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University (FAFU-China), in order to simulate the iGEM Giant jamboree and enhance further communication among different teams. This was a great opportunity to present our work and learn from the other 48 teams. It was nice to see that we did a good job in presentation and the audience was attracted by our project. The most important thing to us was that we harvested much useful advice from the judges, mentors and students. We made the best of the Panel Session and poster exhibition to establish collaborations with other teams. Interestingly, we were lucky to have deep conversations with Igem headquarter King L. CHOW and former iGEMer Zhang Haoqian, who encouraged us to go deeper in research and promote iGEM and synthetic biology research in our university. From the CCiC, we were aware of our current disadvantages in quantitative measurement and the overall logic, which laid a foundation for the later adjustments and improvements. More importantly, we made great acquaintance with many students and establish deep collaborations with teams with same interest, including ShanghaiTech University and Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University.
Sports Meeting
Scientific research is not always a dull work. It can also be an interesting experience which everyone can share and enjoy. With the intention of spreading the fun and attractiveness of the synthetic biology, we designed some letter cards. In this way, synthetic biology drew more attentions by showing its fun, following the idea of combining"

Donato and Kawulainvestigated the effect on bacterial motility of random point mutations in the HNS protein. . As a result of their Swarm plate assay and experiments for the determination of flagellar rotational speed, it was found that some random mutations (HSN-T108I and HNS-A18E) resulted in bacteria with a stronger and faster flagella as compared with wild type bacteria. This single amino acid change caused a 50% increase in the binding of HNS to FliG.. It was also shown that this single amino acid change in HNS resulted in an approximately 50% increase in flagellar rotation speed and about a 2-fold increase in the bacteria’s swarm size.
Figure 4: Swarm plate assay. Fresh colonies from strains carrying the indicated alleles were inoculated onto semi-solid agar plates and grown at 30 °C. Growth was measured as the diameter of the bacterial swarm over several time points. Bacteria with swarm diameters under 10 mm at the end of 17 h incubation were considered non-motile.

Figure 5: Flagella propel bacteria by rotating motor-driven helical filaments (35, 36) whereby swimming speed is directly related to flagellar rotational speed (39). Gina M. Donato and Thomas H. Kawula1 , in another experiment which they tried to compare rotational speeds of mutant and wild-type bacteria, they concluded that hnsA18E and hnsT108I accelerated flagellar speeds 44–62% over wild-type levels.
In the results from fluorescence anisotropy and chemical cross-linking, Donato and Kawula showed that there is an interaction between HNS and FliG, the protein responsible for flagellar torque; and they show that the mutant form of HNS binds FliG 50% more often than does wild-type HNS: They explain the increase in the bacteria’s swarm rate and swim speed caused by mutant HNS thusly “We position H-NS at the interface between the rotor and stator, directly linked to the C terminus of FliG(Fig. 5 A). Tighter binding of mutant H-NST108I toFliG (Fig.5 B) may cause increases in flagellar speed by altering the conformation of FliG relative to the other rotor proteins and/or the MotA·"

Results: The electrophoresis data for the bridge PCR of KNR+petBD was inconclusive. A band was observed at around 1.3-1.5 kb for the reaction which is consistent with the expected size of 1520 bp. However, the gel had too low of a concentration for the 200 bp separation required to differentiate between KNR and KNR+petBD. Thus, there has been no successful gene segment constructions from the individual parts as of yet.
Enzymology
This week we performed our final ethanol assay once again using the BioAssay systems Ethanol Assay kit.  Two sample of ADH/PDC/sigma70 in Iq cells were tested along with two negative controls (BTE/Sigma70 in Iq cells).  Results proved positive as there was a calculated average ethanol production of 0.019% ethanol for the samples compared to 0.006% in the negative controls.
Media
The apparatus was disassembled and cleaned.  All glassware and rubber fittings were autoclaved.  The water pump and piping were bleached.  The apparatus was reassembled, this time with the dialysis tubing just prior to the o-rings cinched with dental floss to further prevent E. coli from escaping.  It was then filled with BG-11, 0.20% casaminos and 50 mM glucose.  100 mLs of an established Synechocystis culture was introduced to the cyanobacteria chamber and 10 mLs of an overnight Iq culture was introduced to the E. coli chamber.  Overnight contamination was observed.  The contaminant was a bright blue color and it was thought that somehow the cyanobacteria had made it into the E. coli chamber, although it is unknown how this could occur.
It was discovered that all of our cyanobacteria cultures had died.  Another experiment was performed with only E. coli.  Because we were still having problems with cross-contamination, we placed heat-shrink tubing around the o-ring sittings before autoclaving the glass support for the dialysis tubing.  It was reassembled and again filled with BG-11 supplemented with casaminos and 50 mM glucose.  No contamination was observed overnight.  However, our E. coli culture turned bright blue overnight, with a peak absorption of 400 nm determined by spectrophotometry.  Experiments will need to be done with antibiotics in the future"

The brick toy is composed of the following parts.
Here is the base board where all the other parts can be put.
Here is the recombinase part, indicating the DNA sequence between two action site of one recombinase. These two triangles represents the action site of the recombinae.The part can be plugged on the base board and can be turned around. You can also plug two recombinase part together so that the sequence can be turned twice.
Here is the DNA sequence without recombinase action sites. These parts are the same as the recombinase part mentioned above, except that they do not have the triangles, so they do not turn under any circumstances.
Here is the promotor part. Promoters answers to inducers and start the expression after induction. The promoter part here has a track on both side which can hold the little patch indicating the inducer. When a patch is put on the track, it means that the promoter answers to the inducer.
The promoter can be plugged into the grooves at the side of both recombinase part and normal DNA sequence part mentioned above.
Here is the coding sequence part. It can be plugged into the recombinase part and the normal DNA sequence part mentioned above. The arrow at the front indicates the direction of the expression.
Here is the terminator part. It indicates the end of expression.
Finally, here is our circuit demonstrated by this model.
The white and black patch indicate the presence and absence of the clock signal. The yellow patch indicate the target signal.
The sewage plant visit and beyond
During the visit
Our project focuses on the construction of a new kind of cellular memory machine which is capable of recording the changes of a signal in an extended time period. This aspect of our memory machine can be extremely useful in monitoring the chemical changes in the environment. So we contacted one of the biggest sewage plant in Shanghai—Xinchu sewage plant and paid a visit there.
After talking to the workers at the sewage plant, we had some new ideas.
The biochemical reaction pool where all the microbes works hard to lower the COD value is exactly where we may put our engineered E.coli to do the monitoring work.
Although data like COD value and pH of the sewage is dynamically monitored, some other important data like the amount of heavy metal is more difficult to detect. So, When it comes to real world application, we may have a closer look on the monitoring of heavy metals.
The reaction pool is more than 10 meters deep, but the regular sampling of the sewage can only cover"

Summer Camp for High School Students
In summer 2016, high school students from different regions of China came to SUSTech Summer Camp. We devoted to prepare a lecture for them, introducing our project based on their knowledge learnt from the biology classes set by their own school. Primary PI, Dr. Wei Huang briefly introduced synthetic biology and iGEM.  We collected their questions and suggestions, which may give us new thoughts about our projects.
“Although I have no biology background, I can really understand what you were talking about. Your works are really amazing and I am deeply impressed.”high school students' principal said.

Citizens and residents
In addition to student population, we thought our project must be known by a wider range of people. Besides, to make our “Sound Visualization” closer to life, we hope to make our effort turned into actual therapy idea or new way to modify genetic structure in response to mechanical stress or sound. We start to concentrate on those who have problems with hearing, not only limited to those with damaged hair cells in ear or other components of ear, but also all of the people with hearing loss in different extents.
We designed a questionnaire on the Internet (link: sojump ) to collect information about the understanding and care about hearing-impaired people, and to find a way that can help them in the most comprehensive and effective way. Meanwhile, we included introduction about iGEM and the basic status of those people and we called for attention to care about them at the beginning of the questionnaire.
To minimize the acquired hearing impairment caused by noise and electronic equipment, we also designed a brochure named ""Shape and Sound"". We printed more than 500 pieces and handed out on our campus as well as several residential communities. In the 6-pages brochure, we introduced the mechanism of hearing forming and the status of hearing-impaired people around the world. We called for concerns about them and also gave several tips for ear caring in daily life in order to reduce chronic hearing loss, which is popular nowadays but draws little attention actually for time course.
Booklets ""Shape and Sound"" designed by ourselves independently. We focused on ear caring and called on public awareness on hearing loss.
We gave out our booklets ""Shape and Sound"" in"
