Abstract: Melbourne 2008 team seeked to build a biological clock that can count up when  it is ""ticked"" by input light pulse signals. As the signal ""ticks"" the clock, the clock changes color and observer can use the color or combination of colors to tell what ""time"" it is. Their team built a linear clock which can be used to keep track on what metabolites are present and what are being produced in the biological system.
In their construct, ribolock 1(CR) prevents translation of gene Y and in the presence of ribokey1(TA), gene Y is translated to activate transcription of another ribokey2(TA) which can open up the loop of another ribolock2(CR). Although they claimed to design and construct some of the parts including key3C and lock3d, no characterisation result was found regarding these CR and TA.

Abstract: Peking 2007 project concerned with the ability for bacterial cells to differentiate out in homogeneous conditions. They aimed to build devices conferring host cells with the ability to form cooperating groups spontaneously and to take consecutive steps sequentially even when the genetic background and environmental inputs are identical . In order to achieve this,  they needed two devices responsible for temporal and spatial differentiation.
To meet the need of spatial differentiation in an assembly line, the system of hop-count conjugation for cell-cell communication was developed in E. coli.  The signals transferred are represented by DNA sequence, and record the times of transfer by losing tandem region at every conjugation event. To construct this system, tandem oriT pairs are inserted into signaling plasmid, and relaxase responsible for initiating conjugation events are removed from natural conjugation system and (attaching a terminator) inserted between these oriT pairs."

Lambert_GA,2018,Team:Lambert GA#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," calculating theoretical maximum voltage for the ElectroPen. Using previously described models, a final model was obtained incorporating dimensions and the disc-orientation of the ElectroPen, resulting in an amplified voltage output. Using established parameters for piezoelectric constants, we arrived at a theoretical maximum of 2.699kV, with the resistance in our system due to strain constraints and wire resistance.
After conducting electroporation trials with the described protocol (Refer to Protocols below), growth of colonies as well as GFP expression were subsequently analyzed. Plates with growth were isolated and inoculated into liquid cultures, and quantified using the plate reader. GFP expression levels were thereby analyzed with a comparison of the ElectroPen to the outputs from an industrial electroporator (BioRad MicroPulser). With the negative control serving as the baseline comparison for validating positive expression of GFP, it can clearly be seen that there is a significant difference in fluorescence intensity (represented as Fluorescence/OD600) between the negative and positive control, confirming that GFP was successfully electroporated. The experimental samples were conducted using the ElectroPen and the positive control with the BioRad electroporator. It can be seen that the fluorescence intensity values for the ElectroPen trials are similar to the outputs produced by the standard electroporator, indicating successful electroporation, uptake of DNA, and expression of GFP by the E. coli bacteria. The obtained transformation efficiency (similar to the BioRad Micropulser) from the experimental trial additionally indicates the functionality of the ElectroPen, presenting it as a powerful device for infield and low-resource settings.

As can be seen, GFP expression from the ElectroPen is comparable to the electroporator (BioRad Micropulser), indicating successful transformation and uptake of DNA. b-c Efficiency of the trials. It can be seen that the ElectroPen has similar transformation efficiencies as the electroporator, demonstrating its functionality.
PRODUCT DESIGN AND GLOBAL COLLABORATION
A key component of demonstrating the accuracy and precision of scientific data is through reproducibility and external validation. We believe that collaboration with other iGEM teams is a powerful method to disseminate information, and in this spirit, we have worked with the University of Georgia iGEM Team and Taipei American School iGEM Team to verify the functionality and practicality of our device.

Feedback
To prove the utility of our software, we released the 2.0 version of BioDesigner Coral and invited several wet teams to use it. We want to inspect whether it can solve problems under real-life condition, as well as collect synthetic biology researchers’ opinions on computer-based literature analysis. Wet teams are asked to fill in a questionnaire about BioDesigner Coral： see^_^ Here are the results:
Remarks & Suggestions:
Haoran Ding from TJU: Overall the software is excellent. We tried to use this software to build a part we use this year and search for some genes we often use. I search for PET degradation, which is our topic this year, and I really get the relative part. I guess it is the first software focusing on the searching of iGEM part. I think what they need to do next is enlarge the database, update the new parts this year and further improve the accuracy of recommendation.
Yisi Wang from OUC-China: I like the concise user-interface of the software, because I can easily understand the relationship between parts and parts information. Most of the standard parts are stored in the database. For the next version of the software, I think they can try to allow users to upload their own parts to the database, so there will be more non-standard parts. Besides, I think it is a good idea to collect some experimental data about some parts for more optimal protocol.
Yu Zhu from XMU-China: The design page leaves a deep impression on me. But I think it would be more user-friendly there is a return button on this page, so users can go back to the last operation. Personally, I think the gene relationship map is not beautiful enough. Can you change the color of lines between genes from black to others?
Kaiyue Ma from USTC: Generally the operator interface is concise. I have not tried to test the function of other database, and I think that of BioDesigner Coral is OK. But I think the user interaction can be refined in many ways, for example, after registration, the web page should automatically turn to the log in page.
Fankang Meng from NKU: I am interested in Gene Relationship"
NTNU_Trondheim,2018,Team:NTNU Trondheim#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," of the work of the Board is to develop appropriate and robust regulatory frameworks that facilitate the harnessing of the potential of gene technology, while also avoiding harm to health and the environment, as well as promoting sustainability, societal benefit and ethics. There is a lot going on in the field of gene editing technologies. CRISPR has become a very popular tool as it is rather easy and cheap compared to other techniques. It is used in several science projects and experiments these days, with plants, animals, microorganisms and even humans. There are also many projects on the way concerning gene therapy. Especially cancer is an illness of interest where scientists are working on ways to cure cancer using gene therapy applying CRISPR technology.
Surveys have shown that a majority of the public is sceptical to GMOs, although the younger generation might be more open-minded. The younger citizens of Norway generally care about the environment and sustainability, and GMOs that might contribute positively in this area have been developed or are in the pipeline, such as corn that sustains drought better than natural corn. Some investigations also suggest that when GMOs contribute to animal welfare, the public is more positive.
We wanted to know if there was anything we should be specifically aware of during our project about GMOs, but since the use of genetically modified bacteria is restricted to our lab (contained use), the requirements are different than if we were to use GMO in for example hospitals (deliberate release).

Key insight
The interview with Hans Petter Kleppen was very informative and interesting. He informed us about different aspects of bacteriophages by sharing his experiences with the use of them in his work. Among others he told us about their negative effects in diary facilities, but also about their positive sides as alternatives to antibiotics and as microbiome controlling agents. Hans also notified us about the relatively low level of scepticism that he had experienced during his research, as well as the various restrictions related to the use of bacteriophages. In addition, he suggested a potential futuristic improvement to our experimental setup.
Summary of interview
Our initial thought was to use bacteriophages to deliver the CRISPRi system targeting the luxS gene, which is involved in the bacterial quorum sensing. To learn more about the use of phages and their potentials we reached out to Hans Petter Kleppen, one of relatively few with phage experience here in Norway.
Hans has a solid background in Molecular Biology, which he gained through his master’s degree at The University of Bergen. In his doctoral"

PAST
Pavia, the ancient Ticinum, is a town and comune of south-western Lombardy, northern Italy, 35 km south of Milan on the lower Ticino river near its confluence with the Po. It is the capital of the province of Pavia. It has a population of c. 71,000. The city achieved its greatest political importance between 568 and 774, as the capital of the Kingdom of the Lombards.
Dating back to pre-Roman times, the town of Pavia (then known as Ticinum) was a municipality and an important military site (a castrum) under the Roman Empire.
It is said by Pliny the Elder to have been founded by the Laevi and Marici, two Ligurian tribes, while Ptolemy attributes it to the Insubres. Its importance in Roman times was due to the extension of the Via Aemilia from Ariminum (Rimini) to the Padus (or Po) (187 BC), which it crossed at Placentia (Piacenza) and there forked, one branch going to Mediolanum (Milan) and the other to Ticinum, and thence to Laumellum where it divided once more, one branch going to Vercellae - and thence to Eporedia and Augusta Praetoria - and the other to Valentia - and thence to Augusta Taurinorum (Turin) or to Pollentia.
Regisole
Here, in 476, Odoacer defeated Flavius Orestes after a long siege. To punish the city for helping the rival, Odoacer destroyed it completely. However, Orestes was able to escape to Piacenza, where Odoacer followed and killed him, deposing his son Romulus Augustus. This was commonly considered the end of the Western Roman Empire.
A late name of the city in Latin was Papia (probably related to the Pope), which evolved to the Italian name Pavia. Sometimes it's been referred to as Ticinum Papia, combining both Latin names.
Under the Goths, Pavia became a fortified citadel and their last bulwark in the war against"

Those few players can no longer support the concrete increasing demand for medical cares. Chinese government had ratified a great number of acts as well as guidelines and simplified documents examining and approval process to encourage innovation in the field of medical devices, which offers our team a great market environment.
Customer Study
   We performed two types of investigations: on different age groups, and on people who participated traditional health examination.
   Survey on Different Age Groups
   We surveyed to people of different ages in the science museum,asking questions about the awareness of the disease.
   Survey on Participants of Traditional Health Examination
   To better understand student body’s attitude and knowledge about medical examination, our team interviewed staff and students participated in medical examination at BIT School Hospital on 7 September 2017. （Hyperlink）
Results
   The result confirm that no one is willing to take bad health, but they simply are not informed. A “stimulus” is needed to warn them potential health issues and prompt patients to visit healthcare. This again reinforce that our main market role is to warn patients and help diagnosis, not to compete for decisive diagnosis. Therefore we came down to build up JACOB’s convenience, efficiency, and affordability instead of optimizing sensitive and specificity.
Industry Research
   In market analysis we had solved many issues regarding our project background, but also generated more questions about operability. To obtain a better answer, we had visited LinfinPort Biotechnology Corporation Ltd and CapitalBio Corporation.
   We asked BluePHA mainly on how to construct a viable procedure to industrialize JACOB. Our plan for JACOB after the iGEM jamboree is divided into developments, commercialization, and resource transformation. For development we currently divided it into small, medium, large scale trial. Based on our current knowledge, small and medium trial is planned as below.
Small Scale Trial
   1. Duration: About half year.
   2. We will choose the production method for JACOB, e.g. as we learned from Biotechnology Corporation Ltd, the “filtration” of aptamers are still expensive, but aptamers synthesis is more economical. Nine sets of known aptamer (90np, 15 microliter, 100nmol/L) costs only about $135, and every set is sufficient for 250 microfluidic chips.
   3. During this phase we also need to rule out unknown influences on the"

In the morning we checked the BMG microplate reader which had been run over the weekend and provided interesting growth curves, quantifying the extent to which adding chloramphenicol to the medium slowed growth (this was by c. 50%).  Bill miniprepped lux R DNA from the registry. James told us that to use the standard Gibson protocol we needed 40bp of overlap, not the 20bp we planned which required rethinking oligos.  Peter prepared a number of cultures to test the effect of lumazine on emissions.
In the evening Hannah, Peter, Anja and Theo combined take-aways and beer with primer design, which went surprisingly well.
Tuesday
In the morning we sent off an order to Biolegio for oligo synthesis, in order to PCR out the Vibrio fischeri lux operon.  Will also designed oligos for the site-directed mutagenesis of Luciola cruciata luciferase into different colours, ready from when it arrives from DNA 2.0.
We decided to have a synthetic lux operon synthesised, relieving HNS repression.  Theo and Anja transformed TOP10 cells with Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent protein and a TetR repressed promoter from the registry, the latter will be used to control the firely operons.  Will and Hannah set up an experiment in the BMG plate reader which was our first test of its ability to detect bioluminescent emissions.
Wednesday
Bill wrote a piece of software in Python to simplify primer design for Gibson Assembly.  Theo and Hannah designed a synthetic V. fischeri lux operon with codon usage and GC content optimised. Will prepared DNA for use with the oligos we hope will arrive tomorrow.  Paul analysed results from the BMG plate reader.
Thursday
Anja continued transferring the RBS and luciferase part into psB1C3 for submission to the registry.  Theo and Hannah sent their synthetic lux operon to Mr. Gene for synthesis.  Peter and Ben (who has returned from Edinburgh!) designed an experiment for characterising the existing registry firefly luciferase.

The contamination occurs at random locations in the sample of cells and the intensity of the amplified signal are based on the aforementioned model parameters."
HUST-Innovators,2014,Team:HUST-Innovators_-_-_TEXT.html,"( In fact, the average length of NGS reads is far longer than the Sanger, the first GS reads). Clearly, the shortage of NGS is their assembly, like puzzle games. The shorter the reads are, the more barriers we will meet in the concatenation process. Unfortunately, this problem is fundamental data property, even if we have more proper modeling and more efficient algorithms. Until now we have found no chance to compensate this demerit.
Comparatively speaking, the SMRT sequencing operating on PacBio RS II
1. Incredibly long read length : the average read length is between 5，000 to 8，000 bases per read( the average length of NGS read ranges from 150 to 400 bp). The maximum read length can reach 20，000 bp.
For instance, the USDA had intended to sequence the microbes in goats. Compared to the least 18 contigs produced by the NGS, which means the project is uncompleted, the SMRT can get the ultimate contig—a successful sequencing.
2. High accuracy ：In short, the accuracy of sequencing can reach 99.999%.
3. GC Problem ：For the NGS, areas with high GC concentration mean low coverage. Only insufficient info can be dug out for assembly. This is why many gaps between DNA sequences emerge in the result.
In SMRT, the coverage do not fluctuate as the GC content varies. So the Problem can be avoided.
Our Project
Sequencing
First, we decided to sequence the unknown Thraustochytrium roseum. As we read the thesis on Velvet, SSpace, GRASS and so on, we finally made a determination to use the struture of the GRASS to do the scaffolding process after finishing getting contigs. As the data is sequenced from the 3rd Generation Sequencing Method, we had changed some lines of the code in order to fix the characteristics of the data.
GRASS has some progresses: Sort, Bundle, Extract, RemoveAmbiguous, Erode   IsolateContigsThink. Those are not needed while we are using the SMRT sequencing data. So we deleted code about them.
Think about the NGS Assembly, nearly all the softwares use pair-end reads to link the contigs through the scaffolding process. Knowing that the reads from the Pacbio machines are extremely,after self-overlapping, we let the Pacbio sequence replace the contigs in GRASS to do the scaffolding.
Here is a part of result:

To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

In conclusion, halorhodopsin could fulfill the need of utilizing light as a signal or energy source. We believe that halorhodopsin would be one of the most promising tools of synthetic biology in the future.

In our topic model there was no cleaning of the words, meaning words without meaning such as “is”, “and”, “a” etc. were included in the data. Therefore, these meaningless words were considered as topic by the model as they do appear very frequently. Therefore, we manually removed them from the final result as it has no meaning. As our aim was to use topic model as a quantitative tool, maps created to visualise the topic distribution of each subject are presented in the Human Practice section here .

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Synergy (MATLAB model)_-_-_TEXT.html,": Exo/endo-glucanase - 1 g/kg, β-glucosidase - 0.01 g/kg
Temperature 35° C
Figure 1 is set with β-glucosidase at its maximum concentration and Figure 2 with  Exo/endo-glucanase at maximum. This is to compare the effect of certain enzymes on cellulose degradation and glucose production.  The result is consistent with what is expected. Exoglucanase chews away at the end of a cellulose chain, producing cellobiose sugars and endoglucanase cuts cellulose chanins in the centre, turning one chain into two. This concurs with the results, with Figure 1 modelling markedly higher amount of cellulose at the minimum amount of exo/endo-glucanase than that of Figure 2. Whereas β-glucosidase cuts cellobiose in half, producing two glucose molecules. Figure 2 which β-glucosidase is at its maximum produces 255.6% more glucose than in Figure 1 with β-glucosidase at its minimum in 60 hours.
The concentration of cellobiose in Figure 1 keeps low. This is because there is little cellulose converted to cellobiose by Exo/endo-glucanase. Also, if there is any cellobiose, they are all converted to glucose by β-glucosidase.
Figure 3: Graph of cellulose degradation over time with maximum β-glucosidase.
Initial conditions: Cellulose - 100 g/kg, Glucose - 0.01 g/kg , Cellobiose - 0.01 g/kg.
Enzymes: Exo/endo-glucanase - 1 g/kg, β-glucosidase - 0.01 g/kg
Temperature 35° C. The x-axis is set to semilog.
Figure 3 is under the same conditions as Figure 2, but its x-axis is set to a semilog scale to illustrate what happens over a longer period of time. The effect of high β-glucosidase can better be seen with the complete conversion of cellobiose to glucose.
(We'd like to thank the ETH Zurich team for submitting some bugfixes to the simulation that led to this figure; where previously it violated the laws of physics, now it does not!)

Georgia_Tech,2012,Team:Georgia Tech#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"gcctttgagtgagc). The sequencing was successful for both primers. EMBOSS Needle was used to align sequencing results to the expected sequence for the part (see attached sequencing data).
The sequence from VF2 from bp 331 to 1099 aligned with the expected sequence from bp 1 to 752 with 92.2% identity. However, it was noted that the region from 332 to 404 bp on the VF2 sequence aligned imperfectly with the expected sequence for that region (1 to 75 bp in the expected sequence for the part).  This region is supposed to include the sequence for the PLlac 0-1 promoter (R0011)
However, a comparison between the expected sequence (aattgtgagcggataacaattgacattgtgagcggataacaagatactgagcaca) against the VF2 sequence (agttctggcaggtttggccgcgggttctttttggtacacgaaagc) reveals very little identity (43.1%). This leads us to believe that the promoter region (R0011) for LasR expression is missing and that the part will not function as expected. A BLAST search the VF2 sequence suggests the part does contain the LasR coding sequence (C0079). Directly upstream of the LasR coding sequence is the ribosomal binding site (B0034) which appears to be the correct sequence. However, upstream of the ribosomal binding site, the VF2 sequence BLASTs to the P. aeruginosalasB gene starting at 247 bp. Upstream of lasB appears to be vector sequence. Nowhere in the sequence is the PLlac 0-1 promoter region (R0011).
The VR sequence (reverse complement) from 1 to 939bp aligns with the expected sequence from 1059 to 2047bp with 97.7% identity. There appears to be no significantly misaligned region. The VR sequence appears to contain the correct sequences for the LasR+PAI promoter (R0079), the ribosomal binding site (B0032), GFP (E0040), and the transcriptional terminator (B0010 and B0012).

Mutual Help
Although some unexpected difficulties arose in the course of our experiment, mutual help among teams can help us get through. We got help from other iGEM teams and professors and overcame the difficulties, we also gave a helping hand to iGEM teams in need of our assistance.
We were extremely fortunate to become friends with the Xiamen University (XMU) iGEM team, they were very generous and gave us plasmids E0020,E0040 and E0010 which we were looking for in our previous preparatory project.
This is Shandong University (SDU) 's first time to participate in iGEM, and Tongji has already participated in 3 years. We shared information on team management，the iGEM requirements and what iGEM really is. In the process we became very good friends.
This year SDU's project focuses on the treatment of tumors by replacing the mutated p53. The 2016 Tongji iGEM team also focused on cancer therapy with some parts containing p53. Therefore SDU team asked us for BBa_K1922003(wt p53) and BBa_K1922006(htERT-p53) for their experiments. We shared what we know and our experiences using p53 in experiments. We sent two samples fugw vector and htERT-GFP plasmid containing htERT promoter in them.
We checked the samples carefully and wrote instructions in order to make their work easier. Some of the information are as follows:

For its second year, the UPO-Sevilla team participates on the international Synthetic Biology competition iGEM. Synthetic biology is a new and exciting discipline of science that puts together computing, engineering and molecular biology with the goal of designing and constructing biological machines: living organisms with the ability to perform new and useful tasks. The iGEM contest is an initiative that hosts undergraduate student teams from all over the world to develop new biological designs, work on them over the summer and present them in the iGEM Jamborees.
UPO-Sevilla was the pioneer Andalusian team to participate in the iGEM competition last year. The UPO-Sevilla team has grown from six students and two supervisors in 2010 to ten students and seven supervisors in 2011. This year's team hosts a mixture of computer science, engineering, biotechnology, genetics, physiology and microbiology students and professors. This multidisciplinary team is working hard on the Flashbacter project, aimed to develop biological machines able to store information, much like a computer's memory does. Find more details on this in the Project section .
In addition to research, the UPO-Sevilla team has undertaken during this year an active diffusion program to promote awareness of Synthetic biology, especially among younger students in Andalucía including seminars, workshops, and the first blog in spanish devoted to Synthetic biology, Tornillos y genes.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"ole and Odense Tekniske Gymnasium, invited us to present our project, in addition to starting discussions with the students about GMO.
An 8th grade class from the local public school, Odense Friskole, were invited to see our laboratory workspace. It was a challenge to successfully convey our project and the concept of synthetic biology in a way that would be easily understandable by 8th graders, who have only recently been introduced to science. A challenge that we accepted and solved, by relaying the fundamentals in synthetic biology, e.g. the basics of a cell, DNA, and GMO.
From all of these presentations and interactions with younger individuals, we had a strong intuition that it had made an influence on their awareness of synthetic biology. This intuition was supported by the positive feedback provided by teachers and students. An awareness of how new scientific technologies can be a feasible solution to a possible energy crisis. Technologies such as synthetic biology, with endless capabilities to achieve efficacy, since no one knows what tomorrow brings. For more information about this read To Future iGEM Teams
Final Presentation at SDU-Denmark
The day before we travelled to Boston, we booked one of the big auditoriums at the University of Southern Denmark, for the final rehearsal of our jamboree presentation. We made sure to take note of all the feedback and tips we received, while also implementing these into our final presentation. This event was promoted on all the information screens at our university in order to attract a broad audience and increase the interest for iGEM. Thus, making it possible to reach a substantial amount of future applications for the SDU-iGEM team and ensure that the iGEM spirit will continue to prosper in the future!
Social Media
Social media is an easy way to impact a high number of people, so a strategy was concocted with the intention of reaching as many people as possible with our outreach. Our strategy yielded marvellous results, amongst which was a video on our project, that reached viewers equal to 16% of our hometown’s population, along with becoming the second most seen bulletin of the year from University of Southern Denmark. They have also asked us to film our experiences at the Jamboree, which will feature on the homepage of the student’ initiative BetonTV. Several articles were written about our project in local newspapers, one was even featured in the saturday special.

Conclusion
Why Do We Want to Model Our Platform?
Our new molecular binding platform contains three binding sites: streptavidin (mSA2), a Carbohydrate Binding Module (CBM3a) and an unnatural amino acid, 4-azido-L-phenylalanine (AzF). These “heads” of our Cerberus are connected by flexible regions, composed of 30-50 amino acids each. These regions called linkers are described in the literature as being highly flexible and as disordered regions1;2.
Figure 1: General design of our Cerberus protein
For more information about our platform, visit the Description or Design pages.
As our linkers between domains are so flexible, it was possible that the CBM3a and mSA2 heads could be brought into contact. Interactions between the different molecular components of the platform could disturb their capacities to bind the target ligands. The spatial organisation of each component could also prevent the functionalization of our platform. In order to try to answer all these questions, we implemented multi-step and multi-level molecular modeling strategy.
First, we built a 3D structure model of our binding platform and we assessed its stability over time. We also evaluated the distance between the different domains and its variations, which provide information about the size of the ligands that can be bound to the platform. We studied the interaction of our binding platform with target ligands. Especially, large-scale conformational sampling and exploration methods were used to assess the conformational rearrangements of these 3D structure models (the binding platform, either free or in interaction with the target ligands) over time, hopefully maintaining their binding capacities.
On this wiki page, we detail the different steps of our molecular modeling strategy and our thought process behind the solutions that we chose to use.
Strategy
To meet all these challenges, we conceived a multi-level and multi-step molecular modelling workflow. Here is a graphical summary of this workflow:

2.2   Overview of Traditional                                     Michaelis-Menten Theory
      Before the improved version, let’s take a                                         quick look at the traditional one. In 1913, Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten                                         proposed a mathematical model of the reaction. It involves an enzyme, E, binding                                         to a substrate, S, to form a complex, ES, which in turn releases a product, P,                                         regenerating the original enzyme. This may be represented schematically as:
      Where k1 (forward rate),k 2 (reverse rate),                                         and k3 (catalytic rate) denote the rate constants, the double arrows                                         between S       (substrate) and ES (enzyme-substrate                                         complex) represents the fact that                                         enzyme-substrate binding is a reversible process, and the single forward arrow represents the formation of P (product).
      By applying the law of mass action (the rate                                         of a reaction is proportional to                                         the product of the concentrations of the reactants), we can write down four                                         non-linear ordinary differential equations and a conservation condition.
      Here, CE, CE0,                                         CS, CES and CP represent the                                         concentration of enzyme, total enzyme, substrate, the complex, and the product,                                         respectively. To solve these equations, the traditional way here is to apply                                         quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) that we assume the substrate is in                                         instantaneous chemical equilibrium with the complex. Therefore, we can let                                         equation (2.4) equals to 0 as:
      Therefore, we get the reaction velocity:
      Where
      Kcat the turn-over number is the                                         maximum                                         number of substrate molecules converted to product per enzyme molecule per                                         second. The Michaelis constant KM is the CS at which the reaction rate is at                                         half-maximum. Thus, the concentration of production will be
      Both parameters can be measured by measuring                                         a single enzyme reaction with Lineweaver-Burk plot. The idea is to rewrite the                                         equation as:
      With equation (2.11) and experimental data,                                         we can easily get the parameters of                                         the system by fitting the slope, y-intercept and x-intercept. The y-intercept of                                         this graph is equivalent to the inverse of Vmax. The x-intercept of                                         this graph                                         represents -1/KM. However, we can only get 2 values from the                                         Lineweaver"

SBML
The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is a computer-readable format for representing models of biological processes. It's applicable to simulations of metabolism, cell-signaling, and many other topics. SBML has been evolving since mid-2000 thanks to an international community of software developers and users. SBML does not represent an attempt to define a universal language for representing quantitative models. It would be impossible to achieve a one-size-fits-all universal language. A more realistic alternative is to acknowledge the diversity of approaches and methods being explored in systems biology, and seek a common intermediate format—a lingua franca—enabling communication of the most essential aspects of the models.
Why SBML?
The adoption of SBML offers many benefits, including:
enabling the use of multiple tools without rewriting models for each tool.
enabling models to be shared and published in a form other researchers can use even in a different software environment.
ensuring the survival of models (and the intellectual effort put into them) beyond the lifetime of the software used to create them.
SBML is neutral with respect to programming languages and software encoding; however, it's oriented towards allowing models to be encoded using XML. By supporting SBML as a format for reading and writing models, different software tools (including programs for building and editing models, simulation programs, databases, and other systems) can directly communicate and store the same computable representation of those models. This removes an impediment to sharing results and permits other researchers to start with an unambiguous representation of the model, examine it carefully, propose precise corrections and extensions, and apply new techniques and approaches—in short, to do better science.
Software support
As the matter of fact, there has been lots of softwares known to us to provide some degree of support for reading, writing, or otherwise working with SBML. Thus, we make SBML to access our software, which makes it more compatible to other biological softwares. Users can output SBML file from our software, which means you can get a standard expression of biological system. It is facilitate for you to analyse the model in other SBML-related softwares.
To access the requirement, there must be a tool helps us to fetch the list of data from a SBML file. Fortunately, LibSBML assists us for all the SBML related staff. LibSBML"

ULaVerne_Collab iGEM 2017 team
ULaVerne_Collab team 2017 was also working with Chlamydomonas reinhardtii species. Their project needed to perform a transformation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with specific vectors to characterize three different superoxide dismutases (SOD) using two different plasmids that direct the SODs to either the cytoplasm or the chloroplasts, to determine SOD efficiency based on placement in the cell.           Our team needed wild type cell wall plus strain, with which they were working. ULaVerne team sent us this strain for our experiments and also their vectors for transformation. We in turn performed transformation of their vectors in our lab and sent electroporated C. reinhardtii colonies containing their vectors.

Potato is a staple food in Honduras. However, the country lacks a healthy seed potato production system, which forces the farmers to import seed potatoes from Guatemala and other countries further afield. In addition to the high price of such imports, the supply of high-quality seed is unstable, as a result of which domestic production cannot be increased. The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, Honduras, is attempting to foster local production of healthy seed potatoes and disease detection technology in order to gradually reduce imports. The ultimate goal is to thereby reduce production costs and increase local farmers’ yields of fresh potato that yields meeting domestic demand.
Following project appraisal, the country’s main challenge was identified as the lack of a domestic seed potato supply system. The core problem is that the agricultural sector has not established a national seed production system, nor does it have the technical capacity for disease certification. Given that a seed potato production program has not been developed in Honduras, local farmers must use seed imported from foreign countries, as a result of which producers have boosted direct production costs, since they are not able to guarantee the quality of such seed.
Another project we are going to do is to implant our detection device into their farms.
The main content of this project will include:
Establishing a seed potato reproduction center and a healthy seed production and supply station.
Enhancing the skills of technicians, strengthening seed reproduction technology and enhancing the cultivation techniques of seed potato producers and local farmers to form a seed potato reproduction system"

University-Wide Challenge
The team at Oxford has been working on a method of cell-free detection of Chargas disease. Specifically, they are testing for the presence of cruzipain, which is known to cleave and release the peptide hirudin from the transmembrane OmpA precursor. To measure cruzipain activity, they are using the Spytag/Spycatcher system. First, they must attach Spytag, a short peptide, onto the OmpA protein. We have assisted the team by running a CG simulation of OmpA bilayer insertion and simulation with SpyTag/SpyCatcher. This simulation, performed on the supercomputer cluster at McMaster University, provided insight into protein conformations and system stability after the OmpA+Spytag fusion protein was inserted into a model membrane.
Collaboration on this project has involved sharing of information on the proteins involved. Below are the 3D images of the two proteins involved in the simulation, OmpA and SpyTag. Furthermore, communication has been required to create the most realistic bond between OmpA and Spytag on a computer. After discussing this issue, we reached the consensus that the optimal route would be to create a harmonic artificial potential between the two proteins.
Below, we have attached the molecular dynamics simulations we ran of their chimeric protein. We showed which residues may be potentially unstable in both the Spytag and SpyCatcher proteins. The root-mean squared fluctuations (RMSF) is proportional to protein stability, and is unique to SHARCNET supercomputer clusters in Ontario, Canada. With this, we were able to offer atomistic resolution.
Oxford provided us with the code for reaction kinetics, which we implemented heavily in our modelling section."

Abstract & Introduction
Mycelium is an ideal candidate for the construction of building materials on Mars due in most part to its replicability; a builder will end up with more material than he brought with him. However, while concrete and rebar are not easily transported, they are conveniently measured in volume and in weight, and a builder can precisely simulate the things that he can build given his material constraints. The model developed for our project attempts to confer this ease of measurability onto mycelium in order to better understand its utility as a building material—given a starting amount of mycelium, how much can a builder grow given his time constraints? Alternately, if a builder brings fillable molds and a starter colony of mycelium—how long will it take for his fungus to fill the mold? I constructed a Python model to answer these questions, and to simulate the fractal and competitive growth pattern of mycelial hyphae, in the hopes that it will be used to inform others’ efforts in growing mycelium in the future.
Materials and Methods
To begin, we got growth data—a few weeks’ worth—from the team members responsible for actually growing mycelium in the lab. We put this data into a spreadsheet and ran various regression analyses on it. We found that an exponential model fit the data with high fidelity, with an R2 value of 0.93. We devised an exponential growth model in Python and ran several simulations. However, we found that the data for the quantity of mycelium grown was dubious as growth periods grew longer, giving enormous values that did not reflect the data gathered in the lab.
We began researching models online, and eventually found a tumor growth model, called the “Eden Model” (after the person who initially developed it; the link to the literature we referenced is given in the “Discussion” section of this page). We were interested in tweaking the Eden model for mycelial growth, because the way that tumors grow is remarkably similar to mycelial proliferation: both incorporate substrate adjacent to their borders into their bodies, initially"

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#teamOverview_-_-_TEXT.html,"th Aug, 2010
On August 5th, teams from 7 top universities in China, SJTU-BioX-Shanghai , ECUST-Shanghai , Peking , Tsinghua , USTC & USTC_Software , ZJU-China , and Sun Yat-sen University all gathered in Shanghai and had a nice day at the iGEM 2010 China Meetup.
The meetup started around 9 with a short speech by Professor Lin He, head of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Bio-X Institute, which hosted the event. Then each team made a presentation displaying their projects and progresses since the summer began, followed by free questioning and discussion time. And when it was near the end of the day, student members had a hour or two to talk and play freely with each other, with a big meal waiting ahead for them.

Naturally in strain TT01, tcdA1 is expressed homologously with other toxins, for example, tcdB1 and tcc toxins. TcdA1 helps to transfer the latter into the cell to maximum the toxic effect(Figure 3).

PCR
We use primer pBad F/pBad R to amplify pBad and standard F/ tcdA1-right R for CDS tcdA1.
Seamless assembly
We used seamless assembly as our assembly method so restriction digestion and T4 ligation can be avoided. Detailed protocol and instruction for primer design can be seen in our Protocol. By this way prefix sequence, pBad, CDS tcdA1 and front twenty bases of mCherry sequence can be ligated seamlessly.

tcdA1 R (R, 5’-3’): CTAGTATTTCTCCTCTTTCTTTATTTAATGGTGTAGCGAA
Transformation and confirmation
After seamless assembly, standard plasmid pSB1C3 containing tcdA1 gene was transformed into E.coli DH5α. When single colony appeared on the LB plate, we picked out 10 colonies, respectively, as our template for bacteria solution PCR. In order to avoid the appearance of false positive clones, we used tcdA1_M1(a primer on the right part of tcdA1)/VR as the universal primers for the CDStcdA1 is too long to amplify all the parts sequence with VF2/VR .Primers are shown below. The positive clone and its corresponding raw bacteria solution were stored and samples were sent to do DNA sequencing.

Finally we asked her general opinion about our device. She reasoned that if we could design a method that is easy in use and gives a quick output, there will be a market for many other veterinary and human diseases.
Jeanette van der Ven – Owner of a goat’s farm near Eindhoven and one of the board members of the ZLTO (association for entrepreneurs in the green sector)
Goal: Learn more about the viewpoints of a cattle-farmer when it comes to detection of diseases such as Q fever.
Approach: We contacted Jeanette van der Ven, who owns a farm where there has been an infection with Q fever and informed about her experiences with detection and treatment of Q fever so far. We asked her about her wishes, when it comes to disease-detection. And asked what she thought about our device.
Result: Mrs. Van der Ven explained that in her case it has been very hard to clarify that an Qfever infection had occurred on her farm. She told us that the rate of abortion rate on her farm rose, after which she got suspicious and sent several fetuses and placentas for examination. However only in the last case, several months later one could find traces of an Q fever infection. We asked mrs. Van der Ven what she thought about the application of our device for detection of Q fever in milk. Mrs. Van der Ven was very positive about the idea of having a toolkit that farmers can use themselves to check their cattle for diseases. She said there would be great interest from farmers for such early-warning systems. Thereby she also emphasized the need for detection-systems for chlamydia and salmonella in animals. Definitely the application in milk could be easy. However she was not completely convinced about the usage of antibody detection. She told us, some of the goats that she knows were infected with Q fever still score negative for an antibody-test. Thus she emphasized that a more reliable technique is needed for antibody-detection.
About the use of GMOs mrs. Van der Ven was quite open minded. She says: ""As long as the environment, people and animal don’t suffer, there is no reason to be opposed of genetically engineered organisms."" However she can imagine bigger steps can be made in the applications on cattle, than in humans. She predicts GMO’s in humans will be mostly used in prevention rather than treatment.

Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#strategic-process_-_-_TEXT.html," July, we did not present any results of our 2011 project, but showed what our concept and idea is. A lot of people were interested in the concepts of Synthetic Biology, iGEM in general, ethical discussions and the shown projects. Inspired by our posters we had some interesting talks and debates with representatives from academia, industry and politics. The expert audience showed a lot of interest, often asked for more detailed information or even suggested new and different applications for our cell free biosensors. Our project raised a lot of interest, because there was a big focus on cell free systems at the conference, so we fitted in quite well. These are supposed to be one of the visionary next steps in biotechnology. Apart from cell free systems, the strategic process points out the current trends in biotechnology. These are Systems biology, Bioinformatics, Synthetic Biology and BioBricks, as well as Nanobiotechnology, especially self assembling molecules. Witpout knowing this when choosing our project, this shows that we are working on an state of the art and innovative project.
The poster session was followed by a panel discussion and workshops on the future innovations of biotechnology. During the breaks and workshops we were able to further get in contact with the other participants and promote iGEM. Additionally to the whole scientific exchange, it was realy nice to get in touch and share some experience with the other iGEM teams.
For the iGEM team Bielefeld the Strategic Process conference was another great experience, to promote our project and to get in touch with a lot of new people. This event was special, because the participants were mainly composed of an influential expert audience. Additionally we gave an interview for biotechnologie.tv , which was broadcasted on August 22nd.
Posters we presented at the Strategic Process Biotechnology 2020+

The concentrations produced when characterising BBa_K2205003 were detected at a minimum concentration of 10 mg/L. The testing strips used could detect a maximum value of 200 mg/L, two samples indicated this value and so greater concentrations could be present. These were 20mL cultures tested at 5mL a time. The volumes used were low; sealed tubes were used; the formaldehyde was within solution when testing the part; and all experiments were carried out underneath fume hoods, hence there was no real risk to team members.
North-East Big Bang Fair
In July, we attended the North East Big Bang Fair- a large and exciting science fair. Over 2000 students and teachers attended, and we got the opportunity to talk to everyone about synthetic biology, iGEM, and our project! We had a few different activities to get the students and teachers involved with synthetic biology.
‘Build your own Biosensor’ is an interactive activity we developed to get the students thinking about synthetic biology independently. Many of the students did not know what a biosensor was, so this was also a good way to introduce the function and purpose of biosensors in an understandable and relatable way. We asked the students to think about what they would like to sense (an input), and how this would be detected (an output). There were lots of fun and creative responses!
We also had many great conversations with both school pupils and teachers, based around 4 main questions that we posed:
What is synthetic biology?
What do you think synthetic biology can achieve?
How does the current curriculum tackle synthetic biology, and how would you change science teaching if you could?
How do you engage with science outside of the classroom?
It was great to spread awareness of synthetic biology among the next generation of scientists, and even give teachers ideas for how they could introduce synthetic biology teaching into their lessons."

Dundee,2011,Team:Dundee#Team_-_-_TEXT.html,"'m originally from Dublin, Ireland, but came to Scotland in 2002 for my undergraduate degree at the University of Glasgow. I've just gone into the 2nd year of my PhD in Frank Sargent's lab (MMB) and my project is to try and engineer a ""superstrain"" of E. coli producing lots of biohydrogen! I love my sport and apart from my borderline obsession with football, I like to do a bit of running, tennis, golf and basically any other sport going!
Rachelle Binny
I am about to start my 4th and final year of Mathematical Biology at the University of Dundee. When people ask me what I study, my response nearly always triggers questioning looks, raised eyebrows and comments such as maths and biology?...what an unusual combination!. In actual fact, mathematics has many applications in biology, for example in population dynamics or mathematical modelling of cellular processes. I am particularly interested in the modelling and simulation of tumour growth and its applications in cancer research. Getting involved in the rapidly evolving new field of synthetic biology is going to be a challenging but immensely rewarding experience and I'm very excited to be a part of the interdisciplinary Dundee team for iGEM 2011. When I'm not scribbling down equations, I enjoy climbing, hill-walking, skiing and other outdoorsy activities!
Dave Gibson
I am an Applied Computing student going into my final year. My interests lie mainly in web application development and learning new languages/skills so coming into this project with minimal biology knowledge has been a fun learning experience. Outside of University, I love to play guitar and my dream is to move to somewhere cold and mountainous like British Columbia, Canada.
Kasia Kozyrska
I have just finished my final year of a BSc(Hons) in Molecular Genetics and hope to graduate spectacularly this June. I spent most of my two last years of university wreaking havoc in various research labs, where I discovered that my love for budding yeast goes far beyond my simple fondness of beer. Manipulating yeast uses similar techniques to those used for bacteria, so my mad wet-lab skills should come in useful on our quest for iGEM Champions 2011. That being said, I will not tolerate unwashed DNA gel tanks or mistreatment of lab equipment and all culprits will be punished by poking with a pipette tip.

Dundee,2015,Team:Dundee#Forensic Toolkit#Chromate Fiona_-_-_TEXT.html,") . Over the last 10 years the group that discovered it started working out the underlying mechanisms of this set of characteristics. A transposon located set of genes that lead to chromate resistance (TnOtChr) was uncovered. This operon, expressed from the Pchr - promoter led to the expression of the downstream genes chrA, chrB, chrC, and chrF. chrA was found to express and efflux pump, whereas the gene product of chrB was identified as being a chromate-inducible regulator of Pchr. Additionally, chrC and chrF were found to confer tolerance to superoxides. Deleting chrC and chrF was shown to have no significant effect on chromate resistance which at first seemed unusual, but considering that Cr(VI) is often reduced via Cr(V) and Cr(IV) intermediates which can lead to the generation of superoxides, these 2 genes are suspected to act as a second line of defense (4) .
Figure 1: Plasmid map of the original biobrick system, (BBa_K1058008) .
To make the system more modular, we aimed to modify and improve this existing biobrick by taking it apart and using its constituent parts in a new arrangement (Fig. 2). This has the advantage that each part can be modified individually and the level of the reporter, GFP, and/or the repressor can be modulated more easily by subcloning either of them.
Figure 2: Plasmid map of the modified biobrick system, (submitted to registry under BBa_K1590003 , and BBa_K1590004 .
↑
How did we test it?
To ensure that the modified system was valid we used mathematical modelling to compare the original biobrick and our modified system (Fig. 3). We also looked at GFP production with varying levels of chromate added to the system (Fig. 4). The models of both the original and modified pathways revealed two key points; the modified pathway is just as reliable as the original pathway, and the level of GFP produced does not change. However the response will be faster for increasing levels of chromate added to the system.
Figure 3: Comparing the likelihood of false positives, in terms of leakiness, of both systems in the case of GFP output. The figure shows that both systems are equally reliable.

We tried to avoid the use of dangerous chemicals whenever possible. We have completely banned a                         number of dangerous chemicals, such as ethidium bromide which had been replaced by anthocyanin                         for our DNA gel electrophoresis. At the same time, we have restricted the use of dangerous                         chemicals (such as acrylamide) which must be clearly placed in marked areas in the laboratory. And we were also required to keep the chemistry reagents in classified storage.

We received positive feedback from the teams, many naming this workshop as one of the most useful parts of the meetup. Opinions still differed greatly, as illustrated by the quotes below.
“ I believe science is all about having aggressive ideas and putting them into experiments. Bioethics should be considered, but it should not be the reason that we stop the development of a certain technology.”
Participant
“Bioethics is something equally important as the product you are going after. It is unethical not to consider bioethics. ”

Hackaton
On October 5th, 2018, we organised a Hackathon during the Cyber Security Week. Here we challenged participants to try and beat our gene doping detection algorithm. The first goal of the Hackathon was to educated participants about synthetic biology and our project. The second goal to learn from the participants and the sequences they generated. In this way, we were able to make our algorithm more robust through the knowledge and sequences we gained while imparting some of our own knowledge on the participants. The Hackathon was a perfect of how learning can go both ways.

“How we can use bioinformatics to detect gene doping is truly fascinating. ”

High School Bioethics Debates
We think that also outside of iGEM children need to be brought in contact with bioethics and their own responsibility, whether this is in the development of technology or the use. Since the use of gene editing techniques are more and more widely available, we decided to visit high schools to start bioethics debates on this topic. Would they want to make use of DIY gene editing techniques? And why should they or should they not? More on the set-up of the debates can be found in the drop down below.

Educational Set-up High School Bioethics Debates
We decided to have one main topic of debate: 'The goal of sports is to get the best out of people. Is science allowed to contribute to this in any way?' After dividing the class over several groups of interest, e.g. the Ministry of Health and Sports, Sport doctors"

Laccase decomposes substrate ABTS, producing ABTS free radical, absorption coefficient is much larger at 420nm compared to substrate ABTS, measure rate of increase of ABTS free radical in order to calculate laccase activity.
Instrument and reagent:
balance, low temperature centrifuge, UV-visible spectrophotometer, microplate reader, raman quartz cuvette/96 pore plate, and a laboratory water bath at constant temperature.
Procedure of extracting enzyme liquid:
Tissue: lower the temperature using mixture of ice and water, and homogenate the mixture of tissue and the extracted liquid (mass of tissue : mass of liquid as 1 : 5-10; 0.1g tissue and 1mL extracted liquid suggested). Centrifuge at 4 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes, 10000g, draw the supernatant, and place it on ice for further measurement.
Cell: lower the temperature of the mixture of cells and the extracted liquid using mixture of ice and water, then add ultrasonication to destroy the cells of the mixture for 3 minutes, 300w power (number of 104 cells : volume of the extracted liquid as 500-1000 : 1mL; 5 million cells and 1mL extracted liquid suggested)

Formula to calculate laccase activity using sample mass:
Definition of laccase activity: 1 laccase activity is the amount of enzyme needed for every sample (per gram) to oxidize 1nmol substrate ABTS per minute.
laccase activity (nmol/min/g) = ΔA /ε(ABTS mmolar extinction coefficient) / d * V (total volume of reaction) / V (volume of sample in the reaction, 0.025mL) / W (sample mass, g) * V (extracted liquid added, 1mL) / T (reaction time, 3 minutes) = 130 *ΔA / W

At the same time, we also discussed with them about our questions. Then, they showed us around the lab. They had certain members in charge of the safety, material and equipment of lab. And they divided the working parts clearly. We were impressed that they made a form to clarify every individual’s work so everyone could understand their duty and improve the efficiency. They had a rule that everyone could have a two weeks’ holiday in the summer holiday, therefore researchers can take a rest and better work. Because our team was newly built, we searched for the reasonable management and learned from our mistakes and others’ experience.

I also enjoy looking at people's face after smelling a sample, this is priceless ! After smelling billions of samples for iGEM (i never joke), I am now immune to strong and bad body odors, though i still cannot stand the odor from my neighbour cooking fish every single day, but that's a different story.Nevermind, BODY ODOR FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD, I CHALLENGE YOU, COME AT ME BRAS.

2. Detected the amount of 2-PE by using HPLC.
Fig.9 2-PE Standard curve
    We firstly made samples of pure 2-PE with different concentration. (Use the chemicals we bought) and draw the standard curve using HPLC. Three mobile phases are double distilled water, Acetonitrile. And the retention time of 2-PE is about 4.8 min.
Fig.10 2-PE Chromatographic peaks
    Then, dealing with our samples of bacteria, we shaking cultured 50ml bacteria liquid collected 30 OD by centrifugation and added 200ul 50 mM phenylalanine as substrate, 37 ℃ cultured for 8h.     The retention time of our sample is the same as the standard curve which prove that we realize the biosynthesis of 2-PE.
Garbage lid
    Overview: In the case of garbage lid, we explore the production of PLA and 2-PE further than the construction part. Moreover, the lid should express the appropriate amount PLA and 2-PE to sterilization and release fragrance.
Garbage lid-PLA
    Goal: We used constitutive promoter, linked with three enzymes to express PLA. In order to make system in lid controllable, we need to figure out that how long and how much will PLA be produced. Then, go further and deduce how long the lid will start to work.     Reaults: 1. Relationship between time and PLA production. 2. Relationship between cell concentration and PLA production.

Figure 11.The relationship between time and PLA production
    We draw the line of time and different optical density (OD) of bacteria’s PLA production and found the accumulation of PLA reached 18 mM at 5 min, which means that the accumulated process of PLA is quite fast. According to the graphs, we can infer the best effecting time is 8 min for 15 OD, 6.5 min for 22.5"

So with all the new tools in hand (cells, plates, LB broth), I decided to start from the beginning – get new mini prep samples, digest the plasmid, and tried different ligation method. In this case, I limited myself to only use GFP Composite (Bba_E0240) and the suitable promoter (Bba_R2000). I also tried to learn more about the ligation problem by cutting both GFP composite and R2000 Promoter with only one restriction digest enzyme, X and S respectively. They will serve as a ""positive control"", because they are supposed to be easy to ligate. I prepared 3 ligation reactions for one type of sample, each reaction is done through either one of the following ligation protocol: 16 C for one hour, room temperature/bench top for 30 minutes, or bench top using quick ligase for 5 minutes. The insert to vector ratio used was 1 to 3 and the heat inactivation step would be skipped here.

Brazil
Brazil is an open-minded country about the development of GMOs, despite                     a strict law to limit the spreading of GMOs in the environment Brazil is one                     of the major producer and exporter of GMO crops. Although, consumption of                     genetically modified crops is legal the product need to be labeled as transgenic.1 Besides, to protect the environment of the propagation of GMO, Brazil ratified the Cartagena                   Protocol on Biosafety.2 An international protocol of good conduct to protect                   the environment.3
China
This past years, China have enacted many laws on GMOs to boost their research                   on biotechnology without neglect the environment and the human health. In this                   optic, research on GMOs are facilitate but the cultivation and the commercialization                   are strictly supervised. The consumption of modified crops is possible, but the                   product has to present a label .4, 5 The Cartagena protocol was also ratified by China.2
France
France has a really strict law on GMO, in addition to the European law,                 France enacts other laws to restrict their utilization. Due to the unfavorable                 opinion public opinion on the subject, there is no GMO cultivation in France                 except for some scientific research and the consumption of transgenic product                 is practically inexistent despite a flexible law on the subject.6, 7 The Cartagena protocol was also ratified by France.2
Mexico
Mexico’s Law on GMO, privilege the right use of safety during the manipulation of it.               Many reports are required on the identification, the evaluations and the strategies               planned to counter the spreads of GMO in the environment. Despite this safety, Mexico               produce many type of GMOs and the law for the consumption of modified crops specify that a               transgenic product did not require a specific label unless special condition.8, 9 The Cartagena protocol was also ratified by Mexico.2
Spain
Unlike France, Spain is an open-minded European country about GMOs. It is the             biggest producer of GMO crops in Europe. Like France, Spain must follow the European law             on GMO, but the country also enacts their own law for the research and production of GMO.             In the other hand, for their consumption, Spain only follow the European recommendation.10, 11 The Cartagena protocol was also ratified by Spain. 2
United State
The United States are the biggest producer of GMO thanks to a different           point of view from the society, government and"

また勉強会では、2年生が全員揃う曜日が少ないこと、時間がないことを考慮し、Web勉強会をすることになりました。
Web勉強会は自律して行わないとできないものです。各自本気で取り組んでください。
ブレインストーミングでは福冨さんの案を中心に行いました。
ほかのチームも福冨さんに負けず、自分たちの案を発表していきましょう。

P&P: P&P brainstormed questions for the survey with Stony Brook. We began sorting out logistics for the New York State Fair during the Fall semester and discussed the possibility of attending the World MakerFaire in NYC. P&P discussed goals for the rest of the summer.
Wiki: Wiki subteam learned about project and discussed possible designs.
Business: Members proofread content for crowdfunding campaign.
JULY 24TH TO JULY 30TH
Wet Lab: Attempted second step of OE PCR for roGFP2-Orp1 and rxRFP-Tsa2. Attempted OE PCR of YF1 and FixJ. When run on a gel, both overlap reactions seemed to produce products and dimerize primers, but no bands were present at the desired fragment lengths. Gels also smeared, producing no distinct bands.
Product Development: Product Development learned React to be used for building the UI of the dashboard. PD decided to use servos to rotate the sensors to maximize coverage of the plants.
P&P: P&P continued filming videos.
Wiki: Wiki subteam presented possible wiki designs for home page and regular page. They decided on a final design for the wiki homepage & standard page with a few tweaks.
Business: Subteam lead added final edits to the crowdfunding campaign. Team members were invited as Ambassadors for the campaign.
JULY 31ST TO AUGUST 6TH
Wet Lab: Continued OE PCR troubleshooting with modified PCR protocols and asymmetric PCR before OE PCR of rxRFP-Tsa2. Performed touchdown PCR of Fixk2, hydrazinase, and Tsa2. Separate annealing and extension PCR reactions were performed, yet the samples still formed smears when run on a gel
Product Development: Product Development implemented the general layout of the dashboard.
P&P: P&P had multiple calls with Stony Brook to finalize the questions on the survey. We made contact with Dr. Sparks regarding the hydroponics application and visited Dr. Turkon at Ithaca College to see her hydroponics set up again. We talked to Dr. Hong from Dr. Roeder’s lab for insight on hydroponics growing solutions.
Wiki: Wiki subteam presented final designs for team page & home page and made collaborative edits to those designs.
Business: Team members went through their Ambassador training for the crowdfunding campaign.

I am a medical biology student, currently in my final year. Originally, I am from                                 a town called Uppsala, which is located 1 hour north of our capital city Stockholm.                                 Besides                                 my                                 passion for science, I have a great passion for food! I am constantly hungry and I'm                                 always                                 eating!

I have always been eager to understand and learn more about the surrounding world, to me                                 curiosity is vital quality. I find chemistry absolutely fascinating and therefore it                                 came                                 naturally to study engineering in chemical biology.
Favorite protein Rubisco
10 years from now I would like to find myself in a place where I can constantly learn new things                                 and develop as a person. Although, if this perfect image would somehow never be                                 fulfilled                                 you will find me at my parents basement, long lost with my lvl 140 mage in World of                                 Warcraft.

In my freetime I                                 like                                 to be                                 out and about and walk around outside, preferably with a camera in my hands. I'm also                                 very                                 social and likes to hang out with friends and family. I also love my cats very much, my                                 sweet                                 company at home!

Several participants were interested in our innovation. Amongst them was the founder of BioNyfiken and board member of Stockholm Makerspace, who was eager to contribute to our project. BioNyfiken is a biohackers network hosting workshops and meetups involving speaking events and training in biohacking, synthetic biology, quantified self and related topics. Their goal is to spread the knowledge of what is possible to do with biotechnology as technology becomes more accessible to the public, and encourage people without any training in those subjects to use technology to examine themselves and their environment and drive the biotechnological development. With over 500 members and a newly licensed DIY biosafety level I openlab space approved by Arbetsmiljöverket (equivalent to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration), we have organized interactive workshops consisting of theoretical presentations followed by laboratory practicals in bacteria sampling, plating, identification, as well as basic techniques such as pipetting and microscopy. This allows for the society to get a hands-on experience in synthetic biology and at the same time be involved in our work.
Open House at Stockholm Makerspace
On 20th of August, the biolab at Stockholm Makerspace had an open house co-hosted by iGEM Stockholm 2016. Everyone was invited and around 50 people of all ages with a wide variety of backgrounds other than synthetic biology participated. Attendees had the opportunity not only to learn more about synthetic biology and how a basic laboratory is structured and operates but also to try out basic but essential skills using a range of equipment and experimental procedures. Following a presentation detailing Stockholm Makerspace, iGEM Stockholm 2016 and the overall collaboration, everyone was curious and mingled through different stations we set up around the lab, including: DNA extraction from kiwis and cherries, introduction to pipetting, gel electrophoresis and PCR.
At this event we were fortunate to be able to announce the three upcoming workshops hosted by iGEM Stockholm at the Makerspace lab: “Lab Basics”, “Cultivation” and “Glowing E. coli”.
See what we managed to achieve with these 'Bio Curious' individuals who actively seek to donate their free time to expanding their knowledge in futuristic biology through Makerspace.
Information about the workshops, which ran over three weeks in September 2016, can be found on our Public Engagement and Education page.

Virginia,2016,Team:Virginia#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,".org / Modified: Jorge Mayer. ""Golden Rice Project."" Vitamin A Deficiency. N.p., n.d. Web. 14 Oct. 2016. We cannot expedite research for any application regarding human consumption, but we can address applications for industrial and environmental use. The biggest concern with GEOs is their potential unintended spread into the environment, because the side effects of this spread are unknown. Rather than wait decades to amass enough data to form a responsible analysis, we propose a device that prevents spread from inception.refReference:
By Re-designing/refactoring a Simple Living System We Hope to Learn How to Better Couple (and Decouple) Our Designed Systems from Their Host Environment. ""Synthetic Biology: FAQ."" OpenWetWare RSS. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 Oct. 2016.
“Biological containment” is a new concept in synthetic biology that aims to control the range in which GEOs can live. For example, consider the implications of oil spills. How could we solve this problem using synthetic biology? Microbes exist that carry genes for petroleum digestion. By making a few slight genetic modifications, we can engineer a bacteria strain to digest petroleum into safe compounds at more efficient rates.refReference:
""Meet the Microbes Eating the Gulf Oil Spill [Slide Show]."" Scientific American. N.p., 15 Aug. 2013. Web. 08 Oct. 2016. This seems like a sustainable solution, but how do we prevent this modified bacteria strain from leaking into the external environment after it has done its job? Biological containment, or biocontainment, offers innovative solutions to these problems. By focusing on internal instead of external factors, biocontainment provides a genetic invisible fence for GEOs.
Current biocontainment methods fall under two major categories:
Kill switch mechanisms involve the addition of a toxin/antitoxin “switch” gene that kills cells when it is activated. Consider the oil-eating bacteria described above. Suppose we encode a gene, TOX1, that causes toxin production unless the bacteria is in the presence of petroleum. Now, bacteria cells can function normally until the petroleum is depleted, at which point the cell dies.refReference:
Helen Knight | MIT News Correspondent. """"Kill Switches"" Shut down Engineered Bacteria."" MIT News. N.p., 11 Dec. 2015. Web. 08 Oct. 2016. These methods are easy to implement compared to other forms of biocontainment.

I skim most of igem teams in latest three years and list some teams whose work can show the advantages and innovations of our database. Their works are about some biological reactions related to light, temperature, PH, etc. Read a paper of Nature about synchronized Ecoli clock, try to master the idea of it and list the reactions in it. It will be added into our database.
Zhengda He
Starting completing our database , writing the story for the game . Collected appropriate  project for us to design it into a game . Designing Wiki was the same-time work for me . And I also pay attention in the creative idea of our Logo and uniform . The jamboree is coming , so I must concentrate on what I'm doing . And I will have it done beautifully .

Zhen Wang
Plan: Think about what database modification tool a senior user would like to use. Write full
database that includes the whole oscillator. Read more on XML. Have fun working.
Summary: Not having much fun working, with both sides’ tasks to be done. Full database for
oscillator is done 2010/9/2. I haven’t checked it in detail yet. It is very likely we are
going to change the db structure yet again, good thing though. Learn from libsbml the sbml
modification tool, our db modification should somehow like that. It should focus on adding
and constructing new model. Discuss on UI&input with Liao, writing the new UI draft.

Probiotic Purification
Lactobacillus rhamnosus has natural lead-binding capabilities (Marc). When Lactobacillus binds lead, it keeps the lead from being absorbed by your system, allowing the normally toxic metal to pass harmlessly out of your body by just taking one pill every day. We plan to “force-evolve” Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG to have enhanced lead-binding capabilities as well as the ability to survive in higher concentrations of lead by exposing it to the metal and observing its growth.

The specific settings for electrophoretic runs depend considerably on the apparatus used and its cooling capacity, the length and thickness of the gel, and the acrylamide concentration of the gel. The settings given above can be regarded only as general hints to approach reasonable experimental conditions. For initial runs, it seems advisable to test considerably lower voltage and wattage settings.

Safety Considerations
SAFE LAB WORK
Being a hardware team, we work in a computer laboratory with no chemicals, toxins, or extreme cold temperatures. However, we do have machines and tools. To ensure lab safety, we wear eye protection when working with the drills and soldering irons, and wear gloves when necessary.
In all collaboration experiments involving mammalian cells, no team member handled biological materials.
PROJECT DESIGN
To create our microfluidic chip, we use a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer to bind the control layer and the flow layer. This is a polymeric organosilicon compound that has 'no marked harmful effects on organisms in the environment' according to Ullmann's Encyclopedia. Thus, it is a safe silicone to use for our consumer market, which are biologists in labs. Consequently, the materials and tools we are using will not harm any living organism.
When all of our materials are used up, our materials can be safely dealt with. Our polycarbonate base for the entire setup and microfluidic chip is recyclable, and the rest of the plastics (the 3D printed parts and PDMS layer) can be easily discarded. However, these materials are safe and much cheaper than other technologies that do the same thing."

Video
In August, we issued a short flash video named Synthetic Biology---yesterday, today and tomorrow to promote the knowledge of synthetic biology. This about 3 minute-long video briefly introduces the history, basic principle, standard procedures and potential applications of this modern subject.
The video can be seen here .
Relevant Information:
The term ""synthetic biology"" has a history spanning the twentieth century.[1] The first use was in Stéphane Leducs’s publication of « Théorie physico-chimique de la vie et générations spontanées » (1910) [2] and « La Biologie Synthétique » (1912).[3] In 1974, the Polish geneticist Wacław Szybalski used the term ""synthetic biology"",[4] writing:
Let me now comment on the question ""what next"". Up to now we are working on the descriptive phase of molecular biology. ... But the real challenge will start when we enter the synthetic biology phase of research in our field. We will then devise new control elements and add these new modules to the existing genomes or build up wholly new genomes. This would be a field with the unlimited expansion potential and hardly any limitations to building ""new better control circuits"" and ..... finally other ""synthetic"" organisms, like a ""new better mouse"". ... I am not concerned that we will run out of exciting and novel ideas, ... in the synthetic biology, in general.
When in 1978 the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Arber, Nathans and Smith for the discovery of restriction enzymes, Wacław Szybalski wrote in an editorial comment in the journal Gene:
“The work on restriction nucleases not only permits us easily to construct recombinant DNA molecules and to analyze individual genes, but also has led us into the new era of synthetic biology where not only existing genes are described and analyzed but also new gene arrangements can be constructed and evaluated.”
By now, synthetic biology has developed a standard execution procedure:
BioBrick
Standard biological parts are DNA sequences of defined structure and function; they share a common interface and are designed to be composed and incorporated into living cells such as E. coli to construct new biological systems. BioBrick parts represent an effort to introduce the engineering principles of abstraction and standardization into synthetic biology. The trademarked words BioBrick and BioBricks are correctly used as adjectives (not nouns) and refer to a specific ""brand"" of open source genetic parts as defined"

Project Overview
Background
Fungal pathogens are a major public health threat with significant global effects which, surprisingly, is not being addressed as it should.
Our project!
We want to produce peptides that bind to fungi. See why this matters.
Perspectives
The peptides we generated can be further refined and potentially become diagnosis and therapeutic tools.
Dry lab
Our peptides are small and fit into a scaffold with a known structure. We simulated their three-dimensional structure by homology modelling.
Wet lab
We've been busy at the lab picking peptides and much more. See how we did it.
Gallery
As the old adage goes: pics or it didn't happen.
BioBricks
We want to share what we did so others can develop it further. There are also some tools for working with yeasts. Take a look at our BioBricks.

Three protein bands were observed in the pre-incubated samples (Lane 1 and 5 in Figures 2, 3). The dCas9 proteins were expected to be the highest bands, indicated as “Native protein”. Post incubation of the enzymes with the PCR product binding and gel shifting was observed, with little migration through the gel (Lane 2 and 5 in Figures 2, 3). After inactivation of the enzymes (Lanes 3 and 6 in Figures 2, 3) protein aggregation was observed at the top of the lanes. This indicates that the binding to the PCR was reversed.

The major differences between the results and our theoretical values was the later maximum GFP concentration and the difference between the measured maximum and the theoretical maximum for 9×10-9moles/dm-3 of miRNA. In order to delay the peak in GFP concentration the rate of RNA decay had to be decreased. We also introduced a term for GFP degradation, to account for the peak in fluorescence. We then tried to fit the data by changing the parameters with these ideas in mind. The new values for these parameters were:

Shui Jing
I’m Shui Jing, a sophomore and still don’t have major. All the wonders in physics and biology attract me so much that I really enjoy the process of learning.
In my spare time, I am involved in all kinds of sports, such as basketball, badminton, table tennis swimming and many more.  As a team leader, my major task in this project is arranging the team affairs, I am also responsible for our wiki. I think I have learned a lot from this special experience. learning how to cooperate with team members from different background and different characters and how to shoulder the responsibilities I have to face are not as easy as what you say. The more difficulties I overcome, the more mature I will be.
I hope everyone can have fun in IGEM and enjoy the process.

SDU-Denmark,2014,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour40_-_-_TEXT.html,". In order to test if the protein is expressed, we made a Western blot, taking advance of the FLAG-tag on OneProt. The Western blot shows that the protein is expressed; however, we cannot tell if the protein has been cut by proteases or not.
To test if the expression of the protein affects growth-rate, we measured OD on E. coli expressing OneProt using a wild-type as control. The growth curve illustrates that the growth-rate of the cell expressing OneProt isn't affected much compared to that of the wild-type.
Even though we now know that OneProt is expressed and that E. coli continues to grow, we want to make sure that the protein is not toxic upon digestion. In order for us to do so, we fed Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) with E. coli K12 MG1655 containing an empty vector and a vector expressing OneProt on separate plates. To stress C. elegans, and thereby making it more sensitive, we used heat chock assay and stressed the organisms even more after 5 hours. The results are clear: after 7 hours of heat-shock assay, all C.elegans were alive, and thus we conclude that the OneProt has no toxic effects.
Figure 3: C.elegans fed with E. coli K12 MG1655 expressing OneProt.
Controlling the Tet promoter
Figure 5: Plate containing 200 ng/mL doxycycline plated with E. coli WT and E. coli expressing GFP controlled by a constitutive promoter, pTet-TeR(+LVA) and pTet-TetR(no LVA).
Figure 4: Plate containing 0 ng/mL doxycycline plated with E. coli WT and E. coli expressing GFP controlled by a constitutive promoter, pTet-TeR(+LVA) and pTet-TetR(no LVA). In order for us to be able to control the amount of OneProt produced, we need a promoter that can be controlled. For this, we put OneProt under expressional control by pTet. Besides investigating the controllable expression, we also investigated the influence of the LVA tag on TetR. We proved that the inhibition of pTet by TetR is correlated with the concentration of inducer – increasing amounts of inducer means decreasing levels of inhibition of pTet. Comparing the expression by pTet controlled by TetR with and without LVA tag shows that there is a higher expression upon induction, using TetR with LVA than using TetR without"
