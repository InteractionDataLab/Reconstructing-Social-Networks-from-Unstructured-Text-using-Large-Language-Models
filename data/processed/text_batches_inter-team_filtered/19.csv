OUTREACH KITS
Part of our Outreach project involved a collaboration project with the UChicago and Illionois iGEM teams.  The UChicago team found us through our blog “Synthetic Blogology” and invited us to work with them on the creation of an Ethics ‘Kit’. We wanted it to contain a variety of outreach materials that other teams would use as a sort of jump off point for their own outreach initiatives.
We wanted to create a kit that could be used by other iGEM teams in the future.  E wanted it to contain a variety of outreach materials that other teams would use as a sort of jump off point for their own outreach initiatives.
We were inspired by the Registry of Parts to create an interactive bioethics “kit.” Users can choose from a series of slides on various topics related to genetic engineering.  Like the Registry, we’ve included background information for each slide, including notes for the speaker and a page for users to add their own experience.  We hope that future teams will use these slides as templates and reference material for their own presentations, whether to their own institutions, neighboring schools, or the general public. By allowing other groups to update and comment on slides we hope to create a communal forum for bioethical discussion. Our goal is not to come to single consensus on bioethics education, but to provide an opportunity for every voice to be heard.

Purdue,2013,Team:Purdue#Human Practices#Overview and Project Impact_-_-_TEXT.html," or how we can educate the public so that they will be more receptive to our innovations.
Outreach to High School
Overview
“New Biology” is the term that has been coined for the revolution of the biological sciences that is emerging. This revolution includes a biological field that is incorporating collaboration with other fields including chemistry, physics, engineering, statistics, and computer science. We, as synthetic biologists, have seen this trend for years now. Synthetic biology couples engineering with the basics of biology and genetics. Other similar fields have also started to emerge such as systems biology. In an effort to help with the transition of younger students to accepting this new idea of biology, we worked with high school AP biology teachers in ways to incorporate modeling in the class room. Through this effort we hope to encourage the next generation of scientists to appreciate the interdisciplinary aspects of biology.
Impact
As the next generation of students advance through high school and college, we are hoping to see a group of biologists focusing more on the applications of biology research as well as interdisciplinary research collaboration. iGEM leads the way with this idea; allowing for undergraduate students to work in groups on projects that have potentially applications that will benefit the lives of people everywhere. It is important to continue to educate high school students to help them grow to be successful in these up and coming fields.
Biomaker Bench
Overview
The Biomaker Bench is a non-profit opportunity established to promote innovative education and discovery. The organization’s efforts are focused within the Indianapolis metropolitan area and other life-science hubs (ex: Warsaw, IN) to coordinate, facilitate and provide tailored and low-cost science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) K-12 outreach while promoting life-science based entrepreneurship and innovation. Indiana has been repeatedly ranked a top-five national setting for Life Science Sectors. Innovative community engagement is needed to maximize the potential of Indiana’s students, workforce, citizens, corporations and academic institutions.
Impact
We will organize and provide innovative outreach efforts in STEM education for Indiana k-12 students by collaborating with industry, academia and citizen scientist . Through these initiatives we hope to educate and equip communities with the milieu and resources needed to develop life science based discoveries in order to enrich the lives of citizens as scientists.
Girl Scout Biotechnology Badge
Overview
Our Girls Scouts initiative began as a conversation between Rebecca Shini, a Greenfield high school teacher, and Tamara Payton, the Central Indiana membership development manager. In their conversation both parties expressed a concern for incorporating Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) into the Girl Scouts curriculum based on the then recent “Generation STEM Report” released by the Girl Scouts"

NTNU Modelling Collaboration
After we came up with a model of DNA Origami arms and the sequences for them and how they would bond we wanted to model the probability of the E.coli arms forming fully and how this probability would change as length of the arms increased. We came up with a basic model but thought it would be beneficial if we sought outside help with the mathematics.
We got in contact with NTNU to ask for assistance and they came back with a stochastic method for calculating said probabilities. After discussing the problem further we came up with various equations such as S_i= Σ_j (K_i,j /  Σ_j K_i,j ) log K_i,j / E_j[K_i,j], where S is how well a zinc finger binds to an arm and P_i = S_i / W (S_i) where P is the probability of formation for that zinc finger arm.

Oxford Collaboration
One part of our project was create a DNA origami glue using a biobrick part from the distributed kit, specifically part BBa_K314110. Once we had designed it, we decided to collaborate with Oxford's iGEM team to help get it made.
Oxford's team sped up he production of our DNA origami by conducting a PCR using primers we had designed and sent to them to create seven PCR products, six of which would be directly used to create the DNA origami.
Once we received the PCR products, we combined and annealed them to form DNA origami structures, which could then be viewed under an electron micrograph.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#OurSensor#Reporter#BetaLactamase_-_-_TEXT.html,", we performed a pH assay using benzylpenicillin as our substrate to demonstrate that our fusion TALE A - β-lactamase protein can act as a reporter. β-lactamase hydrolyzes benzylpenicillin to penicillinoic acid, which changes the pH of the solution from alkaline to acidic. We tested it out with two separate pH indicators, phenol red and bromothymol blue, and we were able to show two different colourimetric outputs. We were able to show successful reporter acitivy with both indicators.
We were able to see a colour change due to the presence of phenol red, a pH indicator with a transition pH of 6.8-8.2, turning red at lower pH.  This pH change causes the phenol red to change from red to yellow. Our negative controls, to which benzylpenicillin was not added, remained red. We can also see the colour change coincides with the amount of purified TALE A-β-lactamase present in each sample (Figure 10).
Figure 10. Benzylpenicillin assay. On the top, the wells only had TALE A -linker-β-lactamase ( BBa_K1189031 ). Benzylpenicillin was added and after a 10-minute incubation at room temperature, we were able to observe a colour output from red to yellow (bottom row) while the control wells remained red.
Additionally, we have demonstrated the same pH change of benzylpenicillin to penicillinoic acid by the TALE A β-lactamase fusion ( BBa_K1189031 )  with bromothymol blue. The pH change causes the bromothymol blue to change in colour from blue to yellow as it gets more acidic (Figure 11 & 12).  In the presence of TALE A β-lactamase fusion we see the colour change to yellow whereas the negatives not containing TALE A β-lactamase fusion remains blue (Figure 11). We did a kinetic analysis at 616 nm every 30 seconds and as the blue colour disappears, the absorbance at 616 nm decreases (Figure 12). Therefore, the lower the decrease the better the TALE A β-lactamase fusion reporter activity. Our kinetic activity shows that the biggest decrease is in our positive recombinant β-lactamase followed by the TALE A β-lactamase fusion at 10 micrograms. This decrease is lessened as we decrease the amount of T"

The team appreciated our recommendation and focused their lab work more on the COD. We were especially curious how they would solve the inclusion body problem and many other issues we had encountered the year prior.
It was a great pleasure to collaborate with iGEM Stuttgart and we hope we were able to help them with their project.
iGEM Marburg
This year, the iGEM team of Marburg tries to establish the organism Vibrio natriegens as a new biological chassis for the iGEM community. They reached out to various other teams in an effort to standardize V. natriegens for labs all around the world.
In context of standardization of V. natriegens we repeated the InterLab study for iGEM Marburg with V. natriegens as chassis.
Here, cultures of the transformed V. natriegens showed decreased growth rates upon induction of protein synthesis but no fluorescence could be detected. Decreased growth rates indicate metabolic stress probably caused by protein synthesis. However, since no fluorescence could be detected no matured functional fluorogenic protein were built.
Yet, the organism shows many interesting features. We were especially fascinated by their incredibly fast growth rate of V. natriegens revealing a great opportunity for scientists to save time and work more efficiently.
It was a pleasure to work with this novel organism and share our obtained data. We were thankful for the opportunity to try out a new powerful organism and we are very interested in implementing V. natriegens in our everyday laboratory life.
iGEM NCHU Taichung
Yu-Hsuan from the iGEM team NCHU Taichung contacted us in June. She was in Darmstadt for a semester abroad. For her team it is the first year participating in the iGEM competition. Thus, we arranged a meeting to exchange project ideas and share our experiences over the years. Since our team was inspired to restructure after visiting iGEM Stockholm last year, we wanted to pass on our experiences on how to organize a team, how to choose a project and lots of other important structures they should be aware of.
During Yu-Hsuan’s visit we talked about how we run our laboratory and which positions we have, e.g. our lab leader, who mainly organizes the lab and takes care of the orders, and our lab group leaders. The lab group leaders in turn are the ones who organize four to five members and work together"

We then sat down with members of the Bart lab to speak with them about their research with resistance genes. The students we spoke with studied cassava bacterial blight and cassava mosaic virus. They discussed the resistance genes and plant-effector interactions they studied, as well as interactions between the resistance genes we studied In addition, they explained how genomes are screened to discover new resistance genes. We also discussed disease management and methods of durable resistance in cassava and compared this to management of wheat rust fungi.
Pfizer
On June 21st, our team was able to tour Pfizer’s facility to learn about their synthetic drug manufacturing process. Many of their drug compounds are synthesized using E. coli and yeast and are produced in large quantities. To ensure top quality, they conduct their drug manufacturing in a separate building with increased safety measures. The building contains numerous bioreactors of various sizes for different stages of production.
We visited numerous labs, all working with synthetic biology and were able to see the incredibly large amount of bioreactors being used, as well as the microbioreactors that were a fraction of the size of traditional ones. A couple scientists in each lab explained to us the work they were doing from R&D to testing the synthesized compounds to material purification.
Meeting with Dr. Kunkel
Several of our team members met with Dr. Kunkel, who researches virulence in the model plant-pathogen system of Arabidopsis thaliana and Pseudomonas syringae at Washington University. During the meeting, she spoke about the methods of plant-pathogen interaction in A. thailiana and P. syringae, and compared them to interactions that occur between wheat and wheat rust fungi. She gave the example of an effector AvrRpt2, a protease that is injected into cells by type three secretion system, which interferes with the plant’s production of and response to auxin, a plant hormone and does not necessarily cause a hypersensitive response. She also discussed how new effectors are found and methods of interaction are investigated. While P. syringae is a weak pathogen that is rarely an agricultural issue, this system is a very good model for more complex systems that allows other researchers to understand what patterns to look for in more complicated systems.
Meeting with Dr. Shah
Our team met with Dr. Shah, a researcher at the Danforth Plant Sciences Center who studies plant defensin proteins, another method of innate plant resistance to fungal pathogens."

70% Ethanol Protocol (starter pack)
Introduction
Ethanol is a commonly used antiseptic in the lab environment. It has the highest effective concentration at 70% compared to a stronger solution. This occurs due to alcohol’s ability to coagulate protein on contact. A higher concentration of ethanol inflicts a very rapid coagulation of protein in the cell wall or membrane of target organism, effectively blocking further penetration of the organism and its subsequent neutralization. Because of this, a more diluted 70% concentration is used for optimal penetration.
Safety precautions
SDS (safety data sheet): Refer to the SDS sheets for all listed materials before entering the lab. Be prepared to answer any questions regarding th3e information on these sheets.
PPE (Personal protective equipment): Proper lab attire should be worn throughout the experiment: This means that upon entering the lab you should be wearing long pants and close-toed shoes. Contact lenses should not be worn. Furthermore, a lab coat, goggles, and gloves should be worn at all times, and long hair should be tied back.
Hazards: Highly flammable, irritant
Materials
Reagents
95% ethanol
Distilled water
Equipment
Wash bottle
Graduated cylinder
Procedure
This protocol results in 200mL of stock solution.
Obtain a graduated cylinder with 42.1mL dH2O (distilled water).
Obtain a graduated cylinder with 157.9mL ethanol.
Transfer 42.1mL dH2O into a wash bottle.
Transfer 157.9mL ethanol into the wash bottle, minimizing any splashing of the solution.
Close the wash bottle and swirl it in circular motion to mix
Leaving the lab

-------During the University of Calgary Campus Fair, we held three main activities:  making “biosaurs,” a pipetting competition, and guessing the number of tube caps in a bag. The “biosaurs” were crafted from sheets of foam, glitter, glue, and coloured pens and the kids seemed to be fascinated by the idea of bringing their bacteria to life by using different types of crafts.
-------For the pipetting competition, we provided kids with plastic pipettes, tubes, coloured water and pseudo-lab gear and had them compete by trying to fill the most tubes with water using pipettes. We were incredibly surprised at the number of kids wanting to participate in this competition and as such, we held multiple competitions to accommodate everyone. Everyone participating in the competition received some type of prize, including kind donations from one of our sponsors Alberta Ingenuity. After the competition, the pipettes and coloured water were left out so the"

Zhuoyi Yang (Joyce):
I’m Zhuoyi Yang from IB program, and the team leader of this year’s team. I was also a team                         member                         in last year’s team and I fell in love with the iGEM adventure. In this year, I organised the team member selection and gave training to the new iGEMer during winter holiday. I guided team members                         to                         brainstorm projects and separated them to groups to research more deeply on each module. To                         give                         better instruction to our team, I invited Cheng Li from Peking University as our instructor,                         and                         was in charge of communicating between teachers and the team. I planned for the summer holiday                         experiment as well as human practice and tried my best to borrow necessary equipments from some                         labs. Moreover, I distributed tasks to team members in presentation preparation and wiki writing                         process. It is a great pleasure to work with my team mates and I hope to be a lifelong                         iGEMer.

I’m Charles, a team member of 2018 BNDS China. I am in Grade 12 AP program. I advocated with my                         teammates a school fund for scientific research; I worked with the experiment group at the                         different labs to learn techniques of synthesis and analysis; I also designed the pamphlets for                         the                         human practice portion of our project.

Freiburg,2015,Team:Freiburg#Labjournals#irif_-_-_TEXT.html,". Continued measuring but saw no signal in iRIf, but stamp was also only hard to see in plate reader.
Slide 121 (Logo) was measured. Strep-Cy5 with 50ug/ml concentration. Large air bubbles came into system after blocking step, but continued measuring. iRIf signal was visible. Yet, still bad quality due to high noise of the picture and inhomogenous illumination. Plate reader showed very intense and well shaped logo → For experiments to just show our logo we should use high concentrations of Strep-Cy5/antibodies.
Spotting GFP on APTES/PDITC and GOPTS
02.06.2015: SurChem prepared two slides (one GOPTS, one APTES/PDITC) and spotted 0,5 µl spots (without PDMS spotting aid): GFP-stock (1,67 mg/ml), GFP (1:500), GFP (1:1000), 2x bBSA 2µM
The new slides were used and thus have no number yet. Surface chemistry of the GOTPS slide might be on the wrong side. iRIf measurement with 5 µg/ml anti-GFP and 5 µg/ml Strep-Cy5. Measurement was performed on both machines in parallel.  Both problems with both new slides, water escaped from the flwo cell - it might be possible that the pdms flow chambers don't stick as well to the new slides or the new surface chemistry
Light in the GOPTS measurement was overexposed.StrepCy5 was not flown into the chamber due to an error in typing the correct eppendorf position in the excel sheet.  Anti-GFP spots might be visibile, but cant be safely confirmed
APTES/PDITC might either spotted or measured the wrong side. Strepcy5 was not observed in fluorescence, therefor the huge iRIf files were not analyzed jet.
Spotting GFP (with PDMS blocked slides)
31.05.2015: Slides 24 & 314; Plasma-activated; Spotted with 15µl (50µl/ml gfp; 40µl/ml bBSA) and PDMS spotting-aid. Incubated for 30 min, then blocked with BSA+PDMS for 30 min; After blocking, the slides were put in contact with the back-side of a PDMS flow cell to avoid problems with hydrophobicity

Lab-Reports + Project Plans
(Teamleader)
place project plans in the dropbox
Coumaryl
Cloning should be done next monday
One enzyme will be synthesized
Expression will be done in E. coli to test functionality, yeast is slower
Characterization in yeast should be done asap
Expression in possible problems in E. coli due to disulphide bridges
Quickchanges will be done later, focus is on results
Substrates for essays could be available at Schwab lab
Purification manual in the pYES2 kit / ask Doreen
Characterization and quickchanges should be done in parallel as purification can easily take over 2 weeks
Order primers! (Ingmar will do it)
Limonene
2 different enzymes
BioBrick: pcr done (add strep tag / RFC25 + removal of rbs)
ligation should start on monday
Schwab: miniprep did not work
ligation should start mid next week
Charactisation with gas-chromatographics (-> Stefan Gilch)/strep tag
Constitutive Promoters
BioBricks have some errors -> genome PCR is necessary
Expression will be done in BioBrick vector
pYES2 could be used as iGEM compatible shuttle vector without promoter, but removal of promoter + terminator is necessary
bad/none sequencing does not necessarily mean the brick will not work
primers will be orderded until Friday
primers need to be blasted against the whole genome
promoters should be ready in 2 weeks
Light-Inducible Promoter
Limiting factors: ordering of BioBricks + iGEM compatibility of pYES2
Bricks should arrive soon
will need constitutive promoters later on
for purification of phycocyanobilin some algae are needed
assembly should be done two weeks after arrival of all necessary parts
Thaumatin
Primers were not ordered due to miscommunications
eventuality not bad since synthesizing the gene makes more sense than ordering
this group can help other groups (or test mass-spectrometrics + brewing tests)
Jonas is missing - is he still in the team?
Caffeine
Promoters can be reduced in length but become more more ineffective
Annotation is bad
Synthesizing 9k bp takes very long and will be very expensive
Prof. Skerra himself is possibly against the long sequence
Plan is to synthesize all parts separately
clone separately/together
second AS after start codon is hard to be identified in 3D"

Biofilms
Objective: To clean biofilms and to make new ones to continue testing.
Procedure:
Cleaning Old Biofilms
August 25th biofilms were cleaned using 3.2 mL of Mr. Clean, GreenWorks Cleaner, and Lysol in 2 35x10 mm Petri dishes each. Water was put into a seventh Petri dish of the same size to be used as a control. The cleaning solutions were left on for 15 minutes and then were rinsed.
The Petri dishes were then put into the refrigerator for 24 hours at 4˚C.
Making New Biofilms
New biofilms were made by putting 21 mL of total volume of LB media, RFP culture, and KAN in a 50 mL falcon tube. The RFP culture was added in a 1/100th dilution and the KAN was added in a 1/1000th dilution. 3 mL of this solution was then pipetted into seven 35x10 mm Petri dishes.
These were put in the incubator for 24 hours at 37˚C.

In a certain limit, the quantity of osmotic pressure increase and K+ production is proportional: ∆n=k∆P.
We use the outflow rate v to express cells’ impermeability. In this phase v=dn/dt.
While if the osmotic pressure is higher than this range, cells will occur the regulatory mechanisms mentioned above. We can use Nernst equation to measure the concentration of K+ indirectly. While it is intervened by compatibility regulation mechanism, there is no linearity connection. Method of variation of constant is ∆n=k(x)∆P."

Mating Factor α
Mating factor α (MFα) is one of the mating pheromones that yeast produce. When a cell with the a-mating type detects MFα in its environment, it will halt its cell cycle and attempt to mate by budding a schmoo in the direction of the mating factor. Simply having the mating factor in the media is enough to cause cellular response, and this same response should be possible if another organism were displaying the factor on its surface, as with the ice nucleation protein on E. coli. Bardwell L (2004) A walk-through of yeast mating pheromone response pathway. Peptides 25: 1465-1476
Lactate-Sensitive Promoter
A number of organisms have promoters that are sensitive to lactate in their environment.  By using such a promoter, an organism can turn on specific genes when in the presence of lactate, usually those involved in its breakdown and metabolism.  However, by placing a different gene after this promoter, it is possible to have it expressed only when the cells are exposed to lactate in their environment.  It is also important to note that many pathways that depend on the presence of lactate are inhibited in the presence of glucose, since it has significantly more stored energy than lactate or other partially broken down sugars.  This made it important to find a promoter that would still function even in the presence of glucose. Lodi T, Goffrini P, Bolondi I, and Ferrero I (1998) Transcriptional regulation of the KlDLD gene, encoding the mitochondrial enzyme D-lactate ferricytochrome c oxidoreductase in Kluyveromyces lactis: effect of Klhap2 and fog mutations. Curr Genet 34, 12-20
His3 Protein
As with the His3 protein used in yeast, it is possible to use a similar approach when selecting for E. coli. E. coli has a gene, hisB, that codes for an analog of His3, performing the same function as the yeast protein. By using a strain that is a mutant for hisB, one can select for transformed colonies by placing them on media lacking histadine. If this gene is produced via an inducible pathway, it would require the organism to be receiving that stimulus in order to live on media lacking histadine. Saccharomyces Genome Database. (1999).

KIT-Kyoto,2011,Team:KIT-Kyoto#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"Q. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
A. We have 3 ideas.
1. To establish ""Best Safety"" Prize. This prize awards the team which shows best effort of biosafety-for example, showing or doing new approach of biosafty, and so on.
2. To add a new requirement to earn a Silver Medal; Join local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution. If there is not such group, make biosafty group and join.
3．To deal with emergency, we will make safety manuals for experiments.
Lecture class about experiments of genetically-engineering
We took Lecture class about experiments of genetically-engineering because we conduct experiments of genetically-engineering. We learned its history and registration, and challenge our project this year.

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."

Why ABCD?
These computational tools (detailed listed in figure below, Figure reproduced from The second wave of synthetic biology: from modules to systems ) are designed to facilitate the scientists in wet lab in purpose of saving time and cost. On the other hand, standardization components provide a powerful tool for engineering biological systems in lab even in future industrial factories. In other words, all the current efforts are put to assist the scientists and could never replace the intelligence of human beings who are the leading roles in designing experiments and mathematical models.
Is it possible to move further to the steps of intelligence? Is it possible to generate the design protocol and list feasible biobricks? Is it possible to make design of biological networks a funny game even for laymen who know little about synthetic biology? Even not that further, is it possible to suggest different topologies of network that can achieve desired functions? Is it possible to tune an existing network to perform new functions? Is it possible to make a biological network more robust against uncertainties?
Another unavoidable challenge is to fill the gap between dry design and wet experiment. Is it possible to guarantee our design solution biologically significant? Is it possible to propose several “strong” examples to illustrate availability and efficiency of our idea?
Here, we try our best to challenge these seemingly impossibilities and make them possible. We hope our software could be cradle where amazing happens. We don't mean we are on the summit of pyramid of computational synthetic biology and it’s of little significance to say whose work is more important or not. Instead, a vast of collaborations are needed among computational scientists, biologists and engineers. As we described in our flowcharts, ABCs of ABCD, relevant tools are strongly needed to cope with difficulties we meet separately.

Conclusion: M9 Supplemented media is much more effective at getting the MG1655 phaCAB cells to grow than M9 minimal. Glucose was the best growth substrate, followed by acetoacetate and 3HB last.
phaCAB with novel promoter
Native promoter in phaCAB growth in sole carbon sources under M9S. MG1655 E. coli transformed with native phaCAB compared to empty vector for sole carbon sources. The trends observed show that there is not much difference between EV and phaCAB for glucose (p = 0.6237), acetoacetate (p = 0.8781) and 3HB (p = 0.9901). ANOVA analysis concluded that  null hypothesis, ""The sole carbon sources tested have no effect on growth"" must be rejected (F 5,12 = 6.938, p < 0.0029). This shows that there is a difference between individual carbon sources. Data points show final time point after 6h growth for each concentration. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6h. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
Hybrid promoter in phaCAB growth in sole carbon sources under M9S. MG1655 E. coli transformed with native phaCAB compared to empty vector for sole carbon sources. The trends observed show that there are differences between EV and phaCAB for glucose (p = 0.9715), acetoacetate (p = 0.0176) and 3HB (p = 0.8276). Indeed, hybrid phaCAB grows exceptionally well on acetoacetate, even at low concentrations compared to empty vector which only grows well at 100 mM 3HB. ANOVA analysis concluded that  null hypothesis, ""The sole carbon sources tested have no effect on growth"" must be rejected (F 5,12 = 14.13, p < 0.0001). This shows that there is a difference between individual carbon sources. Data points show final time point after 6h growth for each concentration. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6h.

Bio 375 - Biological Design and Innovation I
Our iGEM team created a course through the university called Biological Design and Innovation I to teach student about synthetic biology. We had two main goals when we created the course: (1) help students understand theory and concepts behind procedures that we use in iGEM research and (2) develop synthetic biology research project proposals. The course was offered for the first time in Spring 2011. We broke up into groups and developed five synthetic biology research proposals: Glucose Sensor, Honeybee Project, Biofilms Project, Biofuel Production in Algae, and the Effect of Education on Synthetic Biology. From these projects, we decided to pursue the Effect of Education on Synthetic Biology as a human practices project and the Glucose Sensor as our main project.
Undergraduate Research Conference
In Spring 2011, different team members from our team presented project proposals that they developed in our Bio 375 course. We presented the Glucose Sensor Project , the Honeybee Project , and the Effect of Education on Synthetic Biology . The Honeybee project won first place in the Research Proposal category. The Effect of Education on Synthetic Biology project was approved for funding through a competitive OURE (Opportunities for Undergraduate Research Experience) Fellows program.
Participating in the Undergraduate Research Conference was not only beneficial to our team's students, but also to the organization as a whole due to the fact that hundreds of people attend this conference and were exposed to our research efforts.

TAS_Taipei,2016,Team:TAS Taipei#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," Our goal is to find the equivalent crystallin damage that leads to a LOCS 2.5 cataract, in order to know how much GSR to prevent this amount of crystallin damage in Model 2.
LOCS to Absorbance: Literature Data
Numerous studies show how absorbance measurements can be converted to the LOC scale that physicians use. With the results of Chylack, we construct the first two columns in Table 1 (Chylack 1993).
Absorbance Equivalence to Crystallin Damage: Experimental Data
We use experimental measurements from our team’s Cataract Lens Model ( Link ). They induced an amount of crystallin damage, and measured the resulting absorbance.                                      The experimental results are listed in Table A, and Figure 4.A, we calculate the equivalent crystallin damage of each LOCS rating and absorbance, and create the third column of Table 1.
Table 1: Results of Model 1 – Equivalent values for LOCS, Absorbance, and Crystallin Damage. First two columns come from Chylack, the third column uses data from our team's Lens Model experiment (see collapsible)

Conclusion
To guarantee that surgery is not needed for 50 years, we need to limit crystallin damage to 0.9883 units. If crystallin damage goes above this threshold, then surgery is needed. This is the crystallin damage threshold for a LOCS 2.5 cataract.
Figure 4.1: Cataract Threshold. The results show that if we must limit crystallin damage to below 0.9883 units, so surgery is not needed.

The first one is the customized thermo-tolerance system used to improve E.coli’s heat resistant ability and the other is the intelligent quorum regulating system used for controlling the cell density in an appropriate degree. Moreover, the engine begin to work only when it is properly to do so, ensuring the productive efficiency.
The chassis host with I’MHeRE used in the industry may make the fermentation process less depend on the cooling system and decrease the pollutant emission. On the other hand, cells can live as comfortable as in their optimum temperature, because we extend the because we extend the range of their optimum living temperature and make them live in the optimizing density. Owing to this, the high activity of the enzymes in cell could be kept in a wide range of temperature and the efficiency of microbial metabolism can be improved.

Different strength promoters control different expression level of different heat shock proteins (HSPs) at different temperature to achieve the goal of Hierarchy Heat-resistant.
Figure 3: Hierarchy Heat-resistant.
Figure 4:Overexpression of HSP will saddle the cell growth
We found that overexpressing a protein may affect the growth of the host to a certain degree. With the help of RNA thermometers, they can not only be expressed in a hierarchy way, but decrease the burden of overexpressing HSPs at low temperature. That is the answer why we use RNA thermometers.
Bacteria use complex strategies to control gene expression in response to ambient temperature changing. Many genes encoding heat shock proteins and virulence factors are regulated by temperature sensing RNA sequences, known as RNA thermometers (RNATs), which are located in the 5’untranslated region of the mRNA folding into secondary structure that shed RBS to influence translational efficiency in low temperature. But when temperature is increased to a certain temperature, the RNATS release RBS and the blocked genes express.
Most of gene expression responding to temperature shock measure not the temperature itself but the consequences of temperature-induced damage. Those reaction are effected by temperature indirectly. However, RNA thermometers response to temperature immediately, precisely, and controllably. So using RNA thermometers to control our heat shock proteins expression is a good choice. The RNA thermometers can be available included two types, the natural RNATS and the synthetic RNATS.

Conference in NCTU
     Towards the end of July we co-hosted a small iGEM meetup with Mingdao High School. Along with National Tsing Hua University, all three teams presented their projects. This was our second opportunity to share our ideas with other iGEM teams and receive criticism. The improvements we’d made after our first meetup in Wuhan made our project more understandable this time; of course, we were asked new questions that we’d yet to consider, such as how long our proteins would last in the environment. We found that the smaller scale of this meetup allowed for longer and more intimate discussions and really helped us identify some issues with our project. We were very lucky that Mingdao approached us with this amazing chance at improvement, and hope the other two schools benefitted as much as we did!

Therefore we plan an experiment (one to two weeks), where we reproduce the results of the paper [<bib id=""pmid23377039""/>]. After mixing the Acidovorax complex medium (ACM) and adding 4g Chelex-100 resin / 1L ACM  we prepare 25 agarplates (0,5 L ) and two media for liquid culture (1L +0,5L). The second day is about the resuspending of the strain D. acidovorans in 5 ml [recepy in methods] and letting it grow over night. The next day 5 agarplates are inoculated with D. Acidovorans by fractional streak and 5 agarplates with streak over half of the plate. In addition to these 10 agarplates, also the two flasks with the liquid media are inoculated with the strain. The rest of the resuspended cells is stored in a glycerol stock. After 3 days of culture growth (shaking at"

Survey
Public opinion
We carried out a survey of 5 questions to probe the public opinion about synthetic biology. To create sample variation, we interviewed 45 people from different age groups and backgrounds. In general, most of the interviewees didn't object against this new domain in science. Although only few of them could correctly define ""synthetic biology"", they agree that researchers must be able to explore the field. Nevertheless, they insist on the necessity of a controlling system which insures safety during the research process. Before the bacteria are used outside of a lab, the risks should be minimized.
We asked the subjects what type of research in synthetic biology should be allowed. Most people have no problem with bacteria in their environment designed to solve major issues in human life. They insist that the synthetic bacteria must change the users' quality of life and it must be financially manageable for everyone. Some interviewed persons agree to the exploration of synthetic biology, but are hesitant to allow the bacteria outside of the laboratory or the closed environment of an industrial facility. Although there are still a few people who object against research, most of the interviewees are in favour of further study. Provided that a socially relevant goal is pursued and not just a luxury issue.
The last question of the survey asked the respondent if their opinion about synthetic biology could be more negative because they were not familiar with the subject. Most people agreed that 'not knowing' influences their opinion. From the survey it became clear that the majority of the interviewees miss an independent communication about the matter in a comprehensible language. The finding of such an independent and neutral organ to"

Uppsala,2016,Team:Uppsala#Project#UnaG_-_-_TEXT.html," in a vertebrate species, giving it a range of biochemical properties that differs from proteins found in the original FP family - one of the most astounding ones being that fluorescence occurs only when a ligand binds non-covalently to the protein, namely bilirubin. (I)
Structure of UnaG
UnaG is a fatty acid-binding protein (FABP). These proteins are cytosolic and exist in most vertebrates and invertebrates. They contribute to the transport of lipophilic compounds, often fatty acids. Although it is still rather evasive in which ways FABPs function in cells, some of these proteins appear to play roles in cellular anabolism. Wild-type UnaG is 139 amino acids long and has a molecular weight of 15.6 kDa. UnaG is a ß barrel structure containing eleven ß strands - a typical quality for FABPs. Instead of binding a fatty acid molecule, the ligand of UnaG is bilirubin, which binds non-covalently to the center of this ß barrel. Bilirubin exists in all vertebrates and is a metabolite of the heme group in hemoglobin. Bilirubin can only bind to UnaG in its unconjugated (4Z,15Z) form, meaning that wild-type UnaG shows high specificity to this particular molecule. In fact, BR is the actual fluorophore of UnaG. When BR binds to the cavity of the protein, it emits green light at 527 nm. Holo-UnaG has maximum absorption at 498 (i.e. blue light) nm. UnaG does not need molecular oxygen in order to fluoresce, making it suitable for research executed under anaerobic conditions where FPs are not functional. According to Akiko Kumagai and his team, the quantum yield of holo-UnaG is 0.51 and it is stable in a pH ranging from 4 to 11 (I). GFPs are usually stable in a pH range from 6-10, but this varies depending on which mutant is used. (II)

Brasil-USP,2015,Team:Brasil-USP#Notebook#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," worked with a simplified Hok-Sok mechanism - a highly studied kill switch mechanism that is effective on most gram-negative bacteria, and even in some gram-positive microorganisms.  This is how it works: the bacterial culture medium will contain rhamnose, activating the left part of our designed DNA circuit (Figure 1). This will lead to the production of tetR, which inhibits the formation of hokD. If the bacteria is released from the bioreactor, it will be in an environment without rhamnose, and won't produce tetR - leading to the production of HokD, a protein that causes cell membrane depolarization, killing the microorganism. The mechanism is expected to kill the cells almost immediately, with only a fraction of 1.4 x 10-4 the cells surviving after 90 minutes4.Therefore, the system is efficient for containing the microorganism spreading and its modified DNA transmission.
Figure 1. DNA circuit proposed by our team.
    Although the simplified Hok-Sok kill switch mechanism proposed by our team allows, with low energy cost, the efficient and rapid death of the cells after leaving the bioreactor, it doesn’t grant that cells inside the bioreactor which didn’t inherit the developed DNA circuit die. This may be a problem to the process efficiency, as cells that aren’t developing the desired processes will be competing for nutrients with the ones that contain the DNA circuit. For the proposed project, these contaminations will be controlled using antibiotics. As the bacteria desired to survive will contain a plasmid with antibiotic resistance, it won’t die - and all of the other bacteria will.
    As the continuum use of antibiotics can lead to resistant bacteria and has been avoided by scientific community5, our team proposes a circuit that would be able to control these problems. It will not be constructed due to time issues, but it is idealized here (Figure 2).
Figure 2. DNA circuit proposed by our team, with optimization.
The circuits includes sok, a RNA antitoxin, under the rhamnose promoter; tetR is removed from the circuit. Therefore, it will be produced constantly while the cell is inside the bioreactor.
The hok system promoter is changed to a constitutive one - so it will also be produced constantly. In order for it not to be produced in higher concentrations than necessary, which can lead to the risk of it not being completely inhibited by sok, we have inserted only one hok sequence in this design.
While the cells contain the DNA circuit and are inside the bioreactor,"
UC_San_Diego,2018,Team:UC San Diego#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the first biopsy may result in inconclusive diagnosis, and attempting a second biopsy may present risks.
Takeaway:
At this point, our team was able to see that the gold standard or “status quo” was clearly not enough in the cancer diagnostics space. There was an issue of invasiveness, price point, and overall accuracy.
Poorya Sabounchi, internal affiliate with Illumina Accelerator
Dr. Cashin currently serves as the head of the Illumina Accelerator and Dr. Sabounchi is a startup advocate. Dr. Sabounchi helped answer some of our key questions about next-generation sequencing technology . In addition to describing the mechanisms of NGS, he also talked about some of the key diagnostic metrics that Illumina and GRAIL, a liquid biopsy startup by Illumina, are currently focusing on. He explained that NGS uses deep sequencing runs in order to identify mutations, perform whole-genome sequencing, and believes that they can identify mutations at a better rate than existing practices.  He also walked us through some of the companies in the Illumina accelerator and how they were able to harness the power of NGS for improving genomics.
Takeaway:
Our conversation with Dr. Sabounchi helped us understand the promise of next-generation sequencing. Although NGS could resolve the price point, it did not address one of the key patient concerns, namely the invasiveness. We felt that we could somehow engineer the CRISPR protein to detect mutations and then give us a readout that we could quantify.
Pranav Singh, Bioinformatics Team, GRAIL
After speaking with the Illumina Accelerator, we felt that it would be important to understand some of the current alternatives. We reached out to some members of the bioinformatics team at GRAIL to get a better sense of what they do. They first introduced the idea of liquid biopsy, which is given to the collective procedures that amount to non-invasive cancer detection techniques . We learned that the inherent tumor heterogeneity and the ability of cancer genomes to evolve are not properly captured by tissue specimens. GRAIL instead looks at cell-free DNA that is shed by cells and is trying to develop highly accurate. The team also took some time to explain their day to day operations and explained that bioinformatics is becoming exceedingly important due to the massive amounts of data per patient. They use bioinformatics to derive patterns that can generate further clinical insight or help develop more effective treatments in the future.
Takeaway:
After learning from GRAIL, we understood that despite its limitations, liquid biopsy seems to be more advantageous and addresses many of the concerns we had uncovered earlier. As a"

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!

PATENTS and Synthetic Biology
The ideological reasoning behind applying for a patent lies in the fundamental incentive that it would bring forth financial rewards and a sense of monopolistic supremacy in an advancing market. The imposition of patenting technology has been deemed useful in many industries, most notably in electronics. However, it has also brought forth a considerable level of controversial dialogue in determining how historical protocols can be implemented within new technological streams that sometimes question the concept of man-made invention. For example, Craig Venter’s desire in protecting his synthetic cell research methodology gives him a deserving ownership, but his broad patent places a downgrading threat towards the field of synthetic biology. Ironically speaking, patenting is a legal practice that promotes innovation, but imposes a sense of apprehension for those who wish to adapt towards a more open-sourced strategy. This analysis focuses on the implications of introducing patent law to the field of synthetic biology as well as the practicality of gaining rights to a product not developed entirely by man, but with elements  arising from nature.
Monopolizing Synthetic Biology
The accrued financial and proprietary benefit of monopolizing an idea within a competitive market is indeed an accelerated advantage when a patent is granted. However, many have the misconception that monopolistic proprietorship has a standardized value to any industry it is applied to. For years, Professor John Sulston from the University of Manchester, a believer in promoting an open-source environment in the field of synthetic biology has proposed the implications that would arise should Venter receive approval upon his protocol in developing synthetic organisms.  Sulston states,
""I hope very much these patents won't be accepted because they would bring
genetic engineering under the control of the J Craig Venter Institute (JCVI). They would
have a monopoly on a whole range of techniques (BBC UK, 2010).""
The irony in this matter is that the technological industry used the concept of monopolistic competition to drive both innovation and the development of products that would eventually overpower the market leaders. The reason that this concept cannot presently be applied is that synthetic biology is strongly reliant on collaborative construction. Patenting biological parts or processes will not motivate a group of"

Fig.12. Schematic of thermosensitive T7 RNA polymerase
The mechanism of protein splicing[2]:
Fig.13. Mechanism of protein splicing[2]
Step 1: The peptide bond linking the N-extein and intein is converted to a thioester or ester via nucleophilic attack by the N-terminal Cys or Ser of the intein.
Step 2: The N-extein is transferred from the side chain of the first intein residue to the side chain of the first C–extein residue (Cys, Ser or Thr) by transesterification, resulting in a branched ester intermediate .
Step 3: The branched ester is resolved by Asn cyclization coupled to peptide bond cleavage. This leaves the ligated exteins separated from the intein and linked by an ester bond, while the intein has a C-terminal aminosuccinimide.
Step 4: The ester bond connecting the ligated exteins is rapidly converted to the amide bond, and the C-terminal aminosuccinimide of the intein may be hydrolyzed .(Fig.13.)
Selected TS inteins
In Liang’s work, the TS intein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar ATPase subunit (VMA) is active at low temperature(18℃), and dead at high temperature(37℃), which is contrary to our design. Consequently, we referred to literature to select TS inteins that active at high temperature and dead at low temperature, most of them from extreme thermophiles. The selected inteins are listed below:
Why select locus?
According to the mechanism of splicing for canonical inteins and many structural and mutational studies, extein sequences around the junctions affect the splicing activity significantly[8][10](Fig.14.).
Fig.14. extein sequences around the junctions affect the splicing activity significantly
Liang’s solution was to insert intein between Ala 491 and Cys 492, which is similar to VMA’s original extein context[6]. However, this solution can be limited when inserting other inteins into T7 RNAP: it’s difficult to find a locus similar to intein’s original extein context, while this locus happens to have significant influence on T7 RNAP’s activity(Fig.15.).

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#Mutation_-_-_TEXT.html," like Dengue and Zika virus. Less than 150 years     ago, in the blink of an evolutionary eye, Dengue was only able to infect     apes. Mutations enabled it to extend the host range to infect humans as well. But not only the host range but also the mortality of a virus     could be changed by only a few mutations.
That is why fight fire with fire. By applying a special mutagenesis system, we are able to strongly     enhance mutation rate compared to the numbers present in nature. To create an effective evolutionary system we do not      only need an efficient mutagenesis system, but also need to use it during growth of the mutating organism. This is why     we use in vivo mutagenesis. It may seem less efficient than conventional laboratory mutagenesis but it provides     an advantage which can not be bestowed by in vitro techniques: Evolution.
Overview
One of the elementary requirements of every evolutionary process is variability, which can be achieved by              mutagenesis.              The alteration of existing genotypes is the only way to discover new features and abilities              of proteins and organisms. The aim of our mutagenesis system is to create a diversity of              binding proteins during the course of fermentation to gain as much different Evobodies as possible. Building on the library approach and leading to the selection system, the              mutagenesis represents the central part of our project. After transformation of the library and an initial selection round             the mutagenesis has to take over. That is why we are using a system that is capable of in vivo DNA alteration. Two different approaches were applied to reach this aim.
The mutagenesis plasmid is rather unspecific and leads to a general                  raise of mutations in the DNA of host organisms. This system was used to get a manifold                  increase of base pair exchanges and a strong repression of bacterial DNA repair mechanisms. Six                 different proteins build this mutation system.
A more specific approach is the two plasmid mutagenesis system (Camps et al., 2003). It is                  based on a modified DNA polymerase I, which replicates the first part of plasmids belonging                  to the ColE1-family, like pSB1C3.
In the following, we will elaborate on why and how we implemented these two systems in detail in our project.

To test how suitable dhlA is as counterselectable marker, BS-control  and BS-dhlA strains were grown in the presence or absence of DCA. Both strains showed similar growth in both the presence or absence of DCA (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Comparison of growth of BS-contol and BS-dhlA at 0 ul and 20 ul DCA. Both strains showed similar growth in the presence or absence of DCA.
Liquid cultures
Liquid cultures with different DCA concentrations of both BS-control and BS-dhlA were prepared. No distinct difference between the growths of the two strains was evident (Figure 3).
Figure 3. Comparison of growth of BS-contol and BS-dhlA in liquid cultures with varying DCA concentrations. Both strains showed similar growth.
Conclusion:
We extensively characterized the dehalogenase enzyme on plates and in liquid cultures.
We determined that it is not suitable as a counterselectable marker.
Further plans:
To BioBrick it as it can be used in bioremediation (it can break down halogenated compounds).

1.4 Result Analysis and Prospect
    According to the results of sequencing, actual sequence is identical to designed sequence, which testifies the validity of formulation (appendix 1). In lipase functional test, there is relatively obvious phenomenon under IPTG abduction (Figure 11), which testifies the function of gene.
    Hence, using this reformed lipase can erase the grease cover on relic surface, and we hope to use OAH reconstruct relic surface.
    Meanwhile, recombinant lipase can be widely used in any field for de-greasing, for example, the de-greasing process of steel surface, pre-treatment of high-fat food disposal, etc.
    This research project only recombines the lipase without optimising it according to temperature fluctuation, abduction concentration. We hope our project is helpful in every field.

    Since there is no one had done the same experiment as ours before, we assumed the growing pattern is similar as E.coil CVCC249.
    We got the data of this kind of E.coil from a doctoral dissertation,Comparison of Growth Kinetics and Physiological Characteristics of E.coil CVCC249 under both Batch and Continuous Culture by Huaiqiang Zhang, at page34. We used the logistic function data in this form, which is K=1.937 and r=0.550, and we assumed that N0=0.1( since N0 is initial population of E.coil, we can just simply set this data).
    According to logistic function , we can get the bacteria population-time function:(see Figure 1)
        f(t) = 1.937/(1+(1.937-0.1)e^(-0.55t)/0.1)         f(t) = 1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t"

iGEM Netherlands
The iGEM teams within the Netherlands have put their heads together to benefit from each other’s work under the banner of “iGEM Netherlands”. The goals of the organization include creating an environment in which supervisors and previous iGEMers share their knowledge and experiences with the new Dutch iGEM teams, as well as establishing a channel for discussion of ideas and exchange of knowledge and bricks. This initiative aims to improve the research quality and collaboration between Dutch universities participating on the iGEM competition, teaching the iGEM ideals to the new iGEMers and providing feedback on the human practices and safety measures. In this manner, the teams will be better prepared to tackle the obstacles they might encounter during the iGEM competition.
In order to implement the objectives of this initiative, a series of start-up courses were organized by iGEM Netherlands in a sequential order, presenting topics that ranged from a general introduction to iGEM and its role in promoting synthetic biology, advanced cloning techniques and modeling. Furthermore, a project presentation afternoon was organized in order for teams to present their projects to the other teams and get feedback from them. This event was finalized with a delicious BBQ.
iGEM Netherlands is the first of its kind, where a collaborative effort has been established on a national scale within the context of iGEM. This has been very beneficial in boosting our projects towards success with the knowledge that we have gained during the start-up courses and activities that have been organized. This type of collaboration would be beneficial to other iGEM teams as well, should they choose to do so.

Overview
             
                     
As all the world can see, Chinese economic has developed rapidly. However, together with this developing, the environment of China gets worse gradually,especially in some small private mills in the south of China. Because of lacking of the consciousness of environmental protection, the mills use a lot of toxic chemicals during the deinking. In the same time, they pour the waste water into the river and sea straightly. Fortunately, Chinese were starting conscious of environmental protection. The rise of synthetic biology provides a new way to solve this type of environmental question. But in China, synthetic biology, including iGEM, is a new course, most of Chinese don't know or understand it clearly.
Culture Festival

PaperMill
Thus, we didn't spend all our summer in the lab, we also considered our project and iGEM in a wider context. We used some human practice activities to make people know the basic theory of the synthetic biology and the connection with sustainable development. Meanwhile, our team also went to the small private mill and introduced our project to them. Very good feedbacks were obtained from them. We wanted to make them know that using synthetic biology during the process of papermaking would decrease the consumption of the toxic chemicals,  protect our environment and realize sustainable development.        .

We submitted pC13CO, pC13CL, and pC13BA for sequencing. After, we miniprepped and made stocks of pC13AY and pC13AZ. Also, we submitted pA13AW for sequencing. Transformation of pK13AX was unsuccessful because the wrong resistance plate was used. pC13BF and pK13AX were transformed today. We miniprepped the overnight culture of pC13AF. Gel electroporation showed that pC13I samples are good, but none of the pC13J samples are positive. We ran a PCR for the inserts in pAK13CR. We were surprised to know that rbs + crtE (pC13J) already exists! We made 1000x hygromycin and 100x geniticin. We checked plates from our protoplasting and transforming attempt under the microscope. It appeared unsuccessful so next time we will use all the protoplasts, at least 300 µL. We plated a layer of cym agar and the respective antibiotic on top of the regeneration agar gel as well as inoculating 4 new plates of Cochliobolus. We also ran our Gibson assembly of homology regions in G. lucidum. We miniprepped pC13X and pC13AV in anticipation of part submission, and ran a PCR (to check for inserts) from minipreps of pC13BC, pC13BV, and pC13CE, as well as pC13X and pC13AV (just in case).

Paris-Saclay,2012,Team:Paris-Saclay#Project#Project Description_-_-_TEXT.html,": lambda cI
The repressor used for this project is the lambda phage cI repressor. When the lambda phage infects a bacterial cell, 2 outcomes are possible: i) it either produces phage particles and lyses the cell (lysis) or ii) integrates its DNA into the bacterial genome (lysogeny).  cI is a protein that repressed the phage lytic function and is expressed during the lysogenic state to prevent the production of phage particles and therefore prevent the host cell lysis. cI forms a dimer in order to act on the promoter “PCI” regulated by cI. If the PCI sequence is adequately inserted within a promoter sequence of a given gene, the later is control of the cI repressor (if present).  The repressor in available with the BBa_C0051 biobrick, the PCI sequence is present in BBa_K098995 biobrick.
Expression above a given temperature: RNA thermometer
RNA thermometers are 5’UTR regions of mRNAs that have alternative structures according to the temperature: i) at low temperature, the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (SD) associates by base-pairing to a sequence of its transcript preventing the recruitment of ribosomes and protein synthesis; ii) at higher temperature, the pairing is weakened and ribosomes recognize the SD allowing the protein synthesis (cf. Fig 1). These sequences are present in prokaryotes. They were identified in 1989 [4], however the expression ""RNA thermometer"" was coined in 1999 to describe the RNA rpoH discovered in E. coli that controls the expression of heat shock genes. Some pathogenic bacteria used RNA thermometers to induce the expression of virulence genes at high temperature within the host as it is the case for Listeria monocytogenes.
Figure 1: The regulation of a gene translation by thermometer RNA.
An RNA thermometer characterised by The TU Delft 2008 team is available via the biobrick BBa_K115017 (Fig. 2) which can be used to allow protein expression only above 32°C.
Figure 2: The biobrick BBa_K115017, composed of an RBS, containing an RNA thermometer, under the control of a constitutive promoter.
For the project, we propose to place the cI repressor under the control of the RNA thermometer of BBa_K115017. As a consequence, the translation of the sequence encoding the cI repressor of phage lambda should take place only above 32°C"

We used the set of parameters obtained in the first analysis.
in this model, we assumed the container large enough to ignore effescs from the boundary: i.e. the diffusion equation holds for this system.
The simulation under this assumption ended only in activator spot pattern.
New model
We also conducted the analysis above to a new model. It is inspired by zebrafish and includes the effect of colicin.
CODE see this GitHub page. We modeled first and second sections by MATLAB, and the last one by Java.

System
First, we will explain why the first model is not suitable.
The reason why the first model cannnot seem to form pattern
The interactions between E. coli and AHL are expressed as two differential equations below.
$$ \frac{du}{dt}=d_u\nabla^2u+u(1－u)－{\frac{a}{a+K}}{\delta}u=d_u\nabla^2u+f(u,a)\\ \frac{da}{dt}=d_a\nabla^2a+u－{\gamma}a=d_a\nabla^2a+g(u,a) $$ u: concentration of E. coli
a: concentration of AHL
d_u: the diffusion coefficient of u.
d_a: the diffusion coefficient of a.
{\gamma}: degradation coefficient of AHL
(Note that the parameters are non-dimensionized.)
equation 1
The concentration of E. coli increases by multiplication in proportion to its concentration, but if the concentration is too high, the growth rate decreases because of the lack of nutrition(+u(1-u)). If E. coli receives enough AHL, it is killed by Barnase {\frac{a}{a+K}}{\delta}u.The reaction term {\frac{a}{a+K}}{\delta} can be approximated by Hill equation because the system of E. coli death is similar to ligand-receptor system of protein.
equation2
The concentration of AHL increases in proportion to that of E. coli, and AHL degrades in proportion to -{\gamma}.
We concluded that this model may not be able to form a pattern because this model doesn’t satisfy required mathematical conditions of Turing pattern.
Proof

Contamination issues may be a problem in space if the bacteria were to escape. To protect against the event that our radioprotective patch causes contamination in space or on earth, we would engineer inducible kill switches that could eradicate the bacteria if need be. Additionally, engineering controls such as the protective physical barriers of the patch would prevent the outbreak of bacteria. Various safety mechanisms have been included in the device and they are listed below.
Safety Mechanisms: Device
(We are talking about the more ergonomic design here)
Design considerations to promote safety:
The circular design of the packet containing media and spores, encourages equal distribution of liquid pressure around the circumference. Since the packets are made up of flexible polyethylene material, this design is more advantageous when cases such as accidental bumping or ‘squishing’ of the patch happen by distributing the force.
Having a quadrilateral design can cause accumulation of pressure along the edges when a packet is accidentally squeezed. This would potentially rupture the material faster than having distributed pressure along its sides.
The fact that our patch is also non-invasive and only present in the external part of the body promotes safety better than an implant.
Health factors:
Using a patch gives users freedom to take medication even with an upset stomach, as the drug will not need to go through our digestive system.
Accidental breakage of the patch while attached to skin may cause infections if not disinfected properly.
Patch may cause severe harm when swallowed.
Potential skin irritation may occur. Our initial mouse trials however have shown no signs of inflammation.
Material considerations and their relation to safety:
All materials used in the patch is chemically compatible and biocompatible, which poses less risks of user immune response.
Backing layer: The backing layer is made up of strong, flexible, and gas permeable material. This will allow users to move with ease and saving them the worry of the patch tearing apart. This layer also prevents the bacteria from escaping.
Size-controlling membrane: The size controlling membrane is made up of polymers that prevent bacteria from flowing through the patch, only allowing peptide to pass. The bacteria, therefore, will not cause infections as it is shielded from the skin.
Adhesive: The adhesive chosen has high oxygen/gas permeability, causes low pain upon removal to sensitive skin, and promotes diffusivity of the drug. This has been tested by Dow Corning and causes no significant effects on test animals.
Release liner: The release liner is disposed after being peeled.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html," Against, the excitement of the iGEM community, skeptics have pointed to the uncertainty and potentiality for unwanted consequences that might arise from working with synthetic biology. We as a team decided to give these concerns some serious thought! We have had several conversations on topics such as meta ethics, applied ethics, sustainability, GMO, and so on. Furthermore, we established an open and honest mode of discourse to use when engaging with other teams and the public. We held a workshop in bioethics in relation to our Danish Meetup. This workshop consisted of a historical insight into the history of GMO provided by our very own historian, as well as a hefty, kind-hearted debate, supervised by our own philosopher.
All of these considerations, debates, and results led our philosopher Lene to write a longer guidebook entailing an overview of the various bioethical arguments often made for and against the use of synthetic biology. The guidebook is mainly an insight into the most important ethical considerations made by our team, e.g. how they shaped our product, but it also offers a personal and clear overview of arguments and principles meant to help future teams to get a conversation on ethics started!
Make sure to give this guidebook a read, it is definitely worth it!
Integrated Practices
- An Implementation of the Future
“The best way to predict your future, is to create it”
Abraham Lincoln - (former) president of the United States of America
Not that we can claim to be anything like Abraham Lincoln, or even vampire hunters. Nonetheless, we do agree that to create the future we all hope for, we must contribute to find a sustainable solution for a greener future. Before we can tackle the task of providing a sustainable future for the entire world, we must first look to our own local environment. We believe that the best way to gain a better understanding of a global dilemma, is to examine how a local environment is affected by it. Hopefully, this approach will help future iGEM teams find a connection between global issues and local ones. This approach has helped us elucidate specific issues and find sustainable solutions, which can be implemented into our society with the help and endorsement of local agents.

Plasmid harvest on culture from yesterday. Plasmids digested using Xho1 and Xmal1, expecting to see two bands, one at 1.1 kb and one at 1.7 kb. Ran in gel. Gel displays the correct bands. This shows that our construct is basically correct and gives us confidence to send for sequencing to confirm.

Repeat Gibson CBA of Lambda Red Recombinase system and dCas9 cassette using 25 femtomole DNA and 50 femtomole DNA. Emily and Ashlee worked on the presentation to the teachers for the Center for Science and the Schools .
Plasmids prepared and sent for sequencing to Quintara Bio.
Tuesday, June 24, 2014
Ashlee and Emily PCR Rescued PAK-HMF and ran the results on a gel for later purification.  Continued work on the presentation and a demonstration to the teachers for the Center for Science and the Schools .
Inverse PCR attempted again, in case we will need to go back to it. Five tubes run, this time with added cycles and extension time. Still, bands are very faint. Need to find a way to get this reaction to be successful.

Emily PCR Rescued the FTV vector using crRNA primers.  The PCR results were gel purified.  More work was done to update the Wiki and brainstorm design ideas for it.  Emily also did some finishing touches on the presentation for the Center for Science and the Schools . Ashlee updated the Notebook and Team information on the website. She is slowly learning HTML and CSS.
Sequencing Data arrived, showing that the vectors did not pick up an insert at all, and re-circularized without one. Seems as if inverse PCR was successful. Tail sequence of forward primer shown perfectly, tail sequence of reverse primer shown partially by sequencing. Plan is to re-do the digestion of gblocks and pFTV and then ligate, transform again. Inverse PCR completed again, this time shows extremely faint bands. We know that this was successful at least once because of the sequencing data, but we haven't been able to replicate it. Suspicion that the origional plasmid prep of pFTV may have been faulty due to the low concentration that was gathered makes us want"

PCR results from yesterday of PR + RBS turned out well. Still has the weird trailing streaks that plagued the earlier ones, but I think that's an artifact of some gel impurify/size/etc. Did a PCR cleanup on this sample. Had around 200 ng/uL and a 260/230 that was acceptable (although not completely remarkable). Think it may be time for the PCR of this part.

SCUT,2014,Team:SCUT#HP#Magazine#iGEM Thinking_-_-_TEXT.html," biomedical engineering from Boston University, said, ""this achievement of synthetic biology ruined our basic beliefs about life attribute, which were of great importance in the way of how we are  looking at ourselves, human beings, as well as the place of us in the universe. The development of synthetic biology has also been questioned and challenged by the religions. Pope Benedict XVI considered that the scientists changed the will of god on the rules of life. In a speech in 2006, he explained, ""Not being the god, but replacing the position of god, which was a crazy and arrogant behavior, full of dangerous adventure"".
Despite so many objections, science and technology will never stagnate because of them. The research of ethical debate and security risk in synthetic biology is not aiming to prevent the development of science and technology. In fact, the healthy development of science and technology is benefited from these debate and discussion of ethical problems. For instance, as a result of these debates and arguments, scientists could finally set down the strict standards of operation for transgenic technology experiment, and strict regulations on the censorship and access rules of genetically modified food, as well as relevant regulations of assisted reproduction. It is a universal truth that the development and application of every newly emerging science and technology do have potential risks on changing nature and harming mankind. Synthetic biology, being strengthened the supervision, will not become the opened ""Pandora's box"", but benefit the world instead.
iGEM（International genetically Engineering Machine Competition）is the top competition in the field of synthetic biology. It exerted impact on encouraging teenagers’creativity and improving public awareness about synthetic biology. Many teams in China designed their original projects and participated in this competition. They had to passed the safety check by IiGEM HQ. Then they had to be taught to experiment properly in order to avoid environmental pollution and biological pollution produced during experiments. As we can see, we,iGEMers, really paid great attention to the safety and ethics of synthetic biology.

Collaborations
TX-TL is a cell-free, in vitro, transcription/translation system that allows for inexpensive and rapid prototyping of biological circuits. This is desirable, as the usual method of prototyping and debugging circuits requires DNA parts to be cloned into cells, which can be time-consuming and laborious. With TX-TL, once all the DNA parts have been obtained, the circuit can be tested immediately, and so several circuit iterations can be tested in the time it takes to successfully clone even one circuit iteration into cells. Caltech generously loaned us a plate reader to enable us to use this method.
We were able to successfully perform TX-TL for a series of William and Mary parts.
We offered TX-TL William and Mary’s Team’s plasmids in order to see how their results would vary with this different construct. William and Mary’s Team gave us suggestions and also offered us some plasmid and backbone which is iGEM standard plasmid.
Below is a graph of our results:
This chart shows the fluorescence in the plasmids (each labeled by their RBS part number  followed by their iGEM part number) measured in Arbitrary Fluorescence Units using TX-TL.
This graph shows the fluorescence of the plasmids, over a period of 12 and a half hours, in the plate reader.

Flagella enable “Swimming”
Once all structures were established, six further students joined the team so that three subprojects could be processed. On the one hand the isolation of strains of the intestinal bacterium E. coli that can move preferably fast is intended. The already mentioned “Swimming” is enabled by the so-called flagella. At laboratory strains the flagella are often degenerated due to the profuse food availability of the nutrient media. “One of our groups develops a selection system for the fast strains”, explains team member Jan Kampf. A second group is supposed to modify one of the so-called chemoreceptors. With these plainest sensory organs E. coli can detect particular nutritive substances such as dextrose and single protein building blocks to move subsequently towards the location of higher substance concentration. These receptors are aimed to be altered in a way that they can specifically perceive other substances. In this project they are supposed to “learn” to trace substances that are released in the human body during inflammations. “If we succeed, these strains could be further advanced so that they accumulate for instance during chronic intestinal inflammations”, states Schliep. Thus, inflammations of the intestine could be displayed without eteroscopy. The third group develops das selections system for E. coli strains with altered chemoreceptors. Ideally we receive bacteria in the end that can, due to their improved flagella, move very fast towards the substance of desire.
Twelve team members
Since March the twelve team mebers work in the laboratory, each about one or two days per week. Once a week the results are discussed and the tasks for the following week defined, suppoted by Professor Neumann. “During summer holidays the amount of work will arise considerably”, comments Schliep. Besides the three subproject teams there are also people in authority for certain overlapping duties. These include purchasing as well as the documentation and putting online of the results on the iGEM website. The website can be edited till the end of September, then the jury commence operations. “Of those who may present their projects at the European Jamboree on 2nd October in Amsterdam, about 30 to 40 percent will go to the international finals in Boston a month later”, declares Kampf. The iGEM team of Göttingen has then left five months in the laboratory.

iHKU,2008,Team:iHKU_-_-_TEXT.html," to move around. To  generate a recognizable and stable pattern, bacterial motility must be  controlled and coordinated. This can be accomplished by designing genetic  circuits coupling bacterial quorum sensing system and genes controlling  mobility. There are several key genes responsible for the movement of flagella,  two of them are cheY and cheZ. CheY protein has two forms: its  phosphorylated form makes flagella rotate clockwise and the cell will tumble;  its dephosphorylated form makes flagella rotate counterclockwise and the cell  will be driven straight in one direction (run). The CheZ protein is involved in  dephosphorylation of protein CheY. It is known in the literature that cells are immobile in the absence of CheZ.
By rewiring the genetic circuitry  that controls cell motility, we aim to generate unique patterns ( Design ). First, we applied the method of  Recombineering to delete the cheZ gene in chromosome of wild type E.  coli strain, MG1655 ( Protocols ).  Then, a series of biobricks and strains were successfully constructed ( Plasmids and strains ), to (i) import the quorum sensing system of Vibrio fischeri and (2) control the  expression of cheZ by quorum sensing, either positively or negatively. As expected,  interesting patterns were observed ( Results ),  such as Mt.Fuji-like and ring of troughs patterns, when cells are seeded on low density agar plates. Since the ring-like patterns are so counterintuitive -- they formed despite cell growth and diffusion, our remaining work mainly focused on the characterization  and modeling of these patterns.
Considering E.  coli movement as a random walk, a coarse-grained model was used to describe the basic cell motility in response to AHL (the quorum sensor) synthesized by the cells. Our model is  based on time dependent partial differential equations including the effect of  cell random walk, cell growth, AHL diffusion, AHL synthesis and degradation,  and nutrient diffusion and consumption. ( Modeling ). Analysis of the model suggests a basic mechanism underlying the formation of the intriguing trough-like patterns: regions of low cell density are formed by cells being sucked to  neighboring high density regions as the engineered cells move randomly at low density and become immobile  at high density. Our simulation indicated some factors might significantly affect the  development of ring-like patterns, such as the growth rate of the cell which  was also observed in the experiments. By measuring these factors, we provide  not only solid data to support our hypothesis for our model,"

The European Experience 2016 in Paris
EE16 - the biggest get together of iGEM in Europe
From July 1-3 the iGEM teams Evry and IONIS from Paris hosted the “European Experience 2016”, the biggest get together of iGEM teams in Europe. Twenty-seven teams from eleven countries all over Europe were part of a vivid network, exchanging ideas and thoughts about the ongoing projects in the 2016 iGEM competition. Not only discussions about the projects but also about opportunities in synthetic biology were part of the meeting in Paris.
Working in the morning...
The event started with a poster session to get to know the other projects and participants and to present our projects to the other participants. We could use this platform to get new ideas about our project, and we were able to discuss specific problems and safety matters about our project. For example, one of these issues regards to the question how to ensure the biosafety of a genetically modified organism (GMO) which could be ingested into the human body as part of treatment.
In the afternoon, two roundtables gave insight into risks, chances, and economics of synthetic biology. Both tables provided unique insights into an evolving economic sector of synthetic biology. It was an excellent opportunity to get in touch with leading scientists and entrepreneurs of France. Furthermore, the discussion gave a broader view of opportunities within the sector of synthetic biology. This made it a very stimulating and interesting event.
Everyone is listening intently at the round table discussion.
...networking in the evening
Of course, our stay in Paris gave also room for pleasure and networking with other iGEM participants. We had some nice hours hanging on the edge of our seat while our home teams from Belgium, Wales, France, Germany and all the other teams were defeating each other during the European Soccer Championship in France. Sport brings people together, so we made new friends with the iGEM teams of Cardiff, UCLouvain, and others.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Project#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"lying the fusion protein: targeted adapter integration
Design: We designed and tested DNA adapters, compatible with ONT sequencing, to be integrated by the Tn5 portion of our fusion protein. We targeted the integration of these adapters on EPO coding sequence in plasmid DNA.
Results and interpretation: The initial assay for adapter (~30bp) integration on plasmid DNA with EPO coding sequence (BBa_K2643004) was not successful ( notebook ). Based on this result, we hypothesised that it might be necessary to work with linearized DNA, so we digested EPO plasmid with EcoRI enzyme and repeated the adapter integration. Adapter integration with sgRNA ( sg001 ) targeting EPO at around 232th bp should result in fragments of ~250 bp and ~430bp. We PCR amplified the products of integration using EPO and adapters’ primers. The results in figure 22, (Lane 1,2,5, and 6) indicated a correct integration of both adapters in a specific position in EPO cds molecule. The absence of these bands on the negative controls without sgRNA (lane 3,4,7,8) confirmed this specificity further.

DNA substrate: (lanes 1-4) EPO coding sequence or (lanes 4-8) EPO plasmid linearized with EcoRI. Lane L: DNA ladder (100-1000bp), lane 1, 5: amplified DNA with fw EPO lane 2, 6: amplified DNA with rv EPO, lane 3, 7: amplified DNA with fw EPO without sgRNA, lane 4, 8: amplified DNA with rv EPO without sgRNA.
ONT MinION sequencing with adapters integrated by fusion protein
We took our fusion protein one step further and attempted to use the integration product (figure 23) for ONT MinION sequencing. For this assay, we took an initial solution with equimolar concentrations of Tn5 DNA and EPO plasmid DNA and performed our integration assay, after which we continued with Rapid Sequencing Kit pipeline (without transposase fragmentation reaction). As a control, an equimolar concentration of dxCas9 DNA was prepared by ONT library preparation protocol (including transposase fragmentation).
After the sequencing run, we followed the workflow defined in Sequencing alignment protocol . The alignment results showed that most of"

Introduction: what are microcompartments?
In order to produce an efficient bioremediation system, we had to think outside the box and not only improve the expression and function proteins we were working with, but optimise the bacteria themselves for the degradation of toxic compounds. We found that microcompartments, which are explained on this page, are ideally suited for our purposes.
Structure
Structure
Microcompartments are proteinaceous capsules that have only recently been recognised to exist in a wide range of bacteria. They contain enzymes required for a particular metabolic process. The carboxysome is a particularly well-studied example of a specialised microcompartment, and is shown here as a schematic diagram (S. Frank et al, 2013).
The Pdu microcompartment that we are using in our project is composed of several proteins encoded in an operon consisting of the genes pduA, -B, -T, -U, -N, -J, -K. These are expressed in various stoichiometries to form different polyhedral shapes with a diameter of 200-250 nm. The faces of the polyhedron are formed by the hexagonal shell proteins PduA, PduB, and PduJ, while PduN is thought to form the vertices (Joshua B. Parsons et al, 2010).
We are expressing the pdu-ABTUNJK codon in E. coli in the pUNI vector, shown below, which we received from the University of Dundee iGEM team.
Additionally, we are expressing pduABUTNJK in P. putida, which to our knowledge has not been done before. For this purpose, we transferred the ABTUNJK sequence into the pBBR1MCS vector, shown below:
Oxford iGEM 2014
Predicting the microcompartment structure
Predicting the microcompartment structure
The pdu-encoded microcompartments which we are introducing into our bacteria are very similar in shape and structure to carboxysomes, so we used their structure as a starting point for predicting the microcompartment structure. Thus, our initial carboxysome-based structure was a perfect icosahedron with diameter 120nm as established from literature. Following this, we further developed the model by noting that many of"

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#html5_-_-_TEXT.html,"UB. A general algorithm for all 6 type part is designed and we will illustrate this via an example. Consider a ST block with all ANY type parts (we use X to indicate ANY type part in the figures). We find matchings of the first part of the block. There may be many possible matchings because part of type ANY implies arbitrary matching of parts on one chain in MoDeL definitions. For each matching found, we deal with the next, and do the same thing recursively until the end of the template or matching fails. An easy example is shown in the figure to illustrate this simple idea.
After all possible matchings for each chain in the template have been found, we could choose any one from each to form a combination. Matching alternatives of two different chains in the template should not be the same. For example, there are two chains in the template, T1 and T2, and three chains, C1, C2 and C3 in the species. If T1 has one matching to C1 and one to C2 and T2 has one to C2 and one to C3, the possible matchings are (T1,T2)->(C1, C2), (T1,T2)->(C1,C3) and (T1,T2)->(T2,T3). (T1,T2)->(C2,C2) is not allowed. (这里已修改)This is based on the assumption that the writer of template is always sure about the structure, he won't write a two-chain template if the parts are actually on one chain. The general matching relations could be written as (n1,n2,n3...)->(m1,m2,m3...), where (n1,n2,n3...) represents chains in the template and (m1,m2,m3...) represents the chains matched in the species for (n1,n2,n3...) respectively. However, it is only  part of the matching relation because details, such as the matching positions of parts in the template, are ignored.  The next question is: how to validate each matching?
As defined in Chain-Node model, details of distribution of binding are stored in the forest. Matching of chains could not solely determine the overall match -- whether the template and the species have the same structural pattern. However, it is not easy to compare tree structure directly. We designed an algorithm to do this based on the principle: If the template and species have the same structural pattern, it must be possible to isolate the template from the species after replacing the ST part with its matchings"

Replication: The bacteriophage T7 replisome is an ideal model system for studying replication dynamics because it recapitulates the key features of more complicated systems, yet can be reconstituted in vitro with only four proteins. DNA synthesis is carried out by a stable, one-to-one complex of gene 5 protein (gp5) and thioredoxin, a processivity factor produced by the E. coli host. Gene 4 protein (gp4) contains both helicase and primase domains whereas gene 2.5 protein (gp2.5) is the single-stranded DNA binding protein (15).

Large-scale Amplification and Purification of T7 Phage Nanoparticles
The T7-p66, T7-p66x2 and T7-wt nanoparticles were propagated in the log phase culture of E. coli BL21 (OD600~0.8) grown in M9-LB broth (LB broth supplemented with 50 ml 20X M9 salts, 20 ml 20% glucose and 1 ml of 1 M MgSO4 per liter) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 and incubated at 37°C until complete lysis of the culture (3–6 hours). Thirty minutes before removing the culture from the shaker, DNAse I and RNAse A (Roche, Germany) were added to degrade released bacterial nucleic acids. T7 phage nanoparticles were precipitated from the culture supernatant by addition of 1 M NaCl and 10% polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000, Merck) followed by overnight incubation at 4°C. The T7 phage pellet was resuspended in Tris-NaCl buffer (PH 8) and PEG and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. To remove residual PEG and debris, an equal volume of chloroform was added, gently inverted and the top aqueous phase was harvested after low-speed centrifugation at 4°C. The purified T7 nanoparticles were sterilized using a pyrogen-free 0.2 µm pore-size cellulose acetate filter (Millipore) and stored at 4°C until further analysis.

Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production."
