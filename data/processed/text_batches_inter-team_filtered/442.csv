3. For the quality of wound dressings
Bacterial cellulose is well suited for wound dressings due to its good biocompatibility, high mechanical strength in wet state, good liquid and gas permeability, and inhibition of skin infections. For secondary and tertiary burns, ulcers have been successfully used as temporary substitutes for artificial skin. For the application of bacterial cellulose in medical materials, our team visited the BC factory and learned more about what conditions are required for the products of BC films used as wound dressings.

At the same time we would like to thank xx company for providing the conditions of  the test of our BC films . After a variety of tests of specifications, size, permeability, water content and others, data shows that the bacterial cellulose produced after the co-culture meet the technical requirements of wound dressings.
Futurework
During the experiments of overexpressing PGM, we discovered that it didn’t increase the yield of BC as expected. After researching relevant literature,we assume that due to the fact that G6P plays a significant role in the whole metabolic network, over expressing PGM may affect the direction of energy flux in the network. Therefore, the energy in the route of producing BC is going down leading to no increase in the yield of BC. On the other hand, perhaps the reaction PGM catalyzed is not a rate-limiting step or the overexpression of PGM hasn’t improve the efficiency of the enzymatic reaction. Other then that, it is very possible that there are still factors that we haven’t covered influencing the whole metabolic process and the yields of BC.
Therefore.in the future, we might consider to modify or overexpress UGP which catalyze a rate-limiting reaction and explore its effect on the yields of BC
Bacterial cellulose is already a useful biomaterial as is due its attractive mechanical properties. So we want to make and characterise new cellulose binding domains, and fuse them to functional proteins. In our project, the bingding domains are the spytag and its catcher parts--spycatcher.

On the next pages we are going to present you our BioBrick work.
One approach of our project was to visualize a readout by a light emitting system. So a luciferase BioBrick was built. This BioBrick is a highly sensitive reporter gene which was successfully applied in different devices with a PoPS output. The characterization of this BioBrick can be found here .
The second step was to establish a complete VirA/G signaling system from Agrobacterium tumefaciens in Escherichia coli. For this purpose three new BioBricks were created - virA, virG and a vir promoter. The VirA receptor recognizes the phenolic substance acetosyringone and transmits this information to the VirG response regulator - a bacterial transcription factor which activates vir promoters. This natural VirA/G signaling system works in E. coli and was measured and characterized by using the reporter genes mRFP and luciferase .
In the third step we tried to modify the VirA receptor by directed mutagenesis using error-prone PCR, in order to detect substances other than acetosyringone (e.g. capsaicin). For that purpose we designed a high-throughput screening system with a selective system based on the expression of a kanamycin resistance. We tried to modify the receptor by different modification strategies like error prone (random mutagenesis) or specific amino acid changes ( mut1 / mut2 ). The constructs mut1 and mut2 were done by an in silico approach."

European Meetup in Munich
In July we attended the European Meetup in Munich.                  It was a great experience to get in touch with so many teams.                  For the first time we presented our poster to a greater audience and                  were excited by all the positive comments and helpful advice we received.                  We are thankful for the opportunity to get an insight into the other amazing projects.                  Not only did we get to hear stunning talks about synthetic biology in current science issues,                  but we also received important information by attending many workshops.                  In the end we left a bit wistfully, but we also took home so many amazing impressions.

Results from meeting with Fikrig lab: They have not yet purified their iAFGP. They tried expressing it in E. coli and it did not work for them (likely because of the glycosylation sites). They have now expressed it in Drosophila cells and have been working on purifying the protein for about half a year. They cautioned against using anti-freeze glycoproteins for our project. They said that they would be willing to help us with assays for our project. They have experience with ice recrystallization assays, ice morphology assays, and a 4C cold tolerance assay in E.coli. They recommended contacting Peter Davies from Queen's University in Kingston, ON - he is willing to share plasmids from type III anti-freeze proteins. They asked if they could use which ever AFPs we end up expressing and purifying as positive controls for their assays once they purify iAFGP glycoprotein.
Wednesday:
Possibility of using a new AFP sequence in our project instead of one that has already been expressed in E. coli was investigated. Obviously we need to be able to defend a decision to do this, and not just express it because it is new. One possibility is using a hyperactive thermolabile AFP that was recently cloned from fish but not yet expressed in E. coli. This anti-freeze protein has exceptionally high TH activity but it irreversibly denatures at room temperature. This is a useful property, as denatured proteins degrade much faster (public more amenable to this if we are using it in food / on sidewalks).
Discussed with one of the grad advisors whether using MAGE to optimize the general secretory pathway in the EcNR2 strain (inactivating relevant genes like proteases, optimizing RBS sequeneces of relevant genes, etc) would be a good direction to take the project. First, we would need to find a readout. This might be GFP (especially if the Tokyo Tech part works), or we might use the cold tolerance assay (see if more grow at lower temperatures). Might be better to buy the GFP+AFP, then take GFP off with primers that are complementary to AFP plus a new restriction enzyme site. It seems like for our purposes we would be using MAGE to optimize the general secretory pathway in the EcNR2 strain (inactivating relevant genes, optimising R"

Best Integrated Human Practices
Our project is entirely dedicated to improving biosafety in iGEM and synthetic biology projects. When browsing previous years iGEM projects to understand what participating to the iGEM competition meant, a redundant observation highlighted  the fact that biosafety was often a forgotten aspect in iGEM projects. Even when biosafety was taken into account, it seemed that it was integrated late in the conception of the project, after the choice of the chassis and the design of the system. In fact, we only found one project entirely focusing on biosafety (Paris Bettencourt 2012). This is when we decided to work on helping iGEM teams to better consider this aspect of their project. To determine whether biosafety was still undervalued by iGEM teams in 2015, we prepared a survey asking teams whether they had considered the possible effects of the release of their organism in the environment. Because we wanted to be useful to the community, we also asked which organism they chose as chassis. The results of this survey ( Survey results ) showed us that (i)biosafety was still not a major concern for many iGEmers who answered our survey and that (ii) Escherichia coli was still the chassis of choice in iGEM projects. This incited us to consider several directions for our project. First we chose to focus on designing biosafety systems for E. coli chassis . Second, as some iGEMers seemed to consider that releasing E. coli in the environment was not a problem, as bacteria will die, we decided to investigate whether this was indeed the case ( contamination experiments ). Third, we thought that we should take into account physical containment as well as biological containment, as this would certainly be useful for devices aimed at being used in the environment (such as biosensors or bioremediation devices) ( physical containment ). For the biological containment aspect of our project, we decided to concentrate on preventing the dissemination of GE E. coli in the environment, as the Paris Bettencourt team 2012 already worked on preventing horizontal gene transfer"

Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher, public, environmental safety? Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
With regards to the experimental work that our fabrication team is doing in the laboratory, our project involves the creation of non-pathogenic, transgenic microorganisms for the purpose of studying how multiple biological “parts” inserted into an organism interact with one another.  The parts involved are mainly fluorescent reporter proteins and are present in nature or slightly modified with degradation tags, which are not known to pose risks to researchers, the public, or the environment.  The organisms used - Escherichia coli (DH5α-T1R and TOP10) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (BY4741, BY4733, W303a, INVSc) - are common laboratory strains and are considered safe when used according to laboratory good practice standards.  Any new BioBrick parts or devices that we will submit will be composed of fluorescent proteins and degradation tags, and will again pose no known risks.  Even alterations to our systems, from mutations or other sources, would be unlikely to create safety concerns.
For our in silico work, the design team is characterizing the ways that biological parts interact to achieve more successful assembly. Although these efforts are intended for benevolent purposes, there is always the chance that they could facilitate malicious bioengineering as well.  Like other synthetic biologists, we choose to proceed in a spirit of public beneficence and responsible stewardship, pursuing useful outcomes while remaining watchful for potential misuses of our efforts.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Our work is overseen by the Virginia Tech Environmental Health and Safety Office (EHS) and adheres to its Chemical Hygiene Plan and Biosafety for Laboratory Workers. To ensure that our wet laboratory team members are following EHS biosafety policies they have received the following training:
VBI Health and Safety Orientation: biosafety levels, University Health and Safety Policy 1005, dress code and required practices for laboratory personnel, Material Safety and Data sheets, Biosafety Level 2 Lab-Specific Manual, Personal Protective Equipment

Degradation
We pinpointed the localization of two MlrA constructs in yeast
Our results show that our constructs, MlrA (MlrAY) and MlrA with mating factor α (MlrAYa), both localized in the fraction comprising of inclusion bodies, plasma membrane and cell wall (Figure 10, P2 fractions). MlrA was also detected in the fraction containing only cell wall and plasma membrane (P3 fraction), indicating that the protein is localized in the plasma membrane. The absence of MlrAYa from the S3 and P3 samples is most likely due to technical errors in the experiment, and, based on this, we can’t conclude if the protein is in the plasma membrane or in the inclusion bodies.

LAD - molecular weight standard, NC - S. cerevisiae SS328-leu without MlrA plasmid as negative control, S1 - secreted protein, S2 - soluble protein and inner membranes, P2 - inclusion bodies, plasma membrane and cell wall, S3 - refolded protein, P3 - plasma membrane and cell wall, S4 - soluble protein, P4 - inner membranes.
We proved that our enzymes are active
Based on our final enzyme activity assay, both MlrAY and MlrAYa have activity. The earlier assay with non-diluted enzyme had shown that either there is high activity or that there is no activity at all, but with this final activity assay we managed to prove that the enzymes degrade MC-LR. The results show that the three different dilutions degrade the MC-LR at different rates, with 1:10 dilution having the highest activity and 1:1000 having the lowest (Figure 11). Based on the graphs it seems that the plain MlrA has a bit higher activity than MlrA with the mating factor α.

Protein production
Test of our biobrick proteins production using a SDS PAGE and coomassie blue staining. - : no induction ; + : induction with 0.02% arabinose at Abs(600nm)=0.4
We investigated if the DesA, DesB, DesC and DesD proteins were well produced by our biobrick BBa_K1951011 using SDS PAGE.
To do this we performed SDS PAGE (protocol) and stained with coomassie blue using cells containing this biobrick. From an over night starter, cells were diluted and grown from Abs(600nm)=0.2 to Abs(600nm)=1.  Then 1UOD of cells (1.67ml at 0.6OD) was collected and centrifuged at 5000g for 5min.  After removal of the supernatant, the cell pellet was resuspended in 50µL SDS-PAGE sample buffer.  We heated the mix at 95°C during 15min. The sample was loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel and migrated during 50min at 180V.  Staining was done using coomassie blue.
We compared the production of proteins in different background :
- E. coli TG1 strain with pSB1C3 containing the RFP coding sequence (negative control)
- E. coli TG1 strain with des operon ( BBa_K1951011"
British_Columbia,2011,Team:British Columbia#Model1_-_-_TEXT.html," concentration of [IDI1], for the production of I-PP, is tripled because negative values are noted. Therefore, one should not attempt to introduce a higher concentration of that gene into a cell for manufacturing purposes.
Figure 13: The concentration of B-pinene decreased using the pinene synthases (PgTPS-Pin2 and PsTPS-Pin), with selected enzymes' concentrations being tripled, for the simplified biochemical pathway. Mutant cells contain the erg20-2 and K6R-HMG2 genes where as endogenous cells have the HMG2 and ERG20 genes instead.
The final result was for the derivative of the [B-pinene] increased using the pinene synthases (PgTPS-Pin2 and PsTPS-Pin), with selected enzymes' concentrations being tripled, for the simplified biochemical pathway.The simulations suggest the following:
tripling the [K6R-HMG2] increases the rate of [GPP] production by 16.4536 times
tripling the [PgTPS-Pin2] increases the rate of [GPP] production by 3.67743 times
not tripling any enzymes, for the mutant cell, yields an increase of rate of [GPP] production by 2.4292 times
tripling the [IDI1], for the production of DMA-PP, increases the rate of [GPP] production by 2.0348 times
tripling the [IDI1], for the production of I-PP, decreases the rate of [GPP] production by 1.5222 times
Figure 14: The derivative of the [B-pinene] increased using the pinene synthases (PgTPS-Pin2 and PsTPS-Pin), with selected enzymes' concentrations being tripled, for the simplified biochemical pathway. Mutant cells contain the erg20-2 and K6R-HMG2 genes where as endogenous cells have the HMG2 and ERG20 genes instead.
To summarize, the engineered mevalonate pathway should be modified to increase the [K6R-HMG2] and [IDI1] for DMA-PP production for mass producing monoterpenes for manufacturing purposes. The tripling the [K6R-HMG2] increases the [GPP] by 8.7000 times where as tripling the [IDI1] for the production of I-PP and [PgTPS-Pin2] decreases the [GPP] by 37.63% and 41.45% respectively"

Since the real estate on our desktop CNC milled microfluidic chips are limited, this protocol has divided into two chips which, when run in tandem, accomplish these specific serial dilutions. The first chip in the system consists of three consecutive mixers, design with flow rates intended to handle the three 1:20 dilutions. The other chip will run the two 1:10 dilutions and the output selection mechanism.

The gel electrophoresis results from last week confirmed the successful transformation of DH5a with the ligated vector and inserts; pET29b(+)-phaCJ, pET29b(+)-fadE, and pET29(+)-fadD. Overnight colonies of the cells transformed with these complete ligated inserts and vectors were made from the master plate. Overnight cultures of pET29b(+)-phaC colony 2, pET29b(+)-phaCJ colony 1 and 6, and pET29b(+)-fadD were made; two sets of cultures were made for PhaC-pET29b colony 2, A beta-oxidation-pET29b colony 1, and C beta-oxidation-pET29b colony 4. Miniprep was performed on the overnight cultures.
One set of isolated plasmids were resuspended in ddH2O and sent for sequencing confirmation (PhaC-pET29b colony 2, A beta-oxidation-pET29b colony 1 and 6, and C beta-oxidation-pET29b colony 4). The other set was resuspended in TE buffer for digestion confirmation (PhaC-pET29b colony 2, A beta-oxidation-pET29b colony 1, and C beta-oxidation-pET29b colony 4) and ligation with other parts (C beta-oxidation ligation with A beta-oxidation).
XhoI and HindIII were used to digest PhaC-pET29b colony 2, A beta-oxidation-pET29b colony 1, and C beta-oxidation-pET29b colony 4. The samples were mixed with DNA loading dye and loaded into the wells of a 1% agarose gel. The gel was run at 80V for 40 minutes.
The results for PhaC did not seem to work because there were four bands observed. C beta-oxidation digested with HindIII and XhoI seemed to work but no bands were observed on the gel for C beta-oxidation digested with SalI and KpnI.

Phage detection PCR
In order to make sure that phages are present in the turbidostat, a phage detection PCR was performed. This PCR uses three different primer pairs, yielding three characteristic PCR products in lengths of 200, 400 and 750 bp. By this, it is possible to efficiently detect phages in the lagoons to check for phage washout or for evaluating a possible contamination of the turbidostat.

Plaque sequencing PCR
In order to reveal mutations which we were possibly acquired during a PACE or PREDCEL run, plaque PCRs are highly recommended. Therefore, a plaque assay is performed following our *plaque assay* protocol. Based on the results of the plaque assays, single plaques, belonging to single phages infecting a bacterium, should be picked and the gene of interest should be amplified using a HF-polymerase and suitable primers. In total, the PCR mastermix should be prepared equivalent to a mastermix for a colony PCR of bacteria.

Overview
Our project is to screen the high-producing bacteria strain based on the anti-degeneration gene circuit without antibiotics. Totally, we use three methods to achieve this goal. Respectively, we utilize the emrR gene, T7 RNA polymerase gene and CI gene as the core part of our system to screen the high-producing bacteria strain. In our circuit, only the bacteria strain which can produce more target products can stimulate the expression of the growth factor gdh. And then the high-producing bacteria strain will obtain the growth advantage. In contrast, in the low-producing bacteria, the level of the gdh gene expression is lower than that in the high-producing bacteria. Thus, the high-producing bacteria will grow faster than low-producing bacteria and the low-producing bacteria will be eliminated in the end. In this way, we successfully achieve the goal of screening the high-producing bacteria.
I. Safety Training in Lab
Before all the members of our experimental group entered the laboratory to start the experiment, all of our team members carefully read and signed the laboratory safety responsibility book. Everyone carefully understood the relevant regulations of the laboratory and ensured strict compliance with the laboratory. In the first month of the experiment, our advisor Nan conducted relevant supervision and guidance on our experiments and standardized the flow of the experimental operation. After one month, we organized a safe operation for the laboratory. The assessment is divided into two parts which contained theory and experimental operation, only the team members who meet the requirements can be allowed to enter the laboratory to do experiments, those who fail to meet the standards will continue to receive laboratory safety education until they meet the standards.
II. Organism Safety

He also shared with us the contacts of highly recommended specialists with whom we could consult about our product and with which we would have contact later: Juan Diego Pérez de la Rosa, Efraín Rocha, Felipe Esquivel Díaz.
We were able to share a new perspective on beekeeping in relation to synthetic biology with Mr. Ramírez by explaining him our project, the beekeeper mentioned how he was more than willing to help us, and he even shared some honey and bee bread with us! This meeting was an invaluable experience for us!

Meeting with Engineer Alejandro Bianchi
As we were speaking with him about our project, he mentioned the importance of the Varroa mite, a parasite that sucks the hemolymph of bees, the equivalent to blood in this arthropods, weakening their immune system and making them susceptible to other diseases. He ensured that enhancing the natural defenses of bees would have a positive response since healthy bees are a lot less susceptible to diseases.
He recommend us to expand our horizons to consider our product as a product that can also be applied when there is the presence of Varroa.
Urbanization is a problem bees are facing directly.
The Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (Spanish: SAGARPA) is the governmental institution responsible for inspecting hives.
Detailed Description
Engineer Alejandro Bianchi studied Agronomy at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education and has been dedicated to beekeeping since 30 years ago. Currently, he has a company called Kolmena Yothë that offers bee products for health and beauty purposes, his company also provides apitherapy treatments, complementing them with Bach flowers, Schuessler salts and"

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Software#Chatbot_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s very easy to use the software in existing workflows; if your protocols aren’t already on Protocat they simply need to be uploaded and they’d instantaneously be available on our app.
We looked into protocols.io’s API , another protocol database, and contacted the team there to try and get access to the public protocols without the user’s login details. Their cofounder, Alexei Stoliartchouk, informed us that they are working on adding that ability but at the time of writing it had not yet been implemented.
We also looked into sourcing protocols from OpenWetWare . Despite having an immensely useful database the protocols are not in any standard format and thus very difficult to parse automatically. We talked with Michigan Software , who are looking into standardising a protocol format as part of their human practices work.
Testing and feedback
Several teams tested it at the UK meetup, including Judd-UK. Judd suggested the team lookup feature and the ability to repeat a step in the protocol (as opposed to just next and back), both of which we implemented soon after.
Judd also suggested having a command to skip to a particular step. We tried to implement this but found it wasn’t feasible as it caused conflicts with the part lookup feature. This was because the natural language processing algorithms tended to match the numbers to part IDs.
Future work
As it’s open-source (GPLv3 license) and available on Github , other teams are free to build other functions or improve the current ones. In the future all kinds of biological queries could be supported such as looking up particular reagents or safety instructions. It also has the potential to control future IoT lab equipment, such as WiFi-enabled centrifuges or electrophoresis power supplies.

The higher right part, on the contrary, is chilling to the bones. Here, ${k_{on}}$ is low and ${k_{off}}$ is high, which means that the two parts tend to disassociate. The state of spilt EBFP2 without intein falls into this region.
If we compare the two figures in parallel, we can see that the values in the “titration” map is lower than those in the “dimer” map. This is in accordance with our experimental data. Wet lab work shows that with a constitutively-expressed part, channel capacity is lower. The model match and explain the phenomenon.

\[\frac{{d{x_1}}}{{dt}} = {k_1}\left[ {dox} \right]\left[ {c - {x_1}} \right] - {k_{ - 1}}{x_1}\]
\[\frac{{d{x_2}}}{{dt}} = {k_1}\left[ {dox} \right]\left[ {c - {x_2}} \right] - {k_{ - 1}}{x_2}\]
\[\frac{{d{x_3}}}{{dt}} = {k_2}{x_1} - {d_2}{x_3}\]
\[\frac{{d{x_4}}}{{dt}} = {k_2}{x_2} - {d_2}{x_4}\]
\[\frac{{d{x_5}}}{{dt}} = {k_3}{x_3} - {d_3}{x_5} - {k_{on}}{x_5}{x_6} + {k_{off}}{x_7}\]
\[\frac{{d{x_6}}}{{dt}} = {k_3}{x_4} - {d_3}{x_6} - {k_{on}}{x_5}{x_6} + {k_{off}}{x_7}\]

TEAM:
Our team was founded in the middle of 2015 and it is made up of 10 students of the Biomedical Engineering degree of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra who are really fond of science. As the interests of each member of our group vary from Engineering to Biology and Medicine, we form a highly interdisciplinary team capable of facing all the challenges of this project. We have acquired all the technologic and biologic knowledge and tools necessary with the practices developed during the degree and in the internships that each of us has done in important institutions such as: the Department of Experimental and Health Sciences (DCEXS) of the UPF, the Vall d’Hebron Research Institute (VHIR) or the Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL).
We are not only fond of science but also willing to help society. We strongly believe we can really make a change. Our attitude and permanent insistence were the key elements which made our university teachers allow us to start this project.
Advisors
We also have two advisors, Carlos Toscano and Salva Duran, who have kindly supervised and helped us all along the project and to whom we are sincerely grateful.
External Advisors
We are very thankful with the help via email from all the people that we bothered and decided to give us their opinion about our project. Dr. Eugene W. Gerner gave us at the beginnings of our project greate advice about how we could focus our ideas. He is a Chief Scientific Officer, Board Member, Co-Founder at Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals and one of the biggest help we had to better understand the world of polyamines. We would also like to say thank Dr. Masao Kawakita, from the Stem Cell Project, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Scienceo, who gave us great advice about polyamine-like molecules. Finally, we would like to thank Dr. David Christianson and Dr. Nicolas Porter from the University of Pennsylvania, Department of Chemistry for sending us a plasmid with polyamine deacetylase.
Collaborations
iGEM UPO Sevilla Collaboration

Both teams were working on metabolic analysis, and had developed a tool to facilitate analysis of complex enzymatic pathways. However, our two aproaches were quite diferent. Sevilla’s"
Northwestern,2018,Team:Northwestern#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," our Modeling page . The extract that we used for this experiment also seems to be higher, with better fold induction and fluorescence that is visible to the naked eye. If we had more time we would conduct this experiment with lower concentrations of AHL to obtain data for a wider range of concentrations. After a concentration of 20 μM of AHL, the fluorescence decreased drastically. Since AHL was dissolved in Ethanol, we can assume that after this concentration, the AHL became toxic to our system. If we had more time, we would apply what we learned to our Chromium and Lead systems. A more detailed analysis of our future directions is also listed below.
Figure 3A & 3B. - AHL Titration Data & Fold Induction Graph
Achievements
• Able to obtain results in under 4 hours.
• Successfully showed that our system responded to the presence of AHL.
• Showed that all of pLux, LuxR and AHL are needed for GFP production.
• Further optimizations can be done to reduce the leak in the off state.
• A positive correlation between AHL concentration and fluorescence was established.
• The maximum concentration of AHL detectable before our system got poisoned was 20 μΜ.
• Successfully cloned and sequenced ChrB and ChrP.
• Our experiments could not confirm a chromate dependent interaction of ChrB and Pchr.
• Successfully cloned and sequenced PbrR.
• Cloning of PbrAP was unsuccessful.
• Our experiments could not confirm a chromate dependent interaction of PbrR and PbrAP.
• We were lacking time for further in vitro characterizations and experimental setups.
Future Directions
Although we have made great progress towards creating this biosensor, we acknowledge that there are still improvements that could made to develop it further. Initially, our team planned to improve upon the Biefeld team’s work in 2015 by extending what they were able to develop in vivo to cell-free. The team was able to create whole-cell sensors that detected numerous heavy metals, but were unable to transition to in vitro. We were able replicate the potential of our system with our modified LuxR/pLux system, a well-known circuit within the synthetic biology community. However, due to time constraints, we were unable to move the lead and chromium sensors toward cell-free. With more time, we are optimistic our circuits would work with our specially-designed, cell-free vectors.
From there, we would be able to transition from in vitro to cell-free and blot the systems on paper. Although this transition has been proven to be difficult, our collaboration with Purdue and our extensive network of Northwestern faculty that specialize in cell"
XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM-XMU team used simple words with vivid pictures to illustrate the generation and development of this discipline. What's more, we introduced some basic knowledge of genetic safety in an interesting video. These unfamiliar words such as bacteria and gene got across well in our lecture.
In addition, we introduced iGEM, including the start, development and goal of this competition to have the high school students know what we are crazy about. After that we presented some excellent teams, from biosynthesis to software, to stimulate them to enjoy this game. Every program included has its specialty, from bacteria with fluorescence to E.coli that can detect spoiled meat, as well as a kind of automatic LegoTM robot. They were all impressed by the charm synthetic biology shows. iGEM-XMU, a good team with two gold medals in Asia division in the last two years was invited to MIT to compete with the top undergraduates all over the world and achieved a great success. We then introduced our development and our 2013 team, including our project.
We got to know that China had four teams entering the 2012 iGEM-HS competition and made a brilliant achievement. In order to get a better popularization of iGEM-HS in China, we show these high school students some interesting iGEM-HS programs to draw their attention to this competition. Our efforts paid off. Inspired by what they saw, these high school students hoped to popularize synthetic biology and iGEM to make contributions to the development of this interesting project. They believed they can organize a next Chinese iGEM-HS team as well with our help in lab and other aspects. They wished that we can keep a long interaction and cooperation.
During the lecture there was a really positive interaction between these high school students and our team. Every student participates in the competition, answering questions related to biological safety and some lucky dogs won our special rewards. In order to have a better and deeper communication, our team members and high school students exchanged E-mail address and telephone number with each other.
Campus Fair
We held a garden party and related exhibition with the theme of synthetic biology and iGEM in the Gui Huashan Building, Xiamen University on July 17th afternoon.  The whole activity included three parts——synthetic biology exhibition, game and the Killers of Three Kingdoms cards presentation. To help the participants learn synthetic biology is a challenging but attractive process. These high school students could enjoy the interests in science and technology, know the knowledge about biology and think over ethics in life science through our activities.

FUNDRAISING FOR TAIES
We held multiple sales in our school throughout the year to help raise funds for TAIES. At these sales, we also performed simple bandage tests to test people for ALDH2 deficiency. Through these sales and donations, we raised and donated a total of 15,000 NTD to TAIES.
COLLABORATIONS
NYMU-Taipei
We have continued our long standing collaboration with NYMU-Taipei. Several of our members have attended weekly meetings with the team and discussed our projects together. They have been very generous in lending us chemicals and reagents (PEG 8000, MR17 broth). Additionally, they have provided access and instruction for several instruments. Specifically they provided protocols, cuvettes, and access to an electroporation machine so that we could attempt electroporation into Lactobacillus casei and Lactococcus lactis. They also provided access and instruction to a 96-well plate reader so that we could test the efficiency our alcohol induced promoter (BBa_K2539550). In return we have helped NYMU with the cloning of biobrick parts. Lastly, TAS and NYMU teams worked together to help troubleshoot the interlab study and measurements using their plate reader.
Near the DNA submission deadline, we assisted NYMU by cloning their ALB-mCherry (BBa_K2751012) and mEGFP (BBa_K2751011) part into the standard BioBrick backbone pSB1C3. We did this for them while they were also trying to clone the same part, just in case their ligation and transformation was unsuccessful. Both teams were successful and this helped them verify that ligation and transformation of their part was successful.

Tsinghua,2010,Team:Tsinghua#project#outline#m2_-_-_TEXT.html," degradation of the cellulose. The structure of CBD has been resolved shown in the figure below. Our purpose is to utilize the ability of CBD to bind to cellulose and express CBD in E coli and thus force it to bind to microarray coated with cellulose substrate.
Displaying protein OmpA
At present, two kinds of membrane protein are known, that is, alpha helix protein from cytoplasmic membrane and beta-barrel protein in bacteria outer-membrane, exemplified by porin protein. There are two membrane layers in gram-negative bacteria, separately called inner membrane and outer membrane. OmpA is located in outer membrane and belongs to beta-barrel category. This protein is responsible for normal physiological functions in gene regulation in E coli. Because OmpA is located in outer membrane, intensive investigation has been conducted in OmpA because OmpA plays an important role in signal transduction and much work has focused on the mechanism how OmpA was transported from cytosol out of the membrane. Because of the clarified function of the protein, some bioengineers managed to utilize its function to display protein to achieve certain purposes. Therefore, we try to take advantage of the properties of OmpA to display protein, that is, to display CBD, antibody and antigen. The structure of OmpA has been determined, illustrated in the following figure.
Previous work has demonstrated that 46-159 amino acid is adequate to anchor OmpA to membrane and from the topology figure, we can find out that the fragment of AA 46-159 comprise the transmembrane part of the protein, as the red box indicates. Besides, to ensure the transport of OmpA from cytosol to cell membrane, we need to add a signal peptide to the N terminal of OmpA. Previous work found that one kind of lipoprotein in E coli contains a signal peptide consisting of nine amino acids, which ensures the successful transport of the protein outside the membrane. Mining through the parts provided by iGEM, we found one part which provides exactly the same sequence we wants. This part contains N terminal signal peptide and the sequence AA 46-159 and the linker region downstream of OmpA which ensures the folding of the attached domain, such as CBD. The engineered OmpA is illustrated as following.
The selection of antibodies
Due to commercialization of antibody, we have no access to the cDNA of these antibodies. Therefore, we managed to synthesize the cDNA.

Extracellular Electron Transfer Model
Extracellular Electron Transfer (EET) process can deliver the electrons between electrode and cell membrane with mediating functions of redox active molecules including FMN and riboflavin. It can be subdivided into the oxidation of reduced mediator and reduction of oxidized mediator in electrode.
We establish a model kinetics of electrode process on the basis of Bulter-Volmer equation to illustrate the oxidation of reduced mediator in electrode. Firstly, we make several assumptions just like the following tips:
① Although both of FMN and riboflavin can serve as mediator in electrode redox, we only take riboflavin into consideration for simplification in the model.
② There are two kinds of EET pathway model for riboflavin mediating. One of these called single-electron transfer in which riboflavin acts as cofactor of MtrC protein and can be reduced into semiquinone (Sq) with the standard electrode potential of -260v. Another one is two-electron transfer where the dissociative riboflavin binds to outer membrane  c-Cyts as a cofactor in the hydroquinone (Hq) form with shifted potential of -145v. Under conditions of the same electrode and concentration, the exchange current density of single-electron transfer is much high than that of two-electron transfer since enzymatic reaction can greatly decrease its activation energy. Therefore, we assumed that current generation reaction in anode mainly belongs to the single-electron transfer.
③ Oxidation of Sq in electrode is the reversible first order reaction. The net rate for this kind of reaction is made up by the difference between oxidized rate of Sq and reduced rate of riboflavin in electrode.
Accordingly, current density in anode can be calculated by Bulter-Vlomer equation:
 
(12)
Reduction and Oxidation reaction rate constant can be calculated by Arrhenius equation:
 
(13)
 
(14)
As for the reduction of oxidized mediator in outer membrane for Shewanella, we establish a kinetics of enzyme catalyzed reaction on the basis of Michaelis-Menten equation, accordingly.
① Similarly, we also consider the single-electron transfer as the only pathway in vivo.
② In such single-electron transfer process, riboflavin reduction kinetics characteristics follows the general rules of enzymatic reaction.
③ The reduction of riboflavin is related to the reducing state"

The students had to transcribe this template DNA into mRNA to find a code to unlock a briefcase left in                         the room. Inside the briefcase, a second clue led the students to translate the mRNA strand into its corresponding amino acid strands to break into a computer.                         Various other tasks including finding parts of a biobrick and placing them in the correct order and determining where mutations occurred in an altered DNA sequence                         ultimately led the students to hack into an email, find where the mosquitos were, and contain them before they could reach the outside environment.
The students seemed to really enjoy themselves. The escape room was successful in promoting synthetic biology in a fun and new way. The students were challenged academically, but ultimately managed to complete the activity. In the future, the University of Iowa’s iGEM team hopes to collaborate with                         Trio again to create more hands on activities that encourage younger generations to potentially pursue a career in synthetic biology.
TAs for the Honors Primetime Synthetic Biology Course at University of Iowa
Some students in our iGEM team worked with freshman from the class of 2022 on real life lab skills in synthetic biology.                         We began by teaching the students about proper sterile technique and the importance of properly documenting their work. We had the students perform the 2017 Interlab.

Note
In order to be considered for the Best Model award , you must fill out this page.
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.
Here are a few examples from previous teams:
ETH Zurich 2014
Waterloo 2014"
TU_Munich,2010,Team:TU Munich#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," identity site corresponds to the recognition site of the switch .
We simulated the termination and antitermination properties of our transmitter-switch constructs with NUPACK and the kinetic behavior with Kinefold web server and used some standard estimations for diffusive terms. Our main goal was to prove that our constructs work and that termination is stopped efficiently, that is, that the transmitter molecule binds and antitermination occurs before the RNA polymerase falls off.
Results
We successfully constructed several switches and their corresponding transmitter RNA in silico on a thermodynamical basis. We modified different transcriptional terminators in such a way, that the formation of the terminator was prevented by a transmitter molecule. As desired, this only occurred if the transmitter molecule contained both, a trigger and an identity site. Analogously, we were able to design and verify a NOT gate using the same thermodynamical approach.
Our estimations for the switches obtained by the in silico approach indicated that diffusion is negligible. Our RNA dynamics simulations showed for each switch that for appropriate transmitter length the terminator is not folding, hence antitermination is successful. We also found that much smaller transmitter length is suitable for antitermination. Finally, we showed using the example of an AND gate that logic gates based on our transmitter-switch constructs work well.
In silico design
In the following section we will describe how we theoretically designed our switches and their respective transmitter molecules. Our goal was to develop synthetic modified terminators consisting of a target and a recognition site in the described manner (compare Implementation ). As explained, only the complete transmitter RNA may shift the switches´ state, but neither the trigger site nor the identity site alone. This is the prerequisite to fulfill all mentioned requirements for a functional switch allowing to construct logical gates as discussed previously . We implemented this by optimizing the thermodynamically parameters for pairing of each subsegment (identity site, trigger site, recognition site, target site) .

For all NUPACK simulations, following parameters were used if not mentioned explicitly. A temperature of 37°C was used in combination with the default Serra and Turner (1995) energy parameters. Default 1.0 M Na+ salt concentrations were used. For simulating several strand species, 3 nM switch concentration and 50 nM transmitter concentration were used, which equals conditions in a e.coli cell with a low copy number plasmid coding the switch and accumulation of transmitter RNA.

What's for the iGEM Server?
Considering that 83.3% teams (55/66) have encountered the                 situation that the iGEM server got slower or went down when                 it is close to the freeze of wiki, we decide to                 linearize all our request. It means if you want to build                  a page and post it to iGEM server, you have to queue for a while                 until people who requested before you finish their queries. To                 speed up all the requests, we create more than ten queues, which                 we believe is enough to handle them. And we hold the opinion                 that our platform will contribute a lot to ease the burden of                 iGEM servers, if it is accepted by other teams.

Present and Future
By using Flight iGEM, teams can spend more time on their experiment, which will help them to focus on synthetic biology. Flight iGEM has been available online since late august, and iGEM teams from 14 countries have visited our platform. But before the Flight iGEM was available online, many teams had finished their wiki work, so we did not get too much users (while NUDT_CHINA is one of our users this year, and they have given us some precious advises which helped us a lot), but our survey indicates that more than 93.93% of iGEM teams(62/66) are willing to use it next year. We host our source code on GitHub, so you can fork Flight iGEM on github . And we also provide a  concise document for the project, which we hope will help you to get aware of the project quickly.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.

Compared with other model organisms like Mus musculus, which needs approximately two to three months to mature, C.elegans possesses shorter life span. A self-fertilizing hermaphrodite can maintain its genetic information and live for two to three weeks [8] . Meanwhile, worms can also propagate sexually to get genetic recombination offsprings.
The Connectome of C.elegans.
Why AWA AWB neuron?
Normally, the formation of a new ability is coordinate with the specific environment signal, so in our project we need the specific stimulus to train worms form new abilities. We hope to localize the target neurons directly by stimulus in C.elegans for the demand of accuracy and efficiency. Different behaviors of worms are controlled by different neurons, and due to their sensitivity to odors, many behaviors, such as attraction, avoidance, feeding, or mating, can be induced by different chemicals.
In our project, we choose the olfactory neurons ( AWA &AWB) to accomplish our design. The attractive odorant diacetyl is normally sensed by the AWA olfactory neurons. The repulsive odorant 2-nonanone is detected by the AWB olfactory neurons. With the expression of CoChR and Chrimson(photosensitive proteins) in these neurons, worms can develop attractive and repulsive responses to blue light and red light, so we can use lights to induce their learning behaviors.
What is Skinner Box?
Skinner Box, invented by Burrhus Frederic Skinner(1904—1990), is a laboratory apparatus used to study animal behaviors. It uncloses the secret of the operant behavior and deeply influenced American education at that time. Skinner divided the behaviors into two types: respondent behavior which induced by some known stimulus like Pavlov's dog, and operant behavior caused by a subject itself like Skinner's pigeon. In our life, most behaviors or reflects are operant behaviors and operant reflects, so it’s very important to study the mechanism of Skinner box. It is a shell chamber that is large enough to easily accommodate the animal. (Commonly used model animals include rodents—usually lab rats-pigeons, and primates). An operant conditioning chamber permits experimenters to study behavior conditioning (training) by teaching a subject animal to perform certain actions (like pressing a lever) in response to specific stimuli, such as a light or sound signal.

Fluorescence results
In order to check if both constructions are functional, we induced expression using several media as depicted in this protocol . The supplemented SD media (which contains methionine and histidine but not leucine nor uracil) allows the selective growth of transgenic yeasts to obtain a big inoculant which will grow better in a glucose-rich media (YPD8%), leaving us with a culture in exponential phase and high biomass. The expression of ZsGreen1 takes place when our yeasts are deprived of glucose and there is presence of ethanol. Further information about molecular mechanisms is here .
In order to quantify cell growth and normalize fluorescence, the DO at 600 nm of each sample was measured. Fluorescence intensity was measured at an excitation wavelength of 493 nm and an emission wavelength of 505 nm.
Figure 3 shows expression of ZsGreen1 in our transformed yeast –and not in non-transformed yeast– in YPRE broth , that is, in presence of ethanol when glucose is absent. Figure 4 shows intracellular expression of our protein. Moreover, there is such a great level of ZsGreen1 expression that it can be seen it with a naked eye, as shown in Picture 5.
Further experiments are required for a better characterization of our constructions, in which we are already working, but cannot be shown because of the lack of time.

Expectations:
 
We expect to see lower mRNA expression of IL1a and TNFa in the +shIKK +LPS samples (columns 1,2,3) when compared to the WT +LPS samples (columns 4,5). This would indicate that the infection was successful and that IKKb was indeed knocked down, leading to a decrease in cytokine secretion. We also expect to see a lower expression of cytokines in the -LPS wells (columns 6-10) when compared to the same treatments with LPS (columns 1-5). The no cDNA column should show no result, as there is no cDNA present to amplify. This column acts as a negative control in order to identify a contamination, if one occurs. Βeta-actin acts as an housekeeping gene, therefore we expect to see similar expression levels in all samples 1-10.

Discussion:
The IL1a qPCR results were not reliable. We noticed a high disparity in the given values and Cq curves without the exponential shape. As this experiment was the last attempt, out of several, to quantify mRNA levels of IL1a after using two different primers, we decided to exclude this cytokine from further experiments and continue exclusively with TNFa.
The TNFa results agreed with our expectations. There is a clear reduction of TNFa between the +LPS +shIKK samples when compared to the +LPS WT samples. This indicates that the shIKK vector successfully induced knockdown of the IKKβ gene. These values were later used with other repetitions to create the graphs shown below.

According to the Danish decree, an assessment of the possible dangers to human safety and health, as well as to the outer environment of the biological systems used and produced in the lab, must be done before the project is executed in the lab. Additionally, the lab classification must be validated by the Danish Working Environment Authority. You will find the risk assessment further down the page. With regards to the lab classification and validation, the lab is well established and it’s classification has been previously validated.
All team members active in the wet lab received a mandatory lab safety course held by Simon Rose (a representative of the work environment group at BMB) before embarking on the wet-lab adventure. From him, we also got a handbook in lab safety.  The work environment group at BMB is the equivalent of a biosafety committee. The group concerns itself with the general work environment for the employees and, as a part of this, with the safety of the lab. With only three members of our team having done projects in a class 1 GMO lab prior to this summer, safety concerns could be raised. However, since our team members completed the lab safety course before embarking on lab work, our project was approved and good to go.
Moreover, the team members who participated in team DTU-Denmark’s workshop on synthetic biology did a separate electronic lab safety course before we were allowed to enter their lab. Both lab safety courses covered how to work with genetically modified microorganisms (good laboratory practice), how to handle waste, use of safety devices and what to do in case of an emergency.  Researchers Safety During our project our lab team members came into contact with several potentially harmful chemical agents, such as ethidium bromide, DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), and antibiotics. When appropriate, gloves were worn and reagents handled in a fume hood. GMOs were always handled wearing gloves. Furthermore, lab members washed their hands after wearing gloves and before exiting the lab. Also, team members wore lab coats when working in the lab, and took them off before exiting the lab area.
A UV board was used for viewing bands in agarose gels. UV rays are also a minor source of potential danger as high rates of radiation are carcinogenic. Yet, the dose from the table is quite small, and both a fixed screen and a wearable facial screen are provided in the room. Also, it is emphasized not to leave the UV board on longer than necessary.

We exchanged experiences about the struggle to assemble a team, and what are the different difficulties we had during the project development. It was really interesting clashing this contrasting experiences of living an iGEM competition.
The Visit!
     On April 24, 2014, our team was visited by Dr. Carlos Gustavo Nunes Silva, Instructor of the Federal University of   Amazonas Team ( UFAM_Brazil ). He presented his experience in previous editions of the iGEM competition, ongoing projects,   and gave us important advices. Dr. Nunes Silva also spoke about the philosophy of the competition and teamwork, and how   iGEM initiative enhances the training of young researchers. This networking was crucial -- he questioned us about our   skills and lab infrastructure, and thus, we realized we had real conditions to participate in iGEM 2014. Here we are!
iGEM Teams collaborating with our survey!
     Our survey was also applied to virtually all iGEM Teams and other Universities worldwide, with representation from every continent. To date, we have received 64 responses out of Brazil, from all five continents, as follows:

SZU-China,2016,Team:SZU-China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," national renewable energy laboratory of Unite states, found that green algae will continue to produce hydrogen for more than 70 hours, after sulfur deficiency stress.
Figure1: Western blot analysis of photosynthetic proteins from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii[3]
The reason is that the key protein of PSⅡ( such as D1) will be inhibited after sulfur deficiency stress, the photosynthesis activity go down, respiration activity is no affected, so the oxygen concentration will be reduced and the hydrogenase’s activity will be enhanced which will allow the hydrogen to be produced.
Figure 2: Time-course of the PSII primary photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fmax) in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii suspended in media of variable S content[3]
Then the second problem occured.We learn that the only way to use green algae to produce hydrogen is to control its photosynthesis from this experiment, So another question pops out: green algae depend on the photosynthesis to be alive, but hydrogen production and photosynthesis can’t happens in the same time. If we let green algae produce hydrogen for a very long time, great damage will occur to the green algae , even leading them to death eventually. That’s why we need to find the balance between the two process of photosynthesis and hydrogen production to eventually making the whole process work.
Solution：In the year of 2011 two-stage cultivation was created to produce hydrogen. Their method is growing chlamydomonas (a kind of green algae)in normal medium first, let it fully grow , and then put them into a medium which lack of sulfur，which will inhibit the photosynthesis and let the Chlamymonas produce hydrogen. After a certain period of time they put them back into normal medium to make them grow again.  By repeating the two steps again and again, the green algae can continue to produce hydrogen for a long time. In this way they solve the problem of the contradiction of the two process, the hydrogen production and photosynthesis.

Transcription and Translation
Transcription speed was estimated to be 45 nt/s [7]. Since the mRNAs have all a different lengths, the transcription rate depends on how many nucleotides have to be transcribed per mRNA.
e.g.:
mRNAEsaR_EsaI_CepR: 2400 bp -> ~1 mRNA/min
mRNARFP:                         850 bp -> ~3 mRNA/min
Same is for translation which depends on the length of the amino acid sequence of the Proteins translated (20AA/s [8]).
e.g.:
EsaR: 250AA -> ~5 molecules/min

The Binding of Proteins to other Proteins or DNA in this model was measured in molecules/time related to the cell volume. Most references showed a value of e.g. 0.1 1/(nM*min). Those values were converted back to the values mentioned before, because in Simbiology all parameters should be kept in the same unit (molecules). For details, see the list of parameters below (Tab 1).
Parameters
Most of the parameters were estimated based on literature values of the LuxR/I system due to the lack of literature about the EsaR/I and CepR/I quorum sensing systems. For all parameters standardized prefixes were used to keep the model clear.

Namely, we considered fluorescence spectroscopy as tested by Parker et al. (2008), where 410nm output was indicative of iron incorporation as per assembled ferritins.
Apart from using magnetism to manipulate magnetoferritin to isolate pathogenic DNA, we developed a backup approach. Watt et al. (2012) constructed a nanoscale battery where ferritins with two different cores were oxidized and reduced on gold electrodes. We are contemplating using a split TALE capture system to bring ferritin into close association of an electrode. Current could then flow from ferritin into an electrode to indicate binding of pathogenic DNA.
Finally, we considered how we might construct a magnetic device to isolate ferritin. Bushart et al. (2006) discussed methodology for isolating metal chelating magnetoferritin for metal purification. However, the necessary magnetic field strengths, mesh density, or mass of isolated compounds in these systems were not explicit. Thus, we are still uncertain about the feasibility of using magnetism to isolate proteins attached to magnetoferritin.
Week 6: June 3 - June 7
The application of ferritin in our project has changed substantially. Due to uncertainties of using magnetism to isolate proteins attached to ferritin, our team proposes instead to use it as a nanoscale protein scaffold. Our team was inspired by the work of He et al. (2011) who used gold nanoparticles bound to ssDNA to detect DNA in a lateral flow strip assay.
We have decided to modify the aforementioned system. We’ll replace gold nano particles with ferritin and ssDNA with TALEs targeted to pathogenic E. coli markers. These nanoparticles will bind pathogenic DNA via TALEs, be drawn up through a strip via capillary action, and become immobilized with complementary TALEs affixed to other regions on the strip. A reporter marker will also be fused to the recombinant ferritins to allow visualization of the pathogenic DNA.
This system is unique since double stranded sample DNA could be detected without having to first melt the DNA. Cheap prototypes for such a system could be constructed and would be suitable for cost constraints in the beef industry. Moreover, this system is amenable to scale-up for the identification of multiple pathogenic markers on a single lateral flow strip. We are, however, unsure as to what to use as a reporter enzyme.
We also met with two U of C professors in nanoscience to discuss the feasibility of our magnetism idea. Dr. Max Anikovsk"

Legal aspect
Our project focused on a current problem that is not given due attention, depression and anxiety disorders. There is a large number of uninformed people on the subject, since many are barely aware of the symptoms or causes of a depressive or anxious disorder and due to the above, people tend to normalize these diseases by letting them pass indefinitely without giving them adequate treatment. In addition to developing a psychobiotic that can combat the adverse effects of stress that causes inflammation in the body and leads to depression or anxiety, the team wanted to take advantage of their intervention in the topic to help create awareness layers through social networks and thus promote the preventive culture and encourage people to ask for help when necessary.
On the other hand, several events were created in our community where experts on the subject were invited to give the public the opportunity to express their doubts and share their experiences. From our human practices and the feedback obtained from these, the goal of our project was shaped to become what it is now.
Initial contact with a professional
Disinformation. We wanted to break paradigms and establish a concrete mentality about the disease we wanted to attack with our project, understanding the patient.
Galilea 2000 A.C.
Informative speech about the “must know” on depression and anxiety. We should see the disease from the true eyes of a person with the disease.
Kurago Biotek
Not responsible. We thought that our product could be made working alone with E. coli, without considering the adverse effects that this could cause in people.
Panel with experts, stundents, and parents
Target. The panel helped us identify new groups of people vulnerable to these diseases, we adapted our product and market studies according to the new information recollected.
Science diffusion in elementary schools
A brief introductory class to elementary school kids on the basics of biotechnology, their applications and their daily usage. We thought that they wouldn’t have interest.
Meet-Up
Gathering with Latin-American teams, including all Mexico´s teams for feedback, collaborations and support, both professional and personal.

Summary
We analyzed the questionnaires filled out by the students after the lectures, and obtained crucial information about their opinions and intentions. Guided by the questionnaire, we wrote a report to apply for a specific funding for iGEM-HS in Beijing and began to guide three students from the SHSBNU towards their future participation in iGEM competition.
Questionnaire Analysis
Figure 1. Questionnaires.
In order to learn more about what high school students thought of synthetic biology, iGEM, and our lectures, as well as what kind of support they needed, we constructed a questionnaire. After the lectures, 53 students (24 male and 29 female) from the audience filled out our questionnaire.
Questionaire. (PDF Chinese Version)
Questionaire. (PDF English Version)
The data we obtained from this questionnaire was of greatly beneficial for us. According to Question 1 and Question 4 in the questionnaire, we recognized that over three-fifths of these students have not heard of synthetic biology and over nine-tenths of students have not heard of the iGEM competition before our lectures. Therefore, it is extremely necessary for us to popularize the concept of synthetic biology and iGEM before taking any other steps forward.
Figure 2. Question 1 and Question 4
What makes us impressed the most was that nearly 60% of the students in attendance desired to take part in the iGEM competition, according to Question 6, which means our lectures about synthetic biology and iGEM did attract a good majority of students' interests. This enables us"

I heard about iGEM contest because of a friend of mine and I thought that all the concepts surrounding it were pretty fascinating. During the contest I've taken part of both lab and human practises issues (particularly these last ones). When I'm not at the lab I spend most of my time listening to music (Can you guess my likes and dislikes from the profile photo?) and reading whatever.

I am a student of biotechnology and I've been doing lab work during this months. I think the iGEM competition is a good way to gain practice, be creative and also to learn how to work in group. What I usually do in my free time? mmm...well, I haven't free time since I started in the iGEM. Before that I spent my time with my friends, reading a good book or watching series and monologues. I hope see you soon!

Hi! I'm recently graduate in marine science and I really love marine mammals.
So you may wonder ¿why the iGEM? It was simply because I thought it was a good way to open myself doors and to learn new things which, moreover, I am enjoying a lot.

Several gRNA vectors can subsequently be assembled into one vector with a Cas9 expression cassette and then be transformed into yeast. The expression of Cas9 together with gene specific gRNA´s leads to double strand breakage followed by non-homologous end joining repair or homologous recombination, in case of added repair DNA (figure 3).

Design
We designed a novel toolbox to gain the complete control over all major functions of the peroxisome. The toolbox is our solution for improving the engineering workflow and predictability of synthetic constructs. Interested? Find out how.
Scientific background
The root problem
Synthetic biology is an engineering discipline. And while we are able to plan our constructs with tools like biobricks, a major difference to e.g. electrical engineering is that they are not nicely isolated on a chip, but surrounded by all types of interfering agents. One of the major issues regarding protein expression in a novel chassis is unwanted and unexpected crosstalk between engineered pathways and the native cellular processes of the production host. A further issue is toxicity of the products or intermediates of the pathway. Both can greatly change our system’s behaviour which in some cases leads us to having to trial-and-error find a solution, making our previously modeled optimization useless.
Our approach
The natural approach of organisms to deal with metabolic interference and toxic byproducts is subcellular compartmentalization. This has proven to be a functional solution in naturally occurring pathways in eukaryotes as well as new synthetic pathways for biotechnological application. Thus, the creation of a synthetic organelle presents a suitable strategy to increase the efficiency and yield of non-native pathways. A common approach is to build up artificial compartments from scratch. Many breakthroughs have been achieved in the last decade, however the creation of a fully synthetic compartment is yet a milestone to reach for. We on the contrary want to start by engineering artificial compartments through orthogonalization.
The peroxisome is the ideal starting candidate as it has many advantages over other compartments, including it being able to import fully folded proteins and not being essential in yeast under optimal growth conditions. Our project’s aim is to create a toolbox for manipulating and creating customizable peroxisomes as a first step towards synthetic organelles.
By modifying the import machinery of yeast peroxisomes only selected proteins will be imported into the peroxisomes leaving the researcher in full control over the content of the peroxisomal lumen. Furthermore our toolbox will include a secretion mechanism for the synthesized products, various intra-compartmental sensors, modules for the integration"

After our providing some knowledge about yeast prions, we are glad to see these who haven't known prions before answering the questionnaire changed their contradictory attitude to prions and the percentage of them  holding the 3 different viewpoints is similar to that of people know about prions before respectively. About 64% of people are not worried about the application of yeast prions and agree that we should use them carefully enough. Clearly we can see that our efforts worked and the public can make their own decisions rationally after being equipped with related knowledge.
Finally we got many ideas about new applications of prions and difficulties we should consider from the reponders in question 6 and 7.
Here are some of the answers.
Question6: ""To make some temperature-sensitive medical devices."" ""Maybe we can use it for 3D print by controlling its aggregation."" ""We can develop targeted drug with it by connecting prions with devided pieces of drugs. We inject the dispersed prions into the patients and let them to aggregate in the focuses, thus the pieces of drugs can be self-assembled and work."" ""Since yeast prions are sensitive to some drugs, can we employ them to test these drugs?"" ""Is it possible to use them to control the programmed death of fungus in bioengineering?"" ""What if we try to construct micro-robots with prions?"" ""If we can find how yeast prions be affected by some drugs, maybe we can find similar structures in human's prions, thus we can find a cure for Alzheimer's disease."" ""Maybe it can be used to produce a new kind of glue and we can control whether it works by changing the temperature."" ""Since they could be connected to macromoledules and their aggregation can shorten the distance of these chemicals, maybe they can become catalyst in industry.""
Question 7: ""Are you sure they are safe enough for humans only by analyzing theoretically without conducting a lot of experiments?"" ""Please be careful when transforming yeast prions to prevent producing another ""mad cow disease"" for humans."" ""You should try to provide enough information for media first to avoid them from spreading wrong reports and misleading the public."" ""You should make efforts to maintain their activity for a long time if you want to apply them to industry successfully."" ""Maybe you can change its name to make it sound less horrible for the public."" *Prion was translated into Chinese as ""Ruan Bing Du"",which means protein virus. ""Consider potential side-effects to the environment and you should ensure they are not spreaded out of labs or factories."" ""Make sure"

USTC,2009,Team:USTC Software#When_-_-_TEXT.html," So far, this input box is perhaps the simplest one after discussing a lot with our USTC wet team. By proposing many possible solutions, they chose this one. After the publishing of current version, we hope feedback from users can help improve the next version.
Mathematical model
Q1:
The general mathematical model seems to cope with two nodes coupling together at most. How about more than two nodes?
A1:
In current version, we allow more than two nodes reaction function as user-defined form which requires the users to input themselves. Actually, it is easy to add more than two nodes form reaction functions in the model. But the condition of computation time and RAM space will drastically be exacerbated as long as the interaction is related to more than three units. For the next version, we will change our data structure to accommodate more types but more efficient.
Meanwhile, we do believe the 'two-body' approximation to be a moderately acceptable choice. With reference to the classical way physists dealing with Hamiltonian of multi-electron system, we expect the same approximation for interaction among substances - that is, all multi-substances' interaction could always be boiled down to two-body interactions.
One possible mathematical approach is to adopt Tylor Series expansion to shorten each term describing interactions. The physical nature of this mathematical method is nothing but exactly how two-body interactions are interwined to form multi-body interactions.
If three substance x, y and z have an interaction form of 1/(x+y+z), when concentration have significant differences, tylor expansion might work to introduce a perturbation in to this system, avoiding complex calcultions.
Algorithm
Q1:
Can this software run faster and faster?
A1:
Firstly, in our software, we choose and modify these best optimization algorithms carefully by comparing with possible optimization algorithm. How to improve the efficiency of optimization algorithm is an open problem in computer science and mathematics. Collaboration with experts in this field is needed.
Secondly, the speed is quite dependent on the performance of computer. We test these programs separately on Linux system in our high performance workstation. The result is fairly better than the test on our personal computer.
Thirdly, to improve the algorithm performance, parallel computing is a better choice. For this reason, the algorithms we adopt are parallel in nature and extension to parallel algorithm is possible. In the future, we will rewrite our software this form via MPI.
Q2:
Can this software run more and more precisely?
A2:
The imprecision is largely caused by Local minimum and initial value dependence. Similar as above, these are also open problems. For we adopt Monte"

6. Design
6.1 Introduction
Our project focuses on using optogenetics technique to control the simple movement of C.elegans. We have successfully expressed different kinds of opsins in different tissues of the worm, and finally controlled it under specific wavelength LED lights. Actually, this technique has much more potential use in medical treatment and scientific research.
6.2 Medical treatment potential
6.2.1 Treatment of paralysis
Right now, we could already make some simple control of C.elegans’ movement, so optogenetics has potential to help the disabled to gain their athletic ability again. After reading papers we found that this work has been done by professor Linda Green Smith, London University. They insert opsins into embryonic stem cell of mouse, and they add signal molecule to let the stem cell grow into neuron which can transport signal between spine and other parts of body. Next, they input these neurons into mouse whose ischiadic nerve has been cut. 5 weeks later, they used blue light to stimulate the nerve and they found that the mouse’s muscle on leg has shrink reaction. So as we can see, this technique will finally be used on human being. At the same time, right now the only way to help patient is using electric to stimulate the muscle, however, this method will bring extra pain to the patient. Once the optogenetics used on paralysis treatment, the stimulation will be more gently so that the patient will feel better.
6.2.2 Treatment of neurodegenerative diseases
Optogenetics is a new thought to treat neurodegenerative diseases, for instance, parkinson’s disease is an illness which has strong impact on human brain health. Prof. Fan Yang’s group expressed chETA at culturing neuroglia. They found that under the stimulation of blue light, the neuron will differentiate to neuron, at the same time, the neuron cells they got has obvious molecular maker which owns by dopaminergic neuron. So we have great chance to use optogenetics into the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
6.2.3 Treatment of depression
Last but no least, we know that it’s difficult to cure depression right now. So what if we try to use optogenetics into treatment of depression? One method today to treat depression is using electric stimulation to stimulate neuron in order to make it alive. However, this method may make some damages of brain tissue. With gentle technique like optogenetics, we may find a better way to solute this problem.We can stimulate the dopaminergic neuron and let it secret more dopamine so"
Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Indigoidine_-_-_TEXT.html,"F, delH5 and tycC6; Search set: non-redundant protein sequences without organism restriction;
The 50 closest related protein sequences contained in each the library were subjected to a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using clustalO ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/ ). with standard parameters for protein alignments. For library generation iv), each query sequence was BLASTed separately and the 50 best results of each query were combined i.e. a total of 250 sequences for the MSA.   After library generation, the following three methods were employed to design different synthetic T-domains.
Consensus method
Based on the  .clustal file obtained from the MSA of the homology libraries, a consensus sequence using the UGENE software ( http://ugene.unipro.ru/ ) with a threshold of 50% was created (i.e. if an amino acid appears in 50% or more of all sequences at a specific position it is considered as a consensus amino acid). For the creation of the synthetic T-domains, this consensus sequence was used to fill the gaps where there was no consensus amino acid with the original amino acid from the indC T-domain. By this approach, T-domains were generated which might deviate from the original sequence at positions with at least average conservation but coreespond to the original one if there is less conservation.
Guided random method
In this approach, the multiple sequence alignments (MSA) generated by the consensus method was used. Implemented in R [Referenz], a position-specific profile was generated which has the same length as the MSA and contains the rate at which amino acids occur at any given position of the sequence alignment. The synthetic T-domain is created by position-wise generation of the sequence where the probability of choosing an amino acid at a given position is determined by the rate in the profile.
Randomized generation method
For generation of synthetic sequences by the randomized generation method, every amino acid was assigned a score of 1 or 0, i.e. occuring at least ones or not at all at a given position in the MSA. In the subsequent generation of the synthetic T-domain sequence of the synthetic domain, any amino acid assigned 1 had the same likelihood of being chosen at this position.
Seven synthetic T-domains were designed based on differnt combinations of the homology libraries and sequence generation methods.

Tolerance of B. subtilis against alkaline pH
Figure 11: Comparison of B. subtilis cell growth under different pH conditions Shown is the change in optical density over a time period of 14 hours. Cultures were exposed to different pH final conditions (pH 7 till 10). To adjust the pH NaOH or water was added after one hour (indicated by the red dot).
In the course of Peptidosome generation, B. subtilis will be exposed to alkine conditions. Therefore we performed a pre-test to check the tolerance of B. subtilis towards high pH. Cultures were treated with four different NaOH molarities to adjust the final pH in the wells to 7, 8, 9 or 10. NaOH was added after one hour of cultivation (Figure 11, highlighted by the red dot). The experiment was carried out in a plate reader to follow the change of the optical density (OD600) over a time period of 14 hours.
Figure 11, shows the growth of B. subtilis under various pH conditions. No significant changes in growth can be observed for pH 7 to 9. However, under pH 10 conditions, B. subtilis stops growing and shows a slight decrease in optical density. To check if the bacteria were still viable after the high pH treatment, we transferred bacteria at the end of the assay (after 14 hours) to agar plates and could obtain colony forming units. Thus, demonstrating that B. subtilis was able to recover and continue growing normally. Overall, we could clearly show that B. subtilis can survive the process of Peptidosome generation in regards to the pH conditions.
B. subtilis in Peptidosomes
After we have proven that B. subtilis can survive the designed encapsulation process, and that the organism cannot use the building block Fmoc-FF as a nitrogen source, experiments to entrap the bacteria were started.
For this we resuspended an appropriate amount of bacteria in the Fmoc-FF solution. Afterwards droplets of this were placed on an ultrahydrophobic membrane and exposed to CO2 for 10 minutes, followed by a transfer to water or LB medium.

As for FliG, this protein is responsible for the rotation speed and torque power of the bacterial flagella. For our aims in this part of the project, which are to increase the speed and power of the bacterial flagella, we decided to focus on FliG.
In a study by Gina M. Donato and Thomas H. Kawula, it was shown that HNS is not only a transcription factor but also that it can change some protein’s activities through direct interactions with them. .

Arriving at the Idea
Week 9
After an in-depth literature analyzes we have gained the knowledge there currently there are two main state of the art technological solutions of biological part characterization – microwell plates and microfluidics - have both positive, but more importantly considerable negative aspects in terms of acquiring high-throughput activity and sequence linked data and seems to require completely new approaches in order to remove those negative aspects.
More
First of all, the microtiter plate technology approach offers a way to connect biomolecule sequence to activity by physically separating the biomolecule samples in physically separated plate wells. As the location of each biomolecule is known, a robot can quickly measure the activities of biomolecules in each well. Yet, the limiting factor in this case is extracting DNA template encoding the biomolecule from each well and sequencing it, while not losing the information about what activity was recorded for that particular encoded biomolecule. Therefore, as this method offers a precise way to connect sequence and function, its throughput is rather low.
On the other hand microfluidic technology approaches offers rapid biomolecule internalization into small droplets, where each droplet then works as a separate microreactor. In this way the throughput is a lot higher than in microtiter approach. For example, libraries of 109 different biomolecules can be screened in a single experiment. Yet, the problem with such approach is that even though it offers a lot higher throughput and droplets can even be specifically sorted into few different categories, once a scientist wants to sequence the DNA molecules which are contained in those, for example, 109 droplets, the droplets need to be broken. As the water droplets are broken, different biomolecule encoding DNA is mixed together, and the activity information about each particular biomolecule is lost.

Week 11
We have decided to arrange a meeting with Karolis Leonavičius from Droplet Genomics who specializes in Microfluidic Technologies and single molecule research.
More
We talked about advantages and disadvantages of microfluidic technologies as a whole and then we went on to discuss the case of our interest – biomolecule activity screening and characterization. According to Karolis, single biomolecule encapsulation in nano-sized droplets is already highly optimized and efficient. There also is a lot of research describing efficient expression of biomolecules in those droplets.

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,". That should guide treatment decisions, because the whole point of antibiotics is not to treat the clinical signs, but to treat the infection. The idea is that if you treat the infection, the clinical signs should get better. […] Currently, what we use in our research are just PCR tests, but the problem is in most of the places where trachoma is, they don’t have good labs where they can easily perform PCR tests. […] So a point-of-care test you could do in the field would be great. […] I think you guys are right on, because it sounds like the test you are developing is cheap. It has to be cheap. [...] Most of the trachoma programs in developing countries are based on donations [...] so it’s hard for them to afford testing. […] Important would be that it doesn't has to be frozen and that it would be easy to use also for a non-technical person to use, that would be ideal.
Daniel C.:
So what are your different projects concerning trachoma?
Dr. Keenan:
We do different things. We are looking at the frequency and the target-population as well using mathematical models. The WHO recommends giving antibiotics once a year, and we try to see if you give them more frequently to eliminate chlamydia quicker. So we have done randomized trials with villages  to take antibiotics once a year, or twice a year, to see if this speeds up elimination. It is a disease you can get your whole life, and it‘s mostly kids who get infected. Kids are actually much easier to find in a community, because they are in the fields most of the time. So if you could get away with just treating the children only, that would be great. That would be much easier than have to treat the entire community, also due to the antibiotic cost. So that’s why we have done trials where we targeted our treatments only to kids […]. Basically we treat to see how we can get antibiotics better and usually in the context of an cost-optimized trial. [...]                                 The other big trial we have done in the field is about WASH, so WAter, Sanitation, Hygiene. A lot of people think that if you don’t affect the underlying hygiene of the community, the antibiotics can only do so much. So we are trying to improve the hygiene with water points, doing hygiene education, to see if that can prevent trachoma.

We also organized simulating experience for Alzheimer's disease and autism, which highly improve the public understanding about brain disease and the possibilities of synthetic biology and appeal more love and care to patients of neuronal diseases.
In the special lecture for high school students, we used logical relationship of simple experimental parts to show them what synthetic biology and iGEM competition is and how we perform our subject. When introducing, we focused on the tortuous process of our project design and the improvement according to the result of every attempt. We discussed with high school students how to make an affective element for certain purpose. The conversation discussed the possible treatment for brain disease with synthetic biology and also sparked students’ scientific curiosity.

In the next part, several students volunteered to experience simulating experiments held to enable them feel the difficulties caused by neurological diseases about our subject. We provided VR glasses for them and they could use these special glasses to watch certain special videos which recorded visual world of patients with autism or Alzheimer’s disease. For example, a girl student saw what a little boy with autism saw with VR glasses. The boy in the screen was sitting in a mall with his mum, while the girl student said she felt uncomfortable and helpless throughout the whole process. “I’m trying to imitate others and spare no effort to contact with the outside, but nobody understands me.” Because the boy with autism could feel every subtle change of light and sound and enlarge them, he was easy to become anxious and restless. Worse, people with autism couldn’t communicate with others so that nobody could relieve them, in which case, they were caught in a vicious circle.

Here are some feedbacks from students in NFLS:
i)  Xth: This activity opened a window of synthetic biology for me, bringing the advanced technology close to our everyday life: experiments in the lab can actually make a difference to cancer patients, children with inabilities and even to ourselves. The lecturers from both team NFLS and NJU spoke in a very simple but professional way. More importantly, their collaboration made the introduction comprehensive and diversified.
ii) Szh: Though tough to learn, biology, as a branch of science, explains many natural laws, which help us get a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of the world. Some biological knowledge can be applied to our daily life and brings to us more convenience. During this workshop, the speakers explained to"

Sheanne also explained to us that focusing on middle school integration gives teachers the freedom to create an option class designed to support the current curriculum.   While STEM integration is already being applied at the middle school level, our team has decided to focus on integration of STEAM based learning. STEAM helps to create a more well-rounded student by further stressing the importance of art based learning. The field of science and technology is constantly evolving, and STEAM initiatives allow for a more creative problem solving ability in such an environment. Our interview and research inspired us to draft a basic curriculum proposal to start the conversation of STEAM integration and to provide a foundation in future curriculum development in Alberta.

I am a high school student of Nankai High School, Tianjin and a student team member of iGEM 2016 Team: NKU_China. I have many hobbies since I was a child. Yet, once I entered high school, I gradually got interested in scientific research due to the great academic atmosphere of Nankai High School and now I am fond of studying mathematical problems. Moreover, it is for this very reason that I managed to join the iGEM team of Nankai University: NKU_China. This summer, I have learnt fundamental knowledge of synthetic biology from senior student team members. Also, I tried several basic molecular cloning experiments and spread the basic ideas of synthetic biology to my fellow friends in high school. I hope that I can achieve more in the field of synthetic biology in the future.

Plastiback, as an alternative to physical sampling, fills the gap in technology that can detect ocean plastic. Plastiback also has the added benefit of being able to collect plastic and degrade it, converting these fragments, especially microplastics which otherwise pollute the ocean and interfere with the lifecycles of marine organisms, into electricity.
