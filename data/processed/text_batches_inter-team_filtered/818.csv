Given two vcsfmt, find the difference betweem them and produce a file to be put under version control, which we call vcscmp
Reproduce the original input file from a vcsfmt or a vcscmp file.
The dwndiff utility still leaves a lot of work for the user to do. The user must scan in the file to track to produce a vcsfmt file, then track that using an external version control system (many suuch options are noted above). The user must then perform the same operation on that file whenever it is changed to produce a vcsfmt file, and then run dwndiff again to produce a .vcscmp file which will be tracked, and so on for each successive iteration. When another user wishes to use the changed file, they must obtain the vcscmp file from the version control system, then run dwndiff with the ""unzip"" option to obtain the original file. Future versions will automate this nonsense and reduce the hassle.
1. Recover original file from vcsfmt or vcscmp file
Run dwndiff as follows:
dwndiff <file1> <file2> -c [-w -p]
As before, this takes in files and produces an output, which can be written to file or stdout. If written to file, it will have the "".vcscmp"" suffix. The difference between this and the previous command is that dwndiff can only have two input files for this mode of operation, and the input files must already have been preformatted by dwndiff. The resulting output, whether sent to stdout or to the specified file, will be the difference between the two, which, when reviewed by a version control system such as git or svn, will appear extremely small.
2. Take two vcsfmt files and produce the vcscmp ""diff""
Run dwndiff as follows:

As before, this takes in files and produces an output, which can be written to file or stdout. If written to file, it will have the "".vcscmp"" suffix.

Decisions may     also favor a diversified response, in which some cells respond     strongly to a signal while others are downregulated or cease to     respond. For instance, in the human immune system, even though     all T cells initially react to an antigen, only those with a strong     response proliferate and produce an immune response. Many of     these decisions are facilitated by a signaling factor, which the     cells sense and produce more of.
Our goal is to understand how a group of cells uses sense and     secrete communication to make a community decision. Therefore,     we have chosen to pursue the Information Processing track.
We are designing multicellular systems in which different yeast     strains communicate with each other to form a community     decision. By engineering systems in which strains with variable     initial responses develop the same response, or strains with the     same initial response diverge to develop a bimodal response, we     can model interesting communication systems, such as those of     the immune system, leading to more novel insights about how     cells interact to produce a specific response.

PROJECT UPDATE
In this week’s Newletter, we are going to use more graphs to      illustrate our ideas and process. If you have any questions or      advice, please just email us :)
This week, we have been invited to the iGEM Conference in Taiwan,      where we shared our work and results with many teams in Asia.      That’s a great trip and we learned a lot from this meetup!
This is the poster we used in the meetup which provides your more      details about our project compared to last Newsletter.
Currently, we are trying to figure out the optimum conditions of C.      Crescentus development, transformation and expression, which      will tell us how to develop the holdfast in C.Crescentus within      control. So, we can extract the gene regulating the expression      of holdfast in C. Crescentus and build parts with the regulating      system.
In the future, based on the current results, we will construct the      light sensing-response system. And furthermore, to guide the      accomplished system into E. coli and C. Crescentus as well as to      test the function and efficiency of ribozymes.
You may be curious what this little project can lead us to. Here is      our answer:

What are the existing methods of air pollution monitoring?
Pollutant diversity in air and water is so important that no single universal means of detection can exist. Methods must be adapted to the targeted pollutants and the environment in which the pollutant is found. Existing monitoring tools are classified into two main groups: active and passive detectors. Those technologies are then subdivided according to their analysis type: physical, chemical or biological.
In the following table, we show the different means of VOC detection. The principles of some methods (continuous analysis scanner, integrated measure by active and passive sampling) are then detailed as well as biosensor’s advantages and disadvantages compared to existing methods. [7] [8] [9] [10]
*This physical method uses a pump in a continuous manner, a pre-concentration device followed by a chromatographic column and one/two detection systems that use flame ionization or photo ionization.
**The integrated measure by active sampling is a two-step method. First a sampling is carried out by pumping through a cartridge containing adsorbents (graphite black carbon), then the sampling is analyzed in the laboratory by chromatography coupled with flame ionization or mass spectrometry detection.
***The integrated measure by passive sampling is a two-step method. First a sampling is carried out through diffusion tubes containing an absorbent, then a laboratory analysis is made using a chromatography coupled with flame ionization or mass spectrometry detection.
VOC detection methods using biological elements present numerous advantages compared to other physico-chemical methods described above. Even if biological detection methods require laboratory work that can only be carried out by trained people to avoid contamination and dissemination issues, they can, by using appropriate technologies, surpass currently used pollutant detection methods [11] [12].
Whole cell biosensors for environmental applications require the selection of a detector sensitive to the pollutant or group of pollutants to be detected and a reporter system, as well as a suitable method of presentation of the biocatalyst to the transducer. [12] As the pollutant recognition profile of a promoter (used as the detector element) is usually made up of only a few molecules, a biosensor’s output can be very specific and informative. [13]
In addition, according to the strength of the output signals, the quantity of initial signals (quantity of pollutants) can be determined [13].
By modifying the genetic construction, the targeted pollutant can be changed, as well as the sensitivity of the biosensor (the amplitude of its response to"

If it is remained in the environment, it might be eaten by other organisms, which should either be mega fauna (animals of big sizes) or micro fauna (animals of small sizes). When eaten by mega fauna, tiny traces of streptomycin avermitilis are not harmful; when eaten by micro fauna, it cannot be digested before CNC resolves and the degradation period of CNC is far longer than that of avermectin. It's also safe if it remained uneaten when later it resolves or it still remains in our delicately designed device.
-Meanwhile, the toxins E.coli is safe because its degradation period is shorter than that of CNC.
-The CNC carrier doesn't cause any problem about safety because it's a kind of lignocellulose which is easy to degrade after a certain period. Its raw material comes from waste wood which is eco-friendly.
-Our device also contributes to the safety of our project. When it is put indoors, it may be
influenced by mega fauna or micro fauna. Mega fauna wouldn't cause any trouble because the device is fixed and the entrance is too small for them to go in. As for micro fauna, even if they get into the device, safety is still not a problem (see Paragraph Two ).
How to improve the safety of Termite Terminator?
We choose Avermectins:
Environmental Safety
-Can be decomposed easily by microorganism in soil
-Sensitive to sunlight
-High selectivity: only have effects on a few certain pests including termites and cotton aphid
-Completely safe to large mammals under recommended concentrations
Application Safety
-Completely safe to users under recommended concentration
-Already existed mature industrial production system
-Already have more than 3000 registered avermetin-related products in China, passing the security check of AQSIQ (State General Administration of the People's Republic of China for Quality Supervision and Inspection and Quarantine)
An Inducible Promoter
In our plan, we shall build four constructs to express toxin proteins that helps killing termites. In case that our bacteria get outside and leak the toxic protein into the environment, we use an inducible promoter in our constructs. Only when there is arabinose in the medium, can the promoter work as usual. There is no arabinose outside the lab, so our bacterium won't leak the toxic protein.

Cambridge,2009,Team:Cambridge#Notebook#Week4_-_-_TEXT.html," a system that takes an input and at given threshold levels, turns on an output, our pigment. Potential systems have been put forward:
The repressor is constitutively expressed at a level determined by its controlling promoter. It prevents production of a pigment until sufficient activator is present that it overcomes the inhibition, perhaps through a competitive inhibition mechanism. A given input concentration producing a specific amount of activator will be unable to switch on the pigment until a level matching the repressor is reached. A range of strains with different repressor levels could be used to create a 'ladder' of thresholds for the switching on of different pigments.
Placing the amplifier system after this, perhaps with a positive feedback system (the activator driving its own promoter) would permit not only amplification but also allows for a latch so that pigment production, once stimulated, remains on. This would be important in an enviromental sensor to maximise an output that was clearly visual.
It was also suggested by a very intelligent engineer (he didn't write that) that placing the amplifier before the threshold system could be used to change the output for a given input by changing the effective input to the system. With one amplifier a 50um input, say, would produce brown, but with a different amplifier in place the sensitivity of the system would be altered and this input would produce violet. This permits a tuning of the system.
Research into implementation is underway.

Ampiflication - Threshold Device
The data from the plate reader indicates that we could use our amplifiers as a means to create strains with different sensitivities.  In the case of I746391, it appears to act as a digital switch, turning on GFP expression at an arabinose concentration that is lower than the arabinose concentration necessary to trigger significant RFP expression.  This shows that only a small amount of activator is necessary to activate GFP expression, and hopefully different activator/promoter constructs will have a different switching threshold.  This means that we already have two different sensitivities to arabinose: pBAd has a lower sensitivity to arabinose concentration and produces a linear response, while I746391 has a higher sensitivity to arabinose"

Determining the Optimal Seeding Cell Concentration for Mammalian Cell Cultures
OBJECTIVE
With this experiment we wanted to define the optimal starting cell population of different cancer cells lines, in order to avoid overgrowth and detachment of the mammalian cells in our experiments.
PROCEDURE
Variable amount of cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and their growth was assessed via microscopy after 24 hour growth in DMEM medium (supplemented with 1% streptomycin, 1% penicillin and 2% FBS).Two different cell - lines were tested, namely HEK-239 and HeLa CCL-2 lc. The use of HeLa CCL-2 lc allowed to monitor the growth of the cells via fluorescence microscopy as these cells are producing constituively citrine. A detailed protocol for this experiment is available in Protocols.
RESULTS
From the microscopy pictures obtained after 24-hours incubation, the optimal cell concentration range was defined between 60'000 and 600'000 cells/mL in a 96-well plate. For higher concetrations the mamallian cell culture seemed to approach confluency.
Figure 8. Pictures of HEK-239 cell cultures with different initial cell-concentrations after 24-hour incubation. The starting concentrations were spanning from 600 cells per well up to 600'000 cells per well, and the total volume loaded was 0.1 mL per well.

CONCLUSION
The optimal seeding cell concentration to avoid overgrowth was set to 100'000 cells/mL (between 60'000 and 600'000 cells/mL). The same value was used also in experiments"

To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture.

Genspace,2015,Team:Genspace#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," from 20-40 mg/l. A quick search showed that there are two parts listed within the IGEM registry that are able to detect nitrate: Part BBa K216005 and Part BBa_K381001. The first part is a PyeaR promoter, responsive to nitrate, nitrite and nitric oxide. Unfortunately, this part is not available. The second part, BBa_K381001, consists of PyeaR and GFP compound, and was in the 2015 registry. We could use those parts to construct a similar circuit in which NsrR is constituitively produced. PyeaR is normally repressed by NsrR,but when Nitrate or Nitrite enter the cell they are converted to Nitric Oxide which binds to NsrR, halting the repression and allowing the production of any pigment or fluorescence gene or operon downstream of the PyeaR promoter.
Outputs: In discussions with community representatives, we found that a real time indicator of human waste pollution was desirable. A bright color change indicating human waste pollution would act as a visual indicator and serve not only to alert the community but also to serve as a rallying point around remediation efforts. They requested a bright color such as red, which would also psychologically signal danger from an excess of pollution. A colored substance that would remain within the device and not diffuse out would also be desirable. (find out if RFP size is consistent with the pore size of the filter we were looking at).
Combining these three inputs with a colored output would be achieved by building the following three devices:
Biosensor 1. Nitrate from sewage
Biosensor 2. AHL from Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Biosensor 3. AI-2 from Escherichia coli
Build strategy
Our build strategy had a unique component- we decided to use the Rapid DNA Prototyping (RDP) System from Synbiota to assemble and test some of our parts and  prototype biosensors before putting them in BioBrick format. The RDP system has the advantage of speedy assembly of multiple sequential parts, and it is technically easy to use even for amateur synthetic biologists and high school students (the two major contributors to our team).  We feel that our pioneering use of the RDP system represents a step forward for citizen science, and we have expanded on that theme in the Human Practices section of our wiki.
Our first step was to test-drive the RDP system with a simple biosensor build. The RDP: Lux + Rudolph device was constructed using the Synbi"

Abstract
Formaldehyde Eliminator: Engineered Microbes for Detecting and Biodegrading of Formaldehyde
Formaldehyde brings different degrees of harmful symptoms to us humans, such as eye, throat and skin irritation, and even carcinogenicity, which is widespread used in construction and decoration industries. In previous iGEM projects related to formaldehyde, several problems still need to improved, such as 1) the present sensing threshold of formaldehyde concentration (~ 10 ppm) is far upper beyond the environment-protecting standard (~ 0.1 ppm); 2) the degrading system seems to work unstably, although some survival or duration after formaldehyde addition was observed. We constructed a more sensitive and effective E. coli-based system for detecting and further degrading formaldehyde in environments, basing on current systems. Additionally, to promote the real-world application, we tried to design a prototype which can be used in a real environment.
As following is the visual demonstration of our project.

1. Introduction/Background
Methods to capture insects in the nature
Fig.1
In the nature, organisms capture and eat insects by various ways. For example, spiders make cobwebs to capture insects. Nepenthes has pitchers which lure and trap insects. Pyrearinus termitilluminans, which makes and lives in a tunnel around the external surface of the anthill of termite Cornitermes cumulansand, emits light in the first week of the rainy season to lure and hunt the termites.
What is the feasible method to capture insects for Carnivorous E. coli?
Fig.2 : Drowning drosophilas
However, the feasible methods to capture insects for Carnivorous E. coli are limited. Because Escherichia coli moves very slowly and can only exist in the form of colonies on an agar plate or in liquid culture medium, it cannot exist in the form of complicated shapes. Considering these features of E.coli, one way for Carnivorous E. coli to capture insects is to lure the insects to itself, and bind them on the colonies or drown them in the liquid medium.
We noticed that drosophilas sometimes drown in electrophoresis tanks. Hence we are convinced that a liquid medium is a feasible and simple way to capture insects. If E.coli can lure insects(drosophilas), it can capture"

Suspend the colonies contained two plasmids, and plate them with inducers or without inducers (control group). Use fluorescent stereoscope to test the expression of GFP and RFP of colonies. The best result we get is from strategy c (fig 14), Bistable is upstream of AND gate, and C1 with the RBS of B0030. The difference of control group and experiment group is distinguished (fig 18).
Fig 18. The best result of the third strategy. Fig 18a: control group, without induction. 18b: induced group: suspend the cells, add 5uL 1M salicylate and 5uL 1M arabinose, plate together with the cells. 18a and 18b are both merged pictures, for original individual figures, please follow this link
Discussion:
We found that the copy number of different plasmid and RBS of C1 can really influence the result. With strong RBS, such as B0034, some colonies become red without inducing, while with weak RBS, like B0033, no one colonies become red after saturated inducing. These data are not showed here. When assemble a complex system, the bridging part (C1 in this assembling) is crucial: it should adjust output of the previous circuit (AND gate in this assembling) to the proper input of the next circuit (Bistable in this assembling). Thus, we need to try a lot of conditions, different plasmids and different RBSs, to get satisfied results.
Results of the last strategy (three plasmids):
We have constructed the three modules, AND gate, Bistable and T7-CI, on three different plasmids: pSB4K5, pSB1A2/pSB6A1 and pSB3T3. Then we transformed them into E.coli one by one. Then the colonies contained three plasmids were picked into 3 mL liquid LB and incubated until the OD600 value reached 0.4~0.6. At this time, we used different combinations of different concentration of arabinose and salicylate to induce. Every two hours we discarded 2mL LB culture, and added 2mL new LB into it, and the concentration of inducers should be kept. Repeating this step for 3 times"

Mercy ships:
In order to find a cheap and effective way of distributing our product, we first spoke to the director of marketing for the charity Mercy Ships (a charity we originally perceived to be a floating hospital that docked at areas where infected people were), Brian Walshe. After speaking to him and discussing our idea we realised this wasn’t going to be an efficient way to distribute our product, as it turned out that in order to keep a barrier between them and infections on land, their ships stay out at sea. This was a minor setback but ultimately a big positive, as talking to him we came across another consideration; could our prevention work and be packaged in such a way that our bacteria could kill Vibrio cholerae and Shigella using RNA interference? This idea eventually led to the idea and development of our spiRNA.
Clinical Microbiologist:
Brian Walshe from Mercy Ships directed us towards looking into infection control, and was able to pass us on to an infection prevention specialist who we presented our project to, along with a consultant in medical microbiology, Rob Porter. They helped us greatly by answering some of our main concerns such as the positive/negative impacts our project could have on communities and whether they would even use something that involves GM bacteria. They were very enthusiastic about our idea and thought it had great potential, saying that the communities we are aiming towards are unlikely to be concerned about GM bacteria, as they wouldn’t have a lot of knowledge on the subject. They also suggested we think about how to contain the bacteria; our answer to this would be to use one of the many killswitch parts available on the iGEM registry of standard parts."

As pCold allows that alginate lyase be 6X His-tagged, we are in process of purification with Ni column to study the effect on alginate and P. aeruginosa biofilms.
Amplification of Signal Peptide sequence of ChiA74 and cloning into the pCold
    Analysis in silico of the putative alginate lyase of B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis AM65-52 (GenBank accession number: CP013275.1) indicate that this gene does not have a signal peptide ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/ ), for this reason we decided to control the secretion of these genes with the signal peptide sequence of ChiA74. The spchiA74 was amplified from the vector pEHchiA74 reported in Barboza-Corona et al. (2009), digested with KpnI/PstI and then ligated into the pCold-algy previously digested with  BamHI/Kpn (Figure 3). This construct is transformed in E. coli to generate E. coli/pCold-spchiA74-algy. This signal peptide will allow the secretion of alginate lyase in E. coli. We are in process to check the effectiveness of the spchiA74 to secrete the alginate lyase comparing the enzymatic activity of E. coli/pCold-algy versus E. coli/pCold-spchiA74-algy.
P. aeruginosa biofilm formation
    In order to check the effectiveness of the alginate lyase synthesized by E. coli, we standardized the biofilm formation  according with  O´Toole (2011), which is stained in blue (Figure 4). Once we check the effectiveness of the alginate lyase, we  will be able to test the effect on the P. aeruginosa biofilms.
Inhibitory effect of nisin
    We tested the effect of commercial nisin on pathogenic bacteria. We found inhibitory activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus. This is not a surprise since nisin has effect on Gram positive bacteria. However, when we tested the activity against P. aeruginosa we did not  find  inhibition under the concentrations of the bacteriocin used in the assay (Figure 5). P. aeruginosa is a Gram negative bacterium and nisin has"

Background
Our project “The Gatekeeper” is based on two scientific publications  : the work of Marciano et al. (1998) on the pIV porin electrophysiological characterisation, « An Aqueous Channel for Filamentous Phage Export. » and  Spagnuolo et al.’s (2010) on defining the gating regions “Identification of the Gate Regions in the Primary Structure of the Secretin pIV.”
The pIV porin that we used for our project comes from the bacteriophage f1. It is a filamentous phage that infects Gram-negative bacteria and is capable of assembly and release without lysing the host cell, allowing it to continue to grow and divide. The assembly of the phage is coupled to its extrusion which is done by a machinery composed of three phage-encoded proteins : pI and pXI in the inner membrane and pIV in the outer membrane.
More precisely, pIV is secreted in the periplasm and then inserts into the outer membrane, where it forms a radially symmetrical 14-meric complex with a barrel like structure.
Marciano et al.(1998) brought a lot of elements to build our project and furthermore to create protocols. In fact, in this article, the pIV porin channel behavior (produced by the filamentous phage 1 to export virions out of its E. coli host) is analysed. This article describes two types of porin pIV, on the one hand the Wild Type porin and on the other hand  a mutant porin pIV (pIV*S324G). Marciano and his team wanted to see if between those two pIV porins some differences in the permeability of the E. coli’s membrane appeared. Let’s remember that staple.
First thing to know, the phage F1 produces a channel porin pIV that is placed in the outer membrane of E. coli. This channel is closed (avoiding the lysis of the bacteria) except when the phage is leaving its host ⇒ So it’s possible to open this gate but surely thanks to a gating mechanism provided by the phage. However, this last article showed that when using the pIV mutant ("

Fudan-CHINA,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," link between production rates and dynamic range. Thanks to it, we now have a clearer way to achieve a higher dynamic range.
Explanation of large background noise
In the beginning, our wet experiment shows a relatively large output of our system in spite of low concentration of the exogenous ligand, which is not quite as expected. This phenomenon reduces the dynamic range of the system, resulting in a decrease in the sensitivity of the system to the concentration of exogenous ligands.     Through the formula we obtained from the modeling of differential equations (Equation 18 and 19 in Section 1.2.2 of our entire model report ), α and β are both positively correlated with the system output. This explains why the excessively high chain generation rate enhances the background noise. So we can simultaneously achieve greater dynamic range and smaller background noise by reducing the two production rates at the same time, as long as the factor (α-a0ζ)/β is always small.
Protease cleavage ability
Introduction
Due to random collision or exogenous ligand, a PC chain and a TC chain will be combined. There are two situations after that. In the first case, after a period of time T the protease cleaves the transcription factor, then the two chains are separated. In the second case, there are not enough time for the protease to cleave the transcription factor before the two chains are separated. Obviously T is a random variable, and the more likely the cleavage occurs, the smaller its mathematical expectation E(T) is.    Whether the cleavage is prone to occur is mainly determined by the catalytic efficiency of the protease, and is also affected by other factors such as the length of the intracellular segment of the PC chain and the TC chain. For the sake of convenience, we say that protease cleavage ability is stronger if the cutting is more likely to occur.    In order to research the relationship between dynamic range and protease cleavage ability via this stochastic process, we need to consider two typical cases: the concentration of exogenous ligand is nearly 0 or large enough so that the system output is saturated.     Let us focus on how a TC chain behaves in the two situations. At first, it moves freely on the membrane (State 1, the free sate). After a period of time it is combined with the PC chain (State 2, the bound state) due to random collision (in the first case) or an exogenous ligand (in the second case), and then it is either cleaved by protease (State 3, the inactive state)"

Additionally, the “group favorite” and “starRating” fields are also     important for individual evaluation of the parts, which doesn’t get     the deserved attention from the iGEM groups. “Group Favorite” defines     the confidence on the part by the designer group. “StarRating” defines     the related part in terms of popularity and usage efficiency among the     groups. According to our observations, most groups are not aware of     either of the fields or they are used incorrectly or ineffectively.     For example for a part with a full reporter which is known to be functional     and gives precise and expected results the StarRating should be at least     2 stars, but for most of the parts in 2010 distribution, it is very     difficult to observe a part whose “StarRating” is above one. For quick     determination of functionality of the parts these two evaluations are     important so they have been included in the proposed standardization     template. But, as they were not properly used up to now for the re-organization     of the parts information during the development of our software application     we had to include all parts to our queries regardless of their evaluations     based on “Group Favorites” and “ StarRatings”
Second step for building the standardized template was to get the     phylogenic information about the parts development process which includes     the name of the group, designer and contact information, along with     the comments from the group on the parts they have submitted. Contact     information is especially important for iGEM as other groups who need     extra information about the available part can reach to the required     information. Even though contacting with the designers of the individual     parts which are available is highly encouraged by iGEM, unavailability     of contact information points at out the fact that iGEM’s parts registry     needs strong re-organization in order to serve to the synthetic biology     community properly.
Additionally, the “group favorite” and “starRating” fields are also     important for individual evaluation of the parts, which doesn’t get     the deserved attention from the iGEM groups. “Group Favorite” defines     the confidence on the part by the designer group. “StarRating” defines     the related part in terms of popularity and usage efficiency among the     groups. According to our observations, most groups are not aware of     either of the fields or they are used incorrectly or ineffectively.     For example for a part with a full reporter which is known to be functional     and gives precise and"

Berit Haßing
Hello everybody!
Welcome on our home page!
My name is Berit Haßing and I am a member of the iGEM team of the Georg-August University Göttingen. As most of the other team members I am currently in the second semester of the master study course “microbiology and biochemistry” and I really enjoy studying here in Göttingen! Last year I gained my bachelor degree in the department of microbiology of the University of Osnabrück and currently I am planning to further specialize in the field of microbiology and genetics.  I decided to participate in the iGEM competition because of the possibility plan a complete project and to work independently in a group with further students. Of course I hope to learn a lot and meet interesting new people at the jamborees!
Greetings
Berit
Bianca Genenncher
Hello everybody and welcome to our wiki. My name is Bianca Genenncher and I am a member of the first iGEM team of the University of Göttingen. It is my second year of the Biochemistry and Microbiology Master in Göttingen and I just finished my first lab rotation in the microbe-plant interaction department of Prof. Schirawski. During my Bachelor studies in Göttingen my main focus pointed towards the molecular plant biology examining the plant´s reaction on invading pathogens. Last year, I was studying in Scotland at the University of Aberdeen. I really enjoyed my time abroad working together with students from other countries with interesting cultural backgrounds. This is my first iGEM participation. I am highly motivated to start doing the experiments and gain the first experience designing own experiments. Another reason for me to participate is the internationality of this competition. I am also looking forward to have rewarding discussions about the results or different ways to reach the aim with my kind team members.

Winnie Yan Wa Ho
The Wonder Woman/Lifesaver. Winnie is very efficient when it comes to work. Either in the lab, or in Graphic Design team. She can do a lot of things in a short time. She’s also very diligent in naming gel photos and keeping them tidy (the lifesaver of our presentations). Other modules should be jealous of pTet for having Winnie in the team!
✖
Alice Wang Qingyang
Alice is one of the smartest person we have around. She had given us constant encouragement in Modelling, MATLAB coding, and when we encounter difficulties in lab work. She also teaches us how to face challenges with optimism when we face challenges. We sure miss her a lot when she exchanged to Cornell in the Fall semester.
✖
Bonnie Park Hojeong
Bonnie is a kind and amiable person. She always carry with her a big smile and you will find her comfortable to talk with. She loves cats very much and when you find drawings of cats in the lab, we can be 99.999% sure that it was done by her. Having Bonnie as one of the advisor in this year is definitely a pleasure for us.
✖
Edward Ng Siu Wang
Being a final year student but his first year as an advisor (3rd year as iGEM member), Edward devoted a lot of his time to our training at the very beginning despite being busy at his internships and studies. He is the first choice that you would go to when you have uncertainties about lab work in mind since he would always answer you in a very gentle way with extraordinary patience. When you feel daunted or discouraged by your experimental progress or performance, he is also the one telling you not to mind as long as you learn from your mistakes.
✖
Eric Cheung Ming Fung
The lab psychopath. Eric is the team leader of last year’s iGEM team and a first-time advisor this year. He would always question us on our interpretation of our lab results, regardless of if they are positive or not, but that’s just because he wants us to think critically. He may seem difficult to get along with at first due to his constant poker face. However, he does show a quirky side once in a (long) while. His advice is generally helpful and often helps add onto our knowledge. He is crazy in the way that he will only have lunch if his experiments fail, what a lab maniac!

Albert Brown
Throughout my summer, I mostly worked in the lab. With the guidance of the advisors Fatima, John and Alex, I was able to learn a lot about working there, and have been able to carry things out independently when required (such as cloning or further producing our final constructs). The Dundee collegiate wet team members aided greatly in learning the initial ways of how I should go about doing my work; I was also particularly helped by John when performing experiments with the constructs to see if our osmY-hfq fusion was being secreted.
Bartosz Witkowski
Throughout our 8 weeks of iGEM, I worked mainly in the labs to do cloning and experiments. With the help of our lab advisors, John, Fatima and Alex, I was involved in the cloning of our BioBricks and further characterisation by doing experiments such as western blots. I also helped with successfully cloning the spiRNA and working on the motility assays. During the early stages of our lab work I was also helped a lot by the Dundee collegiate team as they showed me how to carry out basic procedures and the art of using a pipette. When I wasn’t in the lab I was working on the wiki content, the presentation or learning some of the concepts behind maths modelling.

We grew this stool by crating a hexagon mold from recycled cardboard and then stuffing the stool with aspen chips coated with mycelium. Within two weeks we had grown a fully functional stool! Images of us crafting, baking, and testing the tool can be seen below.
Step 1: Grow mycelium on yard waste
Step 2: After ~1 week of growth, transfer mycelium to mold.
Step 3: Let mycelium grow; pictured above is after 1 week.

However, in order to have a holistic approach, we also wanted to understand what were the challenges of introducing this material to the public, something we questioned these pioneers on. They all echoed similar statements regarding some social resistance to the use of fungus in products. And perhaps the even greater challenge is shifting policy to favor the production of more sustainable products over cheaper, more environmentally damaging products. However, as Eben Bayer noted, opinions about mycelium are shifting. What was at first perceived as strange and alien, is now the center of growing excitement and research. People are thrilled by mycelium and all the potential it has to help create a better, more sustainable future.
Sustainable Housing
While exploring the design of our habitat for Mars, we realized that the short-time frame for construction of the house combined it’s self-growing and eco-friendly nature might make our habitat useful on the earth.

To further expand our ideas we consulted with Architects Chris Maurer, from redhouse studio in Ohio and a key collaborator on the NIAC with Dr. Lynn Rothschild, and Maria Aiolova, the co-founder of Terreform One , a non-profit that is focused on envisioning what a truly environmental city would like. Both these designers have done work exploring the potential of mycelium in an architectural setting.
Maurer emphasized the sustainable nature of the material, and their relative affordability--he speculated that some of the structures he has designed using mycelium would only cost around $8000 to produce"

By applying an electrical field (10 to 20 V/cm), these gels were used for analytical or preparative separation. Therefore, the desired amount of agarose was boiled up in 0.5x TAE buffer until it was completely dissolved. After the solution cooled down to 50 to 60°C, it was poured into a flat-bed tray and ethidium bromide (EtBr) solution (0.5 µg/ml final concentration) was added. Finally, a comb"

Hi! (whoever is now surfing this site) My name is Marie Wei, a sophomore who is studying abroad in Worcester Academy, Worcester, Massachusetts, US. I am a very easy-going person with many different hobbies and specialties (in various levels of course). In my leisure time, I would enjoy myself by reading, writing stories, drawing, playing instruments, working out and so on. Attending iGEM this year and becoming a member of GreatBay_China is one of the best things that I have ever done in my life. I am the kind of person who always feels enthusiastic about every decision in life. By attending iGEM, I have received an absolutely incredible experience dealing with synthetic biology. Biology has always been one of my passions and interests, by attending iGEM, the only thing I can say about it would be: I am IN LOVE with this subject—totally, genuinely, in LOVE.
During this whole summer, I had great fun with the team, discovered myself and those little tubes more in the lab, and really, generated a large amount of LOVE for biology.
Really. The best experience ever.
Role in team:

Yale,2018,Team:Yale#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," optimize their production of palm oil. We found it incredibly cool that even though both of us were interested in utilizing the unique metabolic pathways found in A. baylyi ADP1, we were utilizing the same organism is wildly different ways. This really showed us the promise that synthetic biology holds for solving real world problems by creatively taking advantage and modifying biological systems already found in nature.
We also spent quite a bit of time talking about how each of our teams were structured. We were especially interested in hearing about how the NAWI Graz team had members specialized for web design, outreach, fundraising, etc… Since every student member of the Yale iGEM team conducts research, we do not have specialized team members working on specific aspects of the iGEM competition. We discussed with the NAWI Graz team the benefits and drawbacks of our differing team structures and were inspired to potentially try out their team structure in the future (i.e. having specialized team members for various aspects of the iGEM competition other than lab research). This would help take the load off the rest of our team so that they could focus on the lab research components without worrying about everything else.
Lastly, we talked a bit about how our teams were funded. Although both of our teams are heavily supported by our respective institutions, we both discussed the challenges of raising enough money to register for the competition, travelling to the Giant Jamboree, registering for the Giant Jamboree, and also covering research costs for the summer. We were especially impressed by the NAWI Graz team’s efforts in reaching out to companies about getting corporate sponsors.
Overall, we really enjoyed finally meeting a team outside the United States to see how iGEM is truly a competition that brings together students from all around the world. After meeting, the NAWI Graz team was kind enough to add us to their WhatsApp group message full of European iGEM teams who are attending the Giant Jamboree and are coordinating a meet-up. We look forward to meeting them all in-person and getting to know them more at the Giant Jamboree."

PCR of lacZ beta from the galactosidase biobrick from iGEM kit. This galactosidase gene does not contain the EcoRI restriction enzyme in the end of the gene. This means we do not have to do mutagenesis to take away the restriction site. I use Q5 protocol and setup. Used primers: LaczBeta forward and LacZBeta reverse – Stop and Non-Stop. Used both galatosidace biobricks found in the kit as template. For the part 9E kit plate 2 (galactosidase w. RBS) I got clear bond for both parts. We will use these parts for future work.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," for Startups Program. The goal of the program is to help early-stage startups to take advantage of the cloud and get resources to quickly launch their idea on google platforms.
This was a wonderful opportunity for us as we were already using google platform to train or Generative Adversarial Networks for novel protein generation. The problem was that the training was very resource intensive and we did not have enough finances run it for a long time.
So, as the partnership between Startup Lithuania and Google has begun, we have submitted an motivational and strategic application to Startup Lithuania.
Soon after, we have received the sponsorship and were extremely happy we can accelerate our research on generative adversarial networks for unique catalytic biomolecule creation.
Protection of the Intellectual Property (IP)
As we are planning to commercialize our solution after the iGEM, we have had to carefully consider on how to protect our work throughout the iGEM year, yet still provide ourselves and other teams the full open-source iGEM experience. For this reason, we have strategized to submit a patent application on CAT-Seq system just before the biological part submission date.
There are some things we also plan to keep as a trade secret (for everything that will be developed after iGEM). For example, it would be smart to keep the connection between our experimental CAT-Seq pipeline and computational Artificial Intelligence pipeline a trade secret. That is because it would be very hard to protect it as a patent. That’s because here would be virtually no way to determine who would be using it, if it would be published as a patent. In contrast, it could be kept as a trade secret for a long time.
Right before the part submission deadline we have successfully submitted a national patent application. Writing the application was extremely challenging for us, as it was the first time for everyone. For that reason we have consulted with the IP department of our sponsors Thermo Fisher Scientific, which have helped us immensely to prepare a solid application. We plan to expand our patent application to USA and to the rest of Europe shortly after the iGEM competition ends.
A short iGEM guide on protecting IP using patents
As we have spent a large amount of time considering and planning the best ways to carefully protect our IP, while still being an active, we thought that this collected knowledge would be useful for the future iGEM teams.
1. A patent is basically a right to prevent others from manufacturing, using or selling your invention. They are very important in biotechnology industry as it takes a long time and to develop a novel product or technology and, also, the cost of that development is extremely"

Design Note
In this occasion, we have added a new Design Team constituted mainly of Design Students at KIT. Here we describe the activities of this Design Group.The main theme of our project is ""At the Intersection of Art and Science"" .  The underlying reason for this selection of this theme is our desire to connect people with science. The poster of our proposed work “E.coli pen and Wiki” was entirely crafted by the design group. We hope that the work of the design group enhances the interest of more people towards synthetic biology.

However due to methane gas is potent for greenhouse  effect for doing experiments, special hood system is designed that could be  used which has its own gas container for storage of gases is used. Thus,  emission of methane gas is controlled. Later on, filled gas container is taken  by department of chemistry to empty with certain procedures. We arranged the  conditions in department for possible experiments with methane gas. And  protective gloves and goggles are equiped for personal safety.Out of the  experiments for storage the gas tanks were saved in area where is cool enough  and never used open flames.

For the steps with methanol the  characterization tests for LUSH protein, methanol is        used. Methanol is hazardous in case of  skin contact, eye contact, ingestion and inhalation. It is flammable liquid.The  safety for this chemical is provided by experimenting in hood with high  ventilation and and so much exposed because it pose a health risk to anyone in  lab.

We had studied with ANS; 1-Anilino-8-Naphthalene  Sulfonate as protein conformational tightening agent for LUSH protein folding  experiments. We searched on safety of this chemical and we found that it is non  hazardous chemical according to Directive 67/548/EE Following reference belongs  to Sigma Aldrich MSDS report.

b. Risks to the safety and health of the general public if  released by design or accident?
The materials  mentioned in part a. could potentially be  dangerous to the general public. We use just enough concentration for our  experiments. We always check the amount both for methane and methanol and EtBr,  because if accidentally released, they could be dangerous to us while  experiments and to lab security.
c. Risks to environmental quality if released by design or  accident?
Since methane is a gas at normal temperature  and pressure, the inhalation of this gas pose a risk for human health and so  for environmental quality. Methane is potent greenhouse gas and compared to  carbon dioxide it has greater potential. This makes methane gas dangerous for  environmental quality in case of release by accident or design.However, as  mentioned in part a, we controlled the conditions for gas and examined in air  ventilated glove boxes.

Our Ph.D. supervisor, and former iGEM participant, Kyle Rothschild taught the importance of human practice and held a workshop in the art of pitching. Our supervisor, Chris Workman, held a very informative lecture regarding the iGEM registry and biological parts, as well as the Interlab study and alternative assembly techniques. And last, but not least, we had the great honor of having Abigail Sison from headquarters talk about the after iGEM initiative and join the panel session regarding team dynamics, outreach, PR, economy and funding activities, where all the participants could ask any questions as they wanted.

The Fun Part
However, it was not all long hours of work and no fun. Small social events were held throughout the weekend, but Saturday night we had a long star run with mixed teams, planned by Nicolai, where the entire team had positioned themselves around DTU with creative, and maybe a bit Danish, humored challenges; for example at one post, participants would guess whether a tweet was made by Donald Trump or Kanye West.
""My fingers are long and beautiful, as, it has been well been documented, are various other parts of my body.""
""I have no interest in working with anyone who is too important or too good or too traditional to take a call at 3am.""
At another post, teams were given a short time period to create a beer opener using only an onion, elastics, tape and fresh baking yeast. Easy to say there were some interesting solutions. One team even had the brilliant idea of hiding a bottle opener inside the onion.
Even though it was a tiring and stressful weekend, we all enjoyed the opportunity of hosting an event of such caliber and the reviews given made it worth every can of caffeinated beverage replacing actual food.
“I (and the rest of my team) really had a great time at DTU, thank you so much for the amazing experience! Hopefully, we will all see each other again soon at the next event.”
“It was a really nice weekend altogether and a good learning experience.”
“I think you did amazing. It might be different for the people on the advanced level but as an undergraduate, I felt it was a nice overview.”
“All of it was great! Good job arranging!”
“Thank you so much for the lab exercises!! And food, I can’t imagine how hard it was to organize everything 😱❤️”
“I honestly never plated bacteria before and I found it very amusing and necessary.”

In-Silico determination of Esterase mutants

Introduction

Experminental validation
Conclusions
Introducton
As we began to build the first prototype of CAT-Seq system, we have quickly realised, that the best way to measure system’s performance is to have a well working Substrate Nucleotide and a catalytic biomolecule pair that predictably catalyzes chemical conversion from a Substrate to a Product Nucleotide. Initially, having a predetermined system output allowed us to track CAT-Seq performance and its early issues instead of performance of substrates and catalytic biomolecules.
For this reason we have chosen a Substrate Nucleotide (N4-benzoyl-2'-deoxycytidine triphosphate) and then screened a library of esterases using standard methods to find an esterase that would successfully convert the Substrate Nucleotide into Product Nucleotide (2'-deoxycytidine triphosphate).
After finding the efficient substrate and biomolecule pair, we wanted to see how CAT-Seq system discriminates between different activities of the catalytic biomolecules. For that reason wanted to mutate our already well-working Esterase to create its mutants, which would have slightly different activities then the original Esterase. Then, we would measure the mutants using standard low-throughput methods to determine their relative. Lastly, after using the mutant library in CAT-Seq, we would compare our high-throughput system results with the results of standard methods. In this way, we can assess the accuracy and precision of CAT-Seq system.
Yet, the addition of the mutations is not an easy task, as even a single amino acid change can inactivate the catalytic biomolecule completely. Therefore, we have decided to determine the mutants of the Esterase by in-silico computational modelling.

Braunschweig,2013,Team:Braunschweig#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," Uppsala iGEM encoding the device J23110-B0034-aeBlue. We tested expression of the blue chromoprotein at different temperatures, oxygen supply and rpm. These experiments led to the conclusion that low oxygen supply and a temperature of 37°C result in higher expression rates.
The evaluation of the leakiness of the inducible promotors showed that only the Prhl is not leaky. Plux as well as Plas were leaky and showed growth of E. coli XL1 Blue MRF' at all tested ampicillin concentrations. Therefore we repeated the experiment using higher ampicillin conentrations.
The bricks containing the fluorescencw markers ligated yesterday were transformed in E. coli XL1 Blue MRF' by heatshock.
Colony PCR of the constructs containing lactonase and LuxI which were transformed yesterday was performed. Since all screened colonies showed religated vectors we decided to try an alternative restriction strategy to combine the BioBricks by using the endonuclease NcoI.
B0032, C0060 and C0061-B0015 were digested with NcoI and corresponding SpeI and XbaI. Gel extraction was performed for the vector DNA as well as the inserts.
Overnight liquid cultures were inoculated with E. coli XL1 Blue MRF' containing the chromoprotein in 2xYT supplemented with chloramphenicol.
Thursday, July 4, 2013
Investigators: Laura, Kerstin
Ligation of the constructs B0032-C0060 (containing lactonase) and B0032-C0061-B0015 (containing LuxI) was performed for 30 minutes at room temperature using T4 DNA Ligase (NEB). Constructs were transformed in E. coli XL1 Blue MRF' by heatshock and plated on agar plates.
As we were still having trouble with the brick C0062 (LuxR) we amplified the brick from the device F2620 using Q5 Polymerase (NEB). Gelextraction was performed for the PCR products.
The chromoprotein cultures were miniprepped and DNA was directly used for digestion to combine the chromoproteins with our promotor-RBS construct. The insert parts were extracted from an agarose gel while the vector part was dephosphorylated and purified using DNA clean-up columns.
Colony PCR was conducted for the constructs with the fluorescent proteins which were transformed yesterday. We were able to identify colonies with the right construct size for all tested constructs.

One of the first steps of our project was to visit the Silver Creek Water Reclamation Facility. This experience was integral in helping us understand the mechanisms of water reclamation. We owe a huge thank you to Gary Hill for giving us a tour of the facility, and for helping us to find ways in which we could help the process to become more efficient. As well, we were able to help those at the facility become more aware of more improvements of wastewater treatment of nitrates and antibiotics which we hoped to address with our engineered biological machine. They appreciated our ideas and the questions and concerns we were addressing. He also provided us with important data about the treatment plants for our experiments.

UT-Tokyo,2014,Team:UT-Tokyo#Counter#Project#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," that the reaction 0 doesn't occur in [0,t). Then from the definition of a,we obtain the equation; P(t+dt) = P(t)(1-a× dt). (Because the probability that the reaction 0 doesn't occur in [0,t+dt) is the product of the probability that the reaction 0 doesn't occur in [0,t) with the probability that the reaction 0 doesn't occur in [t,t+dt).) Using P(t+dt) = P(t) + dP(t)/dt, we get :
equation (21):
<img src = ""
"" height=""50px"" class = ""math"" />
Because the probability that the reaction0 doesn't occur in a 0 second interval is zero; P(0)=1. Solving the above ordinary differential equation we get :
equation (22):
<img src = ""
"" height=""24px"" class = ""math"" />
If r1 is a uniform number from [0,1], the time of the next reaction should be determined by solving P(t) = r1. Using (22), we get t =  -a0/log r1.
Now we suppose there is N types of reactions. Let a1,a2,…,aN denote the respective propensity function of reaction 1,2,…,N. From previous method;
equation (23):
<img src = ""
"" height=""70px"" class = ""math"" />
Let dt be so small that we can ignore the term of higher than two orders of dt. The equation(23) becomes:
equation (24):

"" height=""70px"" class = ""math"" />
Solving (4) (a = Σ_{j=1}^{N} aj)
equation (25):

"" height=""23px"" class = ""math"" />
Setting τ as the time of the next reaction, we get:
equation (26):
<img src = ""
"" height=""45px"" class = ""math"" />
Second we answer the question (B) what types of the reaction will it be? We determined the time of the next reaction, so what we have left to do is to determine what kind of reaction occurs. Some people may feel queer, but in the Gillespie algorithm, first the time of next reaction will be determined, and second the kind of reaction will be determined. It is natural to determine that the probability that the reaction j occurs is aj/a. If r2 is a uniform number from [0,1], j is the"

UCLA,2015,Team:UCLA#Project#Programming Spider Silk_-_-_TEXT.html," protocol on how to perform ICA, see Spider Silk Genetics Protocols
Results
Using ICA, we have generated 10 silk constructs. These include constructs of pure MaSp2 ranging from 3-15 mers, pure MaSp1 of 9 and 12-mers and 12-mers of MaSp1/2 hybrids in 3 different ratios.
Fig 5:Gel image of constructs we created this summer using ICA. pSB1C3 Plasmids containing the sequence verified construct were digested using XbaI and PstI. Results were run on 1% TAE gel. The expected band size for the pSB1C3 is ~2070. Expected sizes for inserts fragments are indicated on the right hand side.
Future Directions
While we were able to construct many sequences of varying length and composition using ICA, we were unable to explore its maximum potential for cloning repetitive genes. We have not established an upper limit on the number of monomers able to be assemble using ICA. In addition, we have not explored the extended use of ICA to create extremely large (greater than 50 monomer units)

Gel electrophoresis was used to verify appropriate band sizes and amplification of the DNA. HO = 720 bp and PcyA = 750 bp. Bands appeared in appropriate places with amplified DNA, indicating successful amplification of the PcyA and HO constructs.

7/5- Jon
PCR amplified PcyA(bc), PcyA(dg), HO(bc), HO(dg), NPF (h beta) [a CBCR], and PSB1C3 with an annealing temp of 55 ℃ was used. Electrophoresis of these samples indicated that these amplifications were successful.
7/6 - Amanda
All 13 CBCR gblocks were amplified with the promoter (Pbad), RBS (B0034), and chitin binding domain. An annealing temperature of 55℃ was used. This amplification was unsuccessful as the CBCRs should be about 500bp, however the gel electrophoresis run on these samples did not indicate any bands in this region.
7/8 - Jon
Nanodropped PCR amplified PcyA(bc), PcyA(dg), HO(bc), HO(dg), NPF (h beta) [a CBCR], to determine concentrations in preparation for a Golden Gate Reaction.
7/11 - Amanda
Tried to optimize PCR amplification of CBCR gblock since the experimental PCR amplification conducted on 7/6 was unsuccessful. The amplification was performed on CBCR2 at an annealing temp of 55, 60, and 65℃. These results were successful. It is hypothesized that the issue encountered on 7/6 was DNA polymerase staying active, due to the previous annealing temperatures, among the 13 CBCR samples.
7/12- Samir
PCR amplified CBCR3 and CBCR4 but changed the extension period from 30sec to 50sec. This was successful for CBCR3 and not CBCR4. This leads us to believe that some CBCRs amplify better than others.
7/13- All
To date, PCR amplification of CBCR’s have only been successful with select CBCR’s. An attempt was made to PCR amplify the previously unsuccessful CBCR’s to determine if the extension period was not long enough. CBCR 4, CBCR 6, CBCR "

Pasteur
The Pasteur Paris 2016 team did their project about capturing mosquitoes and analyzing whether they were inffected, pretty neat. They needed people evaluation of it, so we answered a few questions for them.
Tianjin
The Tianjin team joined their forces with  Valencia_upv, Pittsburgh, NTU-Singapore, Virginia, Pasteur_Paris teams and made a questionnaire covering different aspects of synthetic biology.
Munich United
The Munich team made a pretty good research about enabling factors in biotechnology and we collaborated with our input.
Toulouse France
The Toulouse France team did a really useful video guide teaching the synthetic biology basics. It included subjects from PCR to transformation. We contributed to their work by doing a voice-over in portuguese for their videos, so future teams from Brazil could watch it in their own language. The videos have a lot of different languages choices available. It is in their wiki.
USP-UNIFESP Brazil
We must also consider the USP-UNIFESP team as a collaboration for us. Even tough our teams did not have any active collaborations, their guidance and advices really helped us a lot. During our visit in their labs, they helped us with vital information about genetic design. During our first iGEM steps, they were also present and helped us to get university support. At first, the idea of jointing both teams was a real possibility for us.

Gold
In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, two additional goals must be achieved:
1. Provide a convincing validation, testing the performance of the development -- experimentally (can be outsourced) or by other teams and users. Note, even if the algorithm or tool turns out not to work that well, the Gold requirement is fulfilled if the test is good and the analysis convincing. Validation may include: preferably experiments, informatics analysis (complexity, run time) of an algorithm, or user studies.
To find out whether Easy BBK is a user-friendly software which can help people with search biobricks of good quality and present their bio-systems. We have contacted 9 members of SJTU-bioX-Shanghai and members of SUSTC-Shenzhen to conduct user studies. More detailed information of user studies are available here: https://2014.igem.org/Team:SJTU-Software/Project/UserStudy.
And the second goal can be any one of the following:
1. Make your software interact / interface with the Registry.
Users can access the main page of the biobrick from “Search”. Additionally, biobricks can be uploaded to Registry. User guide is available through this page: https://2014.igem.org/Team:SJTU-Software/Project/Tutorial .

UCL,2013,Team:UCLA#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," bottle of aspirin. The human immune system, evolved over millions of years, rendered useless in a matter of decades. Evolution stepped in accordingly. Why waste evergy maintaining a process as complex as the immune system when it served no function? By 2090 the aveage white cell count was down 60%. By 2150 no had a white blood cell to speak of.
Looking back, I find it ironic that the isolation we strive for was the very thing that brought the attention of the entire world on us. My name is Jeremiah Catz, I was a member of an isolationist community of Hasidic Jews in the southern tip of South Africa. We were relatively few. Around 1200 of us. The world we lived in was one of change. With each passing the day the world became a different place. New technologies were being developed at an incredible pace, the technology developed one year were left entirely obsolete by the developments of the next. In a world like this, where nothing is constant, no one is sure of anything. Nothing seems real. You feel as if you are living your life in eternal sleep,always shifting between dreams. Or so I've been told. When our community formed in the year 2020, it was was founded on the principal that the key to a prosperous and wholesome life could not be found in the world that was growing around it. Instead the community chose to revoke modern technology altogether and build a society founded upon the principles of hard work and tradition. None of the technologies we had were invented after 1930, and all our food we farmed and raised ourselves. Our community gradually cut off almost all ties with the rest of the world. As a result, IVIS never reached us. We still had the immune system that God gave us.
2165, the year of the epidemic. Humanities greatest test. No one was immune. The virus was relentless. IVIS had no response. People began dying in droves. The virus attacked the mind first, the victims mental faculties were completely depleted in a matter of days. Death followed shortly after. No one was immune. No one except us. We were different. Maybe it was that we were still human and the rest of the world wasn't. Maybe this was God's way of asserting his will, his way of punishing mankind. I wont say that there wasn't a small sentiment of validation, smugness, maybe even satisfaction within some members of the community when the situation was fully understood. The outside world that we so reproached with their fancy vacuum cleaners and such was coming crashing down, and we, we"

Stanford-Brown-RISD,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"ulans from which we borrowed a CBD sequence [2]. Our first glue candidate uses this CBD in a fusion protein of four CBD’s with GSGGSG linkers in between each; our hope was that this could act as a mycelium specific “cross linker” in a sense. Our construct also included a six residue polyhistidine tag and a Lumio fluorescent sequence (CCPGCCGAGG) for detection with Thermo Fisher Scientific’s Lumio Detection Kit [3].
Another protein-based adhesive candidate we investigated was csgA, the major subunit of the bacterial curli system which is secreted in monomers and self-assembles into longer polymer fibers that contribute to the biofilm formation [4]. The csgA protein has been known to be highly adhesive and have amyloid-forming properties, so it was reasoned that it would be a good starting point for bioadhesive proteins [4]. Furthermore, the manner in which csgA fusion proteins express the functionality of the introduced polypeptides while retaining their self-assembly behavior has made them a molecule of extreme interest in engineering functional biomaterials [5].
Our third glue candidate was a combination of the first two: a csgA-CBD fusion protein. We hoped to take advantage of the self-assembling nature of the csgA as well as its known tendency to aggregate under isoelectric conditions [3, 6]. The rationale for this fusion protein was that csgA has a strong affinity for binding its own monomers and CBD of course has a strong affinity for binding chitin. We theorized that a fusion protein with both of these domains would bond tightly to itself and to the mycelium surface.
Lastly, we decided to test the mussel foot fusion protein fp151 developed by researchers at Pohang University of Science and Technology [7]. The fp151 fusion protein is comprised of repeats of the most adhesive segments of marine mussel adhesive proteins (MAPs) 1 and 5 [7]. MAPs are the proteins responsible for adhering marine mussels to the rocks and other hard surfaces they live on in marine ecosystems [7]. It is thought that much of MAPs adhesion properties’ can be attributed to the high number of 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-alanine (L-DOPA) residues, which require the hydroxylation of tyrosine [7]. To facilitate this post translational modification, we ordered an additional DNA construct encoding the tyrosinase enzyme, which would be able to hydroxylate tyrosine residues in vivo. We also ordered mushroom ty"
UC_Davis,2012,Team:UC Davis#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"5 hours. Tomorrow we will prepare these samples to run on an sds page gel and western blot.
Tuesday September 18th
The minipreps from yesterday were nanodropped and sent off for sequencing. We also analyzed the sequence data that we sent off last week. We also planned out the different experiments that we will run in the Tecan as soon as tomorrow. Finally, we transformed the ligations that we had from overnight. We also made some solutions for the Davis high biology class. We made some LB media, some plates for halophiles, and some halophile liquid media.
Today, we ran another gel of the PCR screen and liquid cultured a million things for miniprepping and sequencing later on.
With the cutinase and control cultures from yesterday, we first spun down the 1 mL samples, took off, and saved the media. We then washed the cell pellet and resuspended and lysed the cells in BPER. After vortexing this mixture, we centrifuged and separated the soluble and insoluble portions of the cell lysate. We plan on running all of these samples on an sds page gel so that we can then do a western blot to determine whether or not the cutinase protein is making it into the media of the cell. Today we started by running the media samples on an SDS-PAGE gel and transferring onto a pvdf membrane. We have been more careful about washing the equipment and have started using much less ladder to reduce background noise. We have left it overnight in blocking solution and will probe and wash it tomorrow.
Wednesday September 19th
Today, we analyzed more sequences that we sent out yesterday. We also had to redo our digestions and ligations that we did a few days ago because it turns out that the purification was not done as well as it could have. Therefore we redid it in hopes of a better result. Lastly, we began a Tecan experiment where we test the optimal amount of arabinose for the induction of the K206000 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase in MG1655 and Strain E-15 EG3. We did a round of SDM on B0034 + Reductase + B0015 to get rid of the deletion in reductase. pNPB assay results looked promising. Rerun taking OD, using antibiotic LB, comparing induced/uninduced cells, comparing mutants and taking supernatant.
Today we finished with the western blot for our media samples, but unfortunately, there was a lot of background in the picture."
Lethbridge,2017,Team:Lethbridge HS#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," our tour guide. He took us through the entire building, starting with the design area. This was a section in the building for workers to create designs for customers and other business affiliations. Mr. Warwick then proceeded to show us the printers that they used for the company, including printing presses and other printers used for digital printing. The printers they used were very large compared to the size of the average household printer.Their digital printers used toner, a powdered form of pigmentation, while their printing press used ink, a liquid form of pigmentation.  He shared some interesting facts with the team, like how black is the most used color by consumers, allowing for two black ink cartridges to exist in the digital printers instead of one. In another part of the building there was the printing press, which Mr. Warwick specifically explained can only print one color at a time. Four press sheets were used for the four different colours of the CMYK colour theory. There was also a printer that could print more colors at once. In addition to this, Mr. Warwick showed us a matching color palette given to a customer to allow them to choose a desired color for the product being made. The Pantone Matching System (PMS) is the standard of colour for all ink production. He explained to us how the different types of ink, depend on specific applications. For example, the ink used by the Warwick company is not the same as what we plan to provide for a proof of concept, the fountain pen. They use an ink that is a very thick liquid, almost solid. They then proceed to mix it with water and a chemical to use in their printers. Overall, this tour was helpful to our team’s knowledge in the printing business, as well as in ink marketing and production. We gained a greater understanding on the ways that ink is used in the printing industry and the different standards for the ink.
Best Environmental Practices
Figure 1: Global investment in alternative
energy sources since 2006(3).
The problem that our project is solving is the harmful byproducts of ink pigment production. The most common colorant used in ink today is Carbon Black. Carbon Black is produced by the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons such as oil or natural gas(1). This results in other byproducts such as: Carbon monoxide(2), VOC’s and PCB’s. The basis of our project is to create an alternative source of colorants and pigments which will reduce the need for Carbon Black production and reduce the frequency of these harmful practices. Our use of synthetic biology to produce the pigments will allow us to have a minimal amount"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and"

Trimethylaminuria (TMAU) is a rare genetic disease causing a strong fish odor to appear in the sweat. Here we engineer skin bacteria to degrade trimethylamine, the odor causing molecule, with the enzyme TMM (trimethylamine monooxygenase).

Cas9 Translocation to Periplasm
Bradford Assay:
Before we ran a Western blot to test all of our constructs, we performed a Bradford assay to normalize the total protein loaded into each well of the protein gel, as the whole cell lysis, periplasm fractionation, and OMV concentration involved different amounts of starting cell culture. A standard curve was created using known concentrations of bovine serum albumin ranging from 0.025-0.1 μg/μL, and this standard curve was used to calculate the protein concentration for each sample. The total protein concentration present in the OMV fractions of our hypervesiculating cells was less than that of the periplasm fraction, indicating that the OMV filtration procedure we obtained from UNSW-iGEM most likely does concentrate proteins secreted by cells in OMVs (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Average total protein concentration of Tat/Sec fusions in periplasm and OMV fractions in hypervesiculating strain JC8031.
 
 
Table 1: Total protein concentrations in ug/uL.
Western Blots:
We first tested expression conditions for our saCas9 assembled part under the pBAD promoter in a constitutively expressing line (TOP 10, a TetR negative strain) versus an inducible strain (TetR positive). We expressed overnight at 20°- 25° C, using an uninduced TetR+ strain as a negative control.
Whole cell lysates and periplasm fractions were collected from the expression cultures and run in a Western blot using an anti-His tag marker. A band appears at the expected size of saCas9 for our whole cell lysates, indicating successful expression of our saCas9, though many smaller products with our N-terminus His6 tag were also present. These may have been synthesis truncation products.
Figure 2: Our first Western blot confirmed Cas9 expression in the cytosol.
After verifying that our Cas9 was expressed, we proceeded to investigate the efficacy of our periplasm localizing parts under two expression systems, pBAD and T7 in a hypervesicular cell line (JC8301) and a T7 expression line ("

Public Engagement
Overview
Keeping in line with the principles of synthetic biology, we aimed to make our research accessible to all members of society through the development of a range of educational resources. Many of the misconceptions and skepticism of synthetic biology are the result of a lack of public understanding of the field, and the inability of researchers and industries to “initiate open discussions”. Our initial outreach activities involved the delivery of lessons and workshops for summer school students, and we drew upon the feedback from these activities to plan further outreach events and resources designed for a larger target audience. Equally, these activities enabled us to assess the level of knowledge that the public have about synthetic biology, and discover their opinions about this emerging research field and, more specifically, our project.
The design of our educational programmes were guided by the synthetic biology educational aims outlined by Kuddell et al (2007):
Encourage students to precisely and carefully articulate their views
Raise controversial issues and encourage debate
Address the issues of security, safety and ownership
Be realistic about what synthetic biology has the potential to do
Summer Schools
An important and accessible platform for increasing public knowledge is to educate school children, so we ran workshops at four summer schools in Oxford:
Northwest Science Network Summer School (16-17 year old students interested in a broad range of science subjects)
UNIQ (16-17 year old state school students interested in biochemistry)
Pembroke Science Summer School (16-17 year old students interested in different science subjects)
Oxford Summer Courses (13-16 year old international students)
Our initial summer school classes were targeted at 16-17 year old students studying STEM subjects and with an interest in pursuing these subjects at university. Upon planning our educational resources for summer schools, we sought guidance from current teachers to ensure that the activities were tailored to the right level of understanding and delivered in an engaging format. We worked on developing activities that would appeal to the interests of a young audience, as well as making the activities as interactive as possible. We believed that"
Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," in the process.
Yassen asked what approaches (generally) should be used to solve the world's problems.
Eric said:
Reduce consumption.
Invest in sustainable energy sources: wind, solar, geothermal
Invest in sustainable agriculture
He sees the solutions as coming from improved systems (i.e. ways humans organise themselves) instead of improved technology. For example, hunger is not currently caused because we can't produce enough food, but rather by problems of distribution. These problems are social, political and economic: who owns the food, and who profits from it?
People go hungry because they can't afford the food, not because the food isn't there. So suggesting genetic modification to increase yields doesn't address the root cause of the problem.
If we must invest in new technologies, Eric suggests we invest in technologies that are inherently less risky than biotechnology, e.g. sustainable energy sources and technologies of energy efficiency.
Yassen asked about the relationship between regulation and technological progress. He suggested countries with a relaxed regulatory regime would make progress faster.
Eric said that regulation is a burden if the only focus is profit; but if we also value people and the environment, government policy has an important role to ensure technology develop in a sustainable and just way.
Fionn asked about what motivates corporations.
Eric said while there were examples of corporations deliberately behaving badly, in many cases there is merely a short-sighted focus on profit. He is suspicious of a worldview where profits are regarded as proof that something is valuable to society. But he does not believe synthetic biologists are bad people.
Yassen asked Eric for advice to members of iGEM teams generally for their future careers.
Eric said we should think long and hard about ecological questions (e.g. life-cycle analysis) and safety, as well as issues of how technology will impact the world. He suggests that bench scientists often don't have time to think about these questions.
He suggested we ask: ""Is this the only way, and is this the best way to get there?""

PART 2
Then we consider whether the performance of Boolean gate cascades is good enough. We will examine a biology example and first extract the modelling part of it. Later we will discuss whether our simulation results correspond to experiments.
Truth table
Then we are going to discuss whether our simulation corresponds to wet-lab experiments.
Background
Each AND gate integrates two promoter inputs and controls one promoter output. This allows the gates to be layered by having the output promoter of an upstream circuit serve as an input promoter for a downstream circuit. Each gate consists of a transcription factor that requires a second chaperone protein to activate the output promoter. These gates are connected in different permutations to form programs, the largest of which is a 4-input AND gate consisting of 3 circuits that integrate 4 inducible systems, thus requiring 11 regulatory proteins. Measuring the performance of individual gates is sufficient to capture the behavior of the complete program.

To control dosage the consumer could heat-shock the yeast after a time calculated from the progesterone biosynthesis rate, as opposed to controlling the amount of galactose in the growth media.
Terminator
We originally chose the Tsynth27 terminator recommended by Dr. Hal Alper1 for its short length (66 bp) and high gene expressivity (Curran et al., 2015). When we ordered the sequence from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), we received an error regarding the length of the efficiency region; the long, repetitive sequence of TATA base pairs, which was originally designed for higher efficiency, made synthesis of the gene block impossible.
We decided to use another short synthetic terminator, Tsynth8, also designed by Dr. Alper. Tsynth8 contains a shorter efficiency region yet still allows for high gene expression and low cryptic promoter activity in Y. lipolytica.
GENE CONSTRUCT ASSEMBLY
Initially, we determined that Gibson Assembly (GA) was the best option for plasmid cloning for two reasons: our mentors and team members have prior experience with the method, and Gibson can assemble many DNA fragments of any length. However, we wanted to explore other possible methods of cloning before making our final decision. We reached out to Dr. Jean Marc Nicaud and he suggested we consider Golden Gate Assembly (GGA) for plasmid construction. Dr. Nicaud informed us that GGA was an ideal method for Y. lipolytica plasmid assembly. Dr. Rohinton Kamakaka also advised us to use GGA as it offers a seamless, single-reaction assembly of DNA fragments (Celinska et al., 2017), similar to GA.
After further research, however, we discovered multiple issues with this assembly technique: our team members and mentors have no prior experience with GGA, the process takes up to six hours, and we would need to insert unique type II restriction sites between our gene blocks, which adds another step to our project (New England BioLabs, n.d.). For these reasons, we ruled out GGA as our cloning method and returned to GA. GA requires that DNA fragments have homologous ends (either naturally or artificially) for assembly to occur. These ends are called Gibson overhangs (GOs). To create homology where it does not occur naturally, we will use primers with GO flags on either end that match the overhangs and homology regions on corresponding fragments. GA shortens the construction"

TUDelft,2008,Team:TUDelft#Ethics macro_-_-_TEXT.html,") government, all scientific findings are published and progress is made because everyone has access to the latest scientific developments. Unfortunately, this is currently not the case. Universities have agreements with companies, companies finance research carried out at universities and commercial interests need to be considered. A consequence is that research in an academic environment is not completely open or publicly available anymore. On one hand, it is convenient for universities to have some extra money to spend, but on the other hand it is not an ideal situation for open source research: some research cannot be published or only partially. This means that scientific knowledge lingers in company file cabinets, partly perhaps due to possible commercial losses or gain.
Developing real cash cows? Within this capitalist environment, one can also imagine that developing applications that could really yield a lot of money in the commercial sector, are not made publicly available. It would probably be considered quite obtuse of the inventor of a certain application to not patent it. Of course, the data can still be made publicly available, but one can wonder what than is the eventual point in publishing your secret with which you could make a lot of money. It may therefore also seem unrealistic for constructive open source synthetic biology (iGEM) to expect really valuable inventions to be deposited in public DNA databanks like the BioBrick database.
Academic interests. Another issue to consider in this respect is the interest of companies that sponsor academic research institutes and the interest of the academic institute itself. Imagine a really potentially profitable application being developed by an iGEM team, which deposits its findings in the database. Would the board of the university be happy with this iGEM team or its supervisors or supervising professor? Probably not, since loads of money could have been generated from this certain project, to the benefit of the entire university. Moreover, would it be in the interest of renowned professors to contribute to this particular iGEM project that could have generated a lot of money? Probably not, the professor may even be sacked by the university, for blunt ignorance.
Company interests. Besides the issue described above, also company interests may count here. Supervisors of iGEM student teams are sometimes not allowed to talk about different subjects, because they have agreements with companies that sponsor their research. One agreement may be that the academic institution can do research on a topic as sponsored by this certain company, under the condition that the academics do not contribute or work on other projects related to this sponsored topic. This may not be desirable for the progress of technology or contribution to open source science, but it is the case in everyday scientific practice. In fact, lots of money (and"

Our research and development team will work closely with the manufacturing team, in order to ensure that the required product specifications are incorporated into the final design. Our Chief Operations officer, Iain George, will ensure that production, quality assurance, and distribution processes are streamlined and that deadlines are met. In addition, in 2016, when operations will begin to ramp up, we will be hiring an operations manager in order to take over this position. This will also be a salary-based position as reflected in our five-year budget. In addition, 2 members will be hired in 2016 in order to help with the manufacturing and distribution of cartridges that will be done in-house at FREDsense Technologies.
Marketing and Sales
In order to properly market our product, we will need personnel with expertise in sales and marketing. This will allow us to to create an effective marketing strategy to achieve maximum market penetration. In addition, we will need to consult with business strategy and marketing professionals in order to conduct in-depth market and industry analyses for both our first target market as well as any future generation products that are produced. Our Chief Marketing Officer, Lisa Oberding will take the lead in this area, ensuring that we are creating products for which there is a need in the market, identifying potential market opportunities and market penetration issues, as well as designing our products in a way that meets the needs of our end-users and the demands of industry. We have a partnership already established with HydroQual Laboratories, an accredited toxicity monitoring company in Alberta. As a prospective customer, we have already begun conversation with them in order to better understand the diverse needs of this market. With major research and development activities wrapping up in 2015, we will at this point bring on a marketing officer in order to further these activities. This will also be a paid position.
Administration and Business Development
Personnel with expertise in administration and business development will need to be acquired in order to ensure the company is run in an effective and profitable manner. Specifically, a Chief Financial Officer with experience in accounting and corporate finances will be required in order to oversee and manage company finances. This position will be filled during the first full year of operations, by the end of 2014 and will be compensated by shares in the company. We will also require legal experts, both in corporate law as well as in intellectual property protection, to protect the interests of the company and its members. These roles will be outsourced on an as-needed basis as reflected in the legal section of our budget. To manage personnel in the company as further key individuals are brought in, we will acquire a part time administrative"

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html,"The purpose of the PowerLeaf is to provide a greener alternative to the currently available sources of energy. An important aspect of such an undertaking is to limit the use of depleting resources in the construction of the device itself. This is accomplished through the use of the most common resources available, namely recyclable plastics and bacteria. In turn, this will contribute to our dream of building a better future. A future where fear of reaching a critical shortage of natural resources has been eliminated. Another benefit of the PowerLeaf is the bacteria's ability to self-replicate, if provided with the essential nutrients.
As tools for genomic editing improves, the advancement of biological devices will conceivably become even more complex and independent. They will do so by introducing new metabolic pathways originated from other organisms using genetic engineering. This could potentially allow the PowerLeaf to become completely independent through its self-replication. Independency would occur, when the bacteria are modified to produce their own essential nutrients directly from unwanted pollution in the environment. This trait would lead to cleaner cities, along with providing a natural solution of sustainable energy.
Genetic Code Expansions for Biological Engineering
In an effort to advance the current technologies used in synthetic biology, research groups are working on genetic code expansion. We had an interesting talk from postdoc and former iGEM participant, Julius Fredens, about his work on genetic code expansion. Once a technology like this expands, it will completely revolutionise biological engineering, including that of the PowerLeaf. Genetic code expansion could be used for optimisation of the systems in the PowerLeaf, such as optimisation of nanowires, improvement of the light-sensing system, and making the breakdown of cellulose inducible.

OSIRIS consists of a tweaked 3-round Policy Delphi method. Named after the Oracle of Delphi, it is a forecasting, decision support method that uses the panel of experts to distil responses and build toward group consensus regarding the risk prediction of the proposed project. The panel of experts was pre-selected by the pre-analysis results of our Stakeholders (Experts) Map. Our modified Policy Delphi works as follows (3 Rounds):
Open-ended interviews in the form of Q&A for qualitative data collection regarding general issues of our project (via email, Skype, in-person interview).
Formation of quantitative online survey after evaluating the answers of the 1st Round. This Round is comprised of 8 sets of questions (each set has 2 categories: Risk/Benefit, Uncertainty).
During Round 3, after analyzing the concerns that have arised from Rounds 1 & 2, we performed a short-round of questioning, internally between team members and externally with our advisors and synthetic biology experts in conferences. This round was designed in order to simulate the challenge for iGEM teams to come-up with radical redesigns for their project according to the received feedback.
OSIRIS in numbers
28 answers in our Round 1 open-ended questionnaire out of which 7 were from PIs/Instructors of iGEM Teams, 9 researchers in Greece and 12 postdoctoral researchers and professors in Europe, Asia and America.
66 answers in our Round 2 quantitative questionnaire out of which 46 were from experts such as PIs/Instructors from other iGEM Teams and 20 were from experts that we managed to pinpoint around the globe.
Outreach to more than 80 Ambassadors, called Muses, from countries on every continent, from which more than 60 were actively engaged in promoting Synthetic Biology and identifying experts in their respective fields.
* Osiris first recruited the nine Muses, while embarking on a tour of all Asia and Europe, teaching the arts of cultivation wherever he went.
Each SB application is summarized using an additive risk/benefit and certainty index and ultimately a mean risk/benefit and certainty score.
In case of Risk(R):
\[R = (\sum\limits_{i = 1} {{r_i})/n} \]

We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.
