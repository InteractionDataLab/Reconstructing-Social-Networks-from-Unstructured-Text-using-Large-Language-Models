Collaborations with BNU-China team
It's essential for us to get accurate growth condition of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the natural environment to keep the concentration of toxin at a lethal level. But in fact, it is almost impossible to test concentration anywhere due to the lack of equipment and skills. Therefore, building the growth model can help determine the amount of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii they should use and when they need to add more. To build an accurate growth model, BNU-China team members who have much experience in the mathematics helped us to achieve it. 
Moreover, BNU- China team wanted to detect paclitaxel by utilizing microtubule which expressed in E. Coli. Microtubule is assembled by α-subunit and β-subunit in eukaryotes. But E. Coli is a genus of prokaryote. So it is essential to justify whether microtubule assembled successfully or not in E. Coli. If microtubule assembled successfully, α-subunit and β-subunit will have interaction in E. Coli. To prove it, we used Co-Immunoprecipitation (CoIp) to confirm their interaction. If you are interested in the details, you can visit this link: https://2016.igem.org/Team:FAFU-CHINA/Experiments

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#policypractice#experts_-_-_TEXT.html," General in Edinburgh. Patients were extremely generous with their time, sharing what it was like living with CF, the biggest day to day challenges they faced and what could help them reduce the burden of care they experienced. This information was vital to our project and two main points came from it:
-Patients highlighted how quickly their health could deteriorate without early intervention.
-Patients described the large amount of time spent in hospital, and how this negatively impacted their quality of life.
Both of these points highlighted the need for a new faster detection method that wouldn’t significantly increase burden of care already faced by patients.
Whilst we had built the synthetic biological detection systems, we needed to identify where we saw the device being implemented and design it accordingly. If it was to be used in hospital clinics, patients would still have to travel long distances to use it.
Initially, we started to design the L.A.S.S.O. as a home device to maximize convenience for the patients. During this process we discussed with patients whether they would want to see their results straight away, and the difficulty of representing this data in a meaningful way.
After speaking to patients and a psychologist at Ninewells, we were concerned about the psychological ramifications and impact on a patient’s mental wellbeing if The Lung Ranger showed that they had developed a chronic infection.  However, it was clear that patients wanted more control and autonomy over their condition.
Home visits with nurses provided an alternative opportunity for us to implement the detection device within a support network patients are familiar and comfortable with. We decided to make a detection device which would be portable. This means that it could be taken by the nurse to a home visit and used at home, with the psychological support of the clinical care team on hand. Speaking to patients, nurses and clinicians at a later date, we decided that the data generated would be sent straight to the clinician via the L.A.S.S.O. Interface , to avoid misinterpretation of results by the patient and reducing any undue stress.
Clinical Microbiology
Current methods for detecting and identifying lung infections in CF patients take too long. Acute lung infections can rapidly become chronic biofilm infections, making them much more difficult to eradicate with antibiotics.  We wanted to improve current detection methods for respiratory pathogens in people with CF, and so we visited Dr William Olver in the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory in Ninewells Hospital to further understand this time consuming process and how we could improve upon it.

JUDGING FORM
LIGHT UP THE PIPE - THREE PARTS FOR A BETTER FLOW
For the cleaning and degradation process of clogged drains by e.coli we created a genetic circuit with different enzymes (model Link). Three parts are needed for a better flow:
PART I - ESTERASES and LIPASES
Hair is surrounded by a layer of grease and waxes which first need to be removed to make the hair-keratin available for keratinases. For the first degradation step we choose a combination of  esterases and lipases. We investigated two different esterases for their enzyme activity. One esterase from the registry (EstCS2 BBa_K1149002) and one esterase (LipB) supplied by Dr. Eggert from Evoxx were compared. Additionally we choose the lipase TliA to support the esterases at the fat degradation and to accelerate the entire degradation process. For the extracellular secretion of the enzymes we attached different signal sequences (pelB, OmpA and phoA) that were provided on the iGEM plates.
EstCS2
EstCS2 from the iGEM Imperial College 2013 was proved to be active. In their project the cells expressing these construct were grown and lysed by sonication and were utilized in a colourimetric assay with the substrate analog para-Nitrophenyl butyrate. In our project we didn’t purify the esterases but used the supernatant for the enzyme activity assay.
LipB
LipB showed an enzyme activity of 2,8 U/mL in the supernatant. First, we repeated the enzyme activity assay from the iGEM TU Darmstadt 2012 to determine the esterase with the highest enzyme activity.
TliA
The lipase that is used for this project is the TliA lipase from Pseudomonas fluorescens. TliA is secreted by the ABC (ATP binding cassette) export system (prtDEF gene cluster) from Dickeya dad"

TUDelft,2008,Team:TUDelft#Research Proposal_-_-_TEXT.html," pathway in transformed E. coli, we will screen for the products of the pathway in the transformed cells and compare them to wild type E. coli. This screening will be performed using gas chromatography or mass spectrometry analysis. Overexpressing FPP in E. coli bears a potential risk to the cells while FPP is toxic to E. coli if present in high concentration [7] . One way to prevent a concentration buildup of FPP within the cell is by draining the FPP pool by expressing a colorant, as we plan to do. However, it will be important to tune FPP production: there should be enough to produce a visible color, but not more than the enzymes that produce the color can handle.
Figure 2. Overview of the pathway we want to introduce into E. coli for color production. Lycopene is a red colorant, β-carotene an orange one and zeaxanthin is a yellow-colored compound.
Modeling
Part of the project will be focused on building models to predict the dynamic behavior of mRNA and proteins in the cell taking into account the effects of temperature on translation. The software used to model the metabolic activities in the cell is CellDesignerTM and/or MATLAB. The goal of setting up a mathematical model of the biological processes is to avoid pitfalls that can be predicted beforehand.
Furthermore, the modeling of the system is in itself a goal: results from the laboratory can be used to test the model. Using the results, the model could be changed or optimized by fitting the parameters using experimental data. We aim to be able to predict at what temperature these RNA thermometers will allow translation using mathematical models.
Besides these models we will investigate in silico how to alter the temperature sensitivity of the 5' UTR by mutating the RNA sequence. Alteration of this sequence will change the stability of the RNA secondary structure occluding the ribosome binding site (RBS). More stable structures will denaturate at higher temperatures while less stable structures will denaturate at lower temperatures. This way we aim to design temperature sensitive sequences that act at different temperatures. We will use mfold [9] and the Vienna RNA package [10] to predict the secondary structures and their stability.
Ethical considerations on macro and micro level
Synthetic biology can generally comprise several goals. Some would say the goal is to make biology an engineering science, designing with biology. Others may state that building with biology can be used to further understand life. At the least, one may state that both the bottom-up, constructing part and the top-down, deconstructing aspects of synthetic biology rely on the"

STANDARD JOURNAL
Thursday 23rd June - Told last night after going to see X-men that we need to have a poster completed and ready for use by friday. Spent the day writing poster drafts and designing the layout, as well as attempting to copy the logo we designed onto the computer. We also updated the Wiki and gave it a new navigation bar, and looked into flight and hotel prices for Amsterdam!
Friday 24th June - Spent the day preparing for a brief presentation to the staff of the JIC so that we could prove we've actually done something! Researched more deeply into possible methods of ensuring light production only in the dark. We decided finally on three model organisms, Moss, Algae and E. coli, and divided the team into three sub-teams to work semi-independently on each project.
Monday 27th June - Today, we spent the morning researching moss and received our sample of algae in a nappy! A slideshow of photos was embedded onto the home page of the wiki and then we had lunch. After lunch we carried out transformations with 5 different biobricks, where the details can be viewed in the lab journal.
Friday 1st July - In the morning we ran a gel of our Miniprep of the BBA_M30109 transformed E.coli cells. The Gel showed that we had indeed successfully isolated the plasmid from our cells, and so in the evening (LATE into the evening) we ran  PCR protocol to try and amplify the specific gene we wanted from the plasmid (Cph8) We also continued to arrange the UK meet up, adding up numbers that were coming and trying to find speakers.

This gave an expression of Holin, the compound that cause lysis, see full model, with a maximum about 700. This was quite high, but less than the lethal amount of about a 1000 [15] . After increasing the expression to 0.01 s⁻¹, the amount increased to about 5500. Again, the amount of activated promoter were quite low, indicating a too high transcription and translation rate.

Full model
In the full model, the previous parts were put together and made to control the lysis genes. The lysis genes [16] are adapted from the T4 phage. T4 infect gram negative bacteria and cause lysis in them. This is caused by two compounds; a membrane protein called holin and an endolysin that degrades cell walls. The endolysin itself is relatively harmless for the bacteria, as it cannot pass through the inner membrane [15] . To facilitate lysis, holin is required as it creates pores in the inner membrane. About 1000 holin molecules per cell is required for lysis [15] .
For the phage, there is an optimal delay between infection and lysis, as it takes time to assemble viruses in the cell. To delay lysis, the genes for an antiholin is also present in the gene cassette. Antiholin forms a complex with holin, thus disabling the creation of pores. An infected bacteria will behave normally up until lysis begins [15] .
The figures below describe the behaviour of the system under various conditions. Figure 8 shows the system with a relatively low oxygen level of 100 and a high lactate level of 1000. The antiholin will cause a delay in lysis, but holin will reach lethal levels in about an hour. Figure 9 shows the response to oxygen levels of 2000 and lactate levels of 10. In this case, there is still holin production, but most of it is complexed with antiholin and it does not reach lethal levels.

What makes our project a great one is not only the project itself,                         but also the engagement with public issues.
See our story.
Winter Camp
After the 2015 Giant Jamboree, team members of BIT-China cannot wait to share                                 their experience of participating in iGEM. With the coming of the cold winter, we came up with an idea to start a winter camp and light the fire. Students                                 of different majors including life science and technology, electronic engineering, software,                                 art design and so on came to our publicity.
We invited our instructor Prof. Chun Li to give a general introduction about synthetic                                 biology and iGEM competition, which inspired many students’ interest in synthetic                                 biology and they wanted to know more                                 about the logic design and skills required to start a project.
Many of them wished to take systematic courses to have better understanding of the core concept about synthetic biology including “design, build and test”. They would like to not only gain more besides biology knowledge, but also extend to how to give a good presentation and how to integrate the mathematical equations into the iGEM project. Based on their needs, we prepared several lectures for eveyone may be interested in the skills required for iGEM competition, the speakers were our instructors and team members. Here are the topics:
(1) The history and development of synthetic biology (Chun Li)
(2) Literature searching and reading (Chenyi Li)
(3) Photoshop training (Mingming Cao)
(4) Academic writing and English presentation training (Hui Luo)
(5) Brainstorm introduction (Zeyan Li)
(6) System biology and mathematical model (Pengcheng Zhang)
We got many positive feedback from students. The overview of synthetic biology                                 let them know how broad the field is. And the training of software such as                                 Photoshop and Matlab shall facilitate their use of tools. It’s the beginning                                 of studying, not the end. They showed great interest in the concept of                                 standardization and the idea of engineering design. And we also invited                                 them to visit our labs. From preparation to implementation, the whole winter                                 camp lasted for two months. Then, we welcomed students                                 who showed great passion to iGEM to take part in the brainstorm activity.

Optical density estimation
The main reason to build a model around flotation was to check how gas vesicle flotation is aided by our experiments. This itself was shown by the steady state solution which gave a realistic estimate of how the concentration profile would look after a long time. The time series solutions however, give an insight on how to optical density of the medium would change had the column been in a spectrophotometer taking readings at regular time intervals. Experimental data obtained from this experiment can be found in the ""Experiments"" section of this wiki. Here, we wish to show how a rough functional form of the optical density time series can be obtained from this model.
Note: We consider only the initial and boundary conditions from the first illustration for this estimation
Figure: Sampling region in our simulated cuvette
Assuming the photodiode in the spectrophotometer reads only over this range, intensity in this region will be determined by the average concentration of the gas vesicles in the suspension. This is bascially an integral of the concentration over the sampling region volume determined by the volume itself
\[ C_{avg}(t)=\frac{\int_{l_0}^{l_1} C(h,t) A dh}{A(l-l_0)}  \]
Numerical integration was done over different sampling region lengths (same right hand limits) to get the following curves showing how the average concentration changes with time
Figure: Average concentrations for different sampling region lengths (relative)
Assuming the Optical density is proportional to concentration, the percent change in OD can be obtained from this data to get a qualitative function that can be fit to our data from the spectrophotometric assay,

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," in person, by our team members Fionn Tynan-O'Mahony and Yassen Abbas.
Fionn mentioned that we were interested in whether science simply drags society along, or whether it's more of a two-way progress.
Murdo said this was exactly what the SRTP was set up for, 40 years ago.
Yassen asked what their jobs involved.
Murdo explained that his full-time job is as policy officer for the Church. His work is overseen by a committee, which Glenn chairs; however Glenn's role is unpaid.
40 years ago, the Church saw that the growing oil industry in Scotland would have an increasing impact on Scottish society; and the SRTP was set up to look at the issues raised by technology, and help the Church address issues raised by science. It also helps the Church decide what it should say about ethical issues related to science. Because of its position, the Church often has an opportunity to speak out.
Over the last 40 years, the SRTP has looked at many issues. Some issues that were of concern are no longer of concern. Other issues have remained on the agenda throughout this period, for example nuclear power. And new issues, like genetic engineering, have arisen.
Fionn asked what the term ""synthetic biology"" meant to them.
Murdo noted that the term didn't really exist when he was a researcher, but he became aware of it when he took up his position as policy officer. He regards it as biology meeting engineering: a more ambitious form of genetic modification.
Yassen asked what role biotechnology will play in the future.
Murdo said it had a huge potential and would have many roles. There are lots of ways the technology can be used. As an example, he mentioned the production of anti-HIV drugs in a genetically modified tobacco plant.
However, he noted society might not always accept the way science wants to go. He noted that there was never a real debate on genetic modification in the United States; it simply happened. When the technology came to Europe, it was seen as an American imposition. Monsanto and others ""played a bad hand"" and lost public support, and this led to a harsher regulatory regime. This, however, is slowly changing.
Glenn suggested that biotechnology is used more widely than is commonly known or believed. The public might be quite surprised if they knew the extent of it all. He noted the potential for significant growth in the industry, for example in the form of spinoff companies from university research.

In order to balance all of these constraints, a couple of changes to the coding sequence of the genes were made; however, degenerate codons were used so that the amino acid sequence was not disrupted.

How Can Honeybees Survive?
The functionality of the BeeT module is primarily based on literature research and as such, requires a relatively low amount of parametrization. The main unknown quality is how BeeT will behave, namely degradation and its effectiveness at combating Varroa mites nearby larvae. We are interested in how BeeT can best be applied given certain assumptions. As such we are interested in the best period to apply BeeT, either in autumn or during spring, so we can give recommendations to beekeepers. We also examine the difference in effectiveness between BeeT in sugar water and in bee bread for both periods. This can inform future work on whether it is beneficial to adapt BeeT for functionality in bee bread. There are three additional parameters related to BeeT that can be varied and upon which effectiveness relies. These are: degradation of BeeT in the hive, outside the hive, and the effect of BeeT on Varroa mite mortality. Each is varied across a range of values. Additionally, for every combination we have five replicates to show the variance in our results due to stochastic processes. We divided the analyses into four treatments, each with the same three parameter ranges and five replicates per combination of parameters. This can be seen in Table 3.

Each combination of period and treatment has the same 5169 parameter set per ranges. We compared the autumn period with the spring period for the different ranges and treatments. In each case the spring period was significantly more effective in combating Varroa mites than the autumn period. For further analysis we continued with the spring period.
Three scenarios were identified: the colony dies due to virus load, the colony survives at a lower population level, or the colony thrives. Every year the beehave model checks the population after winter. If the population is below 4000 worker bees"

Valencia_UPV,2014,Team:Valencia UPV#prueba pag_-_-_TEXT.html," where sexyplants are intercropped and moths fly following different patterns depending on its sex.
Females, apart from emitting sexual pheromones, they move with erratic random flight paths. After mating, females are 2 hours in which they are not emitting pheromone.
Males also move randomly while they are under its detection threshold. But when they detect a certain pheromone concentration, they start to follow the pheromone concentration gradients until its saturation threshold is reached.
sexyplants act as continuously- emitting sources and their activity is regulated by a Switch.
On the side of pheromone diffusion process, it is simulated in Netlogo by implementing the Euler explicit method.
Figure 1. NETLOGO Simulation environment.
GO!
When sexyplants are switched-off, males move randomly until they detect pheromone traces from females, in that case they follow them.
When sexyplants are switched-on, the pheromone starts to diffuse from them, rising up the concentration levels in the field. At first, the sexyplants have an effect of pheromone traps on the male moths.
Figure 2. On the left: sexyplants are switched-off and a male moth follows the pheromone trace from a female. On the right: sexyplants are switched on and a male moth go towards the static source like it happens with synthetic pheromone traps.
As the concentration rises in the field, it becomes more homogeneous. Remember that the random turning angle of the insect follows a Poisson distribution, in which the standard-deviation is inversely proportional to the intensity of the gradient. Thus, the probability of the insect to take a bigger detour from the faced gradient vector direction is higher. This means that it is less able to follow pheromone concentration gradients, so ‘sexual confusion’ is induced.
Figure 3. NETLOGO Simulation of the field: sexyplants, female moths, pheromone diffusion and male moths.
Parameters
The parameters of this model are not as well-characterized as we expected at first. Finding the accurate values of these parameters is not a trivial task, in the literature it is difficult to find a number experimentally obtained.
So we decided to take an inverse engineering approach. Doing a model parameters swept, we simulate many possible scenarios, and then we come up with values of parameters corresponding to our desired one: insects get confused. This will be useful to know the limitations of our system and to help to decide the final distribution of our plants in the crop field.

Developing Our Project
Here at FREDsense Technologies, we focus on developing biological solutions to monitoring toxins in our environment.  Bacteria are incredibly diverse and capable of sensing and reporting on the level of a variety of environmental issues in our society.  We have harnessed the power of a genetically modified version of an environmental bacteria to be able to create a general toxin sensor to be used in the oil and gas industry.  Here we describe our commmercialization strategy to make our first Field Ready Electrochemical Detector available.
Project
The development of petroleum-related industries around the world has lead to large amounts of environmental contamination. Alberta, Canada is faced with a specific challenge: the development of petroleum-related industries has led to large volumes of contaminated water, requiring extensive monitoring and remediation before the eventual release of this water back into the environment. Currently, methods of monitoring are either too slow, labour intensive, or inaccurately report on the toxicity of the sample. With increasing government regulation in the petroleum industry, the time for new technology is now. The 2013 Calgary Entrepreneurial team is advancing an electrochemical biosensor for petroleum-related toxins through our early venture: FREDsense. Using a unique sensing platform, our technology is faster, more quantitative, and capable of operating in environments where existing biosensors cannot. With collaborations in both industry and government"

UNAM-Genomics_Mexico,2011,Team:UNAM-Genomics Mexico#SafetyQuestions_-_-_TEXT.html,"amicin). However these plasmids are intended for use only in laboratories, under controlled conditions. This ensures that resistances won’t be horizontally transferred to any pathogenic organism.
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of environmental safety?.
Yes. Hydrogen production could interfere with nitrogen fixation. If the strain we create lacks the nitrogen fixation system and if it becomes common in the environment it could poison the nitrogen cycle. However it is part of our objectives to maintain nitrogen fixation in our bacteria. In the case both systems are mutually exclusive, further safety evaluations and experiments would be required before considering introducing our bacteria into the environment.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
Yes, our broad host-range plasmids with antibiotic resistances.
Did you document these issues in the Registry?.
pBBRMSC-5 is broad host-range with gentamicin resistance. While working at Lab for research purpose there is no problem, for that we think as a implentation the integrate our construction into chromosome. By the moment there are are not other risks with our bioparts.
How did you manage to handle the safety issue?.
Our bacteria will be handled exclusively in the laboratory for the iGEM competition. For further applications we have evaluated the chromosomal insertion of our system, which would make vary unlikely the transfer of any resistance gene to other bacteria.
How could other teams learn from your experience?.
A proper documentation, containing not only what safety measures were taken but also why, is crucial. This way all our team learnt from our project will be properly transmitted to future teams.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?.
Yes.
What does your local biosafety group think about your project?.
They believe it to pose low or no risk at all given our bacterial strain Rhizobium etli CFN42, which has a very low fitness compared to other strains.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions?.
It is important to recognize which teams did a proper job considering safety issues. As well as present teams check what was done in previous winning projects, teams could check what was done regarding safety in previous competitions. Those teams whose work achieved proper considerations should be distinguished, so future teams can look back at their work.
How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?.
Undesired and unexpected interactions among parts or among systems should be diminished to the maximum. For example,"

First Opposition - in the military reserve
Second Proposition - undergraduate student, double major in Mathematics and Linguistics
Second Opposition - undergraduate student in Political Science
Third Proposition - undergraduate student in Microbiology
Third Opposition - student in English, BA in Classics
Fourth Proposition - undergraduate student in Philosophy
Fourth Opposition - undergraduate student in Philosophy and Political Science
Style of Debate
This debate is in British Parliamentary style, the style used at the Debate World Championships. This style of debate is set in parliament, and debaters take the role of government parties discussing policies. There are four teams of two people: two proposition teams argue for the motion, and two opposition teams argue against it. The first and second speaker on a side are on the same team, and the third and fourth speaker on a side are on the same team. Only the two debaters within a team plan their arguments together, and the two teams arguing on the same side compete with each other to argue better. The second team is expected to present an 'extension' consisting of new constructive arguments. The debaters address the Speaker of the House and"

Finally, we took the feedback and conducted a survey which consisted of the questionnaire related to Ethics in Synthetic Biology.Also the course manager of PESR committee, Mr.Lavlesh Bhanot appreciated our initiative.(Letter of appreciation( https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/0/00/T--IIT_Delhi--letter_nen.pdf ) Feedback obtained from the students on the workshop conducted: 8.3/10   (No of students:85)
NIN 100 (Introduction to Engineering):
It’s a course common to fresh entrants of IIT Delhi, it has an important role to play in terms of orienting and exciting students in the subject of engineering. iGEM IIT Delhi gave its orientation in one of the sessions of this course. Professors and around 850 undergraduate students attended the orientation. The main objective is to introduce students to synthetic biology, enlighten them about the products based on research in this field and how these products have an enormous impact on our day to day lives.
CAIC Orientation (Co-curricular and Academic Interaction Council):
It is a student body in IIT Delhi which deals with matters related to academic affairs and co-curricular activities. iGEM IIT Delhi held its orientation on 15th Sept, 2017. It drew a huge crowd which included students from technology clubs of various colleges apart from IIT Delhi. Our work on various genetically engineered biological systems their practical applications were presented to them. An enthusiastic response is received from the audience.
Biotech Freshers Seminar :
iGEM IIT Delhi held a seminar for a group of first-year students of DBEB who had just taken admission into IIT. The students were introduced to the field of synthetic biology and were told about its tremendous potential. Then, students were taken to the lab and a first-hand experience of various simple processes like agarose gel electrophoresis, streaking and spreading were provided. The students were shown the entire lab. Many of the students were enthusiastic about taking up synthetic biology as a career as the event ended.
Survey:
The main goal of our survey was to find out the reach of Synthetic Biology in the current school -going,college-going students and researchers in the field of Electrical Engineering.We got the survey filled by the students who attended our workshops in NEN sessions and schools since we wanted the students to"

Chalmers InterLab
After deciding to participate in the InterLab study as a criterion for the bronze medal, we realized that we did not have any Escherichia coli DH5-ɑ in our lab. Luckily, iGEM Chalmers in Gothenburg, Sweden, generously sent us a plate.
DTU Biobrick Tutorial
iGEM DTU organized an inspiring and practical 3 day introduction to iGEM. We got to learn how to create BioBricks and attend different workshops which covered the iGEM registry, Interlab study, the importance of human practices and life after iGEM.  Abigail Sison from iGEM headquarters also held an informative session about iGEM, answering many of our questions regarding the requirements of the competition.
Biohackathon
iGEM Vilnius-Lithuania organized a biohackathon on the theme “lab issues”, which we were happy to attend. The event took place on August 3-5 and was open not only to iGEM teams but to anyone interested in programming and lab work. We had a lot of fun and won third place with our software, a search engine for the iGEM distribution kit and for previous iGEM teams’ wikis.
Symposium
Together with iGEM Stockholm and iGEM Uppsala, we organized a symposium called Limits of Life, a one day event where two important topics were covered, burnout in academia and the ethics of biohacking and human augmentation. Read more about it here .
Along with the symposium event, we also collaborated with Uppsala regarding their handbook on stress management. We have been in contact throughout the entire process, discussing various topics related to the subject of burning out and stress. They did a great job outlining sources of stress and what one can do to avoid these issues. As such, we have included their handbook as an additional resource for further reading in our own handbook regarding project management in iGEM.

Abstract
We came back to school to continue our work in school. So we had to deal with some problems such as our own laboratory and our plan in next week.
Week 1
9.02.2012-9.08.2012
9.03.2012
Tonight, we had our first human practice. We gave a lecture on synthetic biology to the freshman in our school, and showed them the blueprint of this field. Then we did a presentation on what we are doing right now. They showed great interests in our project and would like to join us.
9.04.2012
We had a meeting to discuss our plan for September. Each group member was assigned a specific role: Zhang Mengshi, Liu Xianggeng and I will be responsible for experiments. Wu Zishan and Shen Liuxing will prepare the lecture and posters which will be used in our planned tours to a couple of high schools in Shenzhen. We are going to introduce synthetic biology and our project to them. Chen Yao and Qie Boyu will optimize our program and finish our web page.
9.05.2012
We paid a visit to SIAT to discuss the potential of using their lab for our experiments. Luckily, they agreed.
Week 2
9.09.2012-9.15.2012
9.10.2012
We had a meeting to check whether our plan goes well. However, because of the new semester, it is a little bit harder to keep up with our schedule. I decided to put the deadline to 9.15.

UMaryland,2016,Team:UMaryland#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," fact that MDH2 concentration is 5.3 μM (217.3 mg per liter).
We sought to optimize the ratio of MDH2 to sMMO by finding the point at which an increase in sMMO production no longer contributes to significantly faster methane digestion (inferred from carbon dioxide production). We found that increasing sMMO beyond 240 mg per liter does not greatly contribute to our pathway running faster. This ratio of sMMO to MDH2 corresponds with a methanol equilibrium of 0.5 M, which according to Team Braunschweig is non-toxic to the cell.
Parameter 2: Methane Concentration
In seawater, methane has a maximum solubility of 890 μM7. To determine the optimal methane concentration for our pathway, we created multiple models with methane concentration ranging from 0 μM to 890 μM. At a methane concentration of 200 μM, methane degradation (inferred from carbon dioxide production) began to plateau.** In order to degrade the highest fraction of methane possible, methane should therefore be bubbled through the cells at a concentration of 200 μM, which is equivalent to 0.031% methane (v/v).
Parameter 3: Presence of ACT protein
Literature analysis of the MDH2 enzyme reveals that an activator protein, ACT, reduces the Km of MDH2 by 2-fold. Our team did not plan to clone the ACT protein, but the modeling team decided to determine if cloning this protein would significantly improve the efficiency of our pathway. We repeated the parameter scanning above (with methanol tolerance and methane concentration) after changing the Km of MDH2 from to 360,000 μM to 180,000 μM. We found that sMMO concentration once again peaked at 0.5M, but the corresponding sMMO concentration was an increased 300 mg/L, implying that the pathway functioned at a higher rate. Methane is still most efficiently degraded at a concentration of 0.031%.
Calculating the Success of Our Optimized Pathway
With the results of our parameter scanning, we have compiled together a series of recommendations to optimize our pathway, and modeled the effect of said pathway.
After optimizing enzyme ratios and determining the steady state methanol concentration that those ratios correspond to, we were able to simulate our optimized pathway and observe the rate of methane degradation. Once our optimized pathway reaches steady state, the only product formed is carbon dioxide. This demonstrates that our engineered E. coli cells can survive our pathway, because no toxic intermediates build up"

After induction with blue light at 460nm the cells                                                 transfected with LOVpep/ePDZ reporter system were lysed and                                                 luciferase activity was determined                                                 with the dual luciferase assay.

 CRY2PHR-CIBN
As it has previously been shown on the example of split Cre recombinase
Kennedy2010
the CRY2/CIB1 interaction upon excitation with blue light seems to be a suitable tool for the                                     reconstitution of split proteins, allowing for spatial, temporal and dose-dependent                                     optical control of protein dimerization. The CRY2/CIB1 system has also been used before at                                     iGEM: Duke 2012 , Marburg 2013 , HNU_China 2014 and ANU_Canberra 2015
Further explanation ...
CRY2 is a cryptochrome, originating from Arabidopsis thaliana and is a blue                                             light–absorbing photosensor that binds a helix-loop-helix DNA-binding                                             protein CIB1 in                                             its photoexcited state. In our system, we used the conserved N-terminal                                             photolyase homology region of CRY2 (CRY2PHR; aa 1-498) that mediates light-responsiveness and                                             the truncated version of the CIB1 protein (CIBN; aa 1-170) without the                                             helix-loop-helix region, which mediates DNA binding

. Dimerization of                                             CRY2PHR and CIBN can be induced by blue light illumination (460 nm), after                                             which the interaction between CRY2 and CIB1 occurs on a millisecond                                             timescale and can be                                             reversed within minutes by removing the stimulus. This light inducible                                             system has already been implemented for light-dependent transcriptional                                             activation with the Gal4                                             transcription factor

Uppsala-Sweden,2011,Team:Uppsala-Sweden#Team#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," a professor at the Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology and a member of the Uppsala RNA Research Centre (URRC). Anders studies primarily enzymes involved in regulating the fate of mRNA. In his research, experimental systems based on mammalian and Drosophila cells are employed. A main goal is to understand how mRNA turnover/degradation, through the mRNA specific cap and poly(A) tail, is integrated with other essential mechanisms of gene expression/regulation. Another goal is to identify previously unrecognized small non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) and to determine their functions. These studies will be of importance for the general understanding of mechanisms controlling the fate of eukaryotic mRNA.
The two greatest discoveries made by Anders Virtanen are: the first known mRNA polyA-site in a human virus; and the enzyme in the animal cells that removes polyA-tail from mRNA.

Why i want to participate in iGEM: I’m interested in biology in general but in synthetic biology in particular. iGEM gives me the opportunity to apply my engineer skills on biological system and be creative. Synthetic biology is the playgrounds were you can play with your fantasy no matter how childish it might seem. I like challenges and solving problems using a different approach
As was approaching the end of my first master year. I became very curious how synthetic biology would work in practice and the huge possibilities it can offer. Hence iGEM is the perfect opportunity to get a flavour of this exciting new field and cooperate with fellow students with the same interest.

EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Our Project#T7 promoter variants#recovery_-_-_TEXT.html," lysing cell culture showed ever-decreasing optical density. This graph confirms that lysis was indeed taking place.
This chart shows the concentration of mRFP genes in the supernatant for each culture as the result of a qPCR. Both cultures contained cells with RFP plasmids. The lysing culture shows a definite increase in the number of mRFP plasmids in the supernatant over the course of the 10 hour experiment. The non-lysing culture shows a quasi-constant number of plasmids available in the supernatant. We can conclude that the DNA from the relevant lysed cells can be recovered from the supernatant.
The colony fluorescence, the second method for quantifying the amount of recovered DNA, relates the number of colonies to the amount of transformant (in uL) that was plated. We find that the number of colonies taken from the lysing culture (all pink because of RFP) increases generally over time, while the number of colonies from the non-lysing culture is near-zero over the 10 hours of the experiment. The colony fluorescence count drops in the last three hours but this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the contents of the cell (nucleases, etc...) damage the plasmids over time, leading to a lower transformation efficiency. In contrast, the qPCR data shows a monotonic increase in plasmid concentration without a drop over the last few hours. This result is an additional confirmation that DNA was recovered.

Sobriety test conducted by an alcohol breathalyzer met some problems as mentioned previously. Blood glucose meter is a smart design to measure the glucose concentration in the blood. We’d like to apply this technique to innovate IGEM BLOOD ALCOHOL METER (iMeter).
BLOOD GLUCOSE METER
Blood glucose meter (BGM) is a common commercialized household health care appliance. It is small, hand-held, portable. It is “smart” with an easy-to-use operation interface. Data processing is quick, accurate and reliable. You can obtain the measures within 5-8 seconds.
PRINCIPLE OF BGM
The BGM is an electronic device built with electrodes covered by the enzyme of glucose oxidase (GOX), which catalyzes the oxidation of glucose, and converts it to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). When H2O2 meets electrode (e.g., Ag/AgCl), the electrons are generated and give a strength of current which can be measured in amperometry.
GLUCOSE OXIDASE (GOX)
 
 
 
 
 
Glucose oxidase (GOX) is an oxido-reductase existing in several insects and fungi. The redox reaction performed by GOX can generate hydrogen peroxide as antibacterial materials when glucose and oxygen are present. GOX extracted from Aspergillus niger is widely used in glucose-related diagnostics and biotechnologies including biosensors and food industries. In the redox reaction, GOX requires FAD as electron mediators and finally transfer electrons to oxygen to generate hydrogen peroxide with the reduction potential of -97 ± 3 mV at pH 7.4 ( Anal Chem. 2014 ).
ALCOHOL OXIDASE (AOX)
 
 
 
 
 
Alcohol oxidase (AOX) is also an oxido-reductase that catalyzes the oxidation of alcohol and produce aldehyde and hydrogen peroxide. The substrates of AOX are primary alcohols including methanol and some short-chain alcohols such as ethanol. AOX is present in the methylotrophic yeast like Pichia pastoris , which has two genes"

""Buy Directly From Farmers""
“Buy Directly From Farmers” is a group dedicated to Taiwanese farmers since 2010 and officially registered as a social enterprise in 2014. Our goal is to connect the potato farmers with this association to provide a solution for a sound environment, creating a harmonious relationship between the city and countryside. We want to bring positive change into the world by letting them understand how their lifestyle and eating habits impact the environment, industry structure and the way that food is grown.  We believe only the cooperation between potato farmers and consumers will result in a comprehensive environmental and food evolution. We hope our efforts will jumpstart new jobs for a new generation not only for potato industry but the whole agricultural system, providing youth with viable options in their hometown for a sustainable and promising future in agriculture.
Goal
Our concrete appeal is to
Create a new value and enhance the new position of agriculture.
Reduce the pollution of the chemical pesticide gradually
Solve the problem of imbalance in non programming marketing and over production
Increase information of transparency of farmers, empower farmers to have more confidence and hold responsibility in their products
Rebuild a better and fair relationship between farmers and consumers
Create new jobs for new generation, provide youth with viable job opportunities in their hometowns instead of forcing them into cities
Improve the quality of life through Eco-friendly agriculture
Create a new generation of consumers who place priority on a healthy and sustainable environment and in turn by themselves
Forums
We participate a lot of forum in order to tell others about reducing pesticide use, potatoes species improvement, how to defend late blight, gene modify technology and so on. We exchange our idea with the participants and also adjust our projects based on their . We tried to exert our influence toward farmers, government, researchers, and the public. We hope that our project can practically carry out and make good use.
Abroad
Our team member Amy went to Germany this summer. Since the main crops grown in Germany are potatoes, she talked to people she met about our project “Fight the Blight”. She introduced our project and iGEM with professors and native instructors, asking some questions about the issues on GMO in Germany. She also asked for some advice on our project design and shared creative ideas with local people. Although Germans mostly are opposed to consuming genetically modified food, they still look forward to the progress of our project and gave us warm encouragements.

1. Expanding new technology in Containment Strategy
- Regulations & Safety
- Research of GMOs intended to release/test in nature
When researchers aim to expand their experimental application from a laboratory scale to a larger scale such as pilot study (small-scale field) or large-scale study, one concern is the safety of products produced from engineered organisms.
2. Sensor for horizontal gene transfer
GFP is a well-known reporter used by many iGEM teams and researchers. Such visual reporters have limited use in some context such as soils, because it can only work in the presence of oxygen and the color output can hardly be detected under layers of soils.
Recently, Rice University researchers have developed gas biosensors that can track the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer without disturbing the soil matrices. This discovery can further aid the study of soil environment and horizontal gene transfer i.e., how hydration affects horizontal gene transfer.
Using our construct as a proof of concept, we can study how to detect and prevent the release of engineered and constitutively expressed product at the same time.  Moreover, this may also provide additional knowledge about the fitness of genetically modified organism comparative to the wild-type bacterium.
When horizontal gene transfer is detected, recombinase can knockout the gene of interest and later knock out the reporter gene after enough concentration of reporter is established.
This not only allow scientists to study horizontal gene transfer and bacterial interactions in a selected sample environment, but also to investigate the prevention of gene transfer between engineered and wild-type bacteria.
As extracting products from organisms require many purification steps and costly, it may be more favorable to be able to use engineered organisms equipped with safeguard system in the field.

This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

Adding Biobricks to the Parts Library of Shanghaitech
We provided our three promoter parts constructed this year for Shanghaitech, helping to build up their parts library of input and output biobricks. Shanghaitech is aiming at creating an intercellular connection between bacteria containing different input/output circuits. We are looking forward to more data showing the performance of our input elements working with their system.

Offering Biobricks to RDFZ-China
Biobricks to an iGEM project is like bricks to a skyscraper, without which a project cannot even start. This is why when RDFZ-China asked us for some essential biobricks, we offered without hesitation. This year, RDFZ-China is paying attention to helping solve the petroleum leakage issue in the soil. Rather awesome!

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

Summary
We were invited to the Synenergene event organised by Rathenau Institute. This event was to make iGEM teams realise the importance of performing a responsible research in their project. During the event we came into contact with several stakeholders and experts.
Antibiotic resistance shield
The overuse of antibiotics has led to the development of antibiotic resistances. Although this problem has already been popping up in scientific and newspaper articles for over 30 years, its threat is one that can no longer be ignored. The US Department of Health and Human Services estimates that annually over 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths in the United States are caused by antibiotic resistance. Moreover, it is approximated that by 2050, 10 million people will die annually due to antibiotic resistance. The ‘antibiotic apocalypse’ needs to be prevented, so action should be taken now!
Antibiotic resistance detection with Cas13a
Up until now, we had been focussing on a plan with the protein Cas9. Nevertheless, this was not the optimal protein for what we wanted to achieve. Participating in iGEM, we caught up with the most recent achievements in the synthetic biology field, amongst which a very interesting paper about Cas13a by Gootenberg et al. Their paper indicated attomolar sensitivity in combination with rapid DNA or RNA detection, which would be perfect for detecting antibiotic resistance genes!
Tardigrade proteins
Simultaneously, team members came up with a completely different idea, based on practical limitations in the lab instead of a societal problem: western blotting. In order to improve on this method, we would require proteins from tardigrades (also known as water bears). Tardigrades can survive under very extreme conditions, such as outer space. Their robustness is (partly) derived from the so-called tardigrade proteins, that protect cell(-structures) and proteins from dehydration and preserve protein activity after drying and rehydration. The western blotting idea was discarded because of practical limitations. Nevertheless, we saw the tardigrade proteins as a perfect opportunity to combine an antibiotic resistance detection system with microfluidics on paper, for which the drying of proteins would be necessary!

How to perform genome integration
The integration into the E. coli chromosome can exploit the bacteriophage attP-mediated integration or the homologous recombination.
Detailed protocols about attP-mediated integration can be found here:
Anderson JC et al., 2010
Haldimann A and Wanner BL, 2001
Detailed protocols about homologous recombination can be found here:
Martinez-Morales F et al., 1999
Posfai G et al., 1997
When using the default integration guide <partinfo>BBa_K300991</partinfo>, the integration method relies on the bacteriophage site-specific recombination (attP-mediated recombination) through the attP site on the integrative vector and the attB site in the host genome.
This integration method is applicable when the host strain does not have prophages in the att(Phi80) locus. TOP10 (<partinfo>BBa_V1009</partinfo>) and DH5alpha (<partinfo>BBa_V1001</partinfo>) strains have the Phi80 prophage and so their chromosome cannot be engineered with this procedure.
The genomic integration of the desired BioBrick part into the attP(Phi80) locus has to be mediated by co-transforming a helper plasmid, such as the Amp-resistant <partinfo>BBa_J72008</partinfo> plasmid, which carries the IntPhi80 site-specific integrase gene under the control of a thermoinducible promoter (see Fig.14). The helper plasmid also has a heat-sensitive replication origin, whose replication can be inhibited at temperatures of 37-42°C, while a permissive temperature for this vector is 30°C. For this reason, it can be cured at high temperatures, when the integrase expression is triggered at the same time. The Phi80 integrase mediates the site-specific recombination between the attP site in the integrative vector and the attB site in the bacterial genome (for a schematic description of this process, see Fig.15 and http://partsregistry"
Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," Simultaneously, BoNTC-HiBit might get stuck on the surface of the cellular membrane and remain there bound to a membrane compartment. It also might be possible that the fusion protein bound unspecifically to the well material and could not be sufficiently removed in the washing process. On this basis, there is yet to be refinement done on this assay to find a reliable proof for a successful HiBit delivery into the cell.
pHluorin Assay
pHluorin2 is a GFP with the pH-dependent fluorescence characteristic of pHluorin and the superior efficiency of EGFP making it an ideal tool for studying endocytotic pathways in cells.
Important Data:
Absorption maximum 1: 395 nm
Absorption maximum 2: 475 nm
Emission maximum: 509 nm
When carrying out protein tracking experiments with pHluorin one has no ability to differentiate the cause for a decreasing fluorescence signal. While a possible reason can be a decrease pH, several other effects influence the signal strength. Those can be changing protein concentrations (e.g. caused by degradation), or fluorescence quenching due to long exposure times. To actually identify a decrease in pH, a single signal value is not enough. This is where ratiometric proteins come into play. Rather than using just one signal measurement to estimate the ambient pH, the observer performs two measurements at a different wavelength. Because the preferred excitation wavelength of pHluorin changes with pH, the ratio of the signals is an indicator of pH unaffected by the confounding effects described above.
To test the absorption maxima based on pH, we expressed the protein coding sequence in Lemo21 E.coli cells and purified the cells via a HisTrap FF column.
For the fluorescence measurement, we used the purified protein in PBS with a buffer capacity of 20 µM. We analogously prepared a PBS buffer with a buffer capacity of 70 µM and titrated it to pH values from 5.3 to 7.5. 80 µl aliquots of the second buffer were given into a White Opaque PerkinElmer CulturPlate-96. For a given pH three samples were prepared as triplets in three separate wells. After that, we added 20 µl of our protein solution (with a concentration of about 0.5mg/ml).
We measured fluorescence using a Tecan M200 Infinite Pro plate reader with the following settings:
Excitation Scan Excitation Wavelength Start 340 nm
Excitation Wavelength End 520 nm
Excitation Wavelength Step Size 3 nm

Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"  This is because we suspect that our low yields may be due in some part to DNA being washed out of the column prematurely, or DNA not being washed completely out of the column during the elution step.  In getting rid of the column, there is no step during which we may lose DNA.
We are extremely happy to report that after weeks of getting dismal miniprep yields, we have found a new protocol that gives us insanely high yields (compared to before)!!!  The protocol is the following:
Centrifuge 1.5 ml of saturated cells at maximum speed for 1 minute, discard supernatant.
Resuspend cells in 200 ul of Buffer P1.
Add 200 ul of Buffer P2 to lyse the cells.  Mix by inverting several times, and let sit for 3 minutes.
Add 200 ul of Buffer N3 to precipitate SDS, mix by inverting several times.
Centrifuge at 4 degrees for 15 minutes.
Transfer supernatant to new tube, add 1 ml of 100% EtOH to precipitate DNA.
Centrifuge for 5 minutes at RT.  At this point a DNA pellet should be visible at the bottom of the tube.
Discard EtOH, wash DNA pellet with 1.5 ml of 70% EtOH (this gets rid of salts).
Centrifuge for 5 minutes at RT.
Discard EtOH, let tubes dry for approximately 6-8 minutes by inverting them on a piece of Kimwipe tissue.
Resuspend DNA pellet in 20 ul of heated EB buffer.
Our resulting yield was overall 463.4 ng/ul!!  The purity also looked extremely good, with a 260/280 value of 1.98.  The nanodrop results can be viewed below:
Over 20x times normal yield compared with the Qiagen miniprep kit.
We will have to repeat this again tomorrow to see if we get the same yields with this procedure.  Also, we should run some of these out on a gel to verify what it looks like.

The protocol used for the restriction enzyme digest will be as described yesterday:
16 ul DNA (any concentration)
2 ul 10x buffer 4
0.5 ul 100x BSA

Collaboration with Aalto-Helsinki
We collaborated with Aalto_helsinki team as well. We contacted them because they were working  on a similar project we were working on: producing boifuel with the tools of synthetic biology. While  they focused on producing propanol, we focused on producing butanol.
We kept in touch regularly trought e-mail, but also held a skype conference, where we talked about  our projects and the ways we could help each other. We both ordered gene fragments from IDT and  talked about that expreience and we gave each other tips on how to best accomplish other tasks of  iGEM. At the time, Slovenia HS has already done some work on our Human Practices, such as  presentations for students and appearences in media, while Aalto-Helsinki was just starting to  prepare their Human Practices, so we talked and echanged information and ideas about that. On teh  other hand, aalto-Helsinki already had experience creating wiki pages (their team won the award for  best wiki in 2014), while Slovenia HS was beginning to learn, so we were glad to also be able to ask  some questions about creating wiki.
We did some work for them in the laboratory as well. Aalto-Helsinki sent us one of their BioBricks (BBa_K1655001) for validation and to be able to compare their results with ours.  This BioBrick is a GFP that can be fused into any protein's aminoterminal. We first attempted to  validate this brick by fusing it with one of our genes (CtfB) that was already tested and proved to be  functional and active.
Our construct with CtfB and double terminator (K1669005) was first ligated as a back insert into their  plasmid pSB1C3 with GFP (BBa_K1655001) .

This year, our project researches the issues of the field sobriety test. We visited the judges, the policemen, the wine tasters, and the health care workers, who we considered as experts who may give us advice. Surveys were designed for the public concerning the breathalyzer test. We also met iGEM teams (NCTU, NTHU, CGU) and attended 2016 iGEM Asian Conference to exchange project ideas and share experience. In addition, a biotech company, BIONIME corp., provided us with technical supports. This page particularly presents our efforts concerning the Human Practices events.
Scenario: One day, a man drove lively on the road after eating lychees. Suddenly, he lost his control and his car bumped into the tree on the sideway. And he fell into a coma. For a while, a police officer came up and asked him to take a sobriety test. It turned out that he exceeded the legal alcohol limit in a breathalyzer test. He felt upset and decided to take action. How could we help him prove that he was innocent?
After researching news concerning the field sobriety test, we found many debates against the breathalyzer test such as individual metabolic differences, diabetes, refusals, people dead or in coma. We studied the principle behind the test and believed that there’s a way more reliable. Therefore, we went to the judges in the court, the police officers in the police station, the health care workers in the hospital and the wine tasters in a working place to discuss the issues and seek for opinions. We also designed a questionnaire to survey the public about their experience in the sobriety test. On campus, we educated the younger schoolmates with biotech skills and engaged the school’s teachers to experience the breathalyzer test. To connect iGEM community, we met teams hosted by NCTU-Formosa and attended the Asian conference held by NCKU-Tainan that provided us opportunities to exchange ideas and share experience. To work with iGEMers, we collaborated with NCTU-Formosa and helped them to confirm a function of one of their BioBrick parts. To develop IGEM BLOOD AL"

Human Impact
With any new development in technology, there coincides a need to appropriate the new object in the established context.  We intend to delineate any major questions about that process by pointing towards answers to these common concerns listed below, and describe how entrepreneurial and open-source work can coexist.
Feel free to jump to the Bottom Line .
What are the potentially proprietary components of a biologically engineered project?
Theoretically, a competitor should own any component submitted to the contest inasmuch as the competitor contributed to the novelty of the component in a major way. Whole organisms/subspecies/strains should not be owned if the competitor did not contribute to the differentiation of the species; isolated naturally-occurring genes should not be owned. Ownership of a biological organism or part cannot be claimed if the competitor did not partake in its creation – for example, the chemist who first isolates gold does not own all gold, but does own the isolation if it is a novel one, and this process would then be patentable. Following this logic it is also clear that isolating a gene does not lead to its patentability.
On 29 March 2010, US District Court Judge Robert Sweet ruled that ""products of nature do not constitute patentable subject matter unless modified enough to be a fundamentally new product,"" invalidating many gene patents in the process [25]. Previously, roughly 40,000 United States patents exist that correspond to about 2,000 human genes, or 20 percent of the human genome. It is still too soon to know how this issue will fall in the appeals courts, but it shows the realization by the courts that genes are information, not chemicals. It also suggests that scientists and engineers may soon be able to utilize all the genes in the quickly-growing GenBank databases free of worry from IP infringement.
Similarly, modifications to biological organisms or parts need to be carefully considered for originality. The rewriting of a book, superficially changing names of characters, locations, etc is not copyrightable in its own right, although the new names and characters could be considered the work of the new “author”; forming a DNA sequence degenerate to an already existing one, then, should not lead to a copyright. Modifying a car engine design does not lead to the"

Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all awards, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

(2) For potential risk
Following the advice from The Safety and Security Committee of iGEM, we contacted Fangzhong Wang from the Center for Biosafety Research and Strategy at Tianjin University. Through a series of correspondences, Prof. Wang kindly suggested us to reinforce the safety training on students who conduct the experiments which we have strictly followed. Prof. Wang also warranted us on the potential misuse and nefarious use, which we think are rather low with the following reasons:
1) The misuse risk is low:
The misuse risk is low because we didn't modify the virus but the chassis cell. The receptors selected for modulation to create effective infection are determined by the receptors already existed on the chassis cell, and differ among cell lines. Thus, modifying the chassis cells does not extensively expand the infection spectrum of a given virus.
2) The nefarious use risk is low:
The nefarious use risk is low because the current technology we used for chassis cell modulation cannot be directly transferred to another cell line, as new technological issues, such as functional expression of the receptor will arise which cannot be solved by the established the current technology.
Also important is that the benefits of this project significantly outweigh the potential risks.
Our project offers a solution that can considerably reduce the cost of vaccine production. Despite the high demand on vaccine, there is a lack of cell lines suitable for rapid virus production with reduced cost and independent intellectual property. Specifically, the stocks and slaughter of major livestocks such as pigs, cattle and sheep have maintained a steady growth rate of 5-10%, but the productivity level of domestic vaccines is difficult to meet the increasing supply demand in China, especially in the supply of high-quality and low-cost vaccines. Our project can effectively solve or release such problems. Take IBRV vaccine as an example, our modified chassis cells can triple IBRV titer, i.e., reducing the production cost by three times. Thus, compared with the enormous industrial benefits, the potential risks are negligible.
Safe lab work
Before conducting wet lab experiments, each team member has received the strict safety training given by our PI, lab technician and the university biosafety office. During these trainings, lab rules, staff responsible for biosafety issues, biosafety equipment and rules were comprehensively covered. Through these trainings, we are more acquainted with the experimental procedures, operation approaches on these equipments, and all safety issues and solutions.
Safe shipment
We sent our BioBricks through the standard shipping process required by iGEM."
BNU-China,2016,Team:BNU-China#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," 95% confidence interval of the dependent variable means under the different levels of the independent variable, and then we can analyze the degree of the different levels. But the precondition is that the data should satisfy the homogeneity of variance, in other words, the variance of the data should be the independent identically distributed. In the next part of the modeling, we will use the one-way analysis of variance to analyze the data, and then deal with the data.
To determine whether the data suitable for single factor analysis of variance
We use the SPSS to do the homogeneity test of variance with the data we got, the outcome is shown in the figure below:
Fig.4 The figure of the data’s homogeneity test of variance
From the figure, we can see the data’s variance is 0.519, bigger than 0.05. Therefore, we can think the data meets the requirement about the homogeneity of variance and we can use the one-way analysis of variance to deal with the data.
3.0 - Construct the F-test statistics
The independent variable is a classified variable which values 0 and 1 to describe whether the tax is added into the test tube. The dependent variable is the change of the micrutubule’ length, our modeling is shown below:
$$ y = u_i + \varepsilon_{ij} \tag{1} $$
In the equation (1), \(y\) is the dependent variable, the change of the microtubule's length. \(y_{ij}\) is the \(j\) observed value of the independent variable under the \(i\) level. is the mean of dependent variable under the \(i\) level.  stands for the residual between dependent variable’s value and it’s mean value,  also obey the normal distribution  \(N(0, \sigma_i ^2)\)
Then we construct the F test statistics. First, we define the quadratic sum of the residual:
$$ SSE = \sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} (y_{ij}-\overline y_1)^2 \tag{2}$$
And the quadratic sum of the elements:
$$ SSA = \sum_{i=1}^k n_i (\overline y_{1}-\overline y)^2 \tag{3}$$
SSA reflects the variance between different levels and the difference is made by the different elements; SSE reflects the variance in a certain level and this random difference is due to the selected sample’s random. For example, the measured length of the micro"

The new collaboration, the new harvest
Significantly, it was our first time to contact with Nanjing-China. We learned from their indefatigable efforts. They were willing to cooperate with other teams and visit different universities to make improvement. They focused on public awareness about the spread of synthetic biology knowledge. We are making the same effort.
Fig.14. The introduction from Nanjing-China
The meet-up was held on the basis of project’s completion, so we inspired each other in all aspects. With such a good platform for collaboration, we can help others and improve ourselves at the same time, become less blind and less helpless. We got the inspiration from sharing, and we attained the courage from communicating. We would like to thank TMMU_China to design primer for the DNA sequences generated by Bio101. Their efforts provided basis for synthesizing DNA sequences.
What we harvest from the collaboration
Through all the collaborations we have taken part in, we learned a lot and shared happiness. We knew collaboration, competition and communication deeper and better. What we acquired was not only about the iGEM competition itself, we made friends and expanded our eyesight. We communicated face to face to understand what they did and let them know what we are doing, through which we improved our own abilities. And we encouraged and competed each other to hold on the scientific trip, which made us know about the importance of the competitors and collaborators to scientific workers. All these memories will be a unique part of iGEM experience as well as our scientific life experience.

Team:Sheffield/29 June 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Today we got a guided tour of our labs for the very first time courtesy of Qaiser Sheikh. Exciting stuff! We looked at the proteins TonB and ExbB for potential use in our desalination cell. The fuel cell desalination idea was adapted to just a desalination cell consisting of 3 chambers without electrodes, with chambers following the same order as before, but this time with a chloride sequestering bacteria in one chamber and a sodium sequestering bacteria in the other. This still needs some research to work out how realistic this idea is. We liked Newcastle's project from 2009 and considered how Bac-Man might be able to aid our project this year in this area. Removing nitrate in sewage treatment plants may also hold potential. We would be looking at ways to lower the amount of nitrate released by the plants using novel bacteria with a consortium of enzymes to 'mop up' the excess. The process could also be energy productive, opposed to energy consuming (where aeration is concerned). Finally we're looking into developing the work done by the Sheffield 2008 team. This was a project aiming to detect the presence of cholera, however due to complications the team could not complete their project. Lunch today - sandwiches in the sun in Weston Park. Tom, Narmada and Caroline revealed their vegetarianism to the rest of the group *gasp*.

Maya and Patrick's log - 07/06/10
So today we have been working on the step-wise construction of our system, taking into account how to test each part along the way. We learned a lot about recombineering and the factors entailed in the process and have come up with the initial version of how we are going to construct the system.
As a rule of thumb we also learnt the following combinations and bad-combinations when working with FP's:
RFP can be used together with either GFP or CFP; and YFP together with CFP.
The bad combinations which we should never ever do are the following: RFP with YFP; and YFP with GFP.
We have also created a new folder in the research group in dropbox, called ""Synthetic biology"" where we have uploaded 2 articles about the first constructed synthetic cell, which we think would be a good idea if everyone had a look at. :)
We have also uploaded Sebastien's presentations from last week, and they can be found in the folder ""Presentations from Sebastien"" in the research group folder as well.
So, from all the work today we are trying to make a scheme of phases / phase planning of the construction parts that need to be completed in a described order that will be uploaded possibly within this week.
Captain's log 040610
Maya, Thomas, Patrick, Lisa and Annemi have been working on a project description for Sebastien. The document 'project description' can be found in dropbox in the research group folder. From now on this document will be the only one describing the project, therefore you should edit in the document and not create a new one. We have decided that every time we are doing something iGEM related, that it should be posted in this document. Please write the date and your name at the beginning of your log. This will make it easier for all of us to keep track of what is going on in the group. We have tried to make a simple plan of what needs to be done before going to the lab:
Investigate the E. coli chromosome to find out where we can integrate the switch
Find the BioBricks we will be using (DNA sequences)
Install the software CLC main workbench (the program which will be useful for the design of the system)
Design the system: Order of genes, restriction sites, DNA sequences, order of integration of genes into the plasmids

Day 1 - 07/06/18
We started the day with introductory talks from iGEM alumni explaining iGEM and the wiki, we then went onto look at previous                      competition entries. Jem Stach and Phil Wright spoke about their experience in the field, research interests and what makes a good competition entry.
Day 2 - 08/06/18
The day began with a talk from Jon Marles-Wright about the importance of human practices and the impacts of                      our projects in the real world. This was followed by Dana Ofiteru who taught us about mathematical modelling of                      biological systems. In the afternoon, plant biologist Max Kapralov discussed using synthetic biology to improve                      the efficiency of photosynthesis. Finally, Rachel Armstrong (professor of experimental architecture) discussed                      the potential of microorganism in waste management systems and energy production in the built environment. Rachel                      also outlined political and economic issues surrounding synthetic biology.
Day 3 - 11/06/18
We started the day with a talk from Angel Goni Moreno who discussed the principles of synthetic biology and provided                      guidance on the implementation of logic in Biology. We then had some time to discuss our own ideas and come up with new ideas as a team. Following this, some Synthetic Biology Masters students came to talk to us about the importance of modelling lab work. Each member of the team gave a presentation on a previous competition                      entry that has won an award so we could familarise ourselves with the components of a successful iGEM project and explore some exciting science!
Day 4 - 12/06/18

Fig.2 The object to be tested changes the orientations of the liquid                                     crystal alignment
Results and outlook
Based on the above principles and design, we firstly verified that there was a significant                         correlation between the liquid crystal brightness and the concentration of fixed mountain 2M,                         and through the optimization of the parameters of the detection system, the liquid crystal                         brightness changed significantly when the antigen concentration was 150ng/mL-400ng/mL. In                         addition, the antibody with long chain modification is selected for detection, and the                         brightness changes of the liquid crystal are more obvious, which can achieve the purpose of                         effective and reliable detection.
At the same time, we designed a test box of 5cm × 5cm × 10cm to demonstrate our product. The                         short-term goal of this project is to make the patients in the home use of our test kits, only                         need to add a drop of urine and auxiliary drops wait for a period of time after taking a                         picture, can intuitive understanding to your beta 2 m concentration in the urine and kidney                         function, when he will photos uploaded to the mobile terminal, can generate individualized                         treatment guidelines.
Of course, we have a better idea. We can use this test to determine a variety of proteins. After                         all, there are many diseases that require more accurate diagnosis using one or a series of                         proteins in urine or blood. For example, AD7c-ntp in urine can be used as an indicator of                         alzheimer's disease. The index of coronary heart disease is 15 kinds of urine polypeptide                         combination. To do this we simply need to design a new type of 96-well plate that imparts                         different antigens to the substrate to enable the determination of multiple proteins and even                         proteomics.

Cloning:
Fourteen new biobricks were successfully cloned. Four of which were cloned into in the pSB1C3 vector and submitted to the registry. The type III Zoarces elongatus antifreeze protein (ZeAFP) and Tenebrio molitor antifreeze protein (TmAFP) have been previously characterized in the literature and are now in the registry for other teams to use. Our project primarily focused on extensively characterizing our novel Rhagium inquisitor antifreeze protein (RiAFP) biobrick, as very little is currently known about the structure or function of this protein, besides its hyperactive thermal hystersis property. All parts were verified by fully sequencing them by our team using Yale's Keck Biotechnology center.  Our RiAFP biobrick was awarded Best Natural BioBrick at the Americas Regional Jamboree.
We improved upon the existing TmAFP biobrick in the registry. Team Tokyo Tech 2009 previously submitted a biobrick of the Tenebrio molitor antifreeze protein, TmAFP (BBa_K193209). However, this biobrick contains an internal EcoRI site and is therefore incompatible with BBF RFC10. Additionally, the TmAFP protein in the Tokyo Tech part seems to be truncated; we have characterized and documented these details on their parts page . Our TmAFP part is RFC10 compatible, and includes the full sequence of this protein.  Our sequence was obtained from the Fass Lab, and is reported on in the following paper: Bar, M., Bar-Ziv, R., Scherf, T. & Fass, D. Efficient production of a folded and functional, highly disulfide-bonded [beta]-helix antifreeze protein in bacteria. Protein Expression and Purification 48, 243-252 (2006).

Integrated HP with TACG Biotech
Gene synthesis technology research:
We know that synthesizing a genome is not as simple as typing a code, so where does its                         technical                         difficulty lie?                         What are the existing gene synthesis technologies? With these questions we came to TACG                         Biotech.
Peng Kai, CTO of TACG Biotech, told us that the current process of a complete synthesis from                         bases                         to                         genomes is                         actually more like building blocks, rather than inputting word by word like writing as what                         many                         people                         may think.                         Gene synthesis is like building blocks, and Oligo is the smallest unit, which is chemically synthesized                         and bears                         the length of up to 250 bp (usually 60 bp to 90 bp). Usually it can be spliced into gene                         fragments                         of                         about 1 Kbp                         in                         one time in vitro, then the next round proceeds. The traditional fusion PCR, TA cloning, and                         the                         newly-minted                         emergence of Gibson Assembly, CPEC, in vitro homologous recombination and DATEL in the past 10                         years                         have provided                         a                         variety of options for this process, greatly reducing the synthetic difficulty of the                         conventional                         kb-level genes.                         However, large-scale gene synthesis over 10K usually relies on the recombination and cloning                         system                         of                         the model                         chassis in order to obtain a better splicing effect. Therefore, how to obtain longer Oligos                         with                         lower                         cost in the                         preliminary stage and achieve large-scale gene fragment assembly with high efficiency in the                         future                         is                         a core                         technical obstacle that restricts the large-scale application of gene synthesis technology. In                         regard                         to Oligos                         synthesis, the high-throughput gene synthesis chip represented by TWIST reduced the synthesis                         cost                         of                         Oligos by ten                         times, yet the initial synthesis length did not improve. CTO Peng further introduced that in                         fact, organism itself                         is the most experienced in gene synthesis, so the bio-enzymatic Oligos gene synthesis                         technology is                         expected to                         achieve cheaper and greener Oligos synthesis with content length and even large-scale gene                         synthesis.

Our proof of concept here was simple: we measured the rate of growth in Synechocystis both before and after transformation. We originally intended to dilution plate and then count the number of bacterial colonies but Synechocystis PCC sp. 6803 grows so slowly that this proved to be very difficult. Instead, we decided to use a colorimeter to measure how much light (at 680nm) was absorbed by the broth. We then had the UCL team confirm our results by measuring the optical density of the broth using a spectrophotometer.
Our results show that the growth rates in the exponential phase of growth differ significantly. By focusing on the exponential part of the growth curve, we calculated the maximum gradients to be 0.016 for untransformed and 0.034 for transformed Synechocystis PCC sp. 6803. As the transformations took a long time, we were unable to set up multiple cultures derived from colonies from multiple transformations plates and so could not obtain numerous repeats.

Week 10 : 29th of August to 4th of September
Monday
The human practices effort has been surprisingly succesful - tracking down a person knowing only their name and alma mater is (disconcertingly) easy with the aid of the internet, and ex-iGEM-ers seem enthusiastic to help out.
The team has had the vague (perhaps impossible) idea of spin-coating a toy car with reflectin as a demonstration of one of the many wonderful applications it could have.
Tuesday
It turns out (with some ruefulness on our part) that the sinister tendrils        observed on our slides may have been due to other components in the thin      film, not reflectin. On the plus-side, however, we're near-certain that the       iridescence of the film itself is due to reflectin, and we're seeing some new     unusual behaviours in our latest films (things like oscillating patterns - too poorly examined by us to write about yet).
A very detailed social itinerary is being put-together for the Amsterdam trip.    To the approval of some and bemusement of others, no time is scheduled for sleep!
Wednesday
Good news! A careful control tells us our much- beloved sinister tendrils are indeed a behaviour of reflectin itself.  It's rather stressful     researching to a deadline, and there's some worry that our pixel won't be working by Amsterdam
Thursday
Today we constructed GA18 - a fusion of Reflectin-GFP and a Twin arginine leader sequence which will form part of our protein secretion experiments. Unfortunately this was the only construct on the Gel which didn"

Carotenoids
Introduction Previous Research Our Action Plan Result Analysis Reference
Introduction
Carotenoids are organic pigments naturally present in plants, algae and some bacteria. There are more than 600 carotenoids, which can be categorised into xanthophylls (hydrocarbons containing oxygen element) and carotenes (hydrocarbons containing no oxygen). Carotenoids perform a range of functions, including light energy absorption, protection against photo-damage, acting as antioxidants, and as precursor to other organic compounds. In human, for example, beta-carotene is the precursor to vitamin A.
The common starting point for carotenoid synthesis is farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), which derives from two precursors, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). In general, there are two pathways for synthesising IPP and DMAPP: the Mevalonate Pathway (starting with acetyl CoA) and the Non-mevalonate Pathway (starting with pyruvate and glyceradehyde-3-phosphate). While the Mevalonate Pathway is present in all higher eukaryotes, the Non-mevalonate Pathway is present in E. coli.
Part of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway is shown below (figure adopted from iGEM 2007 Team Edinburgh):
Some of the intermediates in the above pathways are coloured, e.g. lycopene (red), beta-carotene (orange), and zeaxanthin (yellow). The enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway are CrtE, CrtB, CrtI, CrtY, and CrtZ. Since our team aims to use different colour pigments as signal output, the above pathway can be incorporated in our design of colour production"

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  Today, DLS will be done on the purified PCquadY from last week.  The elutions will be pooled before bringing it to Kevin.
Procedure: The first two elutions from the experiment visibly contained a white precipitate, which is likely the protein cage.  These tubes were pooled and centrifuged.  The pellet was re-suspended in 150uL of triton lysis buffer.
Results:  The supernatant sample and the re-suspended pellet were both ran.  Both did not provide a baseline reading.
Conclusion:  Since aggregation seems to be a problem, the DLS may have to be ran soon after purification."

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," However, the modeling also shows that our biouologically produced microlenses have no focal point but a focal area. For multiple applications this is an important requirement. For example, Nikon told us that the lenses they use for their cameras should have a very specific focal point with a very small acceptable deviation. This means that our biological microlenses, that do not have a focal point and are currently not exactly uniform, are not suitable to be used as a camera lens at the moment.
For applications were the uniformity or focal point is from less importance and the goal is purely to capture more light, our microlenses are very suitable. For example, for solar panels, an array of microlenses is used as encapsulation layer. The more lenses per array, the more light can be captured, which means that the lenses have to be as small as possible. We have shown in the experimental part of our project that we are able to produce spherical microlenses that are around 1 um, which make them 10-100x smaller than conventional microlenses. Current techniques are not sufficient enough to produce microlenses of this size at large scale (Krupenkin, Yang, & Mach, 2003). Therefore, our microlenses solve production limitations encountered in the conventional microlens industry.
In conclusion, our microlenses are currently not suitable for applications were uniformity or a local point is required, such as camera lenses. However, for applications were solely the goal is to capture light, for example for solar panels or optical fibres, the microlenses are often very suitable, because they are so small.
Risk Assessment Tool
Introduction
“iGEM teams follow a high standard of safe and responsible biological engineering. Because you are members of the synthetic biology community, you are responsible for living up to the trust placed in you to design, build, and share biological devices safely” (iGEM HQ, 2016) . With this setting we started our own safety analysis . We have analyzed our working space, ensured that every team member completed the required safety trainings and tests, and that every member who helped with the laser setup received an extensive laser safety training. Furthermore, we analyzed the chemicals, looked into the organisms and did research into the vectors we used.
Although we managed to write an extensive safety proposal and filled in all the required forms, we did notice a lack of standardization of the approach to risk management in the field of synthetic biology. It appears that in many technological disciplines, such as aerospace engineering or chemical engineering, risk analyses are done in a more standardized manner"

BostonU_HW,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Collaborations#Blog1_-_-_TEXT.html,"Before we jump into intellectual property, we should define the idea of property rights. Property rights grant a property owner exclusive authority to determine how a resource is used, essentially giving total power over the resource (within governmental regulations) to the owner. Property rights as a concept blankets everything from real property (land) to intangible property (ideas). One key subset of property and property rights is intellectual property, which is what we will concern ourselves with for the remainder of this post. Now with a clear understanding of property rights, here is the Google definition of intellectual property:
in·tel·lec·tu·al prop·er·ty
noun
LAW
a work or invention that is the result of creativity, such as a manuscript or a design, to which one has rights and for which one may apply for a patent, copyright, trademark, etc.
Gee willikers, what an irritatingly long and overly-complicated definition; let’s break it down.  In the case of synthetic biology, intellectual property is any work done by a researcher that qualifies as property and for which they can apply a patent or copyright. (You might be asking right now, “wait, why isn’t trademark in your definition when it was a part of the formal definition?”  Our response would be, “you actually read the whole definition?!” A trademark is a word or string of words that is legally registered to represent a legal entity.  Most scientists don’t trademark their names or the names of their products so this was excluded from the definition of intellectual property applied to synthetic biology.)  Unfortunately, the definition of intellectual property directly references two other terms that are important to understand for the purpose of our discussion (copyright and patent), so here are their definitions followed by our analysis:
cop·y·right
noun
the exclusive legal right, given to an originator or an assignee to print, publish, perform, film, or record literary, artistic, or musical material, and to authorize others to do the same.
“he issued a writ for breach of copyright”
pat·ent
noun
a government authority or license conferring a right or title for a set period, especially the sole right to exclude others from making, using, or selling an invention.
“he took out a patent for an improved steam hammer”
Right now you’re probably thinking, “holy smoke, that was a lot of definitions taken straight from Google! Why am I reading this then?” You’re right, we definitely copied those definitions from the internet, but this post hopefully adds value to your internet-definition-reading-experience by providing a more in"
