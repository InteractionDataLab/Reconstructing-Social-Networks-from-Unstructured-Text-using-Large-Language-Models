Collaborations
Potsdam
With the iGEM team from Potsdam we had a Skype call, since their project showed some similarities to ours. In their first abstract, they were going to investigate two approaches for metabolic channeling, one of which included the usage of liquid liquid phase separation.
Excited about the fact that we found a project similar to ours, we decided to set up a Skype call. We talked about our projects and exchanged some ideas about Human Practices. Since the project of Potsdam is also more foundational, they also struggled somewhat with explaining it to people. They gave us the tip to work towards a good application, which makes it easier to explain it to people. Furthermore, we gave them some tips about working with the WIKI in HTML and CSS and offered to simulate their system with our modeling approach. They set us up with a contact person who delivered us as much information as possible of their system needed for the model.
After the summer we had some other Skype calls to talk about our progress and the WIKI teams also gave some critical feedback on each others WIKI sites, which was very helpful. After hard work from our modeling team, our model was up and running for our system. But, to really show the adaptiveness of our model we also modeled the project of the iGEM Potsdam team. For them, it’s also nice to have a model of their project, since they do not have much modeling experience. The model gave them a better and more detailed understanding of the inner workings of their project. Besides collaborating on the modeling and the WIKI, we also agreed to help each other during the Grand Jamboree by being present at each other’s practice session to provide some last feedback.
Postcard Exchange
From iGEM team Duesseldorf Cologne 2017 we were invited to participate in this year’s Postcard Exchange. Last year seven iGEM teams from Germany decided to join this Exchange and this year teams from all over Europe have joined! Since iGEM is not only about lab work but also about spreading"

Collaboration
iGEM teams are a big family. All teams register the competition are encouraged to help each other to make the projects better! Collaboration is really an important part in the process of competition.
This year, we built close cooperative relation to HUST-China , WHU-China and ZJU-China and helped each other to make our project better.
1、we offered help to HUST-China team in their genetic circuit construction. They failed when they used a reporter in their test experiment. We provided them with an essential reporter part we constructed (B0034+E0040+B0015)  and succeeded inserting the reporter part respectively to the downstream of the three ptrp mutants.
2、when dealing with the Interface Device, we met some trouble about the usage of SCM (Single Chip Micyoco) as we were not familiar with it. Thus, we turned to ZJU-China for help and they soon provide us a basic program which can change the brightness of LED through controlling PWM as a reference and later other suggestions online.
3、WHU-China team communicated with us frequently. Due to the lack of team member working on modeling, they turned to our team for help. After learning about their project, we analyzed the design of their genetic circuit carefully and built mathematical model for it.
In addition we also received assistance from WHU-China team when we decided to adopt a light control system in our project. They helped us to construct a section of light control system, saving our precious time.

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a"

Safety/Security
BioMORTAR, unlike many other synthetic biology projects, does not deal directly with live cells. However, BioMORTAR designs plasmids for cells that are to be created, and therefore must consider similar safety procedures as other lab-based groups. Simlar to physical labs, BioMORTAR must be able to ensure that the cells created can be controlled for the safety of the environment and community. Also, they must be able to keep away those who are using synthetic biology for malicious purposes in order to ensure safety of the public and because the use of synthetic biology could potentially be used for violence in the future.
In order to make sure that cells do not grow out of control, the COBRA based modeling tool will project the growth of the designed bacteria. The modeling part of BioMORTAR will be able to give the user a graph representing growth rates over time. This would allow the user to compare the growth of the designed bacteria with growth of other bacteria in the environment to determine how it will interact with the other factors in the environment. Cell modeling in BioMORTAR will hopefully help promote the safe use of synthetic biology in more complex or natural environments.
Like cellular biology labs, BioMORTAR needs to have a way to keep people with malicious intentions away from this tool, especially if it is intended to expedite the creation of novel bacteria. In order to deter those wishing to create the next superbacteria, the next version of BioMORTAR will be able to log every plasmid created and match them to their registered account or ip address on the computer.  This will allow us to show records of certain member's activity in case authorities needed to find the one who created a bug that was designed by BioMORTAR.
Since there are many potential risks involved with synthetic biology, it is very important for BioMORTAR to promote the use of safety precautions by those using the software to design novel bacteria.

Abstract
We describe the creation of BioBrick BBa_K1352000, the modularized version of BBa_K759001, which is compatible with iGEM Assemly Standard RCF10. Previous work by the Aberdeen 2014 iGEM team had clearly shown that both Ag43 containing BioBricks BBa_K346007 and BBa_K759001 contained the 6 native PstI sites that characterise the native Ag43 sequence. Also, BBa_K542009 was shown to contain an additional XbaI site and to have a smaller size than predicted. They were thus found to be non-compliant with assembly Standard 10. We describe the design and construction of the new BioBrick BBa_K1352000, and its verification using restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. Finally, we show that antigen 43 protein expression of biobrick BBa_K1352010 was not affected by the PCR-based Site-Directed Mutagenesis process. The biobrick works biologically as intended after modification and has the same response to arabinose induction: formation of culture aggregation.
1. Structure and function
Antigen 43 (Ag43), the product of the flu gene, is a cell-surface autotransporter protein found in Escherichia coli. It is expressed at about 50, 000 copies/cell and is initially synthesised as a precursor of 1039 amino acids. Upon removal of the signal peptide, the protein is transported to the cell surface and is composed of an α subunit (499 amino acids) at the N-terminus and a β subunit (488 amino acids) at the C-terminus (Kj\aergaard"
Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"), IVTT reaction reagents and substrate nucleotides were generated, incubated at 37oC and merged with 40 pL amplification reagents with no cytidine nucleotides. After the 6 incubation at 30oC the amplified DNA product was analyzed in agarose gel. Intensive dark RNA band at ~ 1kb correspond to IVTT reaction kit RNA (tRNA, rRNA and etc.).. L and HR correspond to GeneRuler 1kb and High Range DNA Ladders.
In order to show, that the CAT-Seq workflow for activity recorded DNA library preparation is working, two experiments with different starting DNA templates and no reference nucleotides have been carried out. Two populations of 10pL biomolecule synthesis droplets housing IVTT reaction components, substrate nucleotides and circularized Esterase gene or a pUC19 (control) plasmid were generated. After the incubation in 37oC for 3 hours the droplets were reinfused into the droplet merging device. At the same time droplets, housing MDA reaction components without the reference nucleotides(5mC) were generated at ~2 500 000 droplets per hour. The merged droplets were collected and incubated at 30oC for 6 hours. After that, the amplified DNA was extracted using Ampure beads and analyzed on agarose gel. Because no reference nucleotides were used, the only source of cytidine nucleotides in the reaction were substrate nucleotides. However, these nucleotides cannot be incorporated into the DNA, unless the synthesized biomolecule catalyses the conversion, in this example the hydrolysis, of substrate nucleotides. 17 fig. DNA band migration results conclude, that:
Substrate nucleotides are stable and are not affected by any of the components in the CAT-Seq workflow as there is no DNA product when pUC19 template is used (17 fig. 2 well).
Biomolecule of interest is being synthesised in the 10pL droplets and indeed catalyzed the hydrolysis of substrate nucleotides, as DNA is amplified after the merging because a band is visible (17 fig 1 well).
The amplification of DNA concludes the viability of droplet electrocoalescence technique and proves that catalytic information initially stored in 10 pL droplets is carried to the DNA during the amplification, because these nucleotides are incorporated in it.

Organization of a Meet Up: Another European Meet Up
Reason
After attending two meet ups we realized that these meetings are very enriching experiences in preparation for the Giant Jamboree. One of the main reasons for these meet ups is to get to know and know the project of other teams. Other reason is that its also serves to practice the presentations of the project and its results. And finally serve to open the network of contacts beyond the contest itself.
We realized that the events to which more teams come are usually the first ones to be organized, and in these although if they serve to obtain collaborations, do not fulfill so much the function of practicing to present the results of your project due to at the beginning of the summer there are no results.
This year the European meet up was on July 20. Date in which novice teams, without sufficient contacts do not yet know how to deal with these events and do not have the necessary funds to attend. And teams with more experience do not yet have conclusive results. With this context we proposed this ambitious project: Make another European meet up. We invited all the teams of the continent in mid-September. A date that was supposed to be the best for the organization of new teams and with the possibility of simulating the final event.
Event
The event was organized between September 14 and 16. Although this event was given as much publicity as possible and contact was made with all possible teams in Europe, attendance was low due to several factors:
- Spain is geographically at one end of Europe and travel is expensive.
- The teams were short of funds and were saving for the trip to Boston.
- The event was announced at the beginning of September, many teams did not have room to maneuver in their organization to attend.
Despite these inconveniences we had assistance from several participants of some teams (all of them came from within the Spanish territory thanks to the facilities for transport). Although there was an extensive program of activities, these had to be adjusted and reorganized so that the maximum number of attendees could enjoy them.

Result
The results shows this device can work in 42℃, but it doesn’t work high-efficiently. Combined with OD600 measurement, we found two results for its low efficuent. Firstly, the expression of RFP protein is lower than normal strain, which only has reporter part in the plasmid. Secondly, the RFP protein has a similar emission wave when test OD600, and that may be the most biology nosie in this measurement. What’s more, we changed eGFP reporter to test this part, but it didn’t finish."

Aim of the experiment: Precipitation the 70% saturated ammonium sulfate solution
Procedure: The ammonium sulfate solution, which actually was a suspension, was transferred into centrifuge tubes and spun down (10,000 rpm, 45 mins). As it turns out, unfortunately too much ammonium sulfate was used for the precipitation (wrong table). The precipitate was brought back into solution (20 mM  Tris/HCl, pH 8.0) and loaded onto an SDS gel for analysis, along with other samples (flowthrough of the filtration from the day before).

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,". The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of ammonia concentration to the user’s mobile phone during the detection process.
Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace"

Design
TnrA-pAlsT -RFP
Main goal of this part is to show TnrA protein’s repressor activity on pAlst promoter and derepression of this promoter in the presence of NH3. Thereby we combined TnrA protein’s and pAlst’s gene sequences on the same biobrick. As a reporter, we put RFP gene sequence in front of the pAlst sequence. To make sure the repressive protein TnrA is produced in a high amount, we combined TnrA-pAlst-RFP gene sequence with T7 promoter which has a high transcription rate. Also, we put a Lac operator which LacI protein can bind, between this sequence and T7 promoter, in order to create a controllable system. We searched to find an expression vector working in harmony with this system, peT45-b expression vector was serving this purpose. . When we ordered our genes, we put RFC10 prefix site on 3’ end of TnrA-pAlst-RFP gene sequence and also BamHI restriction enzyme recognition site for cloning to peT45-b. We added RFC10 suffix site on 5’ end of the same gene sequence and also XhoI restriction enzyme recognition site for cloning to peT-45 vector, again.
As shown above,we planned to clone the ordered TnrA-pAlst-RFP gene into peT45-b vector by using BamHI and XhoI enzymes. Final construct after this cloning is, T7 promoter-Lac operator(LacO)-HisTag-TnrA-pAlst-RFP, respectively. Besides, a constitutive promoter called LacI promoter and LacI protein sequence in front of that, found on peT45-b vector’s another part. It is obvious that this part is IPTG-dependent, so Western Blot can be performed easily with the help of His Tag.
According to this system, under the absence of IPTG; TnrA production  will be repressed, pAlsT promoter will be derepressed and RFP won’t be produced. If IPTG is present,  TnrA will be produced , pAlsT promoter becomes derepressed and red colored bacteria will be observed with production of RFP.

learnsynbio
Our main outreach initiative is a series of Synthetic Biology learning modules which we call LearnSynBio.org. After the success of our 2015 educational outreach, we wanted to switch gears and target our outreach efforts             to a demographic which has not received as much attention for educational outreach.
Most outreach seemed targeted either to young children, with the hopes of  introducing them to science in general,          or to the general population, with the hopes of sparking a discussion about the ethical concerns and societal          implications of synthetic biology. But we found comparatively little that reached out to high school students          who are on the cusp of deciding potential career paths in a way that introduced them to synthetic biology as an          actual scientific field. These students seemed like an ideal audience for our outreach efforts.
Since many of the core concepts within synthetic biology are fairly simple to understand with only limited background          knowledge, we set out to create educational materials targeted explicitly towards these high school students in order          to introduce them to the field of synthetic biology as a potential, and perhaps exciting, career option.
LearnSynBio consists of four modules of instructional videos and supplemental materials (worksheets) which are meant          to introduce high school students with basic biology and math background to the ideas in Synthetic Biology. LearnSynBio          is organized into four modules: an Introduction to Basic Biology Concepts, an Introduction to Experimental Techniques          used in Synthetic Biology, an Introduction to Genetic Circuit Theory and Mathematical Modeling, and a module on the          Ethics and Implications of Synthetic Biology.
In order to develop our materials effectively, we spoke with our former high school biology teachers to ask them what          features they would like to see present in LearnSynBio in order to best facilitate its incorporation into the classroom.          They emphasized the relatively short, discrete nature of the videos (preferring several videos in a module to one long          video), and really emphasized the importance of supplemental materials like worksheets which reinforce and complement          the material presented in the videos, and we incorporated these suggestions into the design of LearnSynBio.
for a PDF of more examples of learnsynbio exercises, click here.
Because LearnSynBio is hosted on an independent domain, it is easily accessible anywhere by anyone and can easily          be maintained and updated with feedback from teachers who use it. This allows our outreach efforts to continue even          in places and times where we cannot be physically present!
Finally, we are taking measures"

The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of polystyrene performed could not have been done without the help of Ivonne Robledo and the University of Edinburgh’s iGEM team. They were kind enough to offer us assistance on developing the life cycle assessment and visualise the real impact that our project would have on the environment, from the first steps of reducing EPS waste to finally biodegrading it into biomass products. While assessing the impacts of currently produced plastics may help with understanding of their environmental effects, polystyrene and other common synthetic polymers have been around and unreplaced for almost a hundred years (Dow Chemical, 2012), another important issue to tackle in the modern world is the creation of new, eco-friendly plastics that leave a weaker trace on the environment.
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a polyester category of bioplastics that are ubiquitously found to be produced by various sugar and lipid fermentation processes as a form of energy storage (Jingnan et al, 2009). Their polymers may comprise of up to 200 different monomers that can combine to produce materials that completely differ from each other by properties.
The University of Edinburgh’s overgraduate team project focused exactly on the production of one form of PHAs that they plan to derive from whiskey distillery by-products, called poly-(3-hydroxybutyrate-3-hydroxyvalerate) or PHBV. In their LCA analysis, they have confirmed that production of PHBV biopolymers would have an overall positive environmental impact and believe that further investigation and work on their pathway might improve the world of PHA bioplastics. While collaborating on the LCA, we found that the pathways our projects are using coincide at a specific point, enabling the products TodH breakdown of 4-hydroxy-2-oxopentanoate; acetaldehyde and pyruvate, to be further processed into PHBV polymers through their PHA operon.
Testing on the intercorrelation of styrene degradation and PHA production has previously been done and found that 10% of polystyrene mass fed to the bacteria ends up converted into PHA polymers (Ward et al, 2006), offering exciting insight for"

Short Summary
To showcase the possibility of enzyme activity regulation on protein level, we designed a photoswitching experiment in which we controlled the lycopene production of an E. coli strain. This was achieved by incorporation of the non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) phenylalanine-4'-azobenzene (AzoF) into pytoene desaturase, encoded by crtI. The lycopene production can be completely terminated by introduction of amber codons into crtI. The enzyme activity can be partially recovered by cotransformation with an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS, BBa_K2201207 ). Even without supplementation of the media with the desired ncAA, this will lead to some enzyme activity recovery. In addition, we showed that we are able to switch the conformation of AzoF from a mixed state to trans and cis with our LED panel and that the amino acids are stable in their specific conformation over several hours. When cultivated with AzoF in cis- or trans-conformation we detected a significant difference in the lycopene production. Therefore"

Receptor design highlights
Think before you ink may be a popular slogan wielded by tattoo adversaries, but it has also been perfectly applicable to creating our synthetic biology approach of bioprinting. In the following, we explore the contemplations that contributed to the design of the membrane proteins (also referred to as 'receptors') that allow us to embed eukaryotic and bacterial cells into a stable, three-dimensional and user-definable matrix immediately upon printing.

For this purpose, we built two kinds of receptor constructs, both on their own able – when expressed in mammalian cells – to cross-link cells for our approach of bioprinting:
1) A receptor presenting an extracellular biotin acceptor peptide that is endogenously biotinylated by a coexpressed biotin ligase (BirA), thus presenting biotin molecules on the cellular surface and allowing it to interact with streptavidin in the printing solution.
2) Receptors presenting an extracellular monomeric or single-chain avidin variant.

Since bioethics and security have to be seriously considered during a                                     project’s                                     design and execution, we highlighted the efforts of the                                     aforementioned projects to address these issues.
After we wrapped up our presentation, we discussed with                                     students and professors about synthetic biology and the                                     iGEM Competition. Students showed interest in learning more                                     about the engineering principles of synthetic biology. We                                     were happy to elaborate on the use of logic gates and                                     explain them terms such as orthogonality and robustness.
Survey
Finally, students were asked to complete a short                                     questionnaire. Here are the results:
Reception
All professors welcomed the idea of organizing a second visit in the balkan region, where we would have the opportunity to interact with students through synthetic biology workshops.
Dr Jasna Puizina, University of Split, told us that she was impressed that undergraduate students were involved in such a contemporary branch of science. She wanted to learn more about the iGEM Competition and shared with us her interest about the formation of an interbalkan iGEM team. She concluded that she will initiate discussions so that synthetic biology courses will be added in the faculty’s curriculum.
We also had a discussion with Dr Alen Mujcinovic, University of Sarajevo, as he was interested in the entrepreneurship side of iGEM and synthetic biology’s applications in agriculture. He thought that involvement in the iGEM Competition would be a great opportunity for students of the faculty.
Conclusion
As this was our first time presenting in front of such a large audience in English, we believe that this experience will prove very useful to us. We managed to communicate our work to people of other nationalities and interacted with numerous researchers in the Balkan region receiving their comments about our work.
Students participating in our event got to know a lot about Synthetic Biology and, through examples & discussion, understood how synthetic biological circuits can be used in real-world applications.
We have already made plans to continue our activities in the Balkan region, with the organization of interactive workshops and presentations.

We believe that workshops is a great way to                                                 introduce someone to a specific scientific                                                 branch. An interactive approach gives the                                                 individual the opportunity to to be more                                                 involved in the learning process, promoting not                                                 only knowledge, but creativity as well.

3 IP related to iGEM
4 Background: Myriad Genetics Ruling Summary
5 Interview with the Speakers
Participants
In order to discuss the issues around intellectual property rights and synthetic biology, we attended an event hosted by BioPeople called ""The Basics and the Best"".  This event consisted of a series of three lectures:
""What is IP and how do I use it for my company development?"" by Jakob Krag Nielsen, IP lawyer at Rønne & Lundgren
""Navigating the legal landscape in the United States - How is it different than Europe"" by Michael Cohen, IP lawyer at Gray Plant Moody
""IP strategy in case of external financing and licensing"" by Thomas Tscherning, director at TTO of Aarhus University
We had a question and answer session with the following speakers following their lectures.  Our discussion focused around the impact that the recent Myriad Genetics US Supreme Court ruling would have on synthetic biology.
Lecture Summary
The discussion gave us an interesting perspective on the way that people outside academia view patents and IP law.
Patents can be granted on any useful technology that is novel and not obvious.
If patents are granted on the raw genes, this means that the gene is not available for other researchers to use.
Companies want to patent their technologies, because this gives them the ability to prevent other companies using these technologies without paying a licensing fee.  Having a patent does not necessarily grant the holder ""freedom to operate"", or, the ability to use the technology explained by the patent.
License agreements between parties may grant the rights to manufacture and distribute, but do not necessarily grant the right to use a technology.
License agreements between a patent holder and a licensee may change the terms of payment of royalties, and an interpretation of contract law will determine whether these agreements are enforceable.  An example is Listerine who agreed to a payment in perpetuity was required to continue paying fees even though nearly the same formulation was used by competitors for no fee.  Another example is a company whose"

Restriction Digestion, Antarctic Phosphatase, and Ligation
Determine the order of the two parts you will be putting together; the one in front will be referred to as the insert, while the one behind will be referred to as the vector.  Both the vector and the insert need to have their own separate tube, at least in the beginning.
Restriction Digest
Insert tube
3x molar ratio to vector of DNA
4µL buffer
0.5 µL enzyme 1
0.5µL enzyme 2
1.0µL BSA
ddH2O up to 35µL
Vector tube
1/3 molar ratio to vector of DNA
4µL buffer
0.5 µL enzyme 1
0.5µL enzyme 2
1.0µL BSA
ddH2O up to 35µL
Put both tubes into the 37°C water bath for 2 hours.  After, place them into the 82°C heating block for 20 minutes.  This deactivates any enzymes in the tube (which is ok, because by now they’ve done all they need to). Take the insert out, and put it in a -20°C freezer.
Antarctic Phosphatase Protocol
To the vector tube, add 5 μL of 10x Antarctic Phosphatase Buffer, 9μL of water, and 1 μL of Antarctic Phosphatase.  We do this to prevent the vector from closing up again without any"

Chemical synthesis was performed by Vivien, as she wrote her bachelor's thesis at the Chair of Organic Chemistry at TUM. The initial synthesis plan was discussed with Dr. Martin Dauner, who is the chemist in the lab of Prof. Skerra. Vivien worked alone afterwards in synthesizing the target compounds and subsequently analyzing their properties. The NMR experiments were then measured at the Faculty of Chemistry in Garching. Vivien evaluated all results (including NMR).
Maya Video
To be honest, we are very proud that the Maya Video Vivien built looks so great in the end. Initial renderings that she showed to the team were far more simple than the final product. She had already gathered some experience in 3D animating, having regularly worked with Blender as a hobby before; this helped her very much in understanding the Maya software faster (which is really not that intuitive). She also compiled a How-To Video in which she explains the creation of the video in just short of one hour. If you are interested in the video, please ask her, as she really did it on her own ;)
As there was no PDB file available from the PAS-polypeptide we asked the Junior-PI Dr. Andre Schiefner at the Chair of Biological Chemistry (TUM) for help. As an experienced christallographer he was able to create a PAS(200) sequence with lysines that could be used later on for the creation of the PAS animation.
Micromanipulator experiments
Figure 1: Javier operating the micromanipulator
We thank Professor Dr. Schnieke and her of Livestock Biotechnology at the WZW (TUM School of Life Sciences Weihenstephan) for so generously providing us with the opportunity to use the micromanipulator at the chair's laboratory and allowing us to conduct several highly specific experiments with our bioink. With the extensive help and instructions of Dr. Nicolas Ortega,  a researcher at the lab having much experience with the device, we were able to plan experiments and test our bioprinting technique on a minuscule scale. In the process, our team members Julian and Javier were able to observe the ejection process under controlled conditions in great detail and document the behavior of our modified HEK cells containing ink. Thanks to this opportunity we could obtain useful and valuable visual material as well as a better understanding of our biotINK concept.
Business plan
The business plan was written by Christoph as he also studies TUM Economics besides his studies in Molecular Biotechnology.

The testing strips used could detect a maximum value of 200 mg/L, two samples indicated this value and so greater concentrations could be present. These were 20mL cultures tested at 5mL a time. The volumes used were low, sealed tubes were used, the formaldehyde was within solution when testing the part and all experiments were carried out underneath fume hoods, hence there was no real risk to team members.
Safe Lab Work
As mentioned within the policies section, all of our lab work abided to the University regulation and Nationwide legislation and regulations. If there was anything any member of the team was unsure about they would ask other members of the team or supervisors to help or advise until they were confident. There are non-biological hazards within labs which are covered within the induction, they are similar for both labs as they are reviewed and set by university staff, complying with university standards.
All of the Labs within the university require smart card access, restricting members of the public and unqualified members access. This makes the labs a safer environment to work in and reduces the risk to the public. If biological materials required transportation between labs the appropriate policies were followed including safe storage and suitable labeling.
Sterilisation within the lab environment is particularly important as contamination and release can potentially cause a significant risk to the public and members of the lab. Sterile equipment is used and those which are taken out of their sterile packets are sterilised using the flame of a Bunsen burner or ethanol. When exiting the lab hands should be cleaned as even though gloves are worn it is important not to transfer potentially hazardous biological material to outside of the lab.
Waste was disposed of into hazardous yellow waste bins unless this was liquid waste in which case it was decanter into a waste flask which is autoclaved and disposed of. The University has its own waste disposal procedure ( University Safety Policy ) which another member of the lab carries out. We are required to properly seal and label these bins for the safety of others as they contain sharps and hazardous materials.
A member of staff trained in first aid is always on call and first aid boxes are also in various locations within the lab along with eyewash stations which contain instructions of use. The methods of disposal and containment of spillages and broken glassware were covered upon induction into the lab.

SVCE_CHENNAI,2017,Team:SVCE CHENNAI#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," biology. This sparked their interest in the subject and they were very eager to learn more about it. So we organized a one day workshop at our institution to teach them simple  microbiology techniques and how to use a microscope.
Next we went to Sri Vivekananda Matric and Higher Secondary School where we taught simple synthetic biology concepts  to 11th grade students of biology. To make the session more interactive, we conducted some fun events like dogma quest – a play with knowledge of central dogma of life wherein the students were given a sequence of DNA and asked to predict the sequence of the protein that will be made out of it. This helped them to understand the concepts of transcription and translation better.
Finally we visited Sankara Senior Secondary School and presented the basic idea of our project to the 11th and 12th grade students of biology as well as biotechnology. They were very interactive and asked us many questions. Everyone  enjoyed themselves  and we were appreciated by the teachers for the efforts put in to spread the knowledge about  synthetic biology and its related fields.
On the whole, the Human Practices team of SVCE_CHENNAI had a great time in educating the students and managed to inculcate a basic knowledge of synthetic biology among them. Our efforts encouraged the students to learn more about the subject and they are even willing to do projects based on it although it is not a part of their curriculum.
OMICS - A National Level Symposium
Omics is a one day national level technical symposium that is organized by the Department of Biotechnology, SVCE on an annual basis. This year 600 students from all over the country and from different fields of study participated in it.
We used this platform as an opportunity to spread the knowledge about synthetic biology, iGEM and our project REGULOGEM among our peers. This was done by setting up a stall in front of our department where the symposium was being held and interacting with the students who visited our stall. We provided them with brochures where a brief description of our 2017 project was given which helped them to understand it better.
In addition to this we taught them about biobrick assembly with the help of illustrative charts and by using the game developed by the team who won the second place in the biohackathon, InheritanceHack that had been organized by the Human Practices faction of our team. Most of the participants who visited our stall liked the project that we are working on and were motivated to participate in iGEM.

Colony 2 was digested with XbaI and PstI and ligated into pSB1C3 containing each of the three promotors (PrsaA, Pxyl, and BBa_K081005) digested with SpeI and PstI and then transformed into E. coli Top10.  4 colonies from each transformation were picked, freeze-thawed, PCR amplified, and run on a gel.  Colony 3 for PrsaA + dspB + rsaA was successful ( Figure ) and colony 2 for BBa_K081005 + dspB + rsaA was successful ( Figure ). Both successful BBa_K081005 + dspB + rsaA and PrsaA + dspB + rsaA PCR products were PCR Purified; digested with EcoRI and PstI; ligated into pMR10 digested with EcoRI and PstI; and transformed. However, no colonies for Pxyl + dspB + rsaA showed the expected sizes, most of them contained only Pxyl ( Figure ).  4 more colonies ( Figure ) and then 6 more colonies  were picked, freeze-thawed and PCR amplified with no correct insert present ( Figure ).
Week 8 July 17-23
Optimized esp :
We ligated optimized esp with rsaA and two types of promotors: PrsaA and Pxyl. Later we transformed the ligate products into E.coli. Colony PCR showed that we had optimized esp gene alone in pSB1C3 plasmid, opt esp gene with rsaA gene in IDT-SMART Amp plasmid and opt esp behind two promotors in pSB1C3 plasmid. Overnights of E. coli with opt esp+PrsaA/Pxyl containing pSB1C3 plasmids were made and MiniPrep was done to the overnights so that rsaA gene (from gel extract) can be inserted behind optimized esp later. Additionally, optimized esp + rsaA combination were cut off from IDT-SMART plasmid and put into the standardizd pSB1C3 plasmid for sending to the registry as a BioBrick part. RsaA inserting into opt esp+PrsaA and opt esp+Pxyl containing plasmid were both proved by colony PCR to be successful. Later this week, Pxyl/PrsaA +optimized esp +rsaA were cut off from pSB1C3 and inserted into pMR10.

Vitamin A deficiency – a major global healthcare issue
Malnutrition, defined as “poor nutrition”, is caused by an inadequate diet that lacks in appropriate nutrients. Vitamin deficiencies are a serious type of malnutrition that can lead to significant morbidity through conditions such as anaemia, blindness and even death.  One of the most common and serious vitamin deficiencies is that of vitamin A. It is the leading cause of preventable blindness in children and it weakens the immune system, therefore increasing the risk of severe infections [1] . An estimated 250 million preschool-aged children as well as a substantial proportion of pregnant women are deficient in this micronutrient [2] .
Vitamin A (or retinol) is a fat-soluble and is involved in many different physiological functions such as vision, maintenance of differentiated epithelia, mucus secretion and reproduction.  Humans tend to receive vitamin A from both animals and plant sources.  Animal sources provide “preformed vitamin A” while plants provide pro-vitamin A.  The main difference is that pro-vitamin A is inactive, requiring activation by the body.  β-carotene, a carotenoid in plants and produced by many bacteria, is the most common type of pro-vitamin A.
Carotenoids take part in multiple functions in plants, including photoprotection and photosynthesis, as well as use in further organic compound synthesis. In humans, β-carotene is activated in the small intestine and liver by a cleavage reaction, converting it initially into retinol which can be further metabolized into the various forms of vitamin A [3] .
Current treatment – high dose supplementation
Many developing countries have implemented high-dose supplementation of preformed"

Gellan Gum is produced through aerobic fermentation (Kang et al. 1982). This exopolysaccharide is a “high-molecular-mass, anionic polysaccharide which consists of a tetrasaccharide structure with 20% glucuronic acid, 60%glucose, and 20% rhamnose” (Wang et. al. 2006). The advantages of using Gellan in place of agar include: requiring half of the quantity, a consistent production, more clarity than agar, a reduced plate preparation time along with a faster setting time, stability at high temperatures, and lack of contamination factors found in agar that are toxic to some organisms (Ioannis et. al. 2007).
This protocol involves creating media from every-day grocery store items, autoclaving or microwaving a culture of S. paucimobilis for sterilization, then pouring them into plates which can be streaked with microbes. Figure 1 denotes each of the steps of the protocol. An S. paucimobilis colony is initially grown in conditions that focus the cell’s metabolism on multiplication. This maximizes the number of cells producing Gellan when inoculated into minimal media (Wu et. al. 2014).
We tested this protocol by growing Escherichia coli on LB-Gellan plates and by growing Saccharomyces cerevisiae on YPD-Gellan plates. Both microbes successfully grew on Gellan plates as in Figure 2 and Figure 3. We then confirmed the viability of Gellan-tea media plates to be used for kombucha by streaking various strains that we isolated from Kombucha.
In addition to being usable in this DIY procedure, Gellan Gum is environmentally and socially conscious. Currently there is an agar shortage in the world, because of several threats to its origin, red algae (Calloway 2015).

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.       There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.

Overview
As biological research studies are more and more based on both, laboratory research and mathematical computations, we decided to follow this encouraging development and, thus, build a mathematical model of our system. This abstract representation of a biological process has the purpose to understand the underlying functionality in the first place. Moreover, a variety of distinct conditions can easily be tested and arbitrarily often repeated. Once the feedback loop between model and experiment has led to a satisfying validation, the model can be applied to predict specific biological events of interest. New knowledge can be achieved very quickly.
Goal
With our mutagenesis system, we want to find the best adapted E. coli culture, and we want to find this culture as quickly as possible. Therefore we long for a tool that can predict us, if the desired culture can be found at all, and, if yes, which culture will be the winner. Additionally the prediction should provide us optimal parameters for the laboratory, the best cultivation time and inoculation number.
These considerations lead to a mathematical model that has to comprise different levels - a micro layer and a macro layer. On the one hand, the model has to deal with the experimental parameters affinity, expression strength, ampicillin concentration, and portray the"

We held a cross-discipline seminar delivering lectures on cutting-edge scientific discovery related to synthetic biology and introduced our project, through which we harvest massive creative ideas and comments. Click to see in detail.

    Then we made our way to the public. Before it, under the guidance of biotechnological company’s planning staff, we got fully prepared by making related resources including exhibition boards, leaflets, souvenir stickers and postcards ready. What’s more, to make the activity more interactive and engaging, we took fully advantage of our visualization tool, the two games derived from project idea and modeling results. We optimized their function under the guidance of professional game designers from ‘Perfect World’. Click to see in detail.
Figure 3: A visit to Perfect World
    Finally, we made a hit at China Science and Technology Museum by holding a workshop named “Deciphering Life” that targets both adults and children. We propagated synthetic biology to adults by displaying exhibition and delivering explanation. For children, we had playful workshop activities including engaging art design, DNA model building and web game section with the hope to inspire their affection towards science and research. We got precious feedback from different groups. Staffs from the museum reminded us about the rigorous nature of science and we should balance between rigorousness and joyfulness when we choose the methodology in our activity. We were also inspired by children for more possibility in considering the influence of spatial factors on population interactions that may be helpful for our future work. Click to see in detail.

    On campus, we also discussed our project with professors in the field of microbial biology. We finally confirmed three characters (farmer, warrior and beggar) for our project together. We especially want to express our appreciation for Professor Xie and Wang who provided us lots of advice in introducing and completing the character beggar whose prototype in nature is “cheater”.

Comparison with wet-lab data
Our model captures the shape of the observed temperature profile and predicts that additional variations at lower temperatures are independent of the chosen Biobrick . We have found that transcription rate decreases with temperature as a consequence of the reduction of free RNAP; and synthesis rate grows above the optimal temperature. Their combination leads to the observed variation of fluorescence with temperature. Unfortunately, this is not the whole story. Our model fails to fit the amount of variation, which is larger experimentally than the predicted one. By comparing our theoretical predictions and experimental results of XL1 Blue strain transformed with Bb1 or Bb3, we find that the ratio between theoretical prediction and experimental results is the same at under-optimal temperatures (in fact, accidentally too close given the error bars). This fact suggests that the temperature dependence not included in our model should come from cell mechanisms; independent from Biobrick parameters (promoter strength, ...). On the contrary, the comparison of theoretical predictions and experimental results at higher temperatures show that our model might require more dynamics which depends on Biobrick parameters.
Our model captures the shape of the observed pH profile . We have found that the lowest fluorescence happens at the pH with lowest growth, while it is mildly dependent on the pH from 6 to 8.
Standardization
We will now discuss Biobrick expression in different E. coli strains. The effect of the changes in the number of free RNAP on mRNA synthesis rate depend on the energy of the promoter. The relative transcription rate in different strains can be written as $$ \begin{equation} \frac{r_T}{r'_T}  = \frac{Prob_B}{Prob'_B}  = \frac { 1+\frac{R'}{N_{NS}} e^{-\frac{\Delta\epsilon}{k_BT }} } { \frac {R'}{R}+\frac{R'}{N_{NS}} e^{-\frac{\Delta\epsilon}{k_BT }}} , \end{equation} $$ where we can see that the dominance of the second term over the first one, controlled by the promoter strength, would lead to similar rate independently on the particular strain chosen. Comparing this formula with the relative transcription rate in stability, we find that promoters whose  binding energy makes them more standard also implies more stable promoters. Strong promoter sequences experience a decrease in synthesis rates when subjected to an increase of promoter"

Backbone pSB1C3 was used for σx generator construct and comW construct. comX gene / comW gene were fused with BBa_K880005 which contains a constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23100 ) and strong RBS ( BBa_B0034 ). The purpose of this strong constitutive promoter and strong RBS is to unsure the large production of σx and ComW protein throughout time. Then, a double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ) is fused with the promoter, RBS, and comX. BBa_K880005 and BBa_B0015 were obtained from 2014 iGEM distribution kit.
Construct using pSB1C3 backbone consisting only σx CDS ( BBa_K1379004 ), and σx followed by double terminator BBa_B0015( BBa_K1379045 ) was also built to facilitate assembly of σx to promoters and RBSs of choice.
Bacterial Strain
The bacterial strain of E. coli used is DH10B. Since this strain of E. coli has clpXP degradation enzyme which targets ComX for degradation, an excess amount of ComX protein is required to maintain enough amount of ComX for Com-Box promoter induction.

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

After that, we exchanged opinions and gave some advice to each other. For example, we asked why they chose that method of experiments. We also discussed the future work of projects for the coming Giant Jamboree. We were inspired a lot by knowing innovative research projects and views of other teams.

iGEM Botchan Lab Tokyo
We kept contact with iGEM Botchan Lab Tokyo this year since iGEM East Asia Meetup occurred. They introduced us their project showing us a PDF file ( Go to the wiki page of iGEM Botchan Lab Toyko ). We also sent some documents regarding our project back to them. ( Click here to download our PDF ) Their project may lead to a solution of food crisis from the viewpoint of Nitrogen fixation. They said that if E.coli can synthesize amino acid by taking in nitrogen gas from the air as a part of our intestinal flora, malnutrition can be solved much easier. Considering this project, we offered a scientific article written by our PI, Prof. Iwahashi. Since he used to research nitrogen fixation before. They also taught us the methods of cloning. They constructed really large plasmids and we asked for the advice from them. Sadly, we could not make them this year but still, it was totally helpful for us.
iGEM Paris Bettencourt
Cell-free expression platforms allow the production of proteins from DNA without live cells by making use of modified cell lysates. Their application is increasingly popular in synthetic biology where they allow fast iteration of design-build-test cycles of genetic parts and gene circuits. Now is the time to prepare for the widespread adoption of cell-free methods by iGEM teams.
With this concept, iGEM Paris Bettencourt planned to have a pilot-scale interlab to test the variation of cell-free expression systems between labs. Then Dr.Evelyn from Arbor Biosciences connected us to Paris Bettencourt team. Thus we had a Skype meeting and our team decided to join the collaboration. You can download the PDF which shows the result of our collaborative research below.

UIUC-Illinois,2012,Team:UIUC-Illinois#Notebook#MeetingNotes_-_-_TEXT.html,". - Overview of the Parts Registry: o Where all the biobricks are o At the beginning of the summer we will get a kit with about 500 biobricks that we can use in our parts. o The parts registry shows the parts by type with information about each type of part. Green W’s means the part works! o Upper right hand “get this part” is where you can order the part. Be sure to note the part name, the plasmid backbone, and what kind of antibiotic resistance it has. Ordering any part is free! o Computer modeling: perform a scratch where we put the sequences together to check them before we got to the lab o Before summer, spend some quality time learning what all the different types of parts are and how to put them together. But don’t memorize everything – it’s just not possible! Also review iGEM standard cloning protocol. Angela will take an hour next meeting to give an introduction to cloning and standard protocol. - Next week’s meeting: Will be sometime Sunday NIGHT due to Easter. Check the facebook group for more details. There will be no journal club. Still bring ideas and develop our existing ones! Develop further proposals. Proposal presentations: - Divya – Transplastomic antibacterials o Plant derived antimicrobials: traditional antibiotics, MDR inhibitors, Compounds that target bacterial virulence o Genetically modified plants have new genes inserted into the chloroplast DNA. o We create transgenic plants that make drugs. o We need to find someone on campus with a gene gun. - Cara – A Privy Understanding of E. Coli o After natural disasters or in underdeveloped areas sanitation and uncontained sewage is often an issue. We need a quick, inexpensive, simple solution. o Create packages of freeze dried bacteria that will be able to handle high volumes of human sewage. But the bac in a bucket with water or direct sewage, and a color indicator shows when the sewage had been purified and it is safe to dispose of the remainer of the waste. Color goes from blue -> colorless. o The kill mechanism is sunlight. When you throw the newly processed waste water out, the bacteria die in the sun. o Good project for human practices and for entrepreneurship; need to target/focus the pathway more.

Stony_Brook,2015,Team:Stony Brook#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," discussion made us realize that it is important to take patient’s wishes and expectations into account when developing a treatment idea. To learn more about patient expectations and the viability of our treatment proposals, the iGEM team met with the head of endocrinology at Stony Brook University Hospital, Dr. Harold Carlson.
Meeting with Dr. Carlson made us aware of aspects of our proposed treatment that we had not previously noticed. We learned that medication transitions for and treatment compliance in diabetes patients are difficult periods. Type 2 diabetes patients are often reluctant to begin treatments with oral medications. This reluctance increases as the treatment becomes marginally more invasive and necessitates the injection of insulin. Therefore, patients, he suggested, may feel extreme reluctance and trepidation towards a procedure that can permanently alter their microbiome. He suggested that the treatment regime that was least invasive and labor intensive would have the highest success rate. Otherwise, patients would opt for other, safe, widely-available diabetic treatments that exist on the market to manage their condition.
Synthetic biologists have a commitment to implementing their systems in a way that is safe and prevents contamination with the environment. A relatively small amount is known about the functions of the microorganisms in the microbiome. Implementing new bacteria into this environment has the potential to eliminate favorable microorganisms whose functions are still unknown. For this reason, the effect that a new synthetic bacterium can have on the environment of the microbiome cannot be predicted. Additionally, Dr. Carlson broadened our thinking to help us imagine conditions where contamination involving our system could occur. His primary concern was contamination of the system between patients with diabetes, and people who do not have diabetes. Thus, if people without diabetes are exposed to the therapeutic bacteria, they risk disrupting their own natural microbiome and being subjected to unnecessary treatment. Additionally, there is the risk that the E. coli in the therapeutic system can be released into the environment after disposal from the human body. Here, there is a very small and unlikely chance that it can outcompete other bacteria in the environment for vital resources.
Based on this discussion, we knew we had to go back to the drawing board and redesign the administration of our system in order to make it safer and more appealing to patients. After much subsequent research, we found inspiration in the 2011 Slovenia iGEM team’s work, who were able to incorporate synthetic bacteria into the bloodstream by protecting them with an alginate encapsulation. The microcapsule can be delivered subcutaneously to the patient. This treatment delivery would be no more invasive than one insulin treatment, and has the potential to deliver treatment for an extended period of"

Collaboration always plays an important role in iGEM. As a new iGEM team, we focused mainly on our experiment. While the rules of iGEM was so complicated that we felt quite difficult to put our hand on the project. Luckily, when we met obstacles and setbacks and we had been seeking advice from 3 teams.
We invited NUDT-China that has participated in iGEM many times to our school for discussion. We held a meeting to exchange our experiences. During the meeting, NUDT-China introduced the iGEM process, and shared their experience in team building in detail with us. At the same time, they gave comments on our project, and put forward a lot of good ideas.  We keep in contact with Fudan-China which has participated in iGEM since 2013. Meanwhile, we visited their lab and studio. From the visit, we learned the importance of clinical regulation. The TMMU-China introduced to us some details about the iGEM and we visited their lab in this summer. The technique problems were solved by their advice and experience.
On the other hand, we joined CCIC for the first time. CCIC(Conference of China iGEMer Community)，as one of the best communication platforms for iGEMers in China, has gone through its fifth birthday. During the meeting, we listened to a few lectures given by masters in synthetic biology. The different views of the masters on synthetic biology inspired us to look into the problem we met in our research in another way.

Now I'm doing an internship in UT Southwestern medical center in Dallas. It is really cool to participate in the giant jamboree in Boston, because Dallas is just like a large valley, while Boston is the true Big City. I hope I could spend some time visiting the city in the spare time during the jamboree.
I am Yao Chen, I still remember the first time I knew something nabout iGEM when I was a freshman, my classmate joined this team whereas I could only listen to his proud talking. Until last November I participated in the iGEM team for my dream. We experienced the hard Saturday night brainstorming and staying up late for presentation of our project and finally our sub-team project became the only project in the team. First I even could not understand what we would do but thanks for the team members, I made it clear ultimately.  To retrospect the last 10 months we went through the hardness and success which enrich my experience, broaden my horizon and give me friends. Now I am placid to write the story between iGEM and me and appreciate all the people helped us.
I am Shuohui Liu. During the four years in university, one could choose to sit around and achieve nothing. Or one could treasure the time to do something meaningful. The most meaningful thing for me is to join the iGEM. In the iGEM, one could do researches that are really special and interesting. One could also make friends and work in a team efficiently and comfortably. What's more, one could enjoy the best time in the life. In other words, the one in the iGEM is the most fortunate one in the word. Absolutely, I'm a guy like that.
Zhengwei Yuan| Senior in Biological Sciences Zhengwei is responsible for the separation of FDH (Formate dehydrogenase) gene from Candida boidinii which was bought from China Center of Industrial Culture Collection (CICC) and he work so hard with our team leader that they stay up late for three consecutive days to do the experiment. The main driving force of their diligence is the love for the iGEM and members in our team!

Brainstorm
We invite you to browse through the clouds of thoughts and have a look at all of our ideas that have not made it. We hope our thoughts will not go waste, but will inspire other teams to come up with many more creative and fun ideas. Some ideas were thoroughly elaborated and considered while others were obviously not feasible.
Health
Chemotaxis and bacterial conjugation Many bacteria use chemotaxis to move toward, or away from, chemoattractants and chemorepellents. If we could invert this system in pathogenic bacteria it would decrease their ability to infect their host. To spread this inversion mechanism through a population of bacteria we could make use of conjugation plasmids. These plasmids facilitate their own transfer form one bacteria to another and can also carry resistance genes spreading antibiotic resistance. We could create a conjugation plasmid that also carries genes that somehow cause this inversion. Also involving chemotaxis and bacterial conjugation, a conjugation plasmid that disrupts chamotaxis by inducing a constant tumble (no linear movement). At the same time this plasmid could carry a gene for a chemoattractant that would attract more bacteria to the immobilized bacteria. The plasmid is then transferred to these bacteria, starting a chain reaction.
Diet bacteria. Bacteria that live in the guts and consume large quantities of unhealthy nutrients like saturated fats, cholesterol or sugars converting them to substances that can’t be taken up by the body. These bacteria would be eaten by adding them to foods like to yoghurt.
Colon Cancer detecting bacteria MscL (Mechanoselective channels of Large conductance) have been modified to be light and pH sensitive (A. Koçer, 2007). I think we can use this mechanism for the detection of cancerous cells, which have a lower pH in their microenvironment when compared to normal cells. The bacteria (for cancer in the GI tract) could then secrete some sort of detectable marker. Lipid bodies could be used for detection in the rest of the body.
Bacteria that stimulate production of vital minerals in plants Maybe it would be possible to make bacteria that would interact with plants in a symbiotic manner, supplying the plant with high amounts of metabolites that are important for the production of vitamins in the plant. In exchange for these metabolites they plant will maintain the energy needs of the bacteria by  supplying them with  sugars"

Stockholm,2010,Team:Stockholm#Planning_-_-_TEXT.html,"52). Previously, our group has identified, characterized, and cloned the gene (sodA) encoding the manganese-containing SOD from Streptococcus thermophilus AO54 (1, 12). Unlike most sodA genes, S. thermophilus sodA is expressed under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions and is not induced by the redox cycling compound, paraquat (12). This antioxidant enzyme was shown to be essential for the growth of S. thermophilus under aerobic conditions (1). However, most lactobacilli lack this general defense system (SODs). Lactobacillus plantarum developed an alternative nonenzymatic defense system that involves the accumulation of high intracellular concentrations of manganese ions, which can scavenge O2 ·� (2). The lack of endogenous SODs (49) and catalase may account for the high sensitivity of most species of Lactobacillus to oxidative stress. In this study, we report the expression of the sodA from S. thermophilus in four lactobacilli: L. gasseri NCK334, L. johnsonii NCK89, L. acidophilus NCK56, and L. reuteri NCK932. Under the conditions used in this study, the enzyme provided a clear protection against the inhibitory effect of H2O2 on the growth of L. gasseri and L. acidophilus."" - Expression of a Heterologous Manganese Superoxide Dismutase Gene in Intestinal Lactobacilli Provides Protection against Hydrogen Peroxide Toxicity

Brown,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Implementation#syntf_-_-_TEXT.html," pGAL1 promoter and followed by a terminator (Ajo-Franklin et al., 2007
A transcription factor is composed of a standard activation or repression domain linked to a variable binding domain.   Since these factors were originally constructed in a yeast system, the activator and repressor domains (VP64 and Sin3, respectively) were selected due to their known endogenous regulation of yeast promoters.   The binding domain is chosen such that it matches a corresponding binding site associated with a particular promoter.  Four binding domain-binding site pairs were provided to us (LexA, Zif268-HIV, Gli1, and YY1).  Each set comes from an organism aside from yeast in order to diminish off-target effects from the introduction of such synthetic factors.
More so than the activation and repression domains, the binding domains define the ability to construct a complex synthetic network.  It is possible to define which transcription factors act upon a given promoter simply by appending one of the short binding sites to that promoter.  Conversely, one can select a promoter for a given transcription factor to affect by modifying the binding domain on the protein.  This latter point describes an essential component of our limiter network, which aims to target an endogenous promoter.  In theory, as long as the binding domain of any transcription factor for an endogenous promoter is known, it should be possible to create a synthetic transcription factor to act on that promoter.  The Biofusion standard affords for considerable flexibility in this regard.
Other parts of these synthetic transcription factors include a dimer of fluorescent tags and an SV40 nuclear localization sequence (NLS).
We currently have three versions fluorescence: mCherryx2, YFPx2, and CFPx2.  Note that all three of these fluorescent domains have been codon-optimized for yeast expression.  The inherent fluorescence built into these transcription factors allows for a steady-state and even dynamic read-out of expression levels of the transcription factors.  Furthermore, the double fluorescent tags provide an enhanced stability to the protein.
Finally, the nuclear localization sequence, as the name implies, targets each transcription factor back into the yeast nucleus after translation, allowing the protein to regulate transcription.
Other schemes of regulation
While our device was built to function solely on the level of transcriptional regulation, one can easily imagine the opportunity for regulation through other mechanisms.  Our repressor for the gene of interest in the model can be replaced with a gene encoding for shRNA that targets the mRNA of gene G.  In this case, our limiter would be tuned to interfere with translation.  Alternatively, the re"

Styrene is their main raw material. They are a member of EUMEPS, PlasticsEurope and OIK and are ISO 14001 certified. Unipol is interested in StyGreen, as styrene is their main raw material. Therefore, StyGreen would allow them to significantly increase the sustainability of their EPS production. We have presented our research to Unipol and they are highly interested and enthusiastic about our project. Hence we have acquired a substantial investment from them. Their financial investment as well as interest in our technology as a large industrial player is highly valuable to the entrepreneurial success of our project. We plan to continue our quest to produce biobased styrene in a scaled-up industrial setting.

Fablab: Winand Slingenbergh
As we aim to produce the plastic monomer styrene, making actual plastic products was an exciting idea. As the quantities of styrene we managed to produce are not large enough for industrial applications yet, we found an interesting partner in Fablab , a 3D printing venture. Fablab is an open-source, global network that originated from an MIT course titled ‘How to make almost anything'. They have stayed true to this ideal and offer a wide variety of plastic and wood working techniques in their laboratories.       3D printing with ABS plastic is possible, but it has some drawbacks, hence we decided to collaborate with Fablab Groningen without actually using StyGreen for 3D printing. We quickly realized that 3D printed biological structures can be of great educational value. Therefore, we made prints of the most important enzymes in our project: the cellulose binding domain, the endogluconase, the beta-glucosidase and the Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase. We also printed some of their ligands and matched them size wise to showcase where the pocket with the active site in the enzyme is and which chemical alteration is happening.      We also developed a kit of building blocks for styrene, butadiene, acrylnitril and divinylbenzene that can showcase the process of copolymerization through magnets. On top of that our mascot Styrene Steve was 3D printed multiple times and given as present to some of our sponsors as a nice gesture and to keep iGEM in people’s minds.

Minnesota,2014,Team:Minnesota_-_-_TEXT.html," encapsulation technology can be used in a larger scale plant. Click here  for more detail!
Additionally, a small scale device can be envisioned for household use in contaminated areas. Our system was tested to successfully remediate at least 1mg/L of methylmercury within a 5 hour time period. Water entering these homes will likely have methylmercury concentrations a hundred-a thousand fold lower than 1 mg/L. Based on our time-point degradation studies, a filter for this concentration level would need smaller residence times and consequently a smaller volume. Therefore, a filter using encapsulated bacteria on the scale of domestic water softener filters is possible.

Policies & Practices
Our Policy and Practices approach this year has focused on establishing an effective two-way discourse between our team and the public in order to inform our design, educate the public, and illuminate ethical issues related to both our project and integration of public opinion into project implementation. We focused our discussion on safety, ethics, sustainability, and intellectual property in order to design a project that fits the needs of the public while maintaining technical viability and high potential for commercialization. Our team did extensive educational outreach in addition to educating ourselves on public perception of our work. We used this input to inform our device design such that it could be implemented in a way that addresses the major concerns of both scientists and consumers. We also took steps to protect our intellectual property and explore the patenting and commercialization process of our product. Finally, our team sought to investigate ethical issues brought up by our discourse with the public by discussing both our work and ethics related to the project with a variety of experts and ethicists.
Educational Outreach
Building on past successes, our team has been devoted to volunteering our services to the community in a number of educational venues. The team took our curriculum, first developed in 2013, and improved the structure and delivery of our lesson plans in the hopes of encouraging awareness and education on topics in synthetic biology. Since 2013 our educational outreach group ECORI (Educating Communities On Research Innovation) has taught our original interactive classroom curriculum to over 200 students (K-12) and their teachers. This year we also created a mobile exhibit form of our curriculum along with a layman’s introduction to our project that we displayed on over half a dozen weekends to visitors of all ages at the Science Museum of Minnesota. Our curriculum has also been brought to several other STEM fairs and family fun events in the Twin Cities area including the 3M Science Day Fair for 3M employees and their families, UMN Biodiversity Fair, CSE Family Fun"

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Human Practices#HannahArendt_-_-_TEXT.html," orally or in writing, whatever you may have found out when you are alone, this faculty [of thinking] exerted in solitude will disappear” (Arendt, 40). Hence, we can find a strong analogy (not necessarily in intentions) between Kant's hope that his work would popularize and be read by the public and the attempts of synthetic biologists or scientists working in the field of genetic engineering and their attempts to inform the public of what they are doing. This paper does not argue that scientific truths depend on their ability to popularize and to be spread, this is another discussion. Instead, this paper looks at the need of scientific concepts to spread so that people can judge ethically the developments within science.
In several papers concerning ethics and synthetic biology the need is formulated that the public should be more informed about synthetic biology (Schmidt et al., 2009) (Sture & Whitby, 2012). Moreover, one of the aims of the iGEM competition is trying to get the public more acquainted with synthetic biology, by going to schools, organizing conferences and writing articles for magazines and newspapers. In a Kantian spirit, one should not do this with the motivation to educate the unknowing and ignorant masses (this quickly turns into disdain for the opinion of the public), but it can in fact be a proper test of the current developments within the field of synthetic biology. How does a scientist know whether he/she is not led astray by the need to publish and his/her scientific curiosity, loosing sight of the social relevance or ethical importance of her research? Kant argues that publicity is in fact the principle that should rule all action, so it can be judged. If scientists would be able to conduct their experiments in secrecy no such check would be possible. Hence, the popularization of synthetic biology could serve the purpose of being an ethical check of developments within synthetic biology.
Scientist might not like this judgment of the public as it is likely to interfere with their projects and ambitions. They fear a public that distrusts them because the public is not involved in scientific research and because of its ignorance it is likely to obstruct the application of scientific innovations or the attribution of money to one's research project. However, Kant argues that the public is in fact very well capable of making a proper judgment, for the very reason that they are not involved in the scientific process. Kant argues that the spectator in contrast to the actor occupies a special position that enables him to see the whole. Arendt phrases it in the following way: “the spectator occupies a position that enables him to see the whole; the actor,"

Worldwide connections - a UCSC tradition:
The iGEM Competition pushes teams to work to improve quality of life. To help the world requires an understanding of what the world is asking for; as the 6th UCSC iGEM team, we uphold the reputation of UCSC investing heavily in worldwide outreach to not only spread the word about our project, but to understand the impact of our project on a personal level. Through these personal connections, we evaluated potential issues related to our project including stigma, price, ethics, safety, security, and sustainability.
Women are interested in birth control methods to assist them plan for their few children produced instead of producing many children which cannot be cared for.
— Evelyn Lewsley
Inspiration:
Before choosing a project topic, our team emailed over 50 WHO representatives around the globe to determine the most pressing issues. With the women’s rights movement on the rise, the UCSC 2018 iGEM team wanted to prompt the discussion of women’s health at this year’s competition. We determined that many less-developed countries struggle to access contraception because of stigma, location, and cost. Our goal was to target those countries to test if they’d be interested in our new contraception method, and willing to speak with us regarding their personal experiences.
Execution:
Our outreach team contacted several big organizations, associations, and foundations for help on finding locals willing to speak to us. Not many of them got back to us, so we instead went an alternative route. We searched GoFundMe and found a group of women in Uganda known as the Joy Women’s Group asking for money to help buy condoms for their community. They were funded through the Brighter Brains Institute (BBI) and we quickly contacted the BBI who put us into contact with three local women’s groups in Uganda. Through word of mouth, we reached 7 additional women’s groups. We created a questionnaire for locals to fill out to have more uniform responses. Their response to our efforts prompted us to reach out to other groups in 15 more countries to further spread our word and evaluate the need for cheaper, more accessible birth control.
Execution:
We received input from over ___ countries as well as ____"
Illinois,2009,Team:Illinois-Tools#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," gene data that you generated with IMPtools and export it as Biobrick(s) (adding necessary primers, etc). These one would then submit to the registry.  This feature is also under development, and it not perfect.
Future Plans
Specifications for the next version of IMP tools
The Illinois software tools team has explored into several new ideas that could potentially become projects for next summer’s team and other future teams.  These ideas have focused on adding several new features that improve the present program and expand on what the current project accomplishes.  There are several options that the team is currently considering.  The user input and feedback that we receive will be taken into much consideration, and based on that, we will decide which changes should be implemented first.  In order of importance, the main focus of expansion will be on incorporating the biobrick database, improving graphical representation of pathways, adding more constraints and improving the weighting system, and adding additional helpful features like displaying pricing information on compounds and biobricks, as well as navigational and aesthetic features such as searching compounds directly by name.
One of the main areas of focus for the future teams will be the inclusion of biobricks and how to make use of the biobrick registry in a better way.  This year’s team was able to convert the nucleotide sequence for the genes responsible for a particular pathway into standardized biobricks by cleaving restriction sites, and assigning appropriate prefixes and suffixes.  Next year’s team could focus on creating better biobricks that could actually be tested out in an experimental lab.  They could research into dividing the biobricks into genes that code for single proteins and enzymes, and ones that code for a series of enzymes that are used in the same pathway. Then, these biobricks can be put together on a single plasmid that contains the code for an entire pathway.
Another part of the project that can be improved is the graphical representation of the pathways generated.  The pathway maps can be provided in a variety of different formats and programs.  Some features that could be added are zoom features that could allow users to zoom into pathways and be able to see several alternate paths to a desired compound.  This would involve being able recreate and put entire existing databases into one huge map.  These interactive maps could be designed by members who are proficient at using software programs like Adobe Flash and Cytoscape.
Furthermore, next year’s team can improve the pathway generating algorithm by adding more constraints and developing a more efficient weighting system.  Global computational studies can be used to evaluate immense numbers of possible input and output combinations"

Development of Project
Some of our initial experiments had unclear results, which is to be expected when attempting experiments for the first time. These experiments included examining GFP expression using a Light Cycler and uninduced and induced GFP expression using a protein gel. Knowing that our goal was to demonstrate the circuit in the paper ticket, and that the reaction conditions of the paper ticket were much different than in the other experiments, we forged ahead because it appeared that plasmids were expressing GFP.
The paper ticket produced a lot of unexpected challenges, one being the to incubate the ticket in a way that prevented the ticket from drying out and also not get wet. We tried wet tissues, saturated salt solutions, and parafilm boats to try to get the right balance of humidity. In the end, the most reliable method was to incubate the ticket inside a petri dish using a tissue culture incubator that contained a water bath inside of it.
When we finally figured out this more reliable way to incubate the paper ticket, we discovered that we were getting GFP signal in the negative controls. We hypothesized that the plasmid DNAs we were working with may have gotten mixed up, and so we made new minipreps from our glycerol stocks. We also double checked the DNA sequences and to our surprise, the DNA sequence was not as expected. Although we had selected the appropriate Parts from the iGEM Registry, the sequence information for the arsenic regulator gene was incorrect. This meant we had to remake our plasmids. Luckily, we were able to synthesize new DNA from IDT and try again. The downside is that at this point, school had started for our team members and so we had less time to perform experiments. This trial and error process has allowed us to learn a lot of wet lab skills, and this will help us greatly in the future.
The idea of a paper-based arsenic sensor came from our ECBC partners and military team members. Service members put their"

Study on Antigen Concentration and Fixed Time
Time:
26 Sept: Antigen concentrations of 500 ng/ml and 750 ng/ml were fixed for 12 h.
27 Sept: Antigen concentrations of 500 ng/ml and 750 ng/ml were fixed for 8.5 h.
After the discussion of the previous results, we discussed with the teacher, and then                             explored                             whether there is a problem with the antigen fixed time. We performed experimental results at                             antigen                             concentrations of 50 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL and fixed for 8.5 h and 12 h (Figures (9) a, b, c,                             d).                             Among them, we will self-assemble the upper and lower slides, and the upper and lower slides                             will be                             dried at 110℃ for 1 h, changed to be dried at 80℃ for 1h. The antigen fixation method is                             fixed                             by                             dropping.

Apart from these changes to the protocol, the rest of the steps proceded as normal.
Summary of Procedure
2.5ml of overnight culture of each of the three transformant E.coli cells were split into two Eppendorf tubes and spun down for 3 minutes at 13,000rpm. They were then resuspended in 300ul of Solution I+RNase.
600 ul of fresh Solution II was then added to the 6 Eppendorf tubes and left on the bench for 5 minutes. Once this time had elapsed 250 ul of Solution III was added to each of the 6 Eppendorf tubes.
These 6 Eppendorf tubes (3 cultures divided into 2 Eppendorf tubes each) were then spun for 20 minutes at 13,000 rpm.
1ml supernatant was then extracted from all 6 Eppendorf tubes and placed into 6 new tubes. 600 ul Isopropanol was added to each of the new tubes and the Eppendorf tubes spun for 15 minutes at 13,000 rpm. The samples were then aspirated.
The team then added 500 ul 70% ethanol to all 6 tubes and spun the tubes for 5 minutes at 13,000 rpm. These were then aspirated (using the aspirator) and then applied to a speed vac . Once completely dried, 50ul of water was added to each tube.
The six Eppendorf tubes were then transferred to the -20°C freezer for storage
2) Restriction Enzyme Digests on plasmids containing BBa_J33206
As it stands each of the three E.coli transformant cultures have been split into two Eppendorf tubes and mini-plasmid preps carried out on both tubes for each culture. Therefore for each of the 3 E.coli cultures containing BBa_J33206, the first Eppendorf tube was left untouched whilst the second Eppendorf tube was used in the restriction digests. The protocol used was Dr. Aldridge's Restriction Enzyme Digest Protocol .
Summary of Procedure
To three new Eppendorf tubes the following solutions were added:
0.5 ul EcoRI enzyme
0.5 ul PstI enzyme
2 ul 10x Buffer H
7 ul of sterile water
To each of the tubes, 10 ul plasmid DNA from each"

The genome of Bacillus subtilis is completely sequenced with well-established genetic and molecular modalities. This microorganism is a commercially important producer of a diverse quantity of heterologous proteins, antibodies, vaccines, enzymes, and other secondary metabolites. B. subtilis is not harmful to mammals as a species and is GRAS designated by FDA, meaning that this bacterium is benign to both humans and other mammals (33). B. subtilis has less knowledge base relative to E. coli within the scope of iGEM, however its commercial relevance and safety made this microorganism an ideal candidate for this summer’s experimentation.
Experimental Design
Strain Selection
Although B. subtilis is widely used as a production platform for synthesizing enzymes, fine chemicals, and pharmaceutical agents, this microorganism also has clear associated disadvantages. B. subtilis secretes no fewer than seven proteases during vegetative growth and stationary phase, and contains three wall-associated proteases. The two most abundant secreted proteases are the alkaline protease (AprE) and neutral protease (NprE) and are produced during early stationary phase. Vegetative cells produce minor proteases and all three wall-associated ones (34). Proteases, which are biochemical enzymes that break down proteins and peptides, potentially will impact CBCR expression and viability. In order to provide a control for this, the following strain selections were ordered for experimentation:
B. subtilis KO7 (BGSC Accession # 1A1134): This strain was developed in June 2016 by the Bacillus Genetic Stock Center. This strain is a seven protease deletion strain which is free from antibiotic resistance genes or integrated plasmids. It was developed from the commonly used laboratory host PY79 by sequentially knocking out coded genes. All seven knockouts in KO7 were confirmed through sequencing to be marker-free (34). If secreted proteases were responsible for CBCR degradation and loss of viability, this strain would theoretically work compared to a control (the host strain PY79).
B. subtilis PY79 (BGSC Accession # 1A747): This is a wildtype strain from which the KO7 strain was derived. This strain serves as a control when juxtaposed to KO7.
B. subtilis spo0A3 (BGSC Accession # 1S1): This strain comprises spo0A mutants, therefore they do not produce alkaline or neutral proteases."

TJU Meet-up
Earlier in July, our team member Qingshu went to Tianjin University (TJU) to attend their Summer Camp. We all know that Tianjin University is one of the first schools participating in iGEM competition among Chinese colleges and universities, where synthetic biology developing so well that it's our honor to pay a visit to them in order to learn from them as well as enhance the bond between us.
As soon as the camp came to an end, Qingshu got contact with TJU iGEMers. Actually, having been recommended earlier by professor Gan who is a vice-president of TJU technology department of biological engineering, Qingshu didn't have any problem finding the iGEM laboratory on July 6th.
First they introduced themselves to each other in a pleasant and free atmosphere, and then exchanged the information about the 2012 iGEM project respectively, including the team constitution, experimental progress and so on. TJU iGEMers would like to construct a RNA switch this year. Unfortunately, they didn't have easy access to the experimental apparatus due to the repairing and decorating work of their laboratory building. The good news was that their project would be under full operation in early August. After the wonderful discussion, Qingshu visited their laboratory and left the contact information with them.
Generally speaking, just as Qingshu mentioned, the visit broadened his view of synthetic biology, of other iGEM teams and of the competition itself as well. And the most importantly, this meet-up has built and will build much closer relationship between TJU and XMU iGEM teams than ever.
The Visit to SYSU iGEM 2012 Team
Thumbelina belonging to XMU iGEM 2012 team participated in the Summer Camp of Chemistry in Sun Yat-sen University known as SYSU between July 16th, 2012 to July 20th, 2012, and she had a contact with 2012 SYSU-iGEM team members. After knowing the information that she was able to join the summer school of SYSU, Thumbelina began to prepare for the meeting with 2012 SYSU-iGEM team.
