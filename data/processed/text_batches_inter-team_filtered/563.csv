Protocol from UCSC - Bacillus subtilis competent preparation:
The following protocol was implemented, as shared by the UCSC iGEM team. Protocol No. 4308 915.504 - 08/2003
A solution of 0.5 M sorbitol, 0.5 M mannitol, and 10% glycerol was made. This medium serves as the washing solution and the electroporation solution.
Competent preparation of Bacillus subtilis was performed as follows:
Overnight cultures of Bacillus subtilis, K07, PY79, and spo0A3 were produced with an optical density of 0.85-0.95.
Cells were chilled on ice-water for 10 minutes and harvested by centrifugation at 4 degrees celcius and 5000 x g for 5 minutes.
Cells were washed four times on ice-cold electroporation medium.
Cells were suspended in glycerol-LB medium for storage in the -80 degree Celcius freezer.
Competent cells, in theory, were thus produced.
9/26 - Brent
A variety of PCRs were performed on the E. Coli CBCR’s 2, 3, 4, 8, NPF, G2, and G3. All PCR’s were successful as illustrated below. A gel extraction and PCR cleanup was performed with all of these CBCR’s.

Summary
While the iGEM team from Darmstadt has developed the project they quickly realized that the degradation of PET and the recovery of resources are a topic for the entire population. The question was how to inform the whole people, and how to reach them best. For this reason, the iGEM team decided to separate the people into five broad areas. To do so, the team has participated in events, which cover many areas of the society or they organized these events on themselves. At these events it became clear that Synthetic Biology was not a well known topic or was highly controversial discussed. The team took on the task of eliminating the misinformation and to discuss the impact and safety assessment.
The team has organized a student laboratory, in which the students themselves can experience Molecular Biology. Students should learn that DNA and proteins are ordinary tools of biologists. The students have seen, by"

Figure 8: Framework ( BBa_K2205009 , BBa_K2205012 , BBa_K2205015 ) test with a co-culture in ratio 1:1:1 in response of IPTG induction.
Results from the multicellular modelling predicted that the traditionally used 1:1:1 ratio is not the optimal combination for the Sensynova device to work. It is in fact suggested to adopt a higher concentration of the reporter culture compare with the detector and processor. Thus, the framework test was repeated incorporating our in silico simulation data and combining the 3 cell types in ratio 1:1:13 (detectors:processors:reporters). The experiment results, shown in the picture below, confirm the modelling data. There is a consistent discrepancy between IPTG induced and non-induced samples in the 1:1:13 co-cultures, in comparison with the 1:1:1 co-cultures which don't show any difference in presence or absence of IPTG (Figure 9).
Figure 9: Framework ( BBa_K2205009 , BBa_K2205012 , BBa_K2205015 )  test with a co-culture in ratio 1:1:13 in response of IPTG induction.
The experimental data validate the model prediction showing that the system worked most optimally when the reporter cells were in excess of both the detector and processor cells. One of the reasons that this configuration was the best may be because of signal amplification at each of the quorum sensing communication stages. The quorum sensing mechanism used here is the acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) system in gram negative bacteria. This system works by one cell producing a quorum sensing molecule which can diffuse out through its membrane. Once the extracellular space reaches a certain threshold concentration of AHL molecule, the AHL will begin to diffuse into other cells in the community. If the cell the AHL molecule enters has the appropriate transcription factor present (e.g. LasR for the C12 AHL), then transcription of a gene under the control of the pLas promoter can occur. Therefore, if background expression of the AHL is high enough to reach above the threshold level, then expression of the next quorum sensing molecule in another cell (in this case C4 AHL) will occur. By reducing the amount of detector and processor cells present in the system, the background expression levels of C12 and C4 will be lower, and hence expression of sfGFP by the reporter cell will be lower.

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Cholera - Detection_-_-_TEXT.html," represses transcription of GFP. Thus GFP should NOT glow in the presence of cholera.
Our results in these test tubes aren’t exactly in agreement with what we want.
KP 4/10/2013 Today we worked on our presentation for Friday and we also went over the quorum sensing with Dr. Grose.
4/12/13
KP 4/12/13 We had our presentation today. It was good practice and I learned some things to improve on in the future. There was some confusion on the quorum sensing, because we thought that HapR was a repressor and that it shouldn’t glow green in the presence of cholera. It turn out that it is the other way around and that it should glow green in the presence of cholera and red in the absence of cholera. That still doesnt explain why our tests are glowing green in the absence of cholera. We will have to work backwards and find out exactly what it is that we have. I feel that we have a clearer view of what we need to do.  Also, I need to do more research other than wikipedia on lambda phage and its lytic and lysogenic cycles, because in our presentation, I said that that lambda enters the lytic cycle when it is in a cell that is healthy and lysogenic cycle when the cell is in trouble. That is what it says on wikipedia. Anyway, when I said that, I was told that I was wrong and that it is the other way around. I will look into that. We also hopefully got our quorum sensing system worked out now. All we need to do (once we figure out what we actually have in our plasmids) is add the cro transcription site after the GFP, and in the presence of cholera more cro will be produced and lambda will enter the lytic cycle!
KK 4/12/13 Today was our presentation in class. This is the link to our powerpoint presenation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14mUxVrUdTvNXaPGifXZs_lpXeMrFd-4CxSZ9o1bPqYo/edit#slide=id.p Our presentation gave a background for our project - though we ought to have been clearer WHY we want to use phage - and also the work that we’ve accomplished thus far in our group. We went a long time over in our presentation; it took a long time to explain the quorum sensing circuit, Lambda, and other things. Dr Grose sent an email with several suggestions for presentations in the future"
Tokyo-NoKoGen,2013,Team:Tokyo-NoKoGen#scaffold_-_-_TEXT.html,", when a scaffold containing PP7 and MS2 aptamer domains are expressed, FA and FB come closer and emit fluorescence due to two fusion protein bind to each aptamers.
Objective
Functionalization of protein using RNA without translation
Tokyo-NoKoGen decided to use these parts to detect an RNA fragment that is produced when HHR causes self-cleavage. There is a complementary sequence to RNA scaffold in HHR, therefore one aptamer does not form secondary structure alone. Only when HHR causes self-cleavage and release the scaffold, the scaffold can form both aptamer domains and result in emitting fluorescence (Fig. 1). On the other hand, when HHR doesn’t cause self-cleavage and release the scaffold, the scaffold can’t form one aptamer domains and result in no fluorescence.
So we will regulate GFP fluorescence by RNA, and the response is faster than protein regulation because it doesn’t need to translate. In addition, we can regulate automatically to use RNA oscillation based on HHR.
Fig. 1 How is fluorescence emitted when HHR causes self-cleavage.
Method
Construction of Parts
Ⅰ Construction of split GFP fused with MS2 and PP7 proteins
Ⅱ Construction of RNA scaffold
Ⅲ Construction of split GFP + RNA scaffold
Ⅰ Construction of split GFP fused with MS2 and PP7 proteins
1) We used synthesized sequences of split GFP fused with MS2 (FA-linker-MS2) and split GFP fused with PP7 (FB-linker-PP7) respectively, reference of BioBrick part BBa_K738004 (FA-2X-MS2) and BBa_K738005 (FB-2X-PP7) (ZJU-China 2012). Overlap extension PCR was performed to connect the synthesized fragments.
2-1) The sequence of FB-linker-PP7 was digested at EcoRI and SpeI sites, and BBa_B0015 (double terminator) was digested at EcoRI and XbaI sites, followed by ligation (Fig.2). The region of FB-linker-PP7 and double terminator was amplified by PCR using primers; forward primer has XbaI site and RBS. pSB1A3 and the assembled sequence was digested with XbaI and SpeI (Fig.3).

Edited primers.
06/05
New cloning strategy introduced by Kristina: InFusion by Clontech. Worked to redesign  primers for this purpose.15bp homology required between each insert. Prepared M63 minimal media.
06/06
Made a culture of MG1655 from a plate Michael brought over from BioZone for the  purpose of making competent cells. Edited primers.
06/07
Learned to determine OD600 of growing MG culture by diluting. Made agar and 10% glycerol from 40% stock. Poured plates and streaked the little tabs  that the deletions came in on top of each plate by suspending in sterile LB medium.  Strains were incubated at 7 PM.
06/09
Made liquid cultures of each deletion strain so we can have glycerol stocks. Got trained  on microscope.
06/12
In order to wrap up primer design, Dr. Steipe instructed us on how to make the RBS  overlap, checked over the PCR product schema, and suggested a double stop codon.  Re-established goals for the project and reviewed stimuli and assays.  Booked equipment training with Artur in the Division of Teaching Labs so we can start  trying the ELIZA and spectrophotometer downstairs.
06/13
Made a list of strains to be tested for biofilm proteins. Incubated MG1655 at room temperature without shaking. Prepared for crystal violet  assays with ethanol, temperature and salt stimuli on clear plates
06/14
Artur trained us to use the ELIZA and Titrek Multiscan spectrophotometer.  Made stock solutions of NaCl+LB at varying concentrations, 50mM-350mM.
06/16
Pairing Stimuli with Assays – Organized a chart of stimuli variations matched with  Assays for the different proteins of interest. Ran a sample crystal violet with MG1655  and realized that readings are not noticeably different from each other. Made 400g/L  PEG solution for osmolarity stimuli and ordered ingredients for yeast media.  Grew WT cultures overnight at 250 RPM.
06/17
Pipetted CV plates with varying salt concentrations. Made more salt-free medium and  made stock CR.  Amount of ethanol that needs to be pipetted for each stimulus treatment was  calculated for 100% ethanol. The amount didn't work, since less than 1 microL  was required for some. Thus, 70% ethanol was decided upon. Plate"
Evry,2012,Team:Evry#GB_-_-_TEXT.html,"10: Description of the construction of a non classical cassette for creating a device that test the strength of a terminator using split-vector GoldenBricked mixed with classical or Gibson assembly. The GFP and RFP ratios are measured to evaluate the strength of a terminator the classical way. Two cloning steps are avoided using this procedure.
GoldenBrick make standard part DNA shuffling possible
Aside from the dramatic shortening of the cloning time, the decrease of the costs and the easiness of GoldenBricks over Biobricks, one of the most noticeable improvement is undoubtedly the possibility to make DNA shuffling using a standard format. Let us take the example of a complex system such as a toggle-switch, in which you would like to optimize the expression of the protein repression of its two components to place the system in the working area of the phase domain.
Using the Biobrick format, you will probably have to make tens of different constructs with different RBS to find a condition in which the toggle-switch will work. Using GoldenBricks, you can make all of them in a single tube, in a single step. Moreover, you may eventually find a way to screen them directly after the cloning avoiding the need of purifying and sequence all the clones that couldn't work.
Fig 11: Description of a DNA shuffling experiment in order to optimize the expression of a single gene. 4 Promoters and RBSs are mixed together in a single tube and give rise to 16 construct in a single tube in a single step. The clone expression the enzyme at the correct level can be screened directly on the transformation plate.
Many other use of DNA shuffling can be found in the literature especially for gene expression optimization and screening for working enzymes. We expect that DNA shuffling over standard parts is going to find many applications in the future of iGEM projects.
GoldenBrick is still compatible with Biobrick format
If the situation requires the part to be assembled with the standard RFC 10 format, the new GoldenBrick parts can be assembled the very same way than BioBricks. The only limitation is that BioBrick assembly of GoldenBrick parts leave some scars containing the BsaI restriction site inside, and the produced parts cannot be reassembled with other parts using Golden Gate. No simple way of fixing this issue has been found.
GoldenBricked plasmids are compatible with standard Golden Gate assembly
The GoldenBricked plasmids can be used to assemble contructions using classical Golden Gate. This option has been tested in our team and it works fine. See the result section for more results on the use of Golden"

Data collected by Imperial iGEM 2011.
Upon analysis of the data, a definitive conclusion could not be drawn.  This is due to a number of factors in the setup of the assay. Attractant is localised, and it diffuses in all directions, however the plate is finite and therefore loss of concentration gradient occurs over time. Another factor is the semi-solid agar itself, a medium which is very difficult to manipulate. Although the results were vague, a number of points can be drawn. Positive controls have shown that E. coli DH5α are capable of chemotaxis. They have also shown that when the added serine concentration is too high (10-1 M), bacteria do not swim directly towards the attractant source because the surrounding medium is saturated. Instead they perform chemotaxis in a direction towards which the attractant concentration does not saturate the chemoreceptors. This movement still occurs regardless of the fact that the bacteria are moving away from the attractant source. Negative controls have shown that at any tested concentration of L(-)malic acid, E. coli DH5α without PA2652 or mcpS construct do not perform chemotaxis towards attractant. We could not conclude a result for the mcpS or PA2652 construct with this assay since the colonies observed have a range of shapes at different attractant concentrations"

In 2017 (when our project was not yet formed), we promoted iGEM and explained synthetic biology at our booth. We have designed some small games, such as building blocks to symbolize biobrick, to help ordinary people understand our work.
In 2018, we designed posters to explain our projects, iGEM and synthetic biology. At our booth, we also designed a desert puzzle game to explain the status quo of desertification. In addition, we also distributed 300 questionnaires on “Public Cognition Survey on Desertification and Our Projects” to the public.  (The results and analysis of these questionnaires can be found on our Human Practices-Silver page)

The affiliated primary school of South China Agricultural University holds a science festival every year, and we take this opportunity to contact and communicate with primary school students. In the morning, we came to the playground and set up a booth to showcase our project. After the opening ceremony, the students began to flood in and visit the booth. This time we have prepared some games for them to expect to explain synthetic biology to primary school students in a simpler way. (For example, we have prepared a game of building blocks to explain the concept of biobrick)

Popularization of iGEM and Synthetic Biology
 
When we enjoy the knowledge and jubilant brought by iGEM, we’ve not forgotten to spread them to the public, and let more people, whether in the field or not, know about iGEM and synthetic biology.
 
On September 12nd to 14th, as a key team of XMU summer social practice, we held a science popularization in Xiamen Library, the city's main library. The activity was aimed at popularizing food safety, transgenosis technology, synthetic biology, and iGEM. Unlike in the past, we put the schematic and explicit posters up in the hall along with explanations, did some interesting experiments, made and played an instruction video.
 
To begin with, we informed the readers knowledge of food safety, which drew their attention. The topic was widely recognized, especially the GM food (genetically modified food) which spark a hot debate. Yongyuan Cui, a Chinese hoster and Zhouzi Fang, a Chinese scholar even had a heated argument in Weibo (Chinese Twitter). Regardless the comments on GM food, we objectively presented its theory and laboratory procedures. And there was a lot of misunderstanding we disabused. We believed that after acquirement of the details, the attitude of the public towards GM food could be more objective.
 
We played a video clipped by Wu Fan, Li Zhe and Liu Chang. The 20 minute video introduced transgenosis technology and synthetic biology. Compared with boring explanation, the intuitional way of popularization was obviously more attractive and effective. We were glad to see our audience absorbed in it.
 
The demonstrative experiments were about distinguishing disqualified and toxic food and chemical knowledge. And their characteristics of image, intuition and interest caught the eye of spectators of all ages. In the course of prize-winning quiz, they scrambled to answer questions.
 
Besides, we did a questionnaire which 140 citizens filled out about food safety. We concluded that 42% citizens made up their mind to safeguard their rights and interests when the safety of their food is threatened, even though nearly all of them were concerned about food safety, and that many people jumped to conclusion that GM food is harmful, without comprehension of the mechanism of transgenic <a>technology.</a><a id=""_anchor_1"" href"

Scaling It Up
With the final goal of the Minecrobe project large scale production, the process of scaling up manufacturing from the lab bench to the factory needs to be thoroughly examined and researched. For the final manufacturing procedure we need to consider the following aspects of the process.
·    Culturing the Minecrobe
·    Inducing Sporulation
·    Separating Spores from Live Cells
·    Producing Granule-form Product
·    Packaging and Shipping
- Field Use
Lab Scale
On the scale of the lab, streaks of live bacteria were taken from lawn plates and inoculated in 10 mL of Luria broth. The liquid cultures were left to grow overnight to O.D. of 1.96 – 2.00, .5mL of the culture was pipetted directly onto the seeds which were then planted in sterile soil. For our lab scale tests live cells were used instead of spores due to time and financial restrictions.
Culturing and Sporulation
For large scale production the Minecrobe cells will be cultured and induced to sporulation at the same time. This protocol is from a 1963 Donnellan, Nags, and Levinson paper in which they outline a method and broth that induces sporulation while allowing B. subtilis to divide. Following their protocol and recipe, a 12L flask containing sporulation medium will be inoculated with spores or live bacteria. The cultures will then be incubated at 29 C on a shaker (95 strokes/min) for 4 days. It is hypothesized that inoculating with live cells instead of spores would decrease the incubation time as there would be no need for the spores to"

Template DNA for PCR prepared from colonies using GeneReleaser . ( Protocol )
Week 2 June 5-11
Performed PCR on esp and rsaA genes ( protocol ) and ran results on gel ( protocol ).  Results showed successful amplification ( Figure 1 ).
Performed a transformation ( protocol ) to test the efficiency of our competent cells make in Week 1.  Results were successful with about a 0.7 x 10^7 CFU/μg of pUC19.
Purified PCR product ( protocol ) and digested esp with EcoRI, SpeI, and PstI; rsaA with EcoRI, XbaI, and PstI; and pSB1C3 with EcoRI and PstI.  We then ligated esp, rsaA, and esp and rsaA to pSB1C3 and transformed into E. coli Top10. ( Protocol )
Inoculated liquid cultures with colonies from transformations.
Performed a Miniprep on the results from transformation, digested the plasmid and ran the results on a gel to check the success of our transformations ( Figure 2 ).
Transformed BBa_K081005 , a BioBrick part containing a gene for constitutive promotor and RBS, into E. coli Top10.
Week 3 June 12-18
We inoculated cultures of transformed BBa_K081005, then performed a Miniprep on the overnight cultures to obtain plasmid containing BBa_K081005. PCR amplified the miniprep product.  The product of this was cleaned and digested with Eco RI and SpeI to be used in later ligation with plasmid containing esp and rsaA.
Plasmid samples containing rsaA or esp were prepared and sent for sequencing. Results arrived on Friday showing that the coding sequences had been conserved.
Digested plasmid containing esp with SpeI and PstI and PCR product of rsaA with XbaI and PstI, then ligated these digests together and transformed into E. coli Top10.  Twelve colonies were picked from transformation plates and prepared streak plates and PCR template DNA by freeze-thaw ( protocol ).  PCR was conducted using plasmid primers VF2 and VR and the products were run on a gel, showing some success ( Figure 3 ).  The strain containing the successful ligation product was inoculated in chloramphenicol broth and the overnight culture was used for a miniprep of the plasmid.  The plasmid was then"

Figure 3: Schematic outline of the CINDY Seq method. Proteins that can be characterised by CINDY Seq are involved in the assembly and degradation of polymers.
Another example of a BioBrick that could be characterized using coacervates is T5 Phage Exonuclease ( BBa_K676006 ). This part encodes for a DNase that can denature linear ssDNA and dsDNA, but will not cleave supercoiled plasmids, which makes it ideal when manufacturing plasmids. It has been demonstrated that coacervates can also be made using ssDNA and dsDNA ( Jain & Vale 2017 ). The cleaving activity of this (and other) nuclease can therefore be tested using the coacervation detection method. One more nuclease that can characterised in a similar way is the coding sequence for a nuclease regulated by T7-promoter ( BBa_K2144000 ).
Further improvements
Several optimization and broadening steps for the coacervation method can be thought of. Trivial optimization steps are those in which the coacervate forming polymers and their concentrations are optimized to achieve maximum visual difference between coacervates and homogenous solutions. Furthermore, dyes exist that partition into coacervates rather than in the polymer-poor phase, and by centrifugation the dyed coacervates can be spun down to the bottom of a tube ( Aumiller et al. 2016 ; Aumiller & Keating 2015 ). For more quantitative measurements with the coacervation method, absorbances can be measured in a UV/Vis spectrophotometer, as we did for several of our own experiments as well.

The part lacks an ATG start codon (provided by N-terminal part). It can therefore be fused to any gene in a modular fashion via the modular construction strategy of protein fusion developed by the Freiburg 2007 team.

The RBS CheZ- Fusion BioBrick consists of a RBS fused to the E. coli CheZ motility factor that lacks a stop codon at the N-terminus (although a TAG stop codon is provided by the RFC 25 suffix). CheZ in this part contains the standard BioBrick prefix and the Freiburg (2007) fusion suffix. The N-terminal part can be fused to a reporter or other CDS. Using this BioBrick, CheZ is constitutively expressed.
CheZ is the chief regulator of the molecular events that lead the counter clockwise rotation of the flagella motor during the chemotaxis signal transduction pathway of E.coli. This counter clockwise flagella motor rotation results in bacterial swimming (instead of tumbling).

This part consists of an atrazine-sensitive riboswitch, developed by Sinha et al (2010), detached from its associated translation unit (coding region) and fused to mRFP1 fluorescent reporter (BBa_J61100). This part regulates the expression of mRFP in an atrazine-dependent fashion through an atrazine-specific RNA aptamer.

The theophylline riboswitch1-venus fusion was constructed via 2 rounds of PCR. This part ends with a standard double terminator transcriptional terminator for E.coli (BBa_B0015).

UChicago,2014,Team:UChicago#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," we PCRed out AroF again using our new primer without the overhang. The gel looks good! Let's miniprep it!
And what??? 4 out of 7 overnight cultures from yesterday didn’t grow? And we have to pick the colonies again? We really need mcherry+lva… :( But the IPTG+GFP plasmids look promising. Miniprepped the plasmids and ran them on a gel. Look at this beautiful gel! Now let’s cut it up for gel extraction!
Friday
What? Why didn’t the mcherry colonies grow again? :( Retransformed mcherry again. Ligated promoter and TyrR while waiting for transformation.  For the mutator plasmids, the remaining mutators were digested and ligated into the IPTG+GFP plasmids. Transformation results will be ready tomorrow! The ligated MutT and EmrR plasmids from earlier this week were miniprepped and stored.
Week 9 8/11 - 8/15
Monday
It looks like one of the tubes labelled as “promoter plasmid” was actually IPTG+GFP. Whoopsy-daisy. Also transformed general promoter from kit plate. A lot of the mutator transformation plates worked. Woot! We can now use them for cloning and stuff. Did colony PCR for a bunch of them and then ran on gels. MutH, MutY, and UmuC all gave good results.
Tuesday
Made glycerol stocks of mCherry. Miniprepped mCherry+Iva, then restriction digested and gel purified it. Ran colony PCR reactions for MutS, MutL, and DinB. Ran gels for DnaE, UmuC (redo), and ParC (redo). The redos were done because redundancy is useful in science. Redundancy is redundant. Redundancy is also redundant. Made a bunch of variable Rifampicin plates and diluted MG1655 into 200ul aliquots for mic determination.
Somewhere, in a deep, dark corner of the gel room, someone started making new TAE Buffer...but their mind was in physics mode instead of bio mode…*foreshadowing intensifies*
Wednesday
Did colony PCR on a boatload (okay, it would have to be a really small boat) of IPTG+GFP so that we’d have plenty for future gels. Ran gels for MutS, MutL, and DinB. MutS and DinB gave"

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportPreface_-_-_TEXT.html," alternatively insider and outsider towards their own science formation. That change sometimes permits the development of a critical perception, or, at least, makes it more attainable. That critical perspective permitted by reflexivity is one of the ways to get to ethical reflexion.
Among the large field of synthetic biology, the IGEM competition invites young scientists, future researchers to interdisciplinary experimentation. Heterogeneous teams focus on freedom, innovation and motivation can lead teams to perform that disciplinary “insider/outsider” team standing. The specifications of the competition encourage to this reflexive position. In other word, the point is how exploration and experimentation in the way to build up an IGEM project can lead teams to that critical reflexion. Freedom and experimentation, encouraged by the structure of the competition, make the ethical reflexion both relevant and accessible to the teams' mind.
If we go ahead with our inquiry, crossing several institutional or disciplinary structures which promote a critical standpoint and ethical reflexion, we have to examine our own structure of participation in the competition : our team. We can find two “original” explanations to that reflexivity of the team. The Parisian team is build by volunteers to the “IGEM call” made by the Center for Research and Interdisciplinary (CRI) not only because of the student's membership of a certain university. Therefore, the team(iGEM Paris Team) is hybrid both socially and disciplinarily. Students come from high school or undergraduated programs, and differences in disciplines and specializations are large and various. At first, we had to make an effort to understand each other's different backgrounds. In the course of the project development, that “different regard” of the members was transformed, becoming a “shared regard” by building up our project and knowledge, in the process of building a team.
These differences between members, understood as a wealth, were already in the mind of the researchers of the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI). The CRI was founded in 2005 at the Medical University of Paris Descartes and defines itself as a convivial place at the crossroad between Life Sciences and exact, natural, cognitive and social sciences. New ways of teaching and learning are daily practices at the CRI, for graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and researchers. The originality of the collaborative, non-hierarchical interactions between students and teachers can be found in the autonomy of the student (they collectively choose the content of the classes) but also in the main research's themes and perspectives. The CRI “call for participation” to IGEM has to be understood in that perspective"

Figure 4: Photograph of our SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis gel run with proteins from E.coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pSB1C3-Phasin-HlyA tag (Phasin), E.coli BL21(DE3) transformed with an empty pSB1C3 vector (pSB), and a protein ladder. There were too many protein bands present to distinctly see if Phasin-HlyA Tag was present at 27 kDa.
Figure 5: Photographs of our SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis gels run with proteins from E.coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pSB1C3-Phasin-HlyA tag (Phasin), E.coli BL21(DE3) transformed with an empty pSB1C3 vector (pSB), and a protein ladder and had been incubated with anti-FLAG resin. All lanes are empty, indicating that the anti-FLAG resin incubation had failed.
Our final attempt at SDS-Page gel will use Immunoblotting. Samples from both E. coli variants will be prepared as described above, however, the sample fractions will be incubated with an anti-FLAG rabbit antibody instead. Then, goat anti-rabbit with IgG-HRP will be used as a secondary antibody to detect the presence of FLAG-tagged proteins by a color change. HRP changes color to blue if the secondary antibody binds to the anti-FLAG rabbit antibody bound to a FLAG-tagged protein (our Phasin-HlyA Tag).
Future Directions
In the future, our team would like to test the effects of other alterations on PHB secretion, such as:
Modify temperature, glucose % content, and incubation time to find the optimal conditions for PHB secretion with Phasin-HlyA Tag
HlyB, HlyD, and TolC upregulation,
Mutated versions of HlyB, HlyD, or TolC that can have increased rates of secretion, and
The use of another secretion system (e.g. LapA) that can export larger molecules than the HlyA system.

Introduction :
Setting up our project, we involved local Indian citizens and expert authorities in India to understand their needs and how a synthetic biology approach answer them in an accepted way. They shared with us how they perceive our work and what were their concerns, comments and questions. Our project has largely benefited from these exchanges.
The dish choice. One can think why we chose Idli; it is a really famous fermented dishe eaten daily all around India (see Graphic below) and loved because of it's particular taste and texture. It is a way for us to celebrate and promote Indian culture without disrupting it.
Authorities and Experts :
We exchanged with lawmakers and food safety authorities to get their views on our project and tune it accordingly.
Contact person: Dr. A. K. Sharma, on the behalf of the Chairperson and CEO of Food Safety and Standard Authority in India (FSSAI).
Advice: Choose the right microorganisms so they can survive and work together, along with the use of critical genes for the vitamins pathways. Concerning the law, he said that there is currently no authorisation for GMO microorganisms in the Indian Food regulation and if we want to have our product in India, the safety needs to be established.
Contact person: Dr. Sunita Grover, principal scientist and head of the Dairy Microbiology Division at the National Dairy Research Institute
Advice: Use food grade vector system to make sure our product is safe for consumption and to reduce issues arising form the  use of genetically modified bacteria. She had concerns about the compatibility of the different species  living in fermentation batter. To finish, her major  concern is safety. our project needs to undergo phase I and II trials, to assess safety and scientifically proven health benefits.  She was surprised and really enthusiastic towards the project because malnutrition is a serious problem in India and many children suffer from it our project.

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," silver is the most effective and the least toxic to humans (16) . It is commonly used in medical treatments. Silver ion release from silver composites has also been presented as an effect antimicrobial method (17) .
However, silver has both an effect on S. aureus and E. coli. Gram-negative bacteria such as E.coli suffer more structural damage from silver than Gram-positive bacteria like S. aureus (18) .
Overcrowding
Problem: We should prevent the material from E. coli overcrowding.
Experts: iGEM Düsseldorf 2018 (see collaborations page )
Solution: The risk of overcrowding is low, as E. coli uses most of its resources for protein production. However, we could use a quorum sensing system such as the construct developed by iGEM Düsseldorf 2018.
More information
During the European meetup in Munich we explained iGEM Düsseldorf how we want to make a living material. They recognized the problem of bacterial overcrowding within our construct. Since our bacteria will keep dividing and cannot escape the hydrogel, at some point bacteria will be over-saturated which can lead to problems in protein expression  or even dead. They offered to help us, and we had a meeting with them over skype. They were making a construct that uses the Lux Quorum sensing. Their construct contained 3 plasmids: Luxl (synthase for AHL), LuxR (molecule where AHL binds and can then bind to promotor) and pLux (promotor to which LuxR +AHL can bind). When the promoter gets activated, a phage lysis gene will be synthesized. In our case they offered to send us the plasmids without the Luxl in the construct, so when we add AHL to the hydrogel medium, cell growth will be inhibited. This is a great solution to keep our bacteria in control, as we want them to stay in steady numbers within our hydrogel, with steady lysostaphin production.
Conclusion
The concept of Safe-by-Design helped us to prioritize safety during all stages of the project. Thanks to many interactions with stakeholders, we recognized potential problems early on and found creative solutions. We believe that this resulted in a living material and wound healing bandage which will be safe for scientists, patients, medical professionals and the environment. Extensive (clinical) tests will need to verify this. We want to thank all stakeholders that helped us during the process. Without your help, we could not have considered as many aspects of safety!

Purdue,2016,Team:Purdue#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," than 90% of all measured concentrations exceeded 0.03 mg/L, the recommended level for minimizing algae growth. The annual flow-weighted mean for dissolved reactive phosphorus in tile drainage systems was 0.12 mg/L, and the annual flow-weighted mean for total phosphorus in tile drainage systems was 0.15 mg/L. Results indicated that tile drainage accounted for 48% of the monthly dissolved phosphorus and 40% of the monthly total phosphorus exported from the watershed. While the amount of phosphorus that enters the tile drain system varies with soil type and season, the researchers concluded that, based on similar studies, the observed relationship between phosphorus in tile drainage systems and watersheds are likely relevant for many other watersheds in the midwestern United States.[10]
Therefore,our phosphorus-accumulating E. coli could be used to remove phosphorus from the water before the water leaves the outlet pipe. Our system would be designed to attach to the end of the outlet pipe. Also, we would add genes (based on Nanjing-China’s 2013 iGEM project) to our E. coli to absorb and degrade atrazine. These would include a transporter for atrazine (BBa_K1145001), trzN, an enzyme which degrades atrazine (BBa_K1145002), and a ribosome switch opened by atrazine (BBa_K1145003). By placing trzN downstream of the ribosome switch, we would only produce trzN when necessary. [11] Also, in the future, we could work on developing a genetic system for nitrogen remediation to incorporate into our E. coli.
Wastewater Treatment Plants
[12]
Our phosphorus-accumulating E. coli would be useful during tertiary treatment of the wastewater treatment process. Tertiary treatment refers to any additional treatment after secondary treatment, and this often involves removal of impurities and nutrients, such as phosphorus.[13] The Environmental Protection Agency and state agencies are requiring reductions in the amount of phosphorus in wastewater discharge [14]. Phosphorus can be removed by either a chemical or biological process. The chemical removal of phosphorus involves the formation of a precipitate by the addition of metal salts. The precipitate, and therefore the phosphorus, can then be removed. The traditional biological method of phosphorus removal, enhanced biological phosphorus removal, phosphorus-accumulating organisms are present in sludge. The phosphorus-accumulating organisms (PAOs) then store 5 to 30% of their dry weight as phosphorus. The exact composition"

Introduction to Tyrocidine
Tyrocidine is a mixture of non-ribosomal antibiotics, naturally expressed by Brevibacillus parabrevis. Due to its toxicity, tyrocidine is only suited for topical use. The project has focused on expressing the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase in Bacillus subtilis, an established model organism, and thereby making it accessible for improvement by oligo mediated recombineering. By using recombineering to alter the active site determining the substrate specificity, new variants of the antibiotic can be created which could be screened for reduced toxicity.
Achievements
All parts except for the repressor have been assembled. Read more in the lab notebook .  
A protocol to detect tyrocidine  has been established, which has been tested by using commercially purchased tyrocidine as a standard.
Background
 
 
Tyrocidine is a mixture of non-ribosomal, cyclic antibiotics produced by Brevibacillus parabrevis and has a unique mode of action wherein it disrupts the function of the cell membrane. Tyrocidine consists of four decapeptides varying at three amino acids which are produced by an NRPS system which is capable of incorporating structurally similar amino acids at position 3, 4, and 7 [1]. The three enzymes Tyrocidine Synthetase A, B, and C contain 1, 3, and 6 modules, respectively, and assemble Tyrocidine in an assembly line manner.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"-culture test shows increasing fluorescence/time after specific induction with the connecting molecule C12-RHL.
Framework test. The co-culture of the 3 cell types was inoculated at ratio 1:1:1 (detectors:processors:reporters), growth and fluorescence were monitored after induction with IPTG 1mM. The plot shows no significant increasing fluorescence in the induced samples (Figure 8).
Figure 8: Framework ( BBa_K2205009 , BBa_K2205012 , BBa_K2205015 ) test with a co-culture in ratio 1:1:1 in response of IPTG induction.
Results from the multicellular modelling predicted that the traditionally used 1:1:1 ratio is not the optimal combination for the Sensynova device to work. It is in fact suggested to adopt a higher concentration of the reporter culture compare with the detector and processor. Thus, the framework test was repeated incorporating our in silico simulation data and combining the 3 cell types in ratio 1:1:13 (detectors:processors:reporters). The experiment results, shown in the picture below, confirm the modelling data. There is a consistent discrepancy between IPTG induced and non-induced samples in the 1:1:13 co-cultures, in comparison with the 1:1:1 co-cultures which don't show any difference in presence or absence of IPTG (Figure 9).
Figure 9: Framework ( BBa_K2205009 , BBa_K2205012 , BBa_K2205015 )  test with a co-culture in ratio 1:1:13 in response of IPTG induction.
The experimental data validate the model prediction showing that the system worked most optimally when the reporter cells were in excess of both the detector and processor cells. One of the reasons that this configuration was the best may be because of signal amplification at each of the quorum sensing communication stages. The quorum sensing mechanism used here is the acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) system in gram negative bacteria. This system works by one cell producing a quorum sensing molecule which can diffuse out through its membrane. Once the extracellular space reaches a certain threshold concentration of AHL molecule, the AHL will begin to diffuse into other cells in the community. If the cell the AHL molecule enters has the appropriate transcription factor present (e.g. LasR for the C12 AHL), then transcription of a gene under the control of the pLas promoter can occur. Therefore, if background expression of the AHL is high enough to reach above the"

Human Practises
Human Practises is a major part of our iGEM project. The reason for this is that even though the science and the theory makes sense, we need to establish whether our idea is viable in the outside world. This is in respect to understanding what the public think about our project idea but also the concept behind synthetic biology.
To be able to understand this as a team we decided on producing a short survey which asked questioned what our surveyors understood about synthetic biology and Genetically modified organisms (GMOs), we then introduced our idea and asked their opinions on this. We finally asked what the ethical implications of our project would have on the public.
Using the data we obtained from the  survey we found that some of our surveyors did not understand the idea behind synthetic biology. From this we questioned what would be the best method to at least increase awareness of the new science and its prospects for the future. Majority of surveyors agreed that education about synthetic biology at schools was the best way in which people could learn about it such that as a team we produced a lesson plan for a Year 9/10 class
Information about this is shown under the Education sub heading
Survey
As part of the Human Practices section we wanted to understand what people from all backgrounds and ages understood about synthetic biology. To be able to do this we used questions which will highlight what people know and what they thought as an outside prospective of our project idea.
To achieve this we have created an online survey which can be found at: Survey
Survey Results
From the responses of the survey we have converted them such that the results can be seen visually through bar graphs and pie charts, this has been shown below.
Q1. How much do you know about synthetic biology?
A. Results from the survey had shown that most of the surveyors had little or some information about synthetic biology with 7 people having never heard of it before or knowing nothing.
Q2. What would help you understand about synthetic biology?
A. From the above graph it can be seen that most surveyors found that teaching at schools would help one understand synthetic biology. To develop from what we understood from this we produced a lesson plan for Year 9/10 students, which can be found in the Education section.

The team members working on human practices had a really informative meeting with Kristina Dienhart from Smart City Odense.  We held a presentation at the local high school OTG (The Technical High School of Odense). SDU communication helped us produce a video about our project, which reached more than 27000 people on Facebook. Furthermore, an article about our project and team was published in the local newspaper Fyens Stiftstidende.
The genes encoding the carboxysome were assembled. Furthermore, the expression levels of the Mnt- and PenI-regulated promoters were compared in the fluorescence microscope.
Week 37
We hosted an event for ATU (Academy for Talented Youths) with transformation and synthetic biology as the main focus. This began with a general presentation, after which we went to our lab, where the aspiring scientists from ATU performed plasmid purification and gel electrophoresis. The team had a marvelous day as it was wonderful to see so many young individuals being engaged in science.
Week 38
We had a human practises meeting with Rikke Falgreen Mortensen about integrating our project in MyBolbro.  Furthermore, we held a presentation about GMO and our project for the local public school, Odense Friskole.
We were surprised to discover that a transposon hotspot had formed between the LacI-regulated, lambda pL hybrid promoter and the GFP reporter.
Week 39
We held a presentation at the local high school, Mulernes Gymnasium, where synthetic biology was the main focus.
The lab workers discovered that a region containing the strong constitutive promoter and the BioBrick prefix had vanished from the photocontrol device plasmid. Furthermore, it was decided to keep the cellulose biosynthesis subproject theoretical henceforth.
Week 40
Materials for our prototype were set after a talk with the plastic expert"

Here are two examples of excellent Education and Public Engagement from 2015:

Tuebingen,2013,Team:Tuebingen#Project#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," are extracted from the S. cerevisiae genome via PCR. All of the parts we use are expressed in wildtype organisms and are not known to have any harmful effect on humans or other organisms.
 
Which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
    In Germany any work with genetically modified organisms is regulated by the "" Gentechnikgesetz "". There are different biosafety levels ranging from 1 to 4. Our lab has been registered as biosafety level 1. Our work matches the definition of level 1 since based on our current understanding we see no threats on human health or the environment originating from our work. Genetically modified organisms are allowed to be released into nature only after permission of the Umweltministerium (Department of the Environment) and once freed they need to be monitored constantly.
 
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
    Parts that are able to induce apoptosis or autolyis could be expressed under promoters that are activated if a specific substance is lacking or present in an uncontrolled environment as opposed to a lab. As an example 2011's team of UCL London had a concept for autolysis that could be of value. This year BGU Israel 's iGEM-team is developping a ""Programmable Autonomous Self Elimination""-system.
For our measurement system a possible promoter could be induced by low iron supply, which then would have to be a part of the culture medium in the lab. In environments without iron the organism would not only be unable to survive but would be killed immediately. Mechanisms of this kind would then have to be a obligatory requirement for all contest-submissions.

Our DiaMIX
We developed a low-budget protocol for iGEM teams to express proteins in a prokaryotic cell-free expression system. Due to the prokaryotic origin of most of the proteins expressed during our project, we decided to base our cell-free expression system, the DiaMIX, on an E. coli culture.
Figure 4: E. coli lysate production. The strain BL21 was transformed with the plasmid pRARE2 , induced with IPTG to express T7 polymerase, lysed, centrifuged and the supernatant was flash frozen in liquid N2.
For producing the DiaMIX lysate, we used the E. coli strain BL21 , as it is carrying a gene coding for the T7 RNA polymerase, which improves protein expression. The cells were induced with IPTG prior to further treatment to initialize T7 polymerase expression, therefore allowing a high rate of protein synthesis. 6)
Since codon usage is a limiting factor, especially when expressing proteins of eukaryotic origin, the E. coli BL21 cells were additionally transformed with the plasmid pRARE2 containing the coding sequence of tRNAs for the translation of rare codons (AGA, AGG, AUA, CUA, GGA, CCC and CGG)under control of their native promoters. We prepared the lysate according to an optimized protocol adapted from the European Molecular Biology Lab (EMBL) Heidelberg (figure 4)  This lysate contains the whole transcription and translation apparatus of the cell, allowing successful expression of proteins from DNA templates.
Verification of Protein Expression
To validate whether the expression in the DiaMIX yields correctly folded proteins, we used various methods like fluorescence measurements , luciferase assays and Western Blots .
Our first approach was the expression of GFP , which can be detected via its fluorescence. We used a plasmid template that was kindly provided by AG Roth. For the results of this experiment, have a look at our Results Page . As a second test we performed a luciferase assay. In contrast to the expression of GFP which can be followed by a gradual rise of fluorescence over time, the luciferase assay is based on the emission of light when the substrate luciferin is converted into oxyluciferin (figure 5). This reaction is catalyzed by the reporter luciferase. Since it depends on inducing the reaction with luciferin, it does not allow a tracking of expression over time. Check out our results for more information about the outcome."

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description#Biocontainment_-_-_TEXT.html," the linear substrate was at least partially cleaved in all cases. As expected, dCas9 did not cleave DNA. When two gRNAs that target the RFP gene (in fig. 3, guide 1 and 2) on opposite DNA strands are offered to nCas9-Ala10Asp(TAG), it is expected to see some cleaving caused by the two nicks in close proximity. Indeed, partial cleavage was observed. However, we also observed some cleaving when we incubated with only one gRNA, which is unexpected. It has been shown that the His840Ala version of nCas9 6 , which is the same protein as our nCas9-Ala10Asp(TAG), still has some residual double strand cleaving activity. Further testing is needed to find out whether this caused cleaving by nCas9-Ala10Asp(TAG) in our case, or that it is an artifact of some sort.
Figure 5. in vitro Cas9 activity assays with Cas9, dCas9 and dCas9-Ala10Asp. Substrate for cleaving is a PCR product including the gene encoding RFP, which is targeted at the N-terminal side, both on the template strand (gRNA 2 and 4) and the non-template strand (gRNA 1). Size of the uncleaved PCR product is 4140 bp, cleaving generates a 3100 bp and a 1040 bp fragment. Wt = wildtype Cas9, d = dCas9, n = nCas9-Ala(GCT)10→ Asp(TAG). Marker: 1kb ladder (NEB).
In conclusion: this part of our project shows that an artificial amino acid can be incorporated in Cas9 in response to the TAG stop codon. We also tried to incorporate aspartate in response to the TAG stop codon, and while we have some indications that this restored nickase activity, further testing is needed to verify whether this is the case.

KULeuven,2009,Team:KULeuven#University_-_-_TEXT.html," in terms of its scholarly output. Likewise with regard to teaching, several quality surveys demonstrate that K.U.Leuven stands on par with internationally respected institutions in a large number of fields.
This academic reputation attracts students from all over the world. K.U.Leuven has been involved in the Erasmus student exchange programme since its launch in Europe in the late 1980s; the growing success of the Erasmus programme later on led to the launch of the Socrates programme , and today the University of Leuven has over 300 contracts under this programme. Each year around 600 international Erasmus students spend part of their study programme in Leuven, while more than 500 of our students share the same European experience at another university. The TEMPUS -PHARE programme was set up for students and researchers from Eastern Europe, while contacts with universities in the former Soviet Union are being built up through the TEMPUS -TACIS programme. The co-operation with universities in Latin America falls within the scope of the ALFA programme .
Besides these exchange programmes, the university has set up a number of international academic programmes aimed both at Belgian and international students. Unlike the regular Dutch-language programmes, the international academic programmes are taught in English. Most of these programmes confer master’s degrees: full bachelor’s degree programmes in English are offered only in the fields of theology and philosophy.
At present, K.U.Leuven caters to more than 31,000 students, around 12% of whom are international students from more than 120 nations. In terms of its personnel, there are 5,287 academic staff, 2,730 administrative and technical staff, and 8,172 university hospital staff members. With regard to its physical facilities, the university occupies a total area of 1,058,445 square metres and it has a total of 26,606 rooms. On the academic side, the university is composed of fourteen faculties, fifty departments and about 240 sub-departments. Further, its network of thirty auxiliary libraries now houses a total of 4.3 million volumes, 14,500 magazines and journals, and 7,492 full text electronic magazines. And concerning its medical facilities, K.U.Leuven supports five hospitals and three affiliated hospitals, with a total of 2,057 hospital beds for the acutely ill.
K.U.Leuven's rich history can be read not only from the city's street names, but also from the dozens of historical university buildings. The medieval cloth hall, near the famous gothic town hall, is the university's administrative centre. The beautifully restored Great"

We took a 1ml sample from the induced culture and measured the OD600nmand then the samples from the cultures were spun down to separate the cells and supernatant. Through running both samples on a western blot we were able to determine whether; the protein was being expressed inside of the cell, and if the protein was being secreted outside of the cell. On the whole cell western blot, we can see that our OsmY-HA is being expressed in the presence of rhamnose (Fig. 1A). On the supernatant western blot, we can see traces of our OsmY-HA outside of the cell which shows that it is being secreted (Fig. 1B).
Figure 2: Western blots showing the whole cell samples of rhamnose induced OsmY-Hfq-HA fusion proteins with Hfq from E. coli (A) and Serratia marcesens (B). Western blot showing supernatant samples of both fusion proteins along with OsmY-HA and empty vector. (C) Western blots showing the supernatant samples of OsmY-HA, OsmY-Hfq E. coli and Osmy-Hfq serratia.
Once we knew our OsmY-HA was working and being secreted out of the cell we then proceeded to the next stage, we had to make sure that our fusion protein which was made up of the OsmY-Ha and Hfq from E. coli was also being secreted to test this we ran an identical experiment with cells expressing our OsmY-Hfq-HA constructs (Fig. 2A). The same had to be performed on the fusion containing the Hfq protein from Serratia marcesens and it can be seen that once again the fusion is being expressed when in the presence of the Rhamnose (Fig. 2B). Once we knew that the cells were being expressed we had to perform a western blot on the supernatant of the cells; this was done on the supernatant of each of the fusion proteins as well as the OsmY-HA and on the empty vector to make sure it’s not interfering with any of the results. From the results (Fig. 2C) we can see that both of the fusions are secreting our protein however the Serratia version seems to be more limited in comparison to the E. coli. We can also see that the OsmY-HA"

ASTWS-China,2018,Team:ASTWS-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," when designing our prototype, we extra added the use of germicidal lamp and the settling basin to eliminate the public fear of bioengineering methods. Moreover, we learned from the engineer that the domestic sewage treatment plant had no capacity to treat any heavy metal wastewater, however they were responsible to monitor these values, from his point of view, heavy metal detection devices should have broad market.
Field Trip to Industrial Sewage Plant
Justin Yan, the dry team leader, visited Baoding Baoyun Plate Making Co.Ltd located in Baoding, Hebei, China. This company mainly focused on producing intaglio roller for printing. During the manufacturing process, copper is needed to polish the surface of the metal. So industrial waste water is produced during the process. The original copper inside the water before filtering is 5-184mg/L. Currently, the sewage treatment system is composed of 7 different units: neutralization, settlement, sand leach, carbon-filtrating, resin exchange, ultrafiltration, and antiosmosis. After the process in the system, the waste water could have a copper level lower than 0.15mg/L. Although the process meets the government’s requirement, it takes to much space and the electrical usage is huge. The cost is high, and the working environment is unpleasant.
Interview to Prof. Ruo He
Professor of Environmental Science department of Zhejiang University
Our initial plan was to clone the Mbns gene from the methanotrophs. However upon sequencing the amplified inserts, none of the sequences were what we expected to find. And we have learned the methanobactine's mechanism inside methanotroph but is not yet fully understood.
We asked Prof. Ruo He, an expert who mainly worked on methanotrophs, for advice. She told us as an anaerobic bacteria, methanotrophs are really hard to operate in normal conditions. So finding the corresponding sequence and synthesizing it and then transferring the Mbns gene into E.coli would be more efficient and helpful. Combined with the results of survey mentioned above, we chose Escherichia coli BL21 strain which is low toxicity and low sensitivity to human and environment. And we also successfully constructed the new basic part MbnABC which is submitted to Registry (BBa_2826000).

So all following iGEM teams can build on it and screen the diversity for their desired protein with custom properties. For that reason, it has to be possible, to enter bases of the IUPAC nucleotide code including explicitly random bases, e.g. M, W, X and Y as a part sequence.
To distribute the submitted Monobody and Nanobody libraries for further iGEM teams by the iGEM headquarter, it is necessary to conserve the library diversity as effectively as possible. For that, recloning by chemical or electro transformation is the wrong way. It would be the best, to multiply the plasmid mixes by PCR. Using the primers LIB-bb-fw and LIB-bb-rev . After distribution the operator can realign the linearized Plasmid by using biobrick or Gibson assembly. To ensure, a high yield of different bacterial clones it would be rational, to use high efficient competent cells to gain an optimal variability.

We tried growing them at 20 °C and 16 °C, at which point, quite  some of the protein was finally expressed in the soluble fraction. This needs more  optimization thought, and perhaps the use of promoter and RBS with less strength will  produce the protein in the soluble fraction. Ideally, the three constructs (containing CtfA, CtfB  and BdhB) would be ligated together so that the bacteria are able to perform the conversion  from butanoic acid to butanol after only one transformation.
As a source of carbon in our bioreactor experiments we used waste from which we  produced biohydrogen, which can be used as a source of energy. The other by  products involve bacterial biomass, which could prove useful as a fertilizer in  agriculture, and butanoic acid, which we use as a source of carbon for the next  reaction, in which butanoic acid is converted into butanol. In addition to the butanoic  acid we added glycerol, which enabled the final production of butanoic acid to  butanol.
One of the biggest steps of testing the growth conditions for E. coli was optimization,  which was troublesome due to slow growth of bacteria and the strain of maintain of  anaerobic conditions, in which the production of butanol is performed. Since E. coli is  a facultative anaerobic organism, it can grow in anaerobic conditions; however the  growth is much slower in comparison to the growth in aerobic conditions. Another  issue with optimization was testing different ratios of substrates in such a way, that  the least glycerol and as much butanoic acid as possible would be used, while still  retaining the amount of substrates low enough, so that it wouldn’t be toxic for our  bacteria. We have done our best to replicate the different factors that could  influence the conversion could be preformed and optimize conditions for that  conversion. Applying this in practice after the bacteria is successfully transformed  with a single plasmid carrying all three genes is the next stage of our project.  When put to a larger scale, such production would lower the need for fossil fuels in  everyday life as well as offer new jobs. Butanol spills are also easily biodegraded to  non-toxic concentrations in comparison with gasoline. Produced biobutanol could be  used as fuel for various vehicles and transport, such as cars, public transport and  even farm tractors. Additionally, it would prove as a source of energy for electric "
University_of_Ottawa,2008,Team:University of Ottawa#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," ], suggesting that the structure may possess an evolutionary robustness.
In our system, the induced transcriptional activator (A) is SKN7 and C is our protein of interest. We include TetR as our transcriptional repressor (B). When activated, SKN7 will induce both the protein of interest C (e.g. GFP) and TetR. TetR will accumulate and repress transcription of C, resulting in a pulse of C expression. A similar incoherent T1 feedforward loop was implemented in E. coli by Basu et al. (2004) [ 6 ].
However, we wanted to improve on the design by adding an auto-reset mechanism to allow the cell to return to its initial state and become competent for subsequent pulse inductions. Therefore, we added another component (D), a gene expressing the enzyme cytokinin dehydrogenase (aka cytokinin oxidase, CKX) which is responsible for regulating endogenous cytokinin levels in Arabidopsis thaliana and related plants [ 7,8 ]. It catalyzes the degradation of cytokinins such as isopentenyladenine and zeatin.
In our design, this gene is also activated by SKN7 and degrades the inducer molecule (isopentenyladenine), thus allowing the levels of A, B and C to return to pre-induction steady state levels. In terms of network structure, we are incorporating a delayed negative feedback loop into our feedforward motif:
Figure II - An additional element is added to the feed forward regulatory motif, where element D inhibits the initial stimulus A
To construct our genetic network, we used the pSSRE promoter construct provided to us. There are two configurations of this promoter, one containing a single SSRE element and one containing two tandem SSREs. The tandem SSRE configuration was found to have a higher signal, but at the expense of leaky basal expression [ 2 ]. The gene of interest used for these experiments is the reporter gene coding for yeast enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP). Our design involves three gene cassettes (one for each of GFP, TetR and CKX) regulated by distinct SSRE promoters. The GFP promoter is modified to contain tet operator elements, allowing repression by TetR.
It is obvious that pulse dynamics depend highly on the kinetics of GFP expression as well as TetR repressor expression and repression of GFP. Therefore, we planned to construct a library of constructs, containing different combinations of SSRE elements and tetO elements, and then to screen the strains produced from these for optimal pulse dynamics"
Waterloo,2016,Team:Waterloo#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," of our plasmid by the yeast cells. We used GFP-tagged Hsp104 under the influence of different promoters to study the plasmid retention. A low copy number plasmid was used to more accurately study the partitioning of plasmids into daughter cells. It was also important that we use the same plasmid as our working prototype so that the findings from this experiment could be directly applied to our other data.
This construct is the same one used in the prototype (NSC) except with the Gal1,10 promoter replaced by a Cup1 promoter and CFP replaced by GFP; this experiment was a positive control to show the normal retention of our constructs with Cup1 promoters by cells.

Compared to other model organisms, yeast is underrepresented in the iGEM registries. As our biobrick contribution, we characterized the ADH1 promoter. We also characterized the promoters Gal1 and Cup1 as controls against which we could compare our experiments. A high copy number plasmid was used in this case (compared to the low copy Hsp104 plasmid) to maximize the promoter activity for quantification.
ADH1 is a eukaryotic promoter; the presence of ethanol induces it. Using this promoter, we can increase the production of a desired molecule in the yeast cell by adding a small amount of ethanol.

Gal1 is a positively regulated promoter found on the Hsp104 plasmid. Characterization was important for us to understand the transcription rates in a normal cell in order to see the metabolic load of expression of additional Hsp104.

From the gel it was seen that the BBa_K194003 had been inserted correctly into pRS416. Now this was used to demonstrate that biobrick BBa_K194002 was functional. This was done by opening the USER cassette in BBa_K194003 with PacI and Nt.BbvCI, purifying the backbone from gel and adding two PCR fragments:
1. The constitutive TEF promoter (400bp) using the primers BGHA200/370

Collaborations with Other iGEM Teams
We collaborated  with two iGEM teams, National Yang Ming University (NYMU) and American School in Japan (ASIJ).  We mentored the ASIJ-Tokyo high school iGEM team, which is a new High school iGEM team this year. We taught them how to start and structure a new team, what lab and online resources to use for experiments, and how to set up a lab notebook. In return, they helped us test our nanoparticle calculator by running simulations from the standpoint of a patient, doctor, and manufacturer.
We also continued our long standing partnership with National Yang Ming University (NYMU_Taipei). Three students from our team have been interning on the NYMU-Taipei team (they are members to both teams) to learn about synthetic biology and some basic lab techniques.  Two of these students will be presenting for the NYMU_Taipei team presentation. NYMU-Taipei also hosted a summer camp for our team members, where they taught us about different aspects of iGEM. In return, we helped them increase the efficiency of their model using equations from their literature research and ran simulations using their experimental data. Finally, they also gave tremendous advice on troubleshooting our cloning procedure during the summer months when we ran the majority of our wet lab experiments. We really value the relationship we have with NYMU and look forward to more collaborations in the future.
These collaborations not only created opportunities for us to help each other with problems, but also allowed us to exchange ideas and stimulate creativity. It is also fun to share stories about lab work, successes, and even failures.

PCR for the BioBrick BBa_K549009 containing luxCD was made using the Phusion polymerase, the primers luxCENX_fwd and luxDS_rev. The backbone was the plasmid pBBR1-MSC-lux. The annealing temperature for the 2,4 kb fragment was set at 50°C. This PCR did not work out under these conditions. With changing the annealing temperature to 55°C the PCR finally worked as expected.
We also did the PCR for BBa_K549010 . This BioBrick is the second part for the BioBrick BBa_K549011 together with BBa_K549009. The conditions for the PCR with the Phusion polymerase were 50°C for the annealing temperature, the primers luxEENX_fwd and luxESNP_rev and the backbone pBBR1-MSC-lux. The expected length of the fragment is 1,1 kb. The PCR did not work. For the next PCR we reduced the annealing temperature to 42°C which worked out as wanted.
Week 3
For PnorB we tried a gradient PCR from 40-65°C. The annealing temperatur that was best fitting was 42°C. The PCR was done using the Phusion polymerase. Temolate was the gDNA of N. meningitidis, primers PnorB_fwd and PnorB_rev.

For the BBa_K549011 we did a colony PCR for checking if the construct was correct. Conditions were an annealing temperature of 50°C, the Phusion polymerase and the primers were the ones for the BioBricks (BB_fwd and BB-rev).
Week 4

As the PCR for the BioBrick BBa_K549012 never worked, we tried another BioBrick (BBa_J33206) also containing arsR. This time the arsR was provided by B. subtilis instead of E. coli. We did a gradient PCR reaching form 42°C to 67°C using the Phusion polymerase. Another attempt was a gradient PCR"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of"

Conclusion
If this proposal was successfully implemented Lethbridge would not only look more vibrant, but this proposal would also help a species that humans cannot live without. An increase in pollinators would also be beneficial for the area in general as bees would pollinate all of the vegetation that would need to be pollinated. The cost of the proposal is also relatively inexpensive as only new subdivisions with boulevards would have this seed mix spread along them.
Radio Interview
A local radio station named CJOC interviewed one of our members, Dinula De Silva, about our project after our presentation to City Council. They asked us questions about urban beekeeping in Lethbridge and why it would be beneficial to our community. Also, they asked about urban beekeeping in larger cities such as Calgary and Edmonton, and its success. We also gave them information about what iGEM is and the Jamboree in Boston.
Outreach
School Presentations
Student asking question during our presentation
We presented to Grade 8. students at G.S. Lakie Middle School and Wilson Middle School in order to expand their interest in synthetic biology and iGEM. We started with a basic introduction to DNA and synthetic biology. This included an engaging experiment in which student volunteers assisted in the extraction of DNA from a banana. We also presented the biofilm and bee issues that we are tackling this year. The students were very interested in the presentations, and asked many questions. Some were even wondering how they could join the iGEM team. Overall, our presentation left a positive mark on the students.

Human Practice,""the C project""
Although we do software, we also keep eyes on promotion of synthetic biology and sharing our own program. Therefore, we started a long term human practice, “the C project”, since this summer.“the C project”, as we call, consists of three parts: Curriculum, Communication and Community.
Curriculum
As a IGEM team, we try to let people as many as possible to know what synthetic biology is. Therefore, advisors of our team, Haiyan Liu and Jiong Hong, have established a set of synthesis biology curriculum this summer. We have done many works related to human practice on the curriculum.
Jiong Hong(in the right picture), advisor of our team, gave lectures introducing safety and ethnics issues of synthetic biology.
Luojun Wang(in the head picture), members of our team, gave lectures promoting iGAME.
A survey* on how students know about synthetic biology and their interests for tutor game was made.(*the survey statistics comes from a sample of 240 students. Numbers of undergraduates, masters and PhDs are 160, 60 and 20)
Analysis of the results of the survey The first chart shows students' favorite game types for iGAME, and the second chart shows their knowledge of IGEM project.
The Circos Map
We tried many methods to plot our survey more straightforwardly and clearly before we finally chose Circos mkweb.bcgsc.ca/circos . Circos is biological software used to plot genome elements and relationship. Here, we innovatively used Circos to demonstrate our survey.(as in the right picture) Circos is somehow like pie chart yet it can present multi information as all the statistics are proportional and clear on the graph.
In the graph, there are three circles. The inner circle stands for their knowledge of synthetic biology, and middle circle stands for their interests of iGame. Deeper the color is, the more they know of synthetic biology or the more they are interested in iGame. For example, light pink means they know little about synthetic biology and deep green means they are very interested of the coming tutor games. The outer circle, however, stands for their major"

Leave current and bandwidth at default settings (I Range=Auto, Bandwidth= 5-medium).  Note: Save these setting because they will be used for every reactor over all experiments.
Running the bioreactors
Place bioreactors on a low profile magnetic stirrer (VWR, Part No: 10153-690),  careful to position stir bar to avoid damaging hardware.
Connect to potentiostat by attaching white wire (REF 2) to reference electrode, attach blue wire (REF 3) to counter electrode and attach red wire (REF 1) to carbon felt electrode.
Inspect the units for anything out of place or for bubbles in the counter electrode  housing. This will cause errors in potentiostat readings.
Turn on the stir plate and ensure the stir bars are stable. Run the reactors without  bacteria for at least 2 hours to obtain baseline values.
Inoculate with bacteria, dilute to an OD 600 of 0.01 () in a final volume of 140 mL. Note: C i , V i refer to initial concentration and initial volume, respectively. C f , V f refer to final concentration and final volume respectively.
Bacterial strains grown in the reactors include: ΔmtrB (negative control), ΔmtrB  prL814 (positive control) and ΔmtrB prL814-mtrB.
Allow growth in the bioreactor overnight. Use a syringe to remove 2 mL for sampling  to measure OD 600 and GFP fluorescence.
Induce with 200 µM concentration of 0.1M IPTG once current begins to decrease. Note: The 200 µM was determined to be optimal concentration based on previous preliminary experiments.

Disconnect all leads from potentiostat.
Soak all parts in a diluted bleach solution for 30 minutes, wash with soap, and rinse  with dH2O.  Note: When removing glass reference housing from stopper use soap to avoid breaking housing.

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Modeling#Hybrid_-_-_TEXT.html,", which means that the cells stop                         interacting. Also, as two cells move closer together, they hit a wall where the                         potential energy curve abruptly goes to infinity. The reason for this is that                         two cells cannot occupy the same space and therefore smaller intercellular                         distances are not allowed. Implementing this theoretical potential is however       not possible because the displacement of bacteria is a stochastic process       and the bacteria could randomly jump beyond                         the potential wall, where the force is ill defined. Therefore, we’ve decided                         to define a piecewise quadratic potential (9),                         which results in a piecewise                         linear force that resembles Hooke’s law, but with three different “spring       constants” acting in different intervals of intercellular distances (10),       as illustrated in Figure 5. The force is defined with respect to       the unit vector pointing towards the other cell, meaning that a positive       force corresponds to an attractive force and vice-versa.

Our team consisted of a dedicated group of 11 high school students that worked over the course of a year and two summers at the Ellington Lab at UTAustin.
We, in fact, began working on our project in the summer of 2016. However, all team members with the exception of one were new members who had acquired their lab skills and knowledge through the mentorship of past club leaders during the spring of 2016. As a result, the project moved along slowly and due to difficulties in raising money and in finishing the project, we decided to postpone going to iGEM 2016 and instead chose to work over the course of the upcoming year to make it to iGEM 2017.
Even with the added year, working as high school students with hardly any prior experience was very difficult. A massive influx of team members with no knowledge on synthetic biology and lab work also led to unforeseen complications during the 2016 - 17 school year. While headway was made on the project, we did not reach several of our initial goals:
In our initial project design, we aspired to eventually test our constructs alongside one another. We did not have enough time to reach this stage in our project.
We also had aspirations to do a video series where team members interviewed patients afflicted with Parkinson’s as well as other individuals with ties to the disease, such as medical professionals, family members, and directors of Parkinson’s organizations. This was unable to take place, though, as we were unable to get in contact with a number of groups and individuals.
Our project would not have been possible without the support we received. Below we have listed all the individuals and organizations that helped us go to iGEM:
GENERAL SUPPORT
Special thanks to Dr. Andrew Ellington, our PI, who provided us with the space, materials, and ideas needed for our project in addition to his guidance and financial support.
Dr. Dennis Mishler, our team mentor, provided us with advice on iGEM.
We would not have gotten as far as we had without the daily guidance of Michelle Byrom, Arti Pothukuchy, and Simon Doelsnitz as well as the occasional, but incredibly helpful, pieces of advice given to us by other graduate students and"

This LPP-OmpA system has been used to display a diverse group of proteins, including Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)3, Organophosphorus Hydrolase (OPH)4, Cyclodextrin Glucanotransferase (CGTase)5,  Methyl Parathion Hydrolase (MPH)6, and Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP)6.  Thus, an appropriate display construct for our system would be a Lpp-OmpA-streptavidin fusion protein, which would be anchored in the outer membrane and display streptavidin on the surface of the cell. Streptavidin would bind the nanotag on our target protein in an interaction that could be disrupted by adding biotin.
Harvard 2006 Surface Display System: Legacy Parts
When we checked the Parts Registry to see if someone had already built this or sometime similar that we could use as a starting part for our Idealized Protein Purification Display System, we found the Lpp-OmpA-streptavidin construct submitted by the 2006 Harvard iGEM team7.  In fact, Harvard had submitted four biobrick parts which were variations of the same function.  All four are fusion proteins which have a LPP signal peptide, either one or five trans-membrane ompA, and either monomeric or a single-chain dimeric streptavidin. All the variations and the resulting biobricks are shown below.

Harvard 2006 Surface Display System: Documented Data
Data regarding the activity of the Harvard iGEM 2006 Lpp-OmpA-Streptavidin construct has been published in IET Synthetic Biology in 20077.  The author showed, by Western blot against the His tag fused to this construct, that their protein was being expressed within the cell.  In order to demonstrate binding of their cell-surface-anchored streptavidin to biotin, the author incubated cells expressing Lpp-OmpA-streptavidin with an aptamer that linked biotin to"
