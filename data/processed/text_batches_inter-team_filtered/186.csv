There and Back Again
an iGEM team's tale by Aalto-Helsinki
In March, we had 9 students who were excited about a new field of science that was hardly known in Finland. No experience, some studies, but a lot of excitement.
In October, we had developed a genetically engineered machine from scratch, made a mathematical model and a simulation based on it, ran our own research lab for five months, designed web applications to make research easier, built a pitch explaining synthetic biology to the general public, figured out a new way to do business and built a massive wiki documenting all of this. How did that happen? Check it out here.
Our priorities during the summer were:
Have Fun
Learn New Things
Work Hard
Make Something New
We worked at least 8 hours a day from the middle of May until the end of August in Aalto University's science campus in Otaniemi. There was a huge learning hub/living room in the building adjacent to our lab, so we made it our HQ during the summer. Then we kept on working as much as possible in the autumn while continuing our studies. Some managed to pull off the same hours as before while still keeping up with their studies!
It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to.

Safety
General Safety Matters
All of our team members who worked in the lab have had safety training as a part of their studies. The training covered the following topics:
Personal protective wear: safety goggles, lab coats and gloves
General safety: acting in case of an accident, where to find emergency showers and fire extinguishers, understanding safety labels
Chemical safety: working with different chemicals and how to dispose of them
GMO safety: putting all waste that has been in contact with bacteria (living or dead) to bacterial waste, aseptic working methods
In our iGEM work we have only worked with non-toxic E. coli"

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#HumanPractices#OutreachCollaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

Team_Parts
To help the judges evaluate your parts, please identify 3 of your parts that you feel are best documented and are of the highest quality.
Best new BioBrick part (natural)
BBa_K911003
Best new BioBrick part (engineered)
BBa_K911004
Best improved part(s): None
List any other parts you would like the judges to examine: BBa_K911001 , BBa_K911009 , BBa_K911008
Please explain briefly why the judges should examine these other parts:
Magnesium Sensitive Riboswitch BBa_K911001
As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.
Fluorescent ratiometric construct for standardizing promoter output BBa_K911009
Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide"

Speed-taboodunit is a mashup of speed-dating, taboo, and whodunit; the idea is that each person writes on a piece of paper something unusual about themselves, underlining the key words, then these pieces of paper are randomly redistributed. Everyone organizes in a speed-dating format, with two lines of people, and you have a minute to talk to them and try to find out if they're the person described on their piece of paper-- with the catch that they can't use any of the underlined words. People who successfully find their person leave the group, but otherwise after the minute everyone moves down the line. As for why we came up with this specific icebreaker, we wanted to hit two key requirements of icebreakers: they have to be fun, and they have to make specific accommodations for being shy or quiet. Because each person has the specific objective of finding their person, this helps them overcome the shyness, and as for the fun, everyone loves taboo!
We had our first full team meeting today with all the new members, introducing them to the iGEM competition, and did an icebreaker we call speed-taboodunit! For the next week, they have the assignment of analyzing a previous iGEM project (in groups), and explaining what the project was trying to accomplish, whether synthetic biology was a good approach for this, and reasons for their success or lack thereof.

AQA_Unesp,2017,Team:AQA Unesp#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," treatments for diabetics, that will improve the quality of their lives.
An interesting conclusion of the graph below can be considered, showing that most people are willing to use genetically modified medicines. In this way, our technology could be well accepted by community of diabetic people.
Conclusions
Public data shows that type 1 diabetes is an emerging public health problem in Brazil. With this survey we could reach people and hear their opinion about the current treatment and how they are supported by the public healthcare in our country. We were able to see that the government doesn't always fulfill all the pacient's needs and there is a lack of information about the disease, how treat it correctly and live well. We decided to go further in this subject: we wanted people to know the disease and how to handle it correctly to have a better life. We noticed that when people are diagnosed, they don't have much information about how their life is going to change completely but still can be a normal and healthy life, mainly for children and their parents. In order to help these people, we put our efforts in collecting and spreading informations about it. To see how our team did that, please see our Integrated Human Practices page .
type 1 diabetes around the world
To get information about the distribution and treatment of type 1 diabetes in other countries and cultures, we asked for the collaboration of other teams to raise data on this. With this we obtained:
In Estonia: 70,000 cases of diabetes, being that 7,000 are related to type 1 diabetes. The frequency of cases is around 10 to 11 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Most treatments (fast acting and intermediate insulin), lancets and glucose meter used to control blood glucose and monitor the efficiency of treatment are paid at up to 90% of their value by health insurance plan.
In Australia: About 3.61 million australians have diabetes or pre-diabetes, 10-15% of which are for type 1 diabetes. It is the sixth leading cause of death in Australia. About 6.5 billion dollars a year are spent on diabetes treatments. There is a free app to follow meals, publications and news on the subject.
In the United Kingdom: There are about 3.8 million people with diabetes, of whom 370,000 are related to type 1 diabetes. It spends about 10 billion pounds is spent a year on treating diabetes. Insulin is provided by the NHS member body, the Oxfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group, the organization responsible for purchasing and supervising health services for more than 700,000 people"

Japan-Taiwan Meetup and collaborative analysis on current detection methods
Collaboration Team: NYMU-Taipei
Their topic for this year is to create an easy, time-saving, and affordable screening model in order to determine the effectiveness of hair loss treatments.
Our project also involves detection techniques used by NYMU this year. While NYMU and us use the techniques to build quite different things, we have the common goal of eliminating the use of ELISA in the domain of interest for that ELISA is a detection technique too expensive to be widely applied.
Both of our teams have common in finding another countermeasure rather than using ELISA. We both wish the best for our projects’ successes in iGEM competition. But most of all, we hope our ideas have global impact and improve our lives in our future.

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!
Best Basic Part Special Prize
To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.
Please note: Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize."

Tsinghua,2018,Team:Tsinghua-A#Background_-_-_TEXT.html,"ulocytes and mast cells. F: The presence of the allergens induces the crosslink of FcεRI receptors, leads to the release of mediators.
    These IgEs circulate around with the serum, a fraction of IgEs will bind to the α chain of so called high affinity receptor FcεRI with its constant region in its heavy chain. FcεRI is expressed in the plasma membrane of basophil granulocyte in the blood, and its tissue-embedded counterpart, mast cell. The rest of IgEs remain solutes in the serum. Basophil granulocyte and mast cell both contain pre-synthesized mediator components, like histamine, neutrophil chemotactic factor, platelet activating factor, etc, storing in the vesicles inside the cell.
    When this guy encounters the same allergen the second time, IgEs in the surface of his/her basophil granulocytes and mast cells may be pulled together by the allergen, since the variable regions of different IgEs target on the same allergen bind to different epitopes of the allergens. The aggregation of IgE results in the aggregation of FcεRI, which subsequently triggers intracellular signal transduction, finally leads to calcium influx, then the vesicles in the cell fuse with plasma membrane, and the mediators are released. The mediators directly induce allergy symptoms. For example, histamine released from basophil granulocytes will bind to vascular endothelial cell nearby, mediating contraction of endothelial cell, inducing increase in vascular permeability and blood flow, and local swelling.
    Currently, the most commonly used allergen test methods can be roughly divided into two classes. Some methods, like skin prick test, intradermal test and patch test, belongs to the first class. People’s skin is directly exposed to a variety of common allergens. The tester observes whether there are signs of hypersensitive response. In other methods, blood sample from individuals to be tested are collected, and immunological technologies like ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, see figure 2) and RAST (radioallergosorbent test) are utilized to determine the concentration of IgE target on specific allergen.

Taking it to the market
Barchitecture is a 3D printing technology that uses light to guide cell adhesion between bacterial cells into 3D structures. Light also controls the production of biomaterials, enabling a final solid structure to be produced from cells. The end goal for our technology is to be a cheaper, more sustainable and eco-friendly alternative for construction/architecture and to demonstrate the usefulness of biological light switches in approaching challenges such as forming structures on Mars, quickly building temporary shelters, printing biocompatible medical implants and achieving ‘living buildings’.
Barchitecture works similarly to stereolithography, with cells acting as the prime material. Our design involves two suspended colonies of E. coli cells that, upon light exposure, will form a strong covalent bond between the two binding partners (SpyTag or SpyCatcher) displayed on the surface membrane. With light, we can control in a spatiotemporal manner cell adhesion, allowing for the formation of a 3D structure. For biopolymer production, light can also induce the accumulation of PHB granules inside the cells and their secretion. Once secreted, the granules bind the cell surface and are cross-linked into a solid shape by a photoinitiator.
To achieve such technology, we focused on the first steps: designing and testing a cell adhesion system that can be activated with light. We encourage future iGEM teams to look into optimizing the current designs and approaches to PHB production, secretion, binding and cross-linking.

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2016,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," to NIH system. Since mammalian cells are very sensitive, they will not survive in case of accidental release. All the experiments related to cells are executed in biosafety cabinets and clean bench (Fig. 3). The cell culture and storage process are completed in sealed, UV periodically-disinfected cell rooms with strict control on personnel entering and leaving. The discarded cells are all killed by antiseptics and uniformly discarded. The safety measures we use (ethanol disinfection, UV disinfection, special lab-gown cleaning and sterilization of materials for experiments) are all satisfied with the policies on biological research projects of all the labs in SUSTech.
We used Lipo3000 ( ThermoFisher Lipofectamine®3000) to transfect the Endotoxin-free plasmids into the cells, which is proved to be harmless to human and environment [1] . We use the protocol as on the products specification and all transfections are completed in clean bench, which minimizes the possibility of contamination.
Fig. 2. The clean bench for cell experiments specially The bench is located in cell culture room, which requires thorough clean and disinfection before entering. The whole culture room is disinfected by UV light every night automatically. The individual bench has good ventilation and can be irradiated by UV every time before or after experiments.
Safe Lab Work
All lab work and experiments were done according to laboratory safety policies at Southern University of Science and Technology. The lab team was trained and escorted by lab members and instructors of Prof. Huang lab for the entire time of our work to ensure thesafety and health of team members and lab workers alike.
Since not all team members had experience in genetic engineering lab before, all of our team members have passed lab safety exam in our school. Also, all lab work was done under the supervision of research assistants in lab.
There are three things which are most important during our experiment:
Personal safety: all working in the lab was done with gloves, long pants, shoes and lab coats that are able to cover the surfaces of our body. No drinking or eating is allowed around the lab (Fig. 3).
Keeping our benches clean and organized: working benches were cleaned and disinfected with ethanol each time before and after using. Wastes were separated to biologic wastes and regular wastes and uniformly handled by Biology Department through special companies.
Notebook recording: all the experiment should be recorded in the notebook during the period.

Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:

Cambridge,2008,Team:Cambridge#Improved GFP_-_-_TEXT.html," one of the GFP constructs (see table above) on pSB1A2 were diluted 1:10 into fresh LB with 100ug/ml ampicillin and grown in a 96-well plate at 37°C with shaking for 2 hours before induction with varying concentrations of L-arabinose. Fluorescence was measured throughout the duration of the experiment in 3minute intervals on a BMG FluoStar fluorescence plate reader with 485nm excitation, 520nm emission filters.
In vitro folding and spectral analysis
6-his tagged GFP variants were purified using hybrid purification conditions in the ProBond purification system (Invitrogen). Peak elution fractions were identified by analysis on 12% SDS PAGE. For folding analysis purified GFP variants were diluted 1:10 into TNG buffer (25mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.2M NaCl, 5% v/v glycerol) with 6.8M guanidine hydrochloride and heated to 95°C for 5 minutes. Following this denaturation step, samples were dispensed into a 96 well plate and a single reading of GFP fluorescence intensity was taken from each sample. Samples were then diluted 1:10 into fresh TNG buffer containing no guanidine hydrochloride and fluorescence recovery was measured in 15 second intervals immediately after dilution.   Purified samples diluted 1:10 into TNG without guanidine hydrochloride for the baseline read and again 1:10 into fresh TNG for further readings served as positive (native, non-denatured) controls while samples denatured as described above and diluted 1:10 into TNG with 6.8M guanidine hydrochloride were negative (fully unfolded) controls.

Waterloo,2014,Team:Waterloo#Math Book#Conjugation_-_-_TEXT.html," scale results for the ABM (population size of < 100 000 bacteria) seem to correspond well to the PDE results.
Once we fully validate the results from the PDE model, we can begin to answer interesting design questions. The core question we hope to answer is: “After introducing our modified donor cells into a localized MRSA infection, when is the best time to introduce antibiotics?”
It’s a tricky question to answer, because once we apply antibiotic all the donors (which contain the silencing plasmid) will die, requiring the application of fresh donors. If we get to that stage in the modelling, we plan to use techniques from Optimal Control Theory to find the treatment plan that minimizes the amount of time needed to eliminate the MRSA infection, thereby minimizing negative health effects for the patient.

Cas13a in vesicles
Now that we were thinking about using Cas13a in combination with paper microfluidics, we wanted a method to make it easier for us to dry the protein on the paper. Additionally, we wanted to do this in such a way that the final product would be cell-free. Inspiration for the solution came from other iGEM teams, who had previously tried to produce vesicles and transport green fluorescent protein in these vesicles. Vesiculation would indeed be a solution to our problem, so it was added as an integral part of our project.

Importance of stakeholder mapping
Changes
Validating project with stakeholders
Towards a value sensitive design
Summary
We started this course by mapping all factors relevant for our design. We included every possible factor that could in some way be influenced by our technology. The next step was to identify the most important stakeholders and their values. We came up with many values, some were colliding. During this course we had to analyse potential stakeholders and we came up with a value sensitive design. However, we found out that we still had a broad range of stakeholders, leading to many values that had to be integrated. After this course, we really started steering our project towards a more relevant application. We decided that we needed to narrow our scope in order to integrate values into our design. We interacted with many more stakeholders and set up a new value sensitive design. This course was good practice and a good starting point after which the real stakeholder interactions began.

Testing of the Spectrometer
The only available resin was white. However, this problem can be solved by printing the spectrophotometer in black resin. The effect of white resin was mitigated during testing by covering the spectrophotometer in black putty.
Figure 2: A “loaded” spectrophotometer with an optical filter and a cuvette (left). The spectrophotometer with the bottom side covered in black putty (right).
The spectrophotometer was tested both without an optical filter and with one. The raw pictures are shown in figures 3a-3d.
Figure 3: from left to right is shown the raw output of the spectrophotometer without the filter at 25% amilCP dilution (1); the raw output of the spectrophotometer without the filter at 75% amilCP dilution (2); the raw output of the spectrophotometer with the filter at 25% amilCP dilution (3); and the raw output of the spectrophotometer with the filter at 25% amilCP dilution (4).
Figures 3a-d show raw pictures that are captured by the phone’s camera. It is possible, with software and post processing, to only focus on the centre of the images. This creates a more uniform environment, especially as the ray of light is relatively directed because the “tunnel” for the flash is so precise.
Figures 3a-b show that there is quite a difference between the raw pictures despite not including an optical filter. We have further tested the spectrophotometer and can detect differences between concentrations of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. Figures 3c-d demonstrate that the higher the concentration of amilCP the more is absorbed by the sample.
It is evident that there is a difference, even to the naked eye, in the dilution of amilCP from figures 3a-d. This is however subject to change, especially if the app is to be expanded in the future by including more snakes.
When the dilution is close to 15% it is barely visible to the naked eye, especially in poor conditions. This is even more useful if our approach is to be expanded to more snakes. It is possible that some substrates will result in a lower amount of amilCP, thus making a more quantifiable approach beneficial, adding to the necessity of the spectrophotometer.

Lemon Appearance And Ripening
Introduction
As everyone knows, lemon is a fruit that can display a yellow color when it is ripe and a green color when it is not. Firstly, we chose to use chromoproteins to express these colors in E. coli. Chromoproteins are reflective proteins that contain a pigmented prosthetic group (for example, iron for the haemoglobin) and do not need to be excited to be seen. Although several chromoproteins have been synthesized in the past years, there is no known green chromoprotein yet synthesized in iGEM. We aim to resolve this by fusing a yellow chromoprotein with a blue one that hopefully will display a green color. This construction will be referred as the"

Thus, our goal in performing knockouts is to take advantage of flux redistributions, directing metabolic flux through pathways which produce more of the metabolites we desire.  Optimally, we aim to couple metabolite production with biomass -- that is, in order to grow at all, the cell will need to produce more of the specified metabolite.
Nitrogen fixing E. coli is already ATP-limited (the cell has already redistributed flux as much as it can to produce the most ATP).  Therefore, we focused most on looking for knockouts that couple reduced flavodoxin production to biomass.

By knocking out every gene in our model (there are 1367), as well as performing all non-essential double gene knockouts (a total of 1,236,544 possible combinations), we can comprehensively assess the effect any single or double gene knockout has on intracellular biomass, ATP, and flavodoxin production. Unfortunately, while we did discover knockouts where maximum flavodoxin increased due to compromised biomass, we did not find any instances of coupling between flavodoxin and biomass.
Our Python workflow for assessing single gene knockouts can be found below
Create a list of all genes, constructed from the provided GPRs in the genome scale model.
Create lists of reactions that will be deleted for each gene knockout. This is done by evaluating each reaction GPR for each gene. If a gene is essential to a given GPR, the reaction is added to the list of reactions which will be deleted for that knockout.
Given a list of deleted reactions for each gene, FBA is run iteratively for each gene knockout. Running FBA will determine maximum biomass, max and min ATP values, and max and min flavodoxin values.
The FBA results are collected and outputted for further analysis.

We need the vectors for the yeast-two hybrid system, and the strains of yeast they used. We are particularly looking for the strains that have the UAS driven reporter if you have them.
Yeast two hybrid system
Strain missing Gal4 and Gal80. Gal4 has DNA binding domain and activation domain. Binds to several promoters, one is pGAL1. There is also a GAL2 and GAL4. The strain usually has these two deletions, and those are redulated under galactorse, truned on by it. In the absence of galalctose it is blocked by Gal80. Usually in one of the GAL promoters you have GAL4 deleted and GAL80 deleted. You usually have a reporter, and you can measure by adding OMPG or whatever substrate. The strains come in two mating types, A or alpha. They are haplopd, when opposite mating types meet they fuse.
PRS303—0 means it integrates. You put in your gene of interest and you cut this plasmid in the selectable marker and linearize the plasmid and it integrates into the yeast genome and there is enough homology so youhave a good copy of the leucine gene.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," cadmium is immobilised in spores which are unable to germinate, the toxic metal should no longer provide a hazard to the environment. Even if consumed, germination-deficient spores will pass unchanged through the human alimentary canal. However, there may be a small risk from cadmium bound to the surface of the spore, which may leach from metallathionin-cotC fusion. Implementation of the project would require a period of time in which this leaching process could occur before the public was exposed to the spores.
Environmental Safety
Although B. subtilis is non-pathogenic, the release of genetically engineered organisms into the environment has been a contentious issue since the 1970s. There are numerous reviews which discuss the issues relating to the safety of introducing genetically engineered organisms into systems such as soil. One of our intructors (Anil Wipat) studied issues relating to the release of genetically engineered microorganisms into the soil as part of his PhD [1]. Many systems have been proposed to try to ensure the safety of GM organisms in the environment. For example, engineered systems can be introduced in suicide vectors which fail to maintain outside a contained area, thus preventing the spread of the genetically engineered sequence. Such measures could be employed by our project to enhance the safety of cadmium-sequestering strains to be released into contaminated sites.
2. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
There is an active biosafety committee within the Institute of Cell and Molecular Biosciences. Our lab was reviewed during the period in which we were working on the project.
3. What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
The local safety officer came to visit us, and did not see any problems with the project. She emphasized the need for good microbiological practice and lab cleanliness. We are required, amongst other things, to use lab coats at all times, and follow the ""Michael Jackson Rule"": when carrying gels through the corridors from the lab to the imager, wear only one glove, keeping the other hand uncontaminated to open doors, etc. Sadly, we were unable to use cadmium to test our system.
4. Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
We can see no issues with any of the bricks.
If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry?

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ).

INSA-Lyon,2016,Team:INSA-Lyon#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," a different point of view. Most French laboratories do not take design into account, although it could be a very useful tool to communicate and come up with new solutions. The work of Neri Oxman from MIT and Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg from Cambridge was a great source of inspiration to understand how design and synthetic biology could be integrated together in a project. iGEM is a very unique opportunity to make applied design.
How did our self-test model come to life?
First, we made a list of all the technical specifications we wanted for our device to become a functional prototype. Two formal hypothesis emerged from this work. A lot of sketches were made to explore both options. Then, the whole team voted to choose the best option. The circular design seemed to be better suited for the end-user, so we kept it as the final design. A 3D-printed model was made and evolved progressively with the team’s remarks.
The very first sketches we drew. The two main shape ideas we explored were defined at this moment.
What was the method to work on design?
To begin with, a lot of work needed to be done to analyze what had already been done by others. This phase was useful to find inspiration and avoid making something that already existed. Although this phase can take quite some time, we were able to figure out something rather quickly, thanks to the very precise technical specifications we had laid down in the beginning.                               The second phase consisted of making lots of sketches. It was the most important part of the work. Numerous ideas were put on paper, they evolved little by little, until a good idea emerged. It was a very interesting part, because we could see the evolution of the ideas.                               Then sketches were vectorized to produce more formal designs.
These designs were discussed to choose the best ones. Once the choice was made, we went on with 3D-printing prototypes. This phase was tricky and we had to adjust the design a lot, because the 3D visualization allowed us to see what was working and what was not… So details were corrected, the functionality of the device was improved and changed. We used a lot of 3D printing to be able to get our hands on the device and see what needed to be modified.  So this was really a collaborative work.
How to design something intuitive and user-friendly?
A good product is intuitive and easy to use. But designing something simple is far from being easy. If the device is intuitive enough people should be able to use it without reading the instructions: it’s the main goal of each functional device.                                           For our project, the difficulty comes"

Science and Technology Week
Science and Technology Week is an on-campus annually celebration of science, technology, and engineering                     involving different colleges students in USTC conducting various science-based activities. This year,                     Science and Technology Week attracted over ten thousand citizens to USTC, varying from innocent pupils,                     high school students and college students in biology-related majors to the public from all walks who                     may have limited knowledge of Synthetic Biology. Our team cooperated with Team USTC and offered visitors                     a feast of biological knowledge.
We introduced elementary knowledge of genetics to citizens by poster presentation, then showed them some                     basic experiment operation, like liquid relief, centrifugation and etc. We used metaphors of LEGO and                     principle of programming to introduce the concept of biobricks and Synthetic Biology. What’s more, the                     game Foldit is used to give children a vivid model of protein. In addition, we distributed questionnaires                     to the visitors to get some feedback to improve the design idea of our software.

Science and Technology Exhibition
We held a Synthetic Biology exhibition in Hefei science museum, which is the largest off-campus science class.                     This exhibition attracts thousands of citizens including innocent pupils, high school students and their                     parents. And our team coordinated with team USTC and provide a flood of synthetic knowledge to the visitors.
We used metaphors of LEGO and principle of programming to introduce the concept of biobricks and Synthetic                     Biology. In addition, we invited teenagers to play Foldit (an online puzzle video game about protein                     folding) to give them a sense of computer-aided design. We also prepared several games so that they could                     learn knowledge while having fun.

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get

BHU_China is the first team that we had met. Both of us are new iGEM teams in 2016, so we only talked about our projects.
With SDSZ_China
Both of us are high school teams with Beijing, China. We have met each other for twice. The first time we have introduced each other’s project. At that time we did not register for the Giant Jamboree. It was SDSZ_China that remind us of the Giant Jamboree registration, hotel booking, flight tickets purchasing!

Talking with a team in university has really inspired us. Because we are still teenagers that have never worked in the lab before, whenever we failed our experiments, guides from the UCAS team members have helped us out from trouble and saved us tons of time. When we had just started our experiments, our electrophoresis graphs were terrible. Fortunately, team members from UCAS taught us some skills of analyzing potential causes that lead to an unfavorable result, which is not only useful for the competition but also critical for our further studies. We also had a problem with our protocols. Then the team members from UCAS enlightened us with altering several factors by designing control experiment groups. Without their help, we are not able to"

Some philosophers of aesthetics, defined art as ""sensitive knowledge"": an autonomous knowledge which is opposed to knowledge through concepts. In this case, art is not for art, it has no goals but is a means of knowledge, and is necessarily a role in men’s evolution; it goes beyond the individual. It belongs to no one and is not the object of desire: it is there for contemplation of a generation, and then transmitted to the next.

A single reindeer engraved was found when it seems that it was very consumed at the time. This art does not represent the time of the hunting scenes as one might imagine. Still, the frescoes are extremely realistic in terms of morphology and attitudes of animals. For many prehistorians, the cave is actually a sanctuary, a sort of religious monument. Other theories circulated on the significance of the frescoes compared with the celestial constellations, shamanic worship, magic destruction of these terrifying animals, etc. Anyway, these frescoes carry the message of men 18,000 years ago, and they show us how they lived and what they believed in. They carry a page of humanity. Is it not necessary to keep this message alive as long as possible?
Why use synthetic biology to save art? Indeed, others techniques exist at present to try to slow the progression of fungi in the Lascaux caves. As said before, the walls of the cave are partially and gradually covered with black and white fungi that hide the frescoes. Alongside more traditional methods currently used against these fungi, we decided to act with the most modern means from this emerging science that is synthetic biology, to contribute to the preservation of an ancient heritage and to ensure its transmission to future generations.
Let’s not forget that the Lascaux cave is not an usual work of art, not only by age but especially by the presence of life. In fact, the cave has a very complex ecosystem, diverse and constantly interacting. It contains its own microflora as well as other living beings like insects. The opening of the cave by humans causing an imbalance in the ecosystem, one would think it’s only coherent that men attempt to repair their mistakes. As biologists, we offer to solve this biological problem, in this fragile ecosystem, with"
IPN-UNAM-Mexico,2009,Team:IPN-UNAM-Mexico#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," proposed them to use a discrete version of what they were trying to do: the discrete Laplace operator, or well a partial differential equations system. Finally they chose to use a discrete version of Flick's law to solve this problem, with good results on their drylab.
The collaboration between our team and LCG-UNAM was a very good idea, since it made things a lot easier for both teams and made possible to achieve better results. But definitely the best part of it was the creativity of our mutual contributions, since our teams together cover a very broad range of fields and we could complement each other very well. Two teams thinking together is better than one working alone.

We picked another candidate colony from the ArgE plate because the PCR of the plasmid between VF2 and VR (standard biobrick sequencing primers) was only about 200 bp, while we were expecting about 1.2 kb. We got the same result from our potential MetA colony. We received new ligase, and if that doesn't work, we are going to try the gibson assembly method. Using a previous restriction digest, we attempted another ligation of our new potential biobricks.
The first set of chemically competent cells did not grow anything. The procedure was repeated and completed today. The cells were transformed with a known plasmid and appropriately plated.
Rafael gave us 4 new electroshock cuvettes to temporarily replace the ones that we had destroyed. Joe used 3 of them to test his knockout, and as of today, there is one candidate colony growing on a 1/4 antibiotic concentration plate. A battery of tests have yet to be run to confirm that it is a knockout.
Yesterday, we went to Dr. Ramey, who had taught students who made a successful knockout using the lambda red system. They used a different recombineering plasmid than we did, and we received this plasmid. It was, however, growing in a strain that we were unfamiliar with, and we decided to isolate the plasmid and transform our Epi300 cells with it.  It is currently growing in a culture at 30°.
We received only the TrpB gene from the registry, and successfully grew it on a plate. We are now growing a culture to isolate the plasmid and if Joe's knockout is indeed a knockout, we can characterize the existing biobrick part by complementation.
We ordered the Gibson assembly kit, and it ran upwards of 700 dollars for 50 reactions.
We made Tet, Kan, and Amp plates with 1/2 and 1/4 antibiotic concentration to try growing our knockouts. There was no growth from a resistance-less K12 cell on any of the plates tested.
Our PCR for the yddg and tyrA genes was unsuccessful.

There are many (hundreds) of colonies on Joe's recombineering plates, and the concentration of colonies goes up as the concentration of antibiotic goes down. It appears that the addition of arabinose to the culture did nothing to increase recombineering efficiency. There are several large, well defined colonies on the full"

Construction of Blue Light Sensing and Imaging System
Because of the complication of blue light circuit, work on this circuit began firstly. In the beginning, K592020, a blue light sensor output containing a FixK2 blue light sensing system and producing amilCP, was constucted.
The culture of bacteria went like this:
And this is the bands exhibition of K592020 and K592016, another blue light sensor and RR with RBS, after electrophoresis, were quite satisfying as we expected.
The electrophoresis result of other key parts in blue light sensing-imaging system including B0015, S04617 and K592024. The part I13502 which expresses mRFP was run with them.
Later, construction of the whole parts completed with validation of sequence verification.
Test of Blue Light Sensing and Imaging System
1. Test in solid media.
Without induced expression, bacteria containing blue light sensing-imaging system grew up and developed in the LB media. Then we divided the media into two regions, one of them received blue light simulation while the other one kept darkness by a base plate to block blue light. The testing conditions are showed in the following:
After 12-hours' development, the result showed the bacteria could produce blue chromoprotein when stimulated by blue light and kept its color in the darkness.
2. Test in liquid media.
The idea of control experiment is the same as that ain solid media. We prepared two test tubes containing equivalent bacterium solution. The test was conducted at 18:00, August 4th when one of them was put under blue light and the other was developed in the darkness.
At 11:00, August 5th, the tube stimulated under blue light turned light blue while the other one kept the original color.
After 24 hours, the blue bacteria showed evidently. Using centrifuge to get the bacteria showed extremely distinct blue chromoprotein expression based on blue light activation was come true.

We performed gel extraction for all the 9 parts, but we decided to repeat cutting/run/extraction process for BBa_B0030 (X-P) and BBa_J23100 (E-S) in the next days, to perform a more efficient extraction for these 2 parts.
We took 15 µl from BBa_B0030 and BBa_J23100 glycerol stocks and infected 9 ml LB + Amp for each part. We incubated the 9 ml cultures at 37°C overnight. (We already had at our disposal extracted plasmids for these 2 parts, but we performed plasmid extraction anyway to have more).
05/28/08
We performed plasmid digestion for these 4 parts (about 5.5 µg for BBa_C0062; the whole quantity for the others):
BBa_C0062 (X-P)
BBa_C0012 (X-P)
BBa_C0040 (X-P)
BBa_I15009 (X-P)
NOTES: to avoid smearing fragments during electrophoresis, we planned experiments in which only excided fragments of the same order of magnitude are ran in the same gel. So, we decided to run these four parts on May 28 (the smallest part is 660 bp and the largest one is 1128 bp). The remaining parts will be digested/gel extracted on May 29 (the smallest part is 39 bp and the largest one is 157 bp).
We loaded and ran a gel to separate these 4 excided fragments from the rest of their plasmid.
We performed gel extraction.
We expected to find the 9 ml culture for BBa_J23100 red, but it was not! So we performed miniprep only for BBa_B0030 9 ml culture, after taking 800 µl from 9 ml BBa_B0030 culture to prepare a new glycerol stock.
Unfortunately DNA pellet washing failed...Unlucky day for minipreps!
We took 15 µl again from BBa_B0030 and BBa_J23100 glycerol stocks and infected 9 ml LB + Amp for each part. We incubated the 9 ml cultures at 37°C overnight.

Heidelberg,2009,Team:Heidelberg#Eucaryopedia_-_-_TEXT.html," –gamma).  AP-2 proteins are activated through homo or heterodimerisation and bind to GC-rich motives in their target genes [24] . The genes both positively and negatively regulated by AP-2 are manifold.  These genes are mainly involved in developmental processes. Mutation of AP-2-beta can lead to the Char syndrome [25] . AP-2 transcription factors regulate also genes playing an important role in cell proliferation and apoptosis [24] . In this context AP-2alpha is thought to act in a tumor suppressive manner in breast tissues [24] .
CREB
CAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) is a transcription factor which binds to cAMP response elements (consensus sequence 5'- TGACGTCA -3' [26] ) occurring in many promoter sequences. CREB is activated by MAP kinase cascade but also through the cAMP signalling pathway. Homodimerisation leads finally to an activated complex and binding to DNA occurs via a leucine zipper domain (s. Picture).  Many genes are regulated by CREB including the neurotrophin Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, c-fos and some neuropeptides. CREB is thought to be involved in processes like long-term memory [27] and drug addiction [28] .  CREB plays also an important role in cell survival [29] .
NF-Y
Nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), also called core binding factor (CBF) is a transcription factor which binds to the consensus sequence CCAAT [31] occurring in about 25% of eukaryotic genes [30] . NF-Y is involved in the transcription regulation of several genes including HSP70, albumin, FGF-4, α-collagen, β-actin and several others [31] . NF-Y is a heterotrimeric complex and is evolutionary extremely conserved. It was also shown that NF-Y plays a major role in cellular senescence [30] .
Vitamin D receptor
Vitamin D receptor (VDR), also known as calcitriol receptor, is a transcription factor belonging to the family of steroid receptors and to the super family of nuclear receptors. The VDR has a very high affinity towards calcitriol (1α,25(OH)2-cholecalciferol) which is the prohormone of vitamin D3. Binding of calcitriol results in a heterodimerisation of VDR with retinoid-X receptor, the complex is transferred into the nucleus and binds to several promoters (vitamin D response elements) thereby"

Safety Questions
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of...
researcher safety?
The potential carcinogen and mutagen Ethidium Bromide was used during the process of gel electrophoresis. Standard lab safety protocols were followed when handling this substance, which includes wearing appropriate safety equipment as well as properly disposing or cleaning of contaminated material.
Because our project has potential bioremediation applications, we needed to deal with potentially harmful chemicals in our characterization process. A strong example would be the characterization our biobrick containing the enzyme haloalkane dehalogenase, which degrades 1,2-dichloroethane. Appropriate safety measures were taken when handling these substances, based on both the advice of our lab technicians and the MSDS.
We also ensured our safety through various education and preventative measures such as training for all lab members.
public safety?
While certain strains of E.Coli may be pathogenic and dangerous, the lab strains that we use are non-pathogenic and are therefore not hazardous to public safety. Even though this is the case, we work carefully and treat these organisms as if they were pathogenic, to ensure safety.
environmental safety?
As with public safety, we are working with E. coli strains that are non-pathogenic. Additionally, E. coli is a commonly found bacteria in the environment. Although our E. coli are cloned to have resistance to antibiotics for selection as well as our Biobrick parts, these do not present any evolutionary advantage over wild E. coli that are already suited for their environment. In fact, bacteria that are carrying antibiotic resistance will be disadvantaged when grown in a normal environment. Specifically, in our project, the incorporation of domains into bacterial flagella has been shown to hinder the ability of flagella to polymerize.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
Did you document these issues in the Registry?
Yes, the safety issues arising from each biobrick part has been noted in the registry; as we work more on each part  we will add additional security concerns as"

In Vitro Immune System
Diversity is an important feature of biological systems, and it can be harnessed to serve as a useful tool in synthetic biology.
Many organisms have molecular mechanisms to generate diversity at the DNA level in order to accelerate evolution. This is true in particular with host/pathogen interactions, where the host must mutate to protect itself from the pathogen and the pathogen mutates to evade host defenses. One important example of such diversity generating mechanisms is found in the Bordetella bacteriophage BPP-1. Bordetella is a genus of bacteria that can infect the mammalian respiratory tract, causing diseases such as pertussis (whooping cough). The infectious cycle of the Bordetella bacteria involves a switch between a non-infectious and an infectious stage with different virulence factors and surface receptors expressed. Interactions between bacteria surface receptors and phage tail fiber proteins are extremely specific. The tip of each virus tail-fiber is a protein called the major tropism determinant protein ( Mtd ), which binds to the hosts’ surface and allows the phage to infect it. In order to successfully infect both phases of the host bacteria, the BPP-1 phage uses a complex genetic mechanism to generate diversity at the host-recognition site of the Mtd protein.
Though the general structure of the Mtd protein is constant and very stable, its active ends are extremely variable. Each phage produces a slightly different structural variant of the protein, with the hope that at least one phage can successfully bind to the host and infect it - akin to the way our immune system produces numerous variants of antibodies so that at least one can bind to the antigen of interest.
Others have utilized phage display techniques in order to exploit the Mtd’s natural stability to generate enormously diverse protein libraries. These pursuits have been conducted in vivo, using the BPP-1 phage’s native diversity generation system (Overstreet). Our team hopes to develop a fully in vitro system using synthetic diversity generation techniques to express and select for Mtd variants of interest.
We plan on first generating a diverse DNA library of the mtd gene. Next, we plan on using mRNA-display as a means to detect and screen for the variants"

Jordyn Pieper
My name is Jordyn Pieper and I am currently a senior biology student at WLC and I hope to become a Physician Assistant. This year on iGEM I have been in charge of the Policy and Practices portion of the project. I enjoy working with other people and organizing huge events, such as our week-long Bioengineering Summer Camp and Biotechnology Info Night. This has been my second year on iGEM and I have enjoyed every minute of it! My team members are willing to help with any problems that I may come across and always give a helping hand. I also like to read and spend time with my family.
Elise Sloey
My name is Elise Sloey and as a junior biochemistry major I am still discovering what area of the field I want to specialize in. Genetics and bioengineering are exciting and interesting areas to me. I enjoy the laboratory side of things and have always been driven to ask ""why"".  I hope to continue on to graduate school, contributing to research in some way. For this year’s project, I have been working in the lab with our biobricks, testing our new parts against our team's from previous years. Outside of the lab I try to get lost in nature, hiking and bicycling.
Jack Bechtel
My name is Jack (John) Bechtel. As a sophomore Biochemistry and Marine Biology major at WLC, a large portion of my work with the team has been in policy and practices, community outreach, administration, and running the Bioengineering summer camp with some lab work when I was needed. In my spare time, I work with my numerous fresh and saltwater aquariums at home, randomly wander around fields looking for butterflies, and watch Olympic athletes on YouTube while eating potato chips.  In the future, I hope to attend grad school where I will pursue a PhD in Cellular Biology with a specialization in Marine Organisms.

181001DDW02    E0240 : 6.166 ng/µL
The concentrations measured after the PCR purification were as follows:
pSB1C3: 25.1 ng/µL
pSB1K3: 41.411 ng/µL
L1 was transformed and incubated at 37°C overnight.
ldhA characterisation 
The characterisation was not carried out, because ldhA was already verified on a SDS-gel. Andreas said, that activity tests would be too time consuming and susceptible to errors. Instead, we made an easy prove of the presence of the enzyme with the gel.

7. Ligation
DNA plasmid from restriction step will  paired each other in DNA Plasmid Backbones from iem. According to Wilson (2005)  The DNA products resulting from restriction digestion to form sticky ends may be joined to any other DNAfragments treated with the same restriction enzyme. Thus, when the two sets of fragments are mixed, base-pairing between sticky ends will result in the annealing together of fragments that were derived from different starting DNA. so these pairing are transient, owing by the weakness of hydrogen bonding between the few bases in the sticky end. to stabilised these fragment we using an ligation enzyme called T4 DNA ligase since ligation reconstructs the site of cleavage, recombinant molecules produced. By ligation of sticky ends can be cleaved again at the ‘joins’, using the same restriction enzyme that was used to generate the fragments initially.
8. 3A Assembly
We made assembly of DNA plasmid, we rearrange the sequences of DNA plasmid and assembling two BioBrick parts together.
9. Transformation
For early step of DNA manipulation, we insert the plasmid of competent cell that we already made before, the inserting process of current plasmid to the bacteria called transformation. we using plasmid  backbones pSB1C3 and  put in into Escherichia coli strain DH5α. The plasmid is much smaller than a natural plasmid, which makes it more resistant to damage by shearing, and increases the efficiency of uptake by bacteria (Wilson,2005)

Today, we made glycerol stocks of pC13AT and prepared them for sequencing. We then miniprepped pAK13AC. However, the miniprep qualities are poor so we will redo with a larger stock of cells. We ran a PCR of pAK13AC, pAK13BB, pAK13A (for both RBS + crtE and crtE). pAK13AC and pAK13BB worked but pAK13A failed. Thus, we retried PCR of pAK13A inserts from a fresh batch of minipreps. We prepared cultures of pC13S, pC13P, pC13Q, and pC13BG.
PtrpC with GFP will be sent in for sequencing. We ran PCR of pAK13AC, pAK13BB, pAK13A (for both rbs + crtE and crtE). pAK13AC and pAK13BB worked but pAK13A both failed. We ran PCR of pAK13AC, pAK13BB, pAK13A (for both rbs + crtE and crtE). pAK13AC and pAK13BB worked but both pAK13A failed.

With Team Peking and BNDS_China
At the beginning of the march, our team sent 3 members to attend synthetic biology lessons in Peking University. The class was mainly for postgraduates as well as undergraduates in Peking University. However, because of the generosity and kindness of their instructor Yihao Zhang and Professor Haoqian Zhang, we were able to have lessons with them, and hence gained precious experience.
At the beginning of July, Team Peking invited us to work on the interlab study together in their lab with BNDS_China. This gave us a chance to learn more about practical skills.
With Team Oxford
In September, one of our team members, Zeyu Fëanor, e-mailed team Oxford to ask help for modelling. Chun Ngai Au and Helen Ren, who are the dry lab coordinators of their team, wrote a document on how to create simple ODE(ordinary deferential equation) functions and sent to Fëanor. The explaination in the document was very clear and inspired Fëanor a lot.
With Team GZHS-United
Probit analysis is a specialized regression model of binomial response variables. Regression is a method of fitting a line to your data to compare the relationship of the response variable or dependent variable(Y) to the independent variable(X).By using IBM SPSS，We construct a model to help them find out KT50 of our project.
With Team SNSBNU_China and Tsinghua
In October, we helped team SHSBNU_China distribute their questionaires and finally received more 400 feedbacks. In return, they helped us carry out chemical transformation of B.subtilis compenent cell using protocols given by team Tsinghua."

iGEM Orientation (January 2015):
The team organised an orientation with the purpose of discussing the scope and future of synthetic biology in India and IIT Delhi as well as increasing awareness about iGEM . This event was attended by students from the undergraduate, graduate and doctoral levels, pursuing various disciplines including Computer Science engineering, Electrical engineering, Biological sciences among others.
Orientation for freshmen (July-August 2015):
iGEM Team IIT Delhi kept an orientation exclusively for the freshmen joining in the fall semester 2015. The session involved our team members introducing concepts of synthetic biology to the freshmen and to tell them about iGEM. This was essentially done to help the freshmen develop an interest in synthetic biology and hopefully carry on the iGEM Team IIT Delhi legacy forward.
Tryst (February-March 2015)
Tryst is the annual science and technology festival of the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. iGEM team IIT Delhi set up a stall, which was aimed at encouraging and promoting synthetic biology by using a myriad of ways to do this.
The team set up an on spot DNA extraction technique which allows any person to see the DNA extracted from their saliva or a fruit (banana and strawberry) with their naked eye. The team also displayed its iGEM project from the 2014"

Overview Experts Outreach GMO Consideration Survey Integration Enterprise Outreach Market Analysis  Conclusion
Overview
""Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work."" — Peter Carr, Director of Judging. What’s Human practice? It is not just a work  to confirm and strengthen what we think is right. Instead, we should learn to share our knowledge with the world. We can’t just instill our personal cognition into others, nor can we blindly believe in whatever others say. All in all, human practice is all about “gain, give and mutual interaction”.
First, we build up a system constructed by the three topics below: Project, Us and the World. What we found is that our activities can actually made up a comprehensive interaction (refer to the following picture beside) For example, we “gain” professional suggestions from experts in various fields, which have made us think of repositioning our project; To conduct educating, we “give” what we know to those who are laymen in synthetic biology and sugar controlling. Other examples of give and gain also includes marketing and sponsorships. It is also necessary that we set up mutual pathways for knowledges, which are also known as meetups, collaborations and cross-domain communications. Totaling up all of them, we’ve excellently completed human practice.
To achieve our goal, we consult experts in different areas of study

Nepthrologist
Taiwan has the reputation of “the kingdom of Hem dialysis”. Yes, this is apparently not a thing we should be proud of. A huge sum of money is spent on this problem every year. But, you probably don’t know that a huge ratio of these cases are caused by neither drug abuse nor consuming too much salty food. Instead, diabetes is what may leads to kidney diseases. So, we invited Dr. Wu from the division of nephrology to tell us about the negative effects of diabetes. 
 In the interview, he mentioned that due to hyperglycemia, HHNK and DKA, which may cause headache, nausea, or even drive people into coma, is often found in people with diabetes. Furthermore, hyperglycemia can also cause"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," management of the condition should be optimized in health-care providers prior to participation in the screening programme.
There should be a plan for managing and monitoring the screening programme and a set of quality.
Adequate staffing and facilities for testing, diagnosis, treatment and programme management should be available prior to the commencement of the screening programme
Clinical management of NSCLC is optimized by NICE. NICE would be in charge of creating management and monitoring plan for our test, were it to be used clinically. Our test would actually free up healthcare staff and facilities. Early detection would reduce the number of cancers diagnosed at later stages where the only option is palliative care, which is more expensive than earlier stage treatment.
This in turn would free up healthcare staff and facilities. [12]
Information about the test and its outcomes must be understood by the individual being screened.
Potential participants should be provided with evidence-based information on the purposes and potential consequences of the programme so they can make an informed choice.
Decisions about the screening interval and sensitivity of the process should be scientifically justifiable to the public
When the individual is being screened, information, similar to that on our wiki, could be presented to them. Evidence for the efficacy of screening could only be given once clinical trials have been carried out. The screening interval could also be optimized from these trials.
All other options for managing the condition with cost effective intervention should have been considered
This is not applicable to NSCLC - early detection is required to reduce mortality rates - when detected late, it can only be treated palliatively.
If people carrying a mutation are identified through screening, their natural history should be understood, which includes psychological implications.
If the test is for a mutation or a genetic variants, the method and means for findings to be kept under review, should be clearly set out

Education
After running a couple of workshops relating to synthetic biology, it was clear to us that genetic modification was seen as dangerous, or unsafe by most younger students. Bacteria were generally seen as risky to work with as many people did not realize there were non-pathogenic strains. Often synthetic biology jargon would cause people to turn off. This was not only the case with younger students, but with adults as well.
We therefore changed our approach to engagement - focusing on making our project more accessible and therefore more exciting. We came up with real world scenarios to pique interest in synthetic biology - from diagnosing disease to reducing the impacts of climate change. We emphasized the real world problems synthetic biology can solve rather than the theoretical biology.
We found a successful strategy was to pose questions, designed to help rect"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Software_-_-_TEXT.html,"ding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of"
Hong_Kong_HKUST,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#hp#interview#chan_-_-_TEXT.html," beta cells by decreasing the amount of free fatty acid and ultimately alleviating diabetes. She, however, acknowledged that in the long run, our project itself might not be enough to completely cure diabetes. This is because diabetes is a very complex disease that comes in different forms and is therefore very hard to cure. Professor Chan said that diabetes is a “vicious cycle” and to break this cycle different approaches such as healthy diet and insulin injection are also required. She mentioned that our project could be approached as an option to break the cycle.
We have also investigated the side effects that our project might cause. Prof. Chan specifically mentioned ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis occurs when high concentrations of ketone bodies are formed due to the increase of fatty acid oxidation. We have explained that our inducible promoter is activated at high levels of fatty acids but shuts down before too many fatty acids are oxidized to produce fatty acid deficiency and other side effects such as ketoacidosis. Prof. Chan also worried about the increase of oxidative species caused by the increase of fatty acid oxidation. She said that because fatty acid oxidation requires oxygen, increase of fatty acid oxidation might limit the availability of oxygen for other cells and cause incomplete respiration to ultimately produce reactive oxidative species. She mentioned that to reduce this kind of possible side effect, patients that make use of our product should do aerobic exercise to ensure enough oxygen is provided to the body.
In addition, we discussed the regulations on developing new treatments in medical fields. This allowed us to know more about the biosafety precautions taken in the field. It is known that technologists need to pass 4 phases of clinical research in order to bring their products to market. However, technologists are also responsible to revise and present their ideas to the public so that more people can understand the nature of the ongoing research work.
Conclusion
The interview with Professor Chan allowed us to recognize the limitations of our product in a medical context. The interview also gave us a holistic view on diabetes and brought to our attention obstacles we may need to overcome if we want to bring our work forward in applicability.

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!

WLC-Milwaukee,2018,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," use its water for recreation in and around Milwaukee Wisconsin.
This interview and tour helped us better analyze the possible applications of our kit and although our test kit would not be applicable to use in such large facilities, in smaller scale wastewater treatment operations (such as the Lodi Wisconsin Wastewater Treatment facility visited and examined by the 2017 WLC-Milwaukee iGEM Team) effluent is still tested for fecal coliform contamination using overnight plate culture methods and we believe our test kit could provide a faster method for contaminant testing.
Yet another interview we were able to perform was with Mr. Dylan Waldhuetter the North American Program Director of the Alliance for Water Stewardship. Mr. Waldhuetter provided excellent feedback on our project and efforts along with encouragement that our project was needed to fill a niche in the water testing industry. Mr. Waldhuetter indicated that he saw our kit as a system that could be used, as we had previously examined, on a smaller scale especially in rural areas and communities where recreational water is rarely tested, and well water is often simply assumed to be uncontaminated.  He also pointed out the our kit could be used in industry, but likely more as a preliminary test of effluent from processing plants or vegetable processing plants where E. coli contamination is a real concern. This insight aided our team in finding and confirming a niche for our product both as a small scale consumer test kit, but also as a preliminary system in industry applications.
Finally, during our testing of Horseradish peroxidase activity and possible substrates for our kit, we spoke with Dr. Robert Balza from the Biology department of our home institution regarding potential chromogenic subtrates. Dr. Balza indicated that he had used tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as a chromogenic substrate in a wide variety of applications including Western Blotting and ELISA tests and provided our team with a substantial sample of TMB that we then used in our substrate and color changing experiments. This donation of substrate and advice was vital to our experiments and initial prototype testing and we greatly appreciate Dr. Balza's investment of resources and input to our project.

Do the biological materials used in our lab work pose any of the following risks?
Every species we worked with belongs to BL1. They do no harm to human. Experimenters is careful not to release any parts to the public. And even the worst situation happens as it is released, it will hardly bring risks.
a)Risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab:
Yes. May cause irritation to skin, eyes, and respiratory tract, may affect kidneys. However, E.coli is not considered a human or animal pathogen nor is it toxicogenic. Any concerns for E.coli in terms of health considerations are mitigated by its poor ability to colonize the colon and establish infections.
b) Risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab):
The plasmids we designed cannot function outside certain cell lines in the laboratory, And the cell we used is very fragile and it will soon die leaving the culture medium. So it will not bring contamination to the environment.
c) Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries:

Tsinghua,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#fluid model#regulation of killing ability_-_-_TEXT.html," describe how killing effect of one warrior change as time.
1. Results under original parameter sets
    As stated above, RFP intensity is used to indicate the killing effect of the warrior. From this original parameter set and result, we can see that since the maximal expression rate of RFP of two warriors (Indicating the amount of LacI) have large difference, the maximal killing effects are different largely. In the real situation, this means that warrior I has higher amount of LacI and thus less CmR so it has less resistance to chloramphenicol and slower growth rate.
    The first step we can do to regulate maximal killing effect is to increase/decrease the maximal expression rate of warrior I/II. In the experiment, this can be achieved by changing the RBS after Prhl in warrior. For example, we can increase the maximal expression level of RFP inside warrior II to increase the killing ability of warrior I.
2. Increasing the maximal expression rate of RFP inside warrior II
    From this, Even the maximal expression intensity of AHL promoter of two warriors are the same, we will think warrior II still have much higher killing ability than that of warrior I. This is because its killing effect is high at the beginning and warrior I may be killed at a very fast speed at the beginning. Sometimes we may not only want to regulate their maximal killing effect, but also want to regulate their killing effect in real time. (You can imagine that in a war, warrior II accumulates strength at a very fast speed and kills warrior I immediately, though their maximal strength is the same. What you want to do here is actually equivalent to regulating their speed of accumulating strength.)
    Therefore, what could we do? Intuitively, we may think that if warrior II expresses less LuxI so that 3OC6HSL accumulates slower, the speed of accumulating strength is slower.These can both be demonstrated by our model.
3. Decreasing the expression rate of LuxI inside warrior II
    By doing this, we can regulate the accumulating strength speed of warrior successfully! In the experiment, this can be achieved by changing the constant promoter or RBS of LuxI in warrior II.
    In conclusion, the core is that we can regulate the maximal killing effect by regulating the amount of LacI (In this model, RFP)and the speed of accumulating strength by regulating amount of AHL-production enzyme inside cell. All these can be regulated by thechange the promoter/RBS of the protein or adding LVA tag after the protein experimentally.

For the point of $(u_0, v_0)$ to be unstable, it’s necessary that  $ (D_ug_v + D_vf_u)^2 - 4D_uD_v(f_ug_v - f_vg_u)> 0 \\     D_ug_v + D_vf_u > 0 $
This means that the larger the ratio of $D_u$ and $D_v$ is, the more the point considered is likely to be unstable.

We deemed the concentration of two different metabolites as being critical to our project: 3-Hydroxypropionate, the product itself, and malonyl-CoA, an important intermediate we also plan to overexpress.
Figure 1: Scheme of the working mechanism for the 3-HPA sensor
Using the information from the paper of Hanko et al. (2017), we settled for the hdpR / hdpH system coming from Pseudomonas putida KT2440. It consists the constitutively expressed HdpR protein (BBa_K2560304). , which is able to bind to the P HdpR and induce expression of a gene. In the native setting, that would be the hdpH gene, encoding for a 3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase which enables P. putida to grow on
3HPA
. We cloned our reporter gene in its position. This way we got a direct readout of the
3HPA
concentrations in the individual cells.
Because our model showed that the low activity of V. natriegens native
Acc
, malonyl-CoA is likely to be a limiting factor in
3HPA
production. Having a direct indication to how much malonyl-CoA is available
Figure 2: Scheme of the working mechanism for the malonyl-CoA sensor
and how our efforts to introduce heterologous Acc´s succeed in elevating the native levels would be quite helpful. This can be achieved in a quite similar way to the
3HPA
measurement. Our literature research quickly gave us several starting points. One of them, a system from Bacillus subtilis , in which the repressor FapR binds the 17bp motif fapO, thereby sterically hindering polymerase binding to an adjacent promoter (Liu et al. 2015). When the FapR protein binds malonyl-CoA, a conformational change is triggered which results in FapR dissociating from the fapO site. The now accessible promoter drives expression of the gene under its control, which we replaced with a reporter.
Directed Evolution and Applications
Directed evolution
Although the Marburg Collection enables the construction of many pathway variations, there are still many more possibilities for direct metabolic fluxes towards
3HPA

iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.
