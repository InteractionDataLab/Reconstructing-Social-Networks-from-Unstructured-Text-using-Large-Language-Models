4.Dynamics of Free Growth
In order to understand the effect of the plasmids we constructed on the detection of tetracycline, it is very important to understand the growth of microorganisms and establish a model. In recent years, the study of growth dynamics model has become the focus of predicting microbial growth.     It is often divided into primary prediction model and secondary prediction model.
In the primary prediction model, the modified Monod equation, Logistic equation, Baranyi-Roberts model and Gompertz equation are common. After consulting the literatures, we decided to select Gompertz equation as the equation of this forecast temporarily. Its basic form is:
Two directions for time t:
N_0—Number of microbes at zero time;
N_t—Number of microbes at t time;
N_max—The maximum number of microbes;
λ—The length of the delay period.
Because the quantity of microorganism is difficult to measure and we think the volume of culture medium does not change during culture, the quantity of microorganism is proportional to the density and the density is proportional to the ABS value.
Therefore, the Gompertz equation can be transformed into:

Part2:
Why is the degradation efficiency of three enzymes degrade smaller than that of individual enzyme?
Suppose:
1. The larger the plasmid, the more difficult to be introduced into bacteria, and the number of plasmids introduced into a bacteria has the following relationship with the number of plasmid bp:
P and Q are fixed values;
BP is the BP number of the plasmid.
N is the average number of plasmids introduced by each bacterium;
2. It is possible for the plasmid to be inadvertently exfoliated with ribosomes during expression. Assuming that the exfoliation probability is d for each codon, the exfoliation probability"

Demonstration & Preliminary Data
Due to limitations in human resources, we chose to solve the second part of the process as well as create the culture management system. The reason for this is that these two parts are the parts applied to any replication of this automated metabolic pathway control system.
To date, we have successully manufactured syringe pumps capable of dispensing highly accurate amounts of inducers. By design, our stepper motor's ability to make 200 steps in a full rotation paired with a smooth low-pitch threaded rod allow movements magnitudes more precise compared to hand-operation. View a video of an earlier syringe pump prototype in action here .
Our constant-volume culture setup, modeled after the Chemostat developed by the Dunham Lab at the University of Washington, works with incredible reproducibility. When overflowing with excess medium in a positive-pressure system, the tube is guaranteed to dispense excess media into an overflow bottle.
With our mechanical components functioning as expected, we have started initial testing of the setup using high quality water-soluble dyes as substitutes for metabolite products. The data we collect on colors and their products when mixed can be processed using machine learning algorithms to efficiently understand their complex relationships.

The development of artificial muscles attracts wide interest for industrial and medical     applications. Regarding manufacturing, robotic devices with synthetic muscles are able to     handle softer materials more precisely. Moreover, artificial musculatures in medical     prostheses can improve the wearing comfort while conveying a rather natural feeling.     Currently, muscle-like contractions can be obtained by capacitor systems or by molecular     machines incorporating tissue. This project aims to replace the common materials in both     branches by biological tissue. While increasing ecological friendliness and the compatibility     with human tissue, those fabricated compositions can compete with human biological     material.

Pathomon
As a part of Team Franconia the Department of Würzburg is responsible for all the tedious and boring technical stuff,     which includes this website, graphic designs and the focus of our combined efforts:  The parallel reality game: “Pathomon”.
Since the world is such a dark and scary place, we decided it should be possible to make at least some of these threats visible, so it will be easier to face the threats to modern humanity and to do your part in making this wold a safer place.     With this purpose in mind and maybe to even teach some things to our playerbase, we created an app, that allows you to do something you probably always wanted: To see all the little germs, viruses and pathogens that squirm and writhe around you all the time.     By scanning markers which are distributed around the Covention Center of the Giant Jamboree, you can display the little troublemakers hiding behind them. And even better, you can fight and wipe them off the face of the earth.

Pittsburgh,2018,Team:Pittsburgh#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," and the tracrRNA. The tracerRNA is the portion of the sequence that interacts with the CRISPR complex. The crRNA is the 20 nucleotide sequence that gives CRISPR is targeting property by recognizes a specific DNA sequence that matches the crRNA. Directly downstream of the targeted DNA sequence, there is a three-nucleotide sequence called the PAM (protospacer adjacent motif) site that is recognized by Cas9 to allow for proper binding and unwinding of the DNA. Cas9 will search the cellular DNA for PAM sequences. Once found, it will unwind the DNA to determine if the crRNA matches the DNA sequence perfectly. If the sequences match Cas9 will utilize its 2 nuclease domains to makes a double-stranded break in the DNA. After the double-stranded break is created, the cell’s host mechanisms repair the DNA. However, this repair leads to the insertion or deletion of base pairs, resulting in stochastic outcomes.
CRISPR/Cas9 Base Editor
The efficiency and versatility of CRISPR/Cas9 in gene editing has led to the development of promising new tools. Improving upon CRISPR/Cas9’s gene editing abilities, a fusion base editor complex was developed consisting of the DNA base modification enzyme cytidine deaminase (CDA), catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) or Cas9 nickase (nCas9), and a base excision repair inhibitor called uracil glycosylase inhibitor (ugi). This complex can produce a permanent single nucleotide change in the DNA, resulting in a much more certain alteration. The high fidelity allows for researchers to design complex systems while still retaining the targeting specificity of CRISPR/Cas9.
The cytidine deaminase enzyme is able to make a C-G to T-A base pair mutation; after the enzyme binds to a cytidine (C) in the target region of the DNA, it converts the C to a uridine (U). This U-G mismatch is corrected by cellular repair or replication and altered into a T-A base pairing.
In a base editor, a modified version of the Cas9 protein is used. Compared to Cas9, catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) has two silencing mutations (D10A and H841A) that remove endonuclease activity from both of its functional domains. Rather than making a double-stranded cut in the DNA, dCas9 functions more like a shuttle to carry the cytidine deaminase to the targeted DNA sequence. Another modified form of Cas9, called Cas"

Kent,2014,Team:Kent#publicperception_-_-_TEXT.html," for use in medical products is also being researched[3], and methods developed in our project could aid this research. It could also aid further synthetic biology research not related to the production of terpenoids by creating a better understanding of the applications of synthetic biology.
Promote environmentally friendly manufacturing:
Creating an environmentally friendly fragrance industry could highlight to consumers the impact on the environment of the products they buy. This may increase the demand for environmentally friendly products created from other industries and thus promote environmentally friendly manufacturing in other industries.
Public image of GMO use:
The use of GMOs in synthetic biology to create fragrances may create a 'route of acceptance' to the use of GMOs by the public. Discussions with a number of people with no scientific background showed us that the public may be more likely to accept a product that is created using GM bacteria, but with the bacteria not present in the final product, that they would be to directly consume or use a GMO. This may allow the public to begin accepting the use of GMOs and synthetic biology, thus improving the image of these.
Safer production methods:
Current chemical production methods involve workers being exposed to a variety of chemicals, and natural production methods involve the use of high pressures and temperatures. Production of fragrant compounds using synthetic biology could eliminate this, and the use of the non-pathogenic E.coli we are using is low risk.
New fragrance markets:
If we were able to successfully express multiple fragrances in each bacterium this could allow for a new market to emerge in customisable fragrances. The customisation would be cheap and easy to do and allow for personalisation of fragrances.
Negative Impacts of our project
We have also considered the potential negative impacts our project could have on society. We will discuss these below:
Biodiversity:
If our project was scaled up to an industrial scale many areas of land currently used to grow a variety of flowering plants may be lost. The land may then be used to grow food crops, and could result in large areas of monocultures. This will cause a loss of plant biodiversity, and could have a knock on negative impact on other species such as bees. An article in Nature in 2011 stated 'What bees need most, the new pollination studies have shown, is a diverse community of flowering plants that bloom throughout the spring and summer' [4].
Public image:
The public often have a bad image of the use of bacteria and of the use of GMOs. If the public rejected the idea of our project this could have a damaging impact on public opinion of using GMOs for other purposes.

In order to make a UV sensitive ComR/S system three plasmids were given to us.

Glucoronidase
Erythromycin
pcMMCD 105

pcMMCD 106

The promoters chosen are two proteins’ promoters induced by ComR in Streptococcus thermophilius. P1655 is a strong promoter heavily induced by ComR. On the contrary, Pshp0064 is a much weaker promoter.
The plasmids were contained inside an E. coli DH5-alpha strain that were GusA+. This meant glucoronidase's expression even when not induced.      To prevent this, we extracted the plasmids and inserted them in E. coli DH5-alpha GusA- strain.
This allowed us to quantify glucuronidase activity in ComS’s presence with para-nitrophenol glucuronide (protocol described in notebook).      We took the optical density at 405 nm wavelength after induction. This is the absorption wavelength of para-nitrophenol.      The pcMMCD 102 and pcMMCD 106 gave no signal except background noise. Only pcMMCD 105 gave a significant signal.

To obtain a good UV detector we need the expression to be closely linked in time with the ComS presence.
We assessed this with the same test with pcMMCD 105 but this time with different incubation times.        As you can see on fig.1, the signal is already visible after 20 minutes and becomes steady after 80 minutes.

Dr. E. coli: The smallest injector in the world
Introduction
   Type III Secretion System (T3SS) is a system of pathogenic gram-negative bacterium such as Salmonella, Yersinia and EPEC(entero pathogenic E. coli). Using this system bacteria can inject whole protein molecules through a syringe like organelle named Type 3 Secretion Apparatus. The target of this system is a eukaryotic cell. Naturally it is used to inject Virulence effector proteins.
Structure of Type III secretion apparatus
Fig.1
Needle complex of Salmonella typhimurium [2] .
   Type III secretion apparatus have a syringe like structure. It can be visible under electron microscope [2] . Its length is about 80nm and the diameter of its needle channel is about 2nm [3] . The length is about 1/10 and the diameter is about 1/400 of an E. coli cell’s minor axis. Thus this is the smallest injector in the world (Fig.1 a~c).
How does it function?
Fig.2
Model for substrate recognition and delivery of proteins by type III secretion machines [2] .
   When the needle tip attaches to the host cell membrane, a translocator complex that is also secreted by the T3SS is assembled on the host cell membrane and mediates the passage of the effector proteins through the target cell membrane. On the other hand an effector protein, which have a unique T3SS secretion signal domain on its N-terminal, is recognized by the specific chaperone and form an effector-chaperone complex. The secretion machinery, including a T3-secretion-associated ATPase, recognizes the complex. Then, the ATPase stripes the chaperone from the complex, which remains within the bacterial cell, and mediates the unfolding and threading of the effector protein through the central channel of the needle complex. Finally, the translocated effectors re-fold within the host cell to carry out their function (Fig.2).
Motivation
   It is valuable to develop a system that can modulate cell's behavior transient"

Increasing the number of light regulated DNA in a cell reduces the instability. Perhaps in the future it will become affordable to genome integrate large numbers of light regulated genes to provide reliable and extremely high spatial control of bacteria using mulitple wavelengths.

Hello, iGEMer!! =) What’s up? Today we had a meeting with the entire team to discuss about our human practices, wiki and bench! We also took many pictures to put on our wiki page! Super cool!
On lab, we made a new miniprep of our bio bricks (BB_Essential, BB_Bioremediation, BB_Essential + E0840 and BB_Essential + K346004) to send it to competition.
Plasmid DNA extraction of bio bircks:
1: BB_Essential in PSB1C3 extracted from DH5α
2: BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3 extracted from DH5α
3: BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3 extracted from DH5α
4: BB_Essential + E0840 in PSB1C3 extracted from DH5α
5: BB_Essential + K346004 in PSB1C3 extracted from DH5α
Regarding to the new constructions, our transformation of JM110 with bio brick mRFP generator K516030 grew up!! We made inoculum in LB medium to make miniprep tomorrow.
Today we also continued the identification and isolation of wild bacteria (from contaminated stream and from Negro River). We made plasmid DNA extraction – because on total DNA extraction it appeared a plasmid (see September 9th ). Lets see!!!
Plasmid DNA extraction from wild bacteria resistant to high Hg concentrations:
1: Sample A1* collected from Negro River
2: Sample A2* collected from Negro River
3: Sample E1* collected from contaminated stream
4: Sample E2 collected from contaminated stream
5: Sample P1* collected from contaminated stream
6: Sample P2 collected from contaminated stream
7: Sample P3 collected from contaminated stream
8: Sample S1* collected from contaminated stream
*Resistant to 100ug/ml of Hg.

Imperial_College_London,2010,Team:Imperial College London#Brainstorming_-_-_TEXT.html,"- they would be in an equilibrium of intact and separate parts, which means we couldn’t use them in our system as they would fluoresce even without input stimulation. It should be noted that we considered using Beta galactosidase also. This is naturally transcribed and translated in two halves (genes present on two different chromosomes) which means it’s easy to tag each half, but again the halves have such a high affinity for each other that false positives  are a big problem; an equilibrium between monomer and dimer states always exists.
A host of other possibilities were investigated; Camgaroos and even smell molecules but either the input stimulus wasn’t desirable or the substrate molecules were hard to work with. It was by luck that we happened across our final gene. A supervisor had been to a presentation of SynBio masters students work in the last year and recalled one students work in particular. Jeremy Bartosiak-Jentys’s work revolved around XylE-catechol assaying. The key points include a response that occurs in seconds to minutes with a colourless to coloured (bright yellow) pigment production. We researched into this enzyme and even visited the mentioned masters student who gave use some cells and we watched the assay ourselves. The response was in seconds and you couldn’t miss it; it was such a bright yellow. Suddenly our fast response output problem was solved, we were going to use XylE, and even better; it was in the registry. The next challenge was how to couple activation of C230 with our chosen input. After much research and aided by Jeremy it was known that C230 acted as a tetramer in its functional form. We paid visits to protein engineers and alongside structural research into the monomer decided to modify a monomer by N-terminally linking (GGGSGGGS-TEVcleavage site) it to GFP. This re-engineered monomer was predicted to be incapable of tetramerization and thus inactive. Only when TEV cleaves off GFP would it be able to regain functionality. Thus our system for fast response had been founded. TEV was one of the many considered proteases chosen on a basis of size and specificity; we didn’t want the protease to chop up our key enzyme or for the synthesis step to hinder our timescale of response. TEV is very small and its synthesis timescale is negligible therefore despite not being able to entirely bypass the transcription translation step (easily) we have found a way around it and still meet our system requirements.

Composite part 2 (GSH) in pSB1A3 PCR Confirmation:
We’ve conducted colony PCR with GSH specific primers for our composite part 2 in pSB1A3 backbone. We wanted to see a band of 225 bp on gel (figure 17) and GSH colonies 3, 4 & 5 have given the bands as expected. Below; wells 5, 6 and 7 confirm our transformation and we choose to proceed to the plasmid isolation with the colony number 3.
Figure 17: PCR check with Composite 2 (GSH) part insertion in pSB1A3 backbone. GSH specific primers are used. Expected band length: 225bp.
Composite part 3 (FucO & GSH) in pSB1A3 PCR Confirmation:
After successfully inserting our composite part 3 (FucO and GSH together) into the pSB1A3 backbone, we’ve done colony PCR with FucO specific primers (Figure 18). Our expected band length for confirmation was 194 bp and all the results came out positive (seen in wells 12-20), confirming our transformation. Since the best result was seen on colony number 2 (well 13), we’ve done the plasmid isolation from that colony.

Biochemical Experiments
We designed our biochemical characterization experiments in order to evaluate the effects of our circuits on life span, cell mass, and ultimately the bioethanol yield of ethanologenic E. coli strain KO11. We carried out two experimental assays simultaneously.
In both of our biochemical assays, we had four cultured groups of KO11 ethanologenic strains of E.coli to test.
#1 KO11 un-engineered
#2 KO11 with only FucO
#3 KO11 with only GSH
#4 KO11 with Bio-E"

For that, we added a                          secretion signaling domain, according to the chassis: for gram-negative bacteria, we added the                          TorA twin-arginine translocase domain, a Type II-secretion system [4], wheras for yeast we                          used an exportation signaling domain from the Phosphatase-1 protein [5]. Two eleven-amino                          acid linker are used for avoiding allosteric interference between the three main domains.

In our circuit design, we chose araBAD promoter which will be combined with repressor protein AraC and the latter represses transcription of mRNA without arabinose. Then, Arabinose of reagent addition will bind to AraC and form the AraB·AraC compound, allowing transcription to occur.
Hypothesis
We make an assumption that AraC are always in large concentration and that its binding to arabinose happens on a faster time scale than transcription. Therefore, we do not need to consider the individual concentrations of arabinose and AraC, instead we just need to include the concentration of the complex AraC · AraB.
The process boils down to the following formula:
$$Arac + AraB \overset{k_1}{\underset{k_2}{\rightleftharpoons}} AraC·AraB \xrightarrow{{k}_{3}} mRNA + Arac$$
according to law of mass action,
$$ { {d[Arac·AraB]} \over {dt} } = {{k_1}·{({{[AraC]}_T}-{[AraC·AraB]})} - {k_2}·{[AraC·AraB]} - {k_3}·{[AraC·AraB]} }$$
Because $ { {d[Arac·AraB]} \over {dt} } = 0 $
Therefore $ { { {k_2} + {k_3}} \over {k_1} } = { { {({{[AraC]}_T}-{[AraC·AraB]})}·[AraB] } \over {[AraC·AraB]} } $
Define $ {k_m} = { { {k_2} + {k_3}} \over {k_1} } $, then
$$ { [AraC·AraB] } = { { { { [AraC] }_T } · [AraB] } \over { {k_m} + [AraB] } } $$
Then the transcription rate can be confirmed like the following mathematical expression:
$$ {v} = {k_3}·{ [AraC·AraB] } = {k_3} · { {{[AraC]}_T"

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," This was accomplished by incubating SurA with BamA denatured in urea, then transferring it into a solution featuring liposomes, BamB and BamCDE,  then further incubating for 2 hours. As BamA was expressed with a his-tag, we performed a blot to determine the level of protein folding (Fig. 13).
Fig. 13 Western blot of BamA folding. 1U - sample 1 unboiled, 1B - sample 1 boiled, 2U - sample 2 unboiled, 2B - sample 2 boiled, L - ladder
As we can see from the results, after only 2 hours of incubation over 50% of BamA was processed and correctly folded, which is an indicator of proper functionality. At higher concentrations or within more enclosed environments, such as encapsulated within the liposome, efficiency is bound to increase.
Conclusions
We managed to successfully isolate the BAM protein complex at a high purity with relatively few steps. The BAM complex not only shows activity in vitro, it shows efficient activity within the presence of liposomes, which shows that it is functional and suitable for our system.
Discussion
The study of MPs is and continues to be a difficult area of study, due to the sheer difficulty in handling them. As we have emphasized before, the integration of MP’s is a particularly pronounced issue, being borderline impossible for some cases in vitro. However, we have managed to demonstrate, that with our newly designed approach utilizing the BAM complex, the SynDrop system can allow for much more efficient insertion of MP’s as well as greatly expanding the total amount of viable MP’s for high throughput in vitro studies.

Step 3: Results
The Results consist of two sections: a statistical overview on how your reads mapped                                     to the reference(s) and                                     the filter to extract and save only those reads you need for your downstream                                     analysis.
Section 1:
For each combination of FastQ (file/directory) with FastA you will find one table                                     and three plots.
The table includes read and base frequencies in the reference FastA file. For reads,                                     you receive the                                     information about aligned or not aligned reads. It is not always sufficient enough                                     to rely only on reads in                                     the further analysis. The different read sizes can cause the wrong interpretation                                     of the data: three                                     contaminated reads of length 50 bp or 5000 bp make a big difference despite the                                     fact that there is three of                                     them in both cases. For making proper conclusions about the data it is useful to                                     take a look on the bases                                     as well. For bases, it is important to note that there are two different                                     definitions: alignment bases and                                     aligned bases.
Aligned reads consist out of bases. These bases are called the aligned bases. On the                                     other hand, the bases                                     that are indeed aligned, means mapped to the base in the reference and are not                                     skipped, are called                                     alignment bases.
To support the statistical information in the table visually we also added two pie                                     charts that correspond to                                     the relative and absolute values in the table. These"

Multiple optic devices are designed for the various experimental requirements, such as stimulating neuron of Caenorhabditis elegans, training C. elegans and inducing C. elegans to move in a certain direction. They can regulate output temporally and spatially in an elegant and efficient way.
Forming Pattern with Light
Biology background in our project: We need to use 395nm light to activate Calcium indicator GEM-GECO for neural activity imaging. For the independent excitation of neurons (AWA and AWB) in C. elegans, channelrhodopsins CoChR and Chrimson are activated by blue light and red light respectively [1] .   Due to these proteins' selectivity to the wavelength of stimulating light, we need to ""purify"" the light from the projector.
Fig.1 A) Schematic of fluorescence microscope. B) The proteins' spectra in our system
Fluorescence microscope plays an important role in our experiment, because we need to use specific lights to stimulate worms. The Zeiss Company creates a perfect visual animation to show how the fluorescence microscope works, and you can find it on their webpage . However, typical fluorescence microscopes can only uniformly illuminate the specimen ( C. elegans) with the same light within entire visual field. Thus, we modify a consumer projector to a new  light source, which can illuminate specimens locally, in multi-color, in multi-points and dynamically. The Projector Light Source also has a short response time and high light intensity, which will be an effective and promising  tool for synthetic biology studies.

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," already established low-throughput measuring methods. Then, with CAT-Seq, we can also measure the activities of those mutants in high-throughput, which can then be compared to our previous measurements to confirm that CAT-Seq system is working as intended and can precisely discriminate different mutant activities.
After acquiring the esterase enzyme and its mutants, regulatory sequences - RNA polymerase promoter and ribosome binding site -  were added to each of the library members. Then, the fragments were circularized for the MDA and RCT reactions.
After acquiring the initial esterase for building CAT-Seq, why were the mutations added manually and not randomly?
The goal of the in-silico modelling of the esterase was to determine mutants that would have different catalytic activities. If we had a randomized library of esterase mutants, it would have been difficult to precisely tune CAT-Seq parts as we would not be sure what output of the system we should expect. In contrast, having mutants with precisely measured catalytic activities beforehand using well-established and precise low-throughput methods enables us to recognise how well our system is performing.
For example, if mutant A was determined to be a little bit more active then mutant B, CAT-Seq would have to be sensitive enough to discriminate the difference and also precise enough to determine that mutant A is indeed more active then mutant B.
2. Library encapsulation into droplets
General description
For the precise measurement of multiple biomolecule’s catalytic activities they need to be physically separated. For example, if we would want to measure the activities of two mutants, we probably would not mix them together - we would measure them in separate tubes. The same logic applies with bigger libraries. Droplet microfluidics offers a way to quickly parallelize billions of reactions by physically separating reactants in pico- to nano-liter water droplets.
Using a microfluidic device chip whole DNA library can be encapsulated into the droplets, together with specific reaction reagents. Water phase flows through the microfluidic device channels with the help of pressure created by special pumps.
As water passes through oil flow, it breaks into defined size droplets. Their size depends on dimensions of the device, water and oil flow rates. On average, 300 000 of droplets can be generated in under 10 minutes. Generated droplets are collected into a simple 1.5mL tube and can be incubated at a required temperature or stored in a fridge.
In CAT-Seq, multiple of things must be encapsulated into the droplets:

PHAgave: a solution to a local problem from a global perspective
Introduction
iGEM Tec GDA, is a team of Mexican students that are worried about the environmental situation around the world. As part of our iGEM project we decided to contribute with our knowledge in getting rid of wastes that cause contamination by using them to solve a global problematic.
Our natal state is Jalisco, which besides of having beautiful landscapes and gastronomy, is the state where a well known liquor is made, tequila. Tequila is a traditional alcoholic beverage obtained from Agave Tequilana Weber that has denomination of origin; this means, that it can only be produced in 6 states of Mexico. This industry, is one of the most important industries in our country and is known for its contribution to the economy by exporting to more than 90 countries. Unfortunately, the production of this memorable drink leaves a huge percentage of residues. One of the most significant one is a fibrous material called bagasse. Large volumes of this waste are generated every year by this important industry, and their disposal, has become an environmental and economic problem.
For every liter of tequila, 5 kilograms of bagasse are produced, which results in 400 thousand tons of bagasse in Jalisco every year. This, is equivalent to approximately 5 days of waste generation in New York, the unequivocal world capital of garbage.
The bagasse, which is the remaining matter left after the agave head juices extraction, is a residue of organic origin that can be considered biodegradable. However, when it is not properly managed it can take long time to naturally decompose and reintegrate its components into the environment. The main problem of the decomposition process is that it produces leachate (a toxic waste liquid) that contaminates soil and water changing their properties. Bad smells that pollute the air and proliferation of harmful organisms that can become vectors of health problems are some of the main things caused by the huge amount of bagasse produced by this industry. The environment is not the only one affected by the obtention of this waste"
Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Detectives_-_-_TEXT.html," we have.
Continuing efforts to make our own ‘generators’ (e.g. RFP_gen) that is relevant to our project - using the relevant promoters and RBSs. This will provide us with other options if RFP is deemed suboptimal.
We have found an isothermal PCR (RPA) kit for use with our project. RPA was chosen as the best candidate because of it’s reasonably low operating temperature at 37-39C, compared to another commercially available isothermal PCR system, SDA, which has an optimal temperature 60+C.
We also had our second AITF GeekStarter workshop. A significant takeaway was learning about an alternative assembly method. Using the type IIs restriction enzyme BsaI, and custom primers that would allow us to produce custom sticky ends we could theoretically assemble our entire construct (4-6 parts) in one reaction, which would drastically cut down our time spent in the lab. This will be attempted in parallel to the traditional BioBrick assembly procedure.
Week 10: July 14 - 25
We have obtained a Blood PCR Kit from KAPA that allows direct PCR from whole blood without the isolation of DNA beforehand. We are also in the process of ordering an isothermal PCR kit (RPA; Recombinase Polymerase Amplification) from TwistDx. Since we intend on performing isothermal PCR on whole blood samples we are looking into the molecular details of the conditions in both KAPA Blood PCR and TwistDx basic RPA kit in order to effectively combine both technologies into a suitable strategy for us to obtain a prepared and PCR-amplified sample. We have asked for further support in the form of information from KAPA.
Primers that will allow us to carry out the modified method of ‘Golden Gate’ assembly have been placed for order, we are now waiting for them so that we may begin 1-step assembly. We are also waiting on our synthesized genes.
We have been contacted by 2 more groups so far for collaboration, details are being worked out. We now have three potential collaborations to work on from Purdue, Cornell and Colombia iGEM teams.
Efforts are still being made to assemble our genetic detection circuit manually, using the traditional BioBrick assembly method. However, many failures have been witnessed and it appears to be an uphill battle.

Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).
Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since "

Thus we went to the forest and dug little holes at a couple of different places to collect soil in falcon tubes. All samples were labelled with date, location etc. and send to them for further analysis. It was a lot of fun and a good reason to get out of the lab and into the nature. We hope that the team Norwich could make use of the samples and discovered many interesting specimens in our Heidelberg soil.
Feedback for iGEM Team Purdue
The iGEM Team of Purdue University invited us to support their project by giving input for their plan to create a new standard for biobrick submission, which should lead to more qualitative biobricks. We were glad to help by for example providing our opinion by filling out their survey. Furthermore within a video conference we talked about the ideas of the team and how we think about them, how they would fit to our own needs and how they could implement them. We hope that our reviews were useful to them.

Valencia,2009,Team:Valencia#A short story#Osamu_-_-_TEXT.html," at the Water Science Institute. A few months later, Professor Hirata asked me to assist his graduate student, Yoshito Kishi (later a professor at Harvard University) to determine the structure of Cypridina luciferin. In the summer of 1964, Kishi and I went to Setoda in the Inland Sea to do mass collection of Cypridina, taking some 10 students with us. From frozen Cypridina, we extracted luciferin and then purified and crystallized the luciferin. With that material, Kishi successfully determined the structure of the luciferin the next year.
In February 1965, I went to New Zealand to study two kinds of bioluminescent organisms: the cave worm Arachnocampa and the freshwater limpet Latia. Soon afterwards, I decided to go back to Dr. Johnson's lab at Princeton University, because I realized I did not have sufficient ability to do top-level work in two unrelated fields, earth science and bioluminescence. I wanted to study and clarify the chemical mechanism of aequorin bioluminescence, since some people doubted the existence of a photoprotein like aequorin. In December 1965, I returned to Princeton with my wife and our one-year-old son, Tsutomu. Since the early 1950s, it had been believed that calcium ions play important roles in living bodies, but there had been no way to demonstrate this experimentally. In 1967, however, Ellis Ridgway and Christopher Ashley, University of Oregon, experimentally proved the involvement of calcium ions in the contraction of muscles using aequorin as an indicator. As the usefulness of aequorin as a calcium probe increased in the fields of biology and physiology, I wanted to clarify the mechanism of aequorin luminescence to assist in its use.
I already knew that the aequorin luminescence was caused by an intramolecular reaction that takes place in the protein molecule, which would be difficult to study. But I decided to do my best. It turned out to be an unexpectedly large undertaking. It took about 12 years to obtain a structural model of aequorin, as detailed in my Nobel lecture. We needed a large amount of aequorin to carry out this study, so we returned to Friday Harbor every summer for more than 10 years, where we collected and processed about 3,000 jellyfish a day. My staff, my wife, my children, and some local students that we hired were of great assistance in"

Growth of bacteria with our bio bricks in medium LM (LB + mercury chloride) it’s in progress!!! We could see that bacteria after exposure to Hg gets a grey coloration and with abnormal growth pattern.
The test in medium LM 50ug/ml and 100ug/ml with wild bacteria from the contaminated stream and Negro River is ready. As observed on the following table:
Only two samples (A3 and A4) didn’t grow in medium LM 50ug/ml. Maybe the reason is because Negro River, where bacteria was collected (Açutuba beach), doesn’t have high mercury contamination. We continued the process to identify those super bacteria and today we plated the samples A1, A2; E1, E2; P1, P2, P3; S1 in solid LB.

Sustainability
Bioethics of space exploration and use of co-cultures.
Sustainability is, needless to say, an important theme to have in mind when doing absolutely anything this day and age. The term changes identity somewhat when it comes to space however, because there we have even worse opportunities to recycle, and, obviously, quite simply bringing 'more stuff' is not an option.
One must be capable of growing things in space, and one must be able to remove the tracks of that action. To that end, no less than biodegradeable materials secreted from sporulating bacteria will do; so that very little mass can be brought out, cultured to become a lot of mars, and then degraded to become lactate (a possible fertilizer) - thus closing the ""cradle to cradle""-loop.
It is not only in space that we reflect on how our choices effects the planet, we have also decided to have organic, Fairtrade t-shirts for the Giant Jamboree
The Workshop
Human Practices workshop!
We had so much fun hosting the new (hopefully) annual human practices! Even before the workshop, we were already, great friends with the other Danish teams. Whenever we were talking about the medals, there was one subject that kept coming up, – what is this “human practices” thing? So, we decided to host a human practices workshop. We wanted our friends and ourselves, to learn by doing. We also invited several other of our friendshipteams (read more here) and our friends from Göteborg, came all the way from Sweden to join us!
At the workshop we also involved ourselves in patent reflections, philosophy, public speaking and general human practises.
The workshop was a great success and thanks to Anna from headquarters, who were also at the workshop, we was invited to make a talk at the Giant Jamboree about making a workshop.
Anonymous: “It was great! The number of people and the venue helped to have really good interactions among people. The projects will be very highly benefitted from an activity like this. This event was amazing, I hope more meetups like this happen next year!”
Property rights
The team is currently in contact with a patent-lawyer. That’s all we’re telling you for now.
Ethics
We held a human practices workshop for us and some of our iGEM friend-teams, where the main focus was dedicated to ethics in science. We did this to underline two things - how important ethics are, and how aware you must be of them"

Step 5 - the cells were left on ice for 15 minutes instead of the suggested 3 minutes.
Once the transformation procedure for both sets of DH5-alpha E.coli cells was completed they were plated out on some LB+kanamycin plates (seen as kanamycin is the antibiotic the plasmid pMK-RQ offers resistance to). The way in which the transformants were plated out were as follows:
200ul of the cotC-GFP-smtA transformed E. coli cells were plated on an LB + kanamycin plate
200ul of the kinA transformed E. coli cells were plated on an LB + kanamycin plate
The remainder of the two sets of cells were then centrifuged for 1 minute. 500ul of the supernatant was then removed and pellet resuspended in the remaining solution. The resuspended transformant cells were then placed on plates as follows:
500ul of the resuspended cotC-GFP-smtA transformed E. coli cells were plated on an LB + kanamycin plate
500ul of the resuspended kinA transformed E. coli cells were plated on an LB + kanamycin plate
The four plates were then placed in the 37C incubator overnight to be processed tomorrow.

Today we carried out the minipreps for the E. coli cells transformed with pSB1AT3 + sspB
This time we spinned the tubes 30 minutes after adding isopropanol and we also gave a good mix to the tubes. To create some variances we centrifuges 1st and 2nd tubes for further 5 minutes before adding isopropanol and transferred the supernatant into new tubes. For 9th and 10th tubes we removed  any solution after the first step. For 4t, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th tubes we mixed wel after adding ethanol.

2. Focus on reusing or fixing the CO2 that will be released from the respiration of our cell culture to minimize environmental pollution.
3. The size of the MFC should be scaled up to accommodate the slow PE plastic degradation rate.
7. Finalising our ideas – Final wrap-up with Prof. Davis Bookhart
After making the mentioned modifications to our system, we again approached Prof. Bookhart to update him with our progress and to show him the data we collected. We asked for further advice on how to integrate the public opinion we obtained to help define our future direction with the project. Prof. Bookhart ’s main concern still lied in the fact that CO2 was our end product. He commented that our added nitrogenase system would only delay the problem of CO2 release by recycling it, instead of trapping it permanently.
Integrating all the concerns and suggestions given by Prof. Bookhart and our market research during our exhibition, we came up with the biosphere-MFC conjugation and the nitrogenase system to fully sequester CO2.
For the former, we will let CO2 pass from the anode chamber that houses Shewanella into an adjoining compartment via a semipermeable membrane. This adjoining compartment will house a self-contained biosphere, where plants, shrimp and potentially fish can be kept. The plants inside can take up the CO2 that crosses over via photosynthesis,  hence fixing the CO2 and therefore sequestering it as plant biomass. This will help decompose PE without releasing additional CO2 to solve the issue raised by Professor Bookhart. Since the nitrogenase system does not trap the CO2 permanently, it was not suggested to be the primary way to solve the sustainability issue. Nonetheless, our team decided to keep this system, to enhance our electricity generation when the plastic degradation process is limited.
Alongside carbon sequestration, there is an added benefit of putting plants near the MFC: to absorb any excess copper ions (Cu+) from our PE degradation module (which role is to enhance laccase enzymatic activity). This will nourish the biosphere and also prevent copper ions contamination to the environment.
All in all, our final product design is modified into an MFC/biosphere conjugation.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Modelling#Gold Recovery_-_-_TEXT.html," However, one disadvantage is the rather long simulation time, but recent methods have been developed in order to efficiently simulate differential equations numerically of which the right hand side actually requires the optimization of a linear program [22]. Applying such methods allows a quicker coverage of the parameter space.
In particular, one of the problems that appear in aerobic E.coli fermentations is the fact that at high growth rates (almost surely for growth rates above 0.35 1/h) a lot of acetate is produced which actually suppresses growth [23]. This is something that was not considered in the simulations here, but could be easily added by an appropriate inhibition term to the differential equations and also by tracking the acetate concentration in the dFBA model.
Final judgment
In total, under optimal conditions, our method achieves similar cost to more traditional chemical methods. Of course, optimal production is only theoretically possible and compared to actual measurements in Streptomyces (see above), the final titer is 2 orders of magnitude higher. Still, it has to be also considered that here the fermentation process was assumed to take place in a small scale 10 L bioreactor with high operation costs. Production at industrial scale with 10 $ m^3  $ bioreactors would drastically reduce those costs.
Finally, it also has to be considered that there is still 1 order of magnitude difference in respect to the profitability (cost of Gold compared to price for gold recovery with our method). With the gold price steadily rising and with improved NRPS and metabolic engineering, our approach could eventually turn out to be lucrative.
Outlook
In our project, we have demonstrated the feasibility of small scale recovery of gold from electronic waste by D. acidovorans. The simulations of the cost for gold recovery in industrial scale have been described and discussed above. Ideally, recovery of valuable metals from electronic waste should not be limited to gold alone but could be extended to for instance palladium and platine. As we also provide a tool for the prediction and design of novel peptides, the NRPSDesigner , it is conceivable to create NRPs which exhibit specifity for different precious metals. Furthermore, other innovative recycling techniques could be combined with our gold recyling approach, such as the plastic recycling proposed by Imperial College's iGEM team 2013 . Thus, a complete pipeline for the recycling of a mixture of different wastes based on synthetic biology approaches can be envisaged for the future.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#Mutation#Reversion_-_-_TEXT.html," between the cultures, the change in reversion frequency between both measured time points     is surprisingly low.
Genome Wide Mutator
We performed reversion assays with our genome wide mutators dnaQ926( BBa_K2082116 )     and M6( BBa_K2082117 ) again using the stop lactamase plasmid pLA230.
Our first approach was to cotransform the reporter plasmid and pSB1C3:dnaQ into E coli Top10 and inoculating cultures     containing arabinose or glucose directly with the transformed cells. This yielded a reversion frequency of 2.6×10-5 induced and 1.3×10-6 uninduced after 12 h. Because we did not plate the cells out for exact determination of the cell     count this result is only a first hint at an increases mutation rate through activation of our mutator.
Our next step was to transform the mutator and the reporter plasmids in E coli Top10, plate this on LBCmKan, inoculate LBCmKan     cultures and induced or repress this culture when reaching mid-log phase. The cells were plated after 24 h and counted.     From this experiment, the plasmids for our high-throughput experiment were prepared.
Figure 4: Reversion frequency measured in our first experiment with the genome wide mutators. The reversion rate is probably     not correct (see text), because no plating to count the exact cell count was done. This was included into our next experiments.    The results show an increased reversion frequency in samples supplemented with glucose. In theory the addition of glucose     should repress the PBAD activity, thus decreasing expression of mutagenic proteins.
For the observed smaller reversion frequency of the activated mutagenesis parts there can be two explanations.
The exact cell count was not determined by plating but only by OD600. Because expression of the mutator proteins     decreases cell viability (Badran and Liu 2015) the measured OD600 value probably contains large amount of dead cells,     therefore greatly inflating our supposed cell count. Badran found that induction of their M6 variant decreases cell viability     to ~5 %. This would result that the accessed total cell count is 20x too high in the induced samples, resulting in a 20x to     low reversion frequency.
Another possibility is that the arabinose promoter was active through very low levels of arabinose in LB. It is possible     that even very low levels of leakiness can lead to some mut"

iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting(2017)
We were invited to Shenzhen University (SZU) to attend the  iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting. The meeting was divided into three parts: project presentation, Q&A and free discussion. We gathered together to discuss the feasibility of the project, checked whether the ideas were flawed,came up with many insightful and helpful suggestions.
In this meeting we met different teams from different universities, and established the foundation of collaborations and communications with other teams. It was the first time that our project was displayed when the chassis we choosed was Medicago sativa, and Sinorhizobium meliloti. It was a hard time that we could find no way out our project design.
The iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting brought us a lot, this period of exprience nearly changed the whole project design of our team.
Conference of China iGEMer Community(2017)
The Conference of China iGEMer Committee(CCiC) is an advanced academic conference of synthetic biology in China, aiming to promote the development of synthetic biology and improve the contact and communications of nationwide iGEM teams.
We attended the 2017CCiC  hosted by the FAFU-CHINA. It was a great opportunity for us to know more about other teams’ projects and learn from each other, such as TUST-China, they introduced their project to us, and we found that both of us chased the production optimization of bacterial cellulose, one of the difference between our projects was the chassis we choosed as bioreactor. We went on selecting suitable organisms to modify, and the new project design come into being.
We have well established the connections with some of the teams which bring us helpful collaborations and support for our CUIPD project. In addition, it was useful to talk to other teams to exchange experience on poster design, oral presentation"
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," contains is translated into amino acids. Each amino acid has a certain number of DNA codons that encode the same amino acid. A vector containing these values per amino acid is generated next. Using the target region and Cas property input parameters, the target region of the gene is scanned for possible gRNA positions. Combining the information on the possible gRNA locations and the vector with the amounts of possible codons, positions are selected with the least possible codons. At these positions, gRNA’s are then generated and stored. This output can be exported as a fasta file.
Detailed methods
The tool takes as input:
A .fasta file containing a DNA sequence.
A vector with target region(s). These are the bps that the tool searches for gRNA positions. They can be exon-exon junctions as used in our application, but also regions in e.g. the active site of the protein.
Properties of the Cas protein that will be used. These include the PAM sequence (PAM), the prefered gRNA size (gRNA size) and the amount of base pairs in the gRNA that perfectly should match the score (Cas on target). Please note that the tool currently only supports single base pair PAM sequences and assumes the Cas on target is about the bps directly attached to the PAM.
The tool first translates the input gene into an amino acid sequence and into a vector with the amount of possible codons per amino acid position. This vector is used to identify regions with little codon substitutions possible. Using the target region and Cas property input parameters, the target region(s) of the gene is or are scanned for possible gRNA positions.
Combining the information on the possible gRNA locations and the vector with the possible codons, gRNA positions are selected where the least amount of codon substitutions are possible. This is an essential step, because selecting these positions greatly decreases the amount of gRNA’s that need to be generated, while keeping the same amount of (doping) sequences that we can detect. Supplying more or larger target regions is beneficial to the result of the program: the possibility increases that a target region overlaps with a region with low amounts of possible codons. This means it is more likely that a gRNA position is found where only very few gRNA’s need to be generated. Increasing the target region does increase the running time of the program. At these positions, gRNA’s are then generated and stored. This output can be exported as a fasta file.
The tool supports frame-independent translation, PAM identification on both strands and varying gRNA lengths. It currently does not"

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!

Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.

Monday: Carla is back in the lab. And Pollak didn't find a better way to greet her than to smash her watch against the floor. So now he owes her a new watch.
Also, on the Arduino road... we realize that the sensor we got last week was not the one we asked for u.u Therefore, if we ask for the correct sensor we'll have to wait another two weeks to try our arduino light sensing system. Truth to be told, we have a really tiny sensor (milimeters in length)and we really don't know how to wire it because it doesn't have any visible terminals :( Carla is going to Olimex's technical support on Friday.
Oh... and the most important thing: THERE ARE LIKE A MILLION COLONIES IN THE POSITIVE CONTROL FOR GIBSON :D (psB4K5 + sfGFP) So the problem seemed to be related with the e. clonis we were using. Now with the TOP10 cells we have our faith back :) And it's time to celebrate with good beer of course.
Tuesday: The bactomithril spider guys had a meeting today at 19.00 to check the advancement in their tasks. Later on, we had pizza time (after a very loooooooong time) and yes, Pollak's healthy life style crushed completely afterwards. :)"

Plates were incubated (agar side up) at 37ºC for ~16h.
Transformation of Vic GFP, BFP, YFP, AZ, blueberry and cherry was done using the same protocol as above.
Protein expression
Following the transformation, protein expression was carried out by adding 100ml of Lb media into two conical flasks that were previously autoclaved. Using a pipette tip a single colony from the transformed bacteria of GFP and BFP was selected and dropped into conical flask. They were then incubated at 240rpm at 38 ºC for 18 hours.
Using the incubated GFP and BFP they were divided into two falcon tubes each and centrifuged at 3000rpm for 20min. The supernatant was emptied (waste) and the pellet was resuspended with 20ml of SOC solution and 20 µL of ampicillin being added. At a wavelength of 600nm, the solution was measured in the spectrometer to check the density of the bacteria.The results obtained were as follows: GFP = 0.93A and BFP = 0.95A.Two conical flasks were made
up with 120ml SOC solution and 120 µL of Ampicillin (this is the solution in which GFP and BFP are added to).
Using C1V1=C2V2 the amount of GFP and BFP that was added to the solution from above (SOC and Ampicillin) was found.After adding the GFP/BFP the solution was incubated at 240rpm at 28 ºC for 1 hour. Following this hour the absorbance was read at 600nm and the following results were obtained: GFP = 0.7A (undiluted) and BFP = 0.64A (undiluted). The proteins were then induced by adding 147µL of IPTG into each conical flask. This was poured into 2 50 ml falcon tubes and centrifuged for 10 min at 2000rpm. Stored at -80°C.

Purdue,2014,Team:Purdue#Policy and Practices#Policy_-_-_TEXT.html," States Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Food and Drug Administration. New regulations that would be specific for genetically modified bacteria such as Minecrobe that will act as a soil additive on an industrial scale should include aspects such as large scale field testing before becoming available in the open market, handling and distribution training, and killswitch availability. The design of the regulation procedure can be modelled off of how new GM crops are produced from design, feasibility, field testing, to industrial manufacturing.
Another world model in agricultural regulation is overseen by the European Commision. Europe’s main executive body consists of representatives from multiple countries and they represent the interests of Europe as a whole. In June of 2014, the commision passed new legislation towards member states to restrict or ban GMO cultivation within their respective territories. The European Commision dictates that no GMO is allowed to be released into the market until they are subjected to rigorous field testing in the ecosystems that the GMO interacts with. The EU has a set of policies that can guide a person to test if the presented GMO is too dangerous to release into the market. However, since the new legislation has passed,  fewer GMO based products have been cultivated across the continent. In contrast, a report conducted by the commision that evaluated the quality of the legislation on stakeholders conducted between 2009 and  2011 indicated that there was a greater need for flexibility on GMO cultivation.
India is another major world agricultural contributor. The use of GMO’s in Indian agriculture has been a major debate. There have been many concerns about the use of GMO such as health issues, loss of biodiversity, loss of indigenous varieties through genetic contamination. This continued to occur until 2009, when the Indian Ministry of Agriculture passed legislation in the absence of a scientific consensus to impose a moratorium on several GMO’s until the concerns of the public, scientists, and state government have been addressed.
The role of GM crops in African agriculture is essentially nonexistent, only contributing 1.6 percent of the world’s land area planted with GM crops. According to the International Food Policy Research Institute, the reason for this is a lack of established biosafety regulatory systems in each country and a lack of capital investment in GMO research. However, studies done on GM cotton in South Africa has shown to increase crop yields up to 11%. Thus, there is increasing interest in GMO use in African nations. Though particularly undeveloped, the potential for implementing GMO’s in developing African nations is increasing, and importable solutions such as Minecrobe could pose to be an immense benefit when compared to domestic research and development efforts.

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2016,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#HP#Activities_-_-_TEXT.html," we introduced our project and received suggestions to promote our project.
Law
We are curious about laws that about the rights of people with hearing loss and the investigation process in case of surdomute criminal suspects. We consulted a Justice Liu and a legal practitioner, Miss Zhao.
It is said that in China, the Criminal Law and the Law of Criminal Procedure Law aim to embody the humanitarian. Deaf and mute are given appropriate preferential treatment and Summary Proceeding cannot be applied in these cases:
Cases of crime by deaf-mutes can be dealt with leniently.
A deaf and dumb or blind criminal is expected to receive a lighter or mitigated punishment or even be exempted from punishment as the case may be.
A deaf and dumb should be provided for with people familiar deaf and dumb gestures;
A deaf and dumb with no defender should be provided with legal aid;
Forcing disabled people to beg constitutes a crime;
Utilizing and abetting the crime of persons with disabilities should be cracked down according to law, etc.
Advanced Technology
The most efficient way to improve hearing so far is using hearing auxiliary equipment. There are two main types of hearing auxiliary equipment: hearing aids and cochlear implants.
Hearing aids: for conductive hearing loss;
Cochlear implants (CI): for sensorineural hearing loss.
We consulted Prof. Chen Fei who studies hearing aids and speech recognition technology for cochlear implants. He stressed the importance of attention to hearing-impaired people, because this big problem has not been concerned enough as it deserved.
Beyond hearing loss, pathologically caused hearing loss may also cause complications. The lowered hearing nerve activity for long is potential to cause inactivation of these neurons and lead to impermanent hearing loss. More significantly, due to communication difficulties or discrimination, hearing loss may cause psychological problems.
CI, together with hearing aids, bring sound to those who have never heard anything. However, the cost of a CIs is higher than 10,000 dollars and requires high medical operation expenses. There are only 20,000 people can enjoy the ease brought by CI due to the high price. As a result, we need people to focus on this issue. We hope people can devote to take part in research, charity or simple spread this idea, to make more people able to enjoy the sound.
At the same time, he believes that though hearing aids and CIs are the most direct and efficient way currently, they cannot solve the problem of hearing loss thoroughly. Protect our ears to prevent more hearing impairment cases, together with elaborate studies on hearing using biological methods, tend to be the profound and lasting resolution. He mentioned that"
Lethbridge,2016,Team:Lethbridge HS#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the venom should be significantly higher which in turn should accelerate our clotting. By having our proteins in the periplasmic space, we only need to puncture the outer membrane in order to lyse the cell. This function also allows us to release our construct without introducing E.coli inside the body.
As a side note, we decided to use E.Coli as our chassis because it is easier to use than other chassis such as yeast, and we have experience of working with it before. We have looked into using other chassis such as plant cells, but based on the convenience of E.Coli, we went with that.
Second Construct
The design of our first construct induced a rapid production of clotting proteins and in order to supplement it, we have designed a construct that would stabilize the clot and sterilize the wound. In order to stabilize the clot, we added Human Factor XIIIa (propeptide removed) which is the enzyme responsible for the polymerization of fibrin monomers, by keeping the promoters and binding sites the same strength we ensure that all of the fibrin-venom strands bind at the wound site and form a permanent plug that will not be easily re-opened. Having Factor XIIIa will accelerate the rate of polymerization which further ensures that the venom-fibrin strands will stay localized.
In addition, we have added an AntiMicrobial peptide to insure that all bacteria and infection that is potentially in the wound is sterilized. We have deployed the AMP LL-37 which punctures the outer membrane of bacterial cells causing their organelles to become exposed, ending in the cells dying. We have paired the AMP with a thrombin cleavage site that when introduced to the venom serine protease (Cerastotin) from our original construct, will cut the AMP that is bound to Factor XIIIa at the thrombin site, and at that moment become a functional protein that sterilizes the wound.
Application Method
In order to apply our product to the wound, we will contain our construct in a pre-filled syringe that can be applied to the wound which would be followed by a bandage for sealing it in place. Although our team discussed various other application methods such as spray, gel, or gauze, we eventually decided on the syringe and bandage because of advice and feedback we had received from interviews that were conducted. For instance, a bandage is more resistant to cold temperatures, easy to apply and was the most popular answer on the survey.
We decided to use a syringe because it is already in use by other blood coagulants, for example Pfizer"

What is more, all our codes are shared on github [1] (in the right picture). With fixes and new features putting forward every day,any one in any corner of the world can learn and keep update of our work, not just from the surface, but from codes and essense of our work. This is really a great way of communication, for we do not have to say too much to put our achieves across to those who really want to know our work, which really works. Great contributions have been given through github and we get a lot of advices and opinions as well.
Community
To better promote synthesis and the spirit of IGEM, we decided to establish a community together with IGEM USTC team. For the community, we have set regular classes and lectures for both synthesis biology and IGEM. We also open our laboratory to our community members and teach them basic skills of biology experiment(as in the right picture), like PCR. Of course, this is the main field we will update our progress on in the future.

Demonstration of Colored Reporters
Figure 2: Chromoprotein expected results demonstration. The above photos show an LB only plate with the chromoproteins BCP, GFP, GCP, PCP, pink, and E2C. RCP was present on the plate however is not easily identified in the picture and is therefore not shown.
We plated a mixture containing 7 different chromoproteins to confirm that our selected colors would be different enough for us to identify the different plasmids that they represent. We grew overnight cultures of the chromoproteins from glycerol stocks. 100 µL of each O/N culture was then mixed together in a tube and diluted. This was streaked out on an LB only plate and incubated overnight at 37°C. Since some chromoproteins take longer to be strongly expressed, the plate in Figure 2 does not reflect all of the chromoproteins. The plate on the left in Figure 2 shows the plate on a white background, making it easier to identify the E2-crimson colonies. The plate on the right in Figure 2 is on a black background and under a blue light. Some chromoproteins, like E2C and GFP, are more easily identified under UV light because they fluoresce. In both of the plates in Figure 2, the different chromoprotein colors can be clearly seen, indicating that the chromoprotein genes would serve as effective reporter genes to differentiate the plasmids.
