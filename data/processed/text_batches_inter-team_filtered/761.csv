Fig 7. Similar to the results shown in in figure 6, MZHWK can be seen as an over-expressed band. Although multiple methods for preparation were used here to try and isolate where the protein is being expressed although as shown here it can be found in the lysate and in the pellet.
From figure 7 is clear further work needs to be done when preparing this MZKWK protein as is found almost everywhere so far.
Week 8
(3rd - 9th October)
Attempted to bind chlorophyll to MZHWK, but it could not work. It is believed the incubation time allowed for the chlorophyll to bind was not long enough.
The results of the DCA sequences showed that DCA11 was very close and could possibly be correct. While the sequence analysis of DCA12 showed a perfect sequence alignment and these were then re-transformed to product more plasmid as stocks were running low.
More colonies of MOET were also selected for culturing to attempt to perform more screening. Although no colonies grew as they had been dead for too long. In the future another ligation attempt for MOET needs to be made, unfortunately time has run out to attempt again.
Additionally, all the operons were digested with E/P to do a final check on their size and all ligations products and operons were digested with NcoI (each gene should have a Nco1 site upstream of the sequence).
Week 9
(10th - 16th October)
Additionally, several backbone swaps we done for part submissions:
D3 already in Cam.
CA1 in Kan (was swapped to Cam)
TB1 in Cam
ELJ1 in Cam
MZHWK2-2 in Kan (was swapped to Cam)
OPQR1 in Amp (was swapped to Cam)
MZHWK-OPQR1 in Cam
ELJ-TB1 in Kan (was swapped to Cam)
The swaps resulted in good colonies, although some background colonies occurred and these were avoided when selecting colonies for culture (Cam resistance plates and LB were used).
Week 10
(16th - 19th October)
Final gels were made to characterise MZHWK, this was done by incubating several versions of MZHWK with pure chlorophyll on a gel to visualise if chlorophyll binds to the protein complex.

Despite that, there are recent evidence of different molecules that can act as potential components of transport long-distance mRNAs. One is the presence of translocatable RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in the phloem (Pallas & Gómez, 2013) while another possibility is cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) that transport hydrophilic macromolecules into cells. Here, application of CPPs for macromolecule delivery has been successfully demonstrated for plant cells even though further characterization is needed to determine which structural features influence its function (Chugh, Eudes & Shim, 2010).
Considering that mRNA transport approach is not the most suitable approach yet, we resolved to use plant viral vectors to amplify and transport any desired molecule. This strategy involves two main advantages in our system. First, the protein production is faster, and its yield is higher due to its ability to auto replicate itself. The second one is related to viral vector’s systemic movement ability. Thus, any desired protein can be transported from roots to the aerial part of the plant in an efficient way. These reasons encouraged us to work with viral vector strategy although we know that our main future challenge is understanding the mechanisms of mRNA import and transport in order to enhance and promote ChatterPlant’s possibilities.
WHY AN ON-OFF SYSTEM?
Constitutive expression of transgenes in plants often leads to pleiotropic undesirable phenotypes, limiting Plant SynBio applications in real world (Yi et al, 2010). Different transgenic plants show abnormal development (Romero et al, 1997), growth retardation or severe reduction in seed production (Liu et al, 1998) during their development. Accurate control of transgene expression allows to optimize development and behavior of transgenic plants without giving up improved features of the organism.
An ON-OFF optogenetic circuit offers us the possibility to activate and deactivate transgene expression depending on plant status, avoiding interferences with plant development and decreasing metabolic charge in cells.

2.The Application of Synthetic Biology
1.The bacteria which can kill cancer Voigt etc from UC designed a bacteria could kill cancer. They design many gene circuits so the bacteria could detect the environment. When the bacteria was in a low oxygen and the density of it above the threshold （both of them are the characters of tumor cell）, it would express invasin which would kill the tumor cell. This biosystem combine many module parts including two detectors, one coincidencegate controller and a reactor which illustrate the flexibility of synthetic biology. Because these modules could be replaced by similar parts and that makes the design of specific therapy bacteria target certain tumor cell. In the future, it would be possible for people to design a bacteria could cure cancer. They can be a tiny surgeon and enter into human body and destroy cancer. When they accomplish their mission, they would disappear immediately which will not only release their pain, but also solve incurable disease.
2.Cheaper medicine for malaria Malaria is an antiquated disease, which would infected approximately 5 hundred million people and cause more than one million death. For centuries, the normal treat is the utilization of quinine or its derivative chloroquine but because long-term treatment and drug-fast, the efficiency decrease. In 1972, China scientists extract arteannuin which can cure malaria from Artemisia annua, but the cost spend on extraction is ten times quinine and most of the patients are in the poorest place in the world which can not afford the expensive fees.
Keasling improve the E.coli and yeast production of arteannuin via design of the pathway of bacteria, yeast and plants. The method make each cell’s capacity of produce arteannuin increase one million times than before and the cost of medicine decrease from 10 to 1 dollar. Owing to his outstanding achievement, Keasling was selected by discovery magazine as the most effective scientist in 2006 and received 40 million dollar fund from Bill and Melinda Gates which was used to produce arteannuin in industry.
Arteannuin will be the first commodity utilizing synthetic biology, which illustrate the potentiality"

Penn,2012,Team:Penn#Barriers_-_-_TEXT.html," as Listeria monocytogenes because they are noninvasive and are easy to control through antibiotics. However although they did cause some tumors to regress, ultimately they preferred aerobic environments [5]. Then they tried Salmonella, which was another facultative anaerobe, but thought to favor anaerobic environments more. Due to this preference they were predicted to accumulate around the necrotic centers of cancerous tumors, and especially after modifications made to amino acid machinery [6]. Nevertheless, it remained flawed due to the fact that it was invasive and the safety, and viability of the option in the long-term remained unpredictable. Finally, more recently, an attempt was made with Clostridium, an obligate anaerobe. This was a great candidate since it would target only oxygen-depleted areas of tumors, and thus not be able to cause any systemic disease. In addition, Clostridium are sporulating bacteria which enable them to be metabolically active only in areas of necrotic tissue. As a result, the Clostridium would be inert everywhere else and thus unlikely to cause an immune response [7]. When this was tried in practice, the localization of Clostridium tetani turned out to be highly concentrated in hypoxic areas and therefore made it a suitable target for cancer therapies [8]. Clostridium was eventually tried out years later as a vector and proved to have sustained anti-tumor effects [9].
Bacteria are also advantageous by the fact that they motile due to their flagella. This is especially useful in diseases where the area of infection is large and deep. The bacterial flagellum is useful in these situations because they have the ability to penetrate tissues [10]. Moreover, this also illustrates the point that bacteria will not be entropically limited, unlike passive molecules, and can thus acquire energy to reach areas that are not as easily accessible. This results in allowing the bacterial density to be higher in areas away from the vascular source from which they arrived. Once again this sort of advantage primes bacterial therapies well for areas of tumors that are quite large and deep. Furthermore, the flagella allow bacteria to exhibit chemotaxis which is once again beneficial for cancer therapies. Several bacteria have shown to accumulate preferentially in tumorous regions due to the nutrients provided from dying cells [11].
Additional points can be made to show why bacterial therapeutics are just plain convenient. First of all, bacterial genetics are very well-understood. This makes them easy to manipulate and build circuits in, similar to electrical engineering. In addition, bacteria are responsive to their environment which enables the potential to create"

Goal
The primary goal of this project was to develop and characterize a small riboswitch library. All the riboswitches selected repressed translation when bound to either Vitamin B9 or Vitamin B12. These riboswitches were placed in PSB1C3 to be submitted to the registry. However, while a submission of the basic parts would be most useful to those who wish to use them to regulate future projects, it had to be ensured that the parts were effective. Additionally, the parts were to be characterized such that a general expectation could be formed of how the parts behave, not only in the specific system tested, but in other systems.
Why parts were selected
After searching the literature for riboswitches, five were selected. Three switches that were regulated by vitamin B9 and two regulated by vitamin B12. These riboswitches were selected because the entire sequence was available and because the spacing between the promoter and desired gene or translated region was known.

This part is originally from the Lactobacillus casei genome. According to literature, this tetrahydrofolate (THF) riboswitch could be used with certain chemical (has to be synthesized) to increase the magnitude of response.

It also includes human endoparasites which may cause infections, allergies or toxicity. This Decree is the French transposition of the Directive 90/679 / EEC and is also transcribed in the Labour Code (Articles L4421-1 R4421-1 to R4427-5). This Decree of the 16th July 2007 describes the technical preventive measures that are to be followed in research laboratories, where workers are likely to be exposed to biological pathogens. We have to obey to the rules of health, safety, and preventive medicine applied in public services in France (Decree No. 82-453). This decree refers to the Labour Code, Public Health Code and Environmental Code.
Basic rules in a lab
We have to apply the basic safety principles in all laboratory rooms:
- It is forbidden to smoke in all rooms.
- It is forbidden to drink and eat in the laboratory rooms.
- It is compulsory to wear a closed lab coat in cotton.
- It is compulsory to wear closed shoes.
- Long hair must be tied back.
- Oral pipetting of any substance is prohibited in any laboratory.
There are also others precautions when working with biological organisms:
- We need to wash our hands regularly.
- It is compulsory to wear gloves except for the use of an electric burner.
- In some cases (UV light, projection risk), it is compulsory to wear protection glasses.
Safety in the Lab
- Equipments: As soon as we manipulate in the lab, we have to wear the following personal protective equipments (a conventional lab coat, closed with long sleeves, closed shoes, gloves, glasses if needed).
- Storage: 3 cup-boards for different kinds of chemical products: flammable, acids, bases.
- Waste: Different trash containers are available in the lab:
- One for biological waste. This waste will be autoclaved before being thrown out.
- One for common waste.
- Special waste for chemicals.
- Special waste for waste in contact with ethidium bromide.
- Biological safety cabinet: To work into a sterile area and thus avoid external contamination by unwanted microorganisms, we have used a biological safety cabinet (FASTER – Ultrasafe). This BSC was cleaned with ethanol before and after each manipulation. A control of maintenance is done each year. The last control was executed on October 25th 2015.
- Water-bathes: We often used the water-bathes for transformation or digestion, etc"

Improved parts: BBa_K2886004
This year, we present BBa_K2886004 as our improved part in the judging form, but actually we make improvement to another three parts.
BBa_K2886004
BBa_K2886004 and BBa_K2886005 are both improved from BBa_E0020, which has 87 uses till 2017. And we designed them from BBa_E0020 with the technology BiFC (bimolecular fluorescence complementation).
BiFC is a new technology put forward in 2012 aiming to visualize the interaction of two proteins. If you connect these two parts with your two target proteins respectively, when two target proteins interact with each other, two parts of BiFC might well bind with each other and emit fluorescence for observation, which, in turn, proves the combination of your target proteins.
We split ECFP at the site A155 into two parts and get cECFP (coded by BBa_K2886004) and nECFP (coded by BBa_K2886005) which are the C- and N-terminal of ECPF. If these two parts of BiFC bind with each other, and they will emit fluorescence just as complete ECFP.
To demonstrate that our BiFC system works, we carry out a series of experiment.
Firstly, to prove it preliminarily, we implement experiment in E. coli BL21. To begin with, we transform E. coli with plasmids carrying BBa_K2886013 (leucine zipper + nECFP) and BBa_K2886012 (leucine zipper + cECFP) respectively. Because of the existence of leucine zipper, which can bind with each other due to electrostatic attraction automatically without out outer-membrane, trans"

Model of the plasmid loss
We want to thank Aix-Marseille team for the great help they give to us.       The aim of the model they conceived for us is to assess the evolution of plasmids throughout the culture,       to determine which parameters can matter in the loss of those plasmids,       and to precise what are the probabilities for a bacteria to loose its plasmids during cell division.       As a plasmids can be a disadvantage for growth (energy spent into replicating processes) or a advantage       (protection against a toxin) this question is hard to answer.       But in this situation, where one type of plasmid can influence on the presence of the other type of plasmid in (and reciprocally)       in the same bacteria, the question become too tough to answer and only a mathematical model can resolve such a interrogation!

Receipt of plasmids
We want to thank the 2012 Munich team for sending us 4 different shuttle plasmids. One of these, pBs0k-p, was very useful because we used it for cloning in E.coli and Bacillus subtilis.
Mailing of kit
2016 Evry team asked us to send a Ludox solution that was in our iGEM Kit. They stored their own solution at -20°C so it was not usable anymore. But it was important for them to participate to the InterLab project so we helped them.

We reached out to Team Northwestern to establish a collaboration that would allow us to test our homemade Gibson Assembly recipe on Northwestern’s construct. We received the backbone BBa_J32015, the PelB insert, and the associated PCR primers to test out our method and assemble the PelB-saCas9-His construct.  The expected workflow involved designing Gibson assembly primers specific to the vector and insert, assembling the construct, transforming the assembled construct into DH5α cells, and verifying the assembly success via colony PCR and sequencing.
Once testing proved successful, Northwestern would have received the DNA polymerase and DNA ligase lysate to assemble their PelB-saCas9-His construct using optimal ratios that we established. The success of the assembly would be verified via colony PCR and sequencing.
Unfortunately, we faced unforeseen delays in the verification of our construct and in successful assembly of our test devices. Although we were in communication throughout the project, we were not able to pursue this plan completely.

6/19/2015: Day 15
The NEGEM Meetup was today! We took the train to Boston bright and early, and got there with a bit of time to spare so we met some of the other teams. The presentations were very interesting, and it was great to hear what the other teams are doing. I didn’t really understand all of the science, since all the other teams are working with actual BioBricks, but it was still nice to see the more technical details and the foundation of what we’re building. The time we spent on socializing and talking about collaboration with the other teams was also very helpful, as were the feedback forms they gave us. A lot of the teams suggested we make the protocol and procedures used in a wet lab a more prominent part of the software, which is an important aspect to consider.
6/22/2015: Day 16
We started work on the computer prototype today! We did the basic layout of the program, using sample images. We based everything on the paper prototype from last week, so the workflow was easy. So far, it’s going easier than expected; we haven’t run into any significant coding challenges, but we also haven’t started work on any of the functionality, so we’ll see how tomorrow goes.
6/23/2015: Day 17
Today was another day dedicated to programming. We started adding functionality and worked on marker recognition.
6/24/2015: Day 18
We spent the morning adding more functionality to the prototype. In the afternoon, we introduced a major change to the layout: now the entire screen is dedicated to only one user, with the workbench and the environment each taking up half of the screen respectively.
6/25/2015: Day 19
We continued working on the functionality. We have been feeling a bit uncertain with the current layout of the design, so in the afternoon we talked to Johanna and Orit, and discussed possible changes to the layout. We spent some time brainstorming alternative versions, to emphasize collaboration and to allow multiple users to share the screen. This was to be expected; and iterative design process inherently has the potential for minor or major changes as we go along. We will start exploring new layouts, and we will also start talking to graphic designers about the images we would like to include as part of the design.

York_UK,2013,Team:York UK#Project.html_-_-_TEXT.html,"alactosidase assays were run in triplicates using PNPG as the substrate. In all experiments, untransformed E. coli strain DH5 alpha or strain BL21 were used as our negative control. The protocols are described in more detail in the Protocols section.
We demonstrated that E. coli strain DH5 alpha transformed with BBa_K1127008 can respond to the gold. In Figure 2a, relative activity of the enzyme beta-galactosidase increased significantly in the presence of golS and promoter P(golTS) (DH5 alpha_AB) but reduced to the basal level when golS was missing (DH5 alpha_A). The results are well supported by statistics - Kruskal-Wallis X^2= 20.75, df = 7, p-value < 0.01. This signifies the function of golS as a gold-dependent transcriptional activator.
In Figure 2b, E. coli strain BL21 has background expression of the enzyme. Strong enzyme activities were observed in the absence of lacZ alpha (BL21 and BL21_B), so that no differences were observed (Kruskal-Wallis X^2= 6.69, df = 3, p-value > 0.05). This suggests that there could be beta-galactosidase in the chromosome of this E. coli strain. Further research has confirmed our hypothesis. Beta-galactosidase (accession no. = C6ELN6) is present in BL21 according to the gene database on uniprot.org.
We determined kinetics of the device. DH5 alpha were exposed to different gold concentrations for 16 hours to reach steady states. We found that the response was non-linear with distinct phases - exponential phase (0.0uM - 2.5uM AuCl4), stationary phase (2.5uM - 10.0uM AuCl4) and logarithmic decline phase (not shown). The data were plotted in Figure3a with simulation of the fitted logistic model. Please visit our Modelling section for more detail. As seen in the plot, the device is very sensitive to the gold as low as 0.5uM. Later on, it became saturated from about 10uM onwards. The saturation could be caused by several factor, such as maximum promoter activity, expression and stability of the proteins and diffusion limit of the gold. In Figure 3b,  we ran more assays on the subpart P(golTS)+LacZ alpha to confirm the function"

International cooperation and engagement with other teams are important parts of the iGEM competition. Being in contact with more experienced iGEM teams helps overcoming difficult steps during the project but even exchanging thoughts with new iGEM teams always yields progressive solutions and creative ideas.
Team Eindhoven
Team Eindhoven can be seen as our main collaborator as for them being the team we had the most contact with. We were informed by our iGEM contact that they worked on a project similar to our LLPS approach to metabolic channeling. Their project called GUPPI (link) uses the concept of membrane less organelles to form a gel like structure which could be used in various applications. This was exciting news for us since they concentrated way more on the detailed properties of the droplet forming proteins.
They agreed to a first skype call during which we had a very informative and interesting exchange about our projects. Our teams agreed to a mutual collaboration by helping each other out with problems and talking about overall experiences we had during the projects. The main talking points were Human practices approaches and ideas how to efficiently explain their project to the public. They helped our wiki team getting started by providing HTML and CSS literature. We also set them up with a contact person regarding the modelling of their project.
At the end of summer, we kept in contact and had further skype calls and the collaboration continued by them helping us in a crucial part of the iGEM medal competition with simulating and modelling our LLPs system. This gave us a better and more detailed understanding of the inner workings of our project. General communication continued in the form of regular skype conferences. Furthermore, our wiki teams kept in contact and provided feedback for each other"

Freiburg,2013,Team:Freiburg#HumanPractice#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," research in synthetic biology.
On 26/9/13 it was discussed how a future society based on biotechnology could look like.  Therefore, several movies from the Bio-Fiction film festival in Vienna  were shown, where artists and filmmakers should visualize their associations with synthetic biology.
Here, the panel discussion came to the result that many of the movies showed the chances but also the risks of synthetic biology. Some aspects of mythology reappeared in the movies e.g. breathe life into a golem or opening Pandora's box .
In general, the risks always seemed to have a stronger effect on the audience than the benefits had. Furthermore, synthetic biology seemed to be connected with some kind of industrialization and a symbiosis of nature and technology. Regarding biosafety and biosecurity issues any genetic exchange between synthetic organisms and natural organisms should be prevented. Scientists support a clear separation of those, so that several approaches have been made. Here, xenobiological ideas e.g.  alternative sugar-backbones [1] or chlorouracil [2] in the structure of D(X)NA are worthwhile to mention.
The next day, on 27/9/13, genetically engineered machines were in the focus of the curriculum. During the discussion catchwords such as ""living machines"" or ""creating life"" arose which led to the question if mankind was simply imitating God or if creation was no divine prerogative anymore.
With these questions in mind the discussion went into a direction, where the role and the character of human beings were exposed in the light of synthetic biology. It was realized that within synthetic biology homo faber, a human that changes and modifies his environment, evolved to homo creator, a human that recreates his environment anew. With well-known literature at the back of their minds [3] the participants came to the result that synthetic biologists were still normal members of our society and their engineered machines not comparable to God's creation.
Despite, this led automatically to the question if we would be in need of new laws and limits in order to safe the original environment and to beware the society of a next generation of bioweapons. This was also the main topic of the last day of the seminar on 28/9/13.
Here, the panel discussion showed that differences in e.g. european and US-law make it difficult to assure the safety of the environment. Therefore, it was suggested that a global gremium should adjust international laws concerning biotechnology and synthetic biology. This reminded us of the dual-use debates following a moratorium of several scientists who were working with so called superviruses in 2012. During"

The Revolutionary Change for NYMU-Taipei！2014x2015
This year, 2014 NYMU-Taipei started to get on track since February. We took courses about iGEM and have been working together for months. Besides working on our own project, HOPE, we also started the 2015 NYMU-Taipei in September, a semester earlier than usual. Not only did we try to give them a whole aspect of iGEM, but we also brainstormed and learned together!
We decided to make this great change; starting in February this year was quite a big challenge for us. To start off, we held a welcome party for the incoming freshmen on 9/22. Some of our seniors from NYMU-Taipei 2013 also came to the bonding and shared their past experiences at MIT. It was definitely touching to see excitement sparkling in the freshmen’s eyes. Igniting their interest for iGEM was certainly a first priority for us!
After the welcome party, we arranged synthetic biology courses for them every Monday. Our juniors demonstrated great enthusiasm and interest in iGEM.
Besides guiding them to look through inspiring projects by other teams, we will also taught them knowledge about wiki editing, biobrick, modeling, and wet lab skills. Furthermore, they had opportunities to introduce a project of their own choice to others or to the public. We recently assigned them to film a short video to promote synthetic biology and celebrate the tenth anniversary of iGEM!
Hopefully in the end, they will be fully prepared to conquer any difficulties in the following year!

NYMU-Taipei,2014,Team:NYMU-Taipei#project#2c_-_-_TEXT.html," polyglycine bridges can cross-link glycopeptides that make up the cell walls of biofilm-producing bacteria.
The ideal biofilm degrader must be able to target some, if not all, of these elements.
So how did we do it?
After careful literature search, we found two promising enzymes:
Lysostaphin is a zinc-containing enzyme 27kDa in size, taken from the genome of Staphylococcus simulans, and was used previously by the [2012 HIT-Harbin iGEM team] . It is particularly powerful because it combines the actions of three different peptidoglycan degradation enzymes, and as such can target a wide variety of the glycopeptides that form cell walls, including features such as the polyglycine bridge. Also, unlike other enzymes of this type, it can target both actively growing and non-dividing cells. To add to its merits, lysostaphin causes no side effects in humans.
Dispersin B comes from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a Gram-negative rod oral bacteria. It is a soluble glycoside hydrolase capable of degrading PGA.
After the enzymes have been decided, we needed to find a promoter responsive to the conditions within a biofilm. The Asr promoter comes from E. coli strain MG1655, and is induced by extracellular low pH of between 4.0~5.0. Perfect for what we need.
But wait! We’re not quite done yet. Even after being equipped with the Asr promoter, lysostaphin, and dispersin B, our probiotic would still be useless against biofilms unless we export the enzymes out of the cell, where they can do their jobs. Here’s where the signal protein comes in.
YebF is a signal protein naturally secreted by E. coli, though experimental strains rarely secrete this protein, which makes it useful in synthetic biology. Proteins tacked onto YebF can be expected to also be secreted outside of the host cell, so we put this in front of our enzymes.
At last, our circuit is complete!
Our expectation is that the three-protein fusion of YebF-Lysostaphin-Dispersin B will be exported out of the cell upon translation by the YebF, where they will be able to do their job of degrading the biofilm, such as in Figure 2.
Figure 2.
Putting it to the test!
Having a circuit is only the start! Now we must test how well our"

The team was interested in showing our project to other iGEM teams, in order to know if the project is really useful, and to discuss the pros and cons of this. For this, we decided to contact teams whose projects were similar to ours. That is, teams that are developing new methods to detect molecules in water samples. The collaboration proposal with which we approached the teams was:
""Hold online meetings with the objective of knowing the projects of both groups and discuss the pros and cons of both projects. In this way, we can propose solutions to the problems of the other team, thus providing a new point of view to the problems and possible solutions. As a final goal, the possibility of combining both projects to reduce the cons and increase the pros could be discussed"".
At the end of September, all the teams had already uploaded their abstract, so we dedicated ourselves to read the abstract of all the teams participating in the ""environment"" track. This is how we found 9 teams with whom we were interested in collaborating due to the similarity of our projects. We contacted everyone with our collaboration proposal, from which we obtained some answers. However, the team that was most enthusiastic about our proposal was the Peshawar team from Pakistan ( their wiki! )( Page of collaboration of the team ).
Our first contact was with Shaheer, who was very willing to hold a meeting by videoconference. Despite the difficulties we had to meet, due to the different time zones (Chile and Pakistan are 8 hours apart) we managed to arrange our first meeting, in which Shaheer Sabz Ali and Muhammad Dawood participated. In this first meeting we got to know each other, talk about our respective human practices and about our respective iGEM experiences. We also discussed our project, we showed our iGEM presentation prototype so they could give us feedback, and they did the same with their project. Both teams were interested in each other's project, so we agreed to hold future meetings, this time with the objective of specifically discussing how to help improve the other's project. For this, we made a document describing the pros and cons of our project.

Compiled a set of 35 stress promoters that future iGEMers can utilize as regulatory elements
Function
Stress promoters respond differently to various types of stress that is placed on the cell. We wanted a promoter that would be downregulated in the presence of membrane stress caused by the overexpression of ToxR fusion proteins. The design principle was to express ToxR fusion proteins under this promoter such that the stress it caused would downregulate its production.
Assembly
The 34 stress promoters, identified from microarray data (Moen, 2009), were PCRed from E. coli MG1655 Genomic DNA. Basic parts were made in plasmids with pUC origins. A constitutive promoter (Pcon) was also cloned into a basic part as a control for characterization.
Characterization
The pool of 35 promoters was assembled in front of a rbs.sfGFP reporter gene, and the construct was transformed into E. coli MC1061. The transformed cells were subjected to generalized stresses (heat, cold, acid, base, salt) overnight, and their resulting fluorescence was measured.
Data
Downregulation in response to stress, resulting in decreased fluorescence, was desired. Tecan plate measurements showed initial downregulation in some of the stress promoeters, with the cold condition yielding the best results. Further flow cytometry experiments confirmed the stress-responsive downregulation shown by the Tecan. In the figures below, we show fluorescence relative to that of the constitutive promoter in both conditions. Here we show our cold condition (25 degrees C) vs our control condition (37 degrees C). We find that that these chosen 4 promoters have downregulated activity from the environmental stress we put on the cells.
Function
The expression plasmid consists of a stress promoter regulating the production of ToxR. This construct allows us to express enough ToxR to allow for the functionality we desire and at the same time have minimal affect on bacterial growth rate.
Assembly
The ToxR was PCR amplified out of V. cholerae genomic DNA, digested, and ligated in front of the leucine zipper IILK. A library of potential stress promoters and an RBS library were put in front of the ToxR fusion protein and the library was screened for healthy, transcriptionally active clones. We found a combination of the rffGH stress promoter and an rbs variant gave us the functionality we desired. This construct was then used as our template for our other ToxR fusion proteins.

Synbiologica then plans to acquire the support of early investors for $500 000 and industry knowledge support for further prototype development and initial market entry.  By the 5th year, Synbiologica will seek a second round of investment of $20-30 million for clinical testing and FDA approval for up-scaling production. At this point Synbiologica anticipates that the impact of the technology will be recognised by larger biotechnology and medical device companies, to whom we plan to license-out and eventually sell BEAR technology. Synbiologica would then move on to new projects.
Management of the company will be the responsibility of the members of the Lethbridge Entrepreneurial iGEM team (2013):

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"ET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in pur"

The theoretical model for PALE is built, but not solved yet. Probably finding a solution symbolically is not possible. For that reason the next step is to write a python script that solves the system numerically.

The ratio between the forward and backward rates determines the probability of moving between states and can be determined by the energy difference in the free-energy barrier between going forward and backwards between the state (for each position $n$):
$$\frac{k_{forward}(n)}{k_{backward}(n)} = e^{\Delta n} \tag{1}$$
As mentioned above, functional and structural studies of Cas13a indicate a central seed region ( Abudayyeh et al. 2016 ; Gootenberg et al. 2017 ; Lui et al. 2017 ). Therefore, we can schematically represent binding process as depicted in Figure 2). We take the first bound nucleotide to be at position 12 (as seen from the 5’ to the 3’ end of the spacer), in the middle of the central seed region that ranges from nucleotide 9 to 15 ( Abudayyeh et al. 2016 ). We impose that subsequent binding events occur sequentially in both directions.
Figure 2: Model representation of Cas13a target binding. Starting in the unbound state, binding between the crRNA and RNA target is initiated in the middle of the central seed region ranging from nucleotide 9 to 15. Subsequent binding events – towards the edges of the spacer – occur sequentially between adjacent nucleotides until the complete spacer sequence is bound to the target. If the spacer and target sequence match, Cas13a cleaves the target RNA and is activated (and will engage in collateral cleavage).
With these adjustments, we can follow the recipe given in ( Klein et al. 2017 ), we can now calculate the probability to cleave ($P_{clv}$) a target ($s$) with a given guide ($g$) once it is bound:
$$ P_{clv}(s|g) = \frac{1}{1+\sum^n_{n=1} e^{-\Delta T(n)}} \tag{2}$$
With $\Delta T(n)$ the parametrization of the energy landscape: the transition state energy between the first bound state and the n-nucleotides bound state. Lastly, we make the simplifying assumption that the transition to the next state is favourable for correct Watson-Crick base pairing (with an energy gain of $\Delta C$) and unfavourable for mismatches (with an energy penalty of $\Delta I$). The energy landscape is then only dependent on the number of correct ($n_c$) and"

As the only available evidence for the function of the TU Delft ’10 Salt Tolerance BioBrick (K398108) comes from analysis of the growth rate during the exponential phase, this is used to draw direct performance comparison with the UCL ’12 BioBrick (K729005) (NB: TU Delft '10 data approximate and based on info taken from the team's wiki) which it has already been shown provides this role. The plot below highlights the impressive performance advantage that the UCL construct has over the previous BioBrick for enduring a high salinity environment.
We also wanted to investigate if irrE has any effect on W3110 growth in marine broth. From the graph bellow it is evident that irrE presence improves W3110 growth in marine broth. (For the measurements' data please see week 17 on our lab book).

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," also changed the objective of the optimization such that the ATP-maintenance reaction should be maximized. Then we ran the model 1000 times whilst sequentially increasing the lower bound of the water efflux exchange reaction, the results of which can be seen in figure 17.
Figure 17: The relationship between the maximum ATP available for survival for an E. coli in a sugar-water environment and the incrementally increased water efflux.
The relationship between maximum ATP available for survival and water efflux is shown in Figure 17 the results from the metabolic model suggest that there is a linear relationship between ATP availability and water efflux. This implies that if no water is available for ATP used for maintenance, the cell will die. When the model runs without any modification, i.e. in an environment where it is in the exponential growth phase, an ATP Maintenance flux of

is given as output by the model.
We do not know the exact amount of ATP needed for survival in sugar water conditions, but because of the results from Figure 17 we can start looking at the relationship between survival time and water efflux.
Figure 18: The relationship between the maximum ATP available for survival for an E. coli in a sugar-water environment and the theoretical survival time, given a constant water efflux over this time and a starting volume of 2.8e-13 grams 5 . The various coloured lines indicate water tolerance thresholds for the E. coli.
In Figure 18 we can see not only the relationship of survival time against max ATP available for survival, but also how different thresholds of minimal cell-water tolerance would affect this relationship. The minimal cell-water tolerance threshold gives the value at which percentage of the remaining cell-water reaches a state that will cause cell-death. This has a drastic effect on survival time, changing 20 minutes of maximum survival time to a mere ~90 seconds in the worst case scenario.
Beyond 90 Minutes
Figure 17 shows us that osmotic pressure alone can indeed have an effect on cell regulation and cell death, and from Figure 18 it appears that the minimal water allowance threshold has a high impact on range of possible times. Our model is limited in that it predicts an infinite survival time beyond 90 minutes. This suggests that our model may be missing some form of regulation that allows for longer survival times. To understand this effect, we conducted an experiment to test this prediction. This experiment can be found here . What we can say is that if the cells can survive for longer outside of this"

A colony from each agar plate was selected and inoculated to LB- medium with antibiotics. Competent cells with pgRNA were transferred to LB- medium with AMP, while competent cells with pdCas9 were inoculated into LB- medium with CM. The cell cultures were incubated at 37℃ with shaker.
Preparation of 1xPBS solution for the InterLab-study.
Preparation of agar plates with CM, LA- and LB-medium.
Preparation of standard curves for InterLab study:
Calibration 1: OD 600 reference point – LUDOX protocol
A conversion factor to transform absorbance data from plate reader into OD600 was obtained in spectrometer by measuring four replicates of LUDOX CL-X and ddH2O. The data were imported into Excel sheet.
Calibration 2: Particle standard curve – Microsphere protocol
The solution of silica beads provided in the kit from iGEM HQ, was vortexed before dilution with water (96 μL Silica beads in 904 μL dd H2O). A serial dilution of microspheres was obtained by adding 100 μL dd H2O into 4x11 wells (E2, F2, G2, H2…E12, F12, G12, H12) on a 96 well plate. Microsphere stock solution (200 μL) was pipetted into E1 and 100 μL of the solution was transferred to E2 and mixed well before transferring 100 μL to E3. The procedure repeated until 100 μL solution was pipetted into E11, and 100 μL was transferred to liquid waste. The dilution series was repeated"

RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
Functionality of the Bxb1 Invertible promoter switch
Once the Bxb1 Invertible promoter switch test construct was co-transformed with its corresponding Bxb1 integrase-expressing construct, the resulting colonies were screened for RFP and GFP expression for both the co-transfomations and the negative control respectively. Figure 5b. represents the resulting colonies screened for RFP expression after the co-transfomation. All bacterial colonies were expressing detectable amounts of RFP. These colonies were also screened for GFP expression (Fig 5a.) and showed no fluorescent protein expression, thus confirming the integrase-mediated inversion of the Bxb1 promoter switch.
The negative control consisting of our single transformation of the Bxb1 promoter switch test construct in the absence of integrase. Figure 5c. and 5d. represent the resulting colonies when screened for GFP and RFP expression repectively. As expected, fig. 5d. confirmed no expression of RFP, however, GFP expression was also undetectable. To detect GFP from our control plates, a bacterial colony from the negative control transformation plate (fig. 5e.) was inoculated in culture for ~16 hours and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 minute. The allowed the bacterial cells to be concentrated into a pellet, which was consequently screened for GFP expression. As shown in Fig. 5f., the cell pellet showed detectable GFP expression when compared to its corresponding controls (RFP expressing bacterial cells and bacterial cells expressing no fluorescent protein). The observed GFP expression confirmed the proper functioning of our switch in its PB state.

Tuesday June 1, 2010
Today, we met with our advisors and had a discussion about possible circuits that could be used for our reporter plasmids. We also discussed the idea of the lux system as an indicator as suggested by Dr. Anthony Schryvers. We also decided that we should use different promoters like arabinose inducible ones as well as the Cpx, GroES, and DegP systems. We began research for the different promoters and their respective systems in order to present them at a meeting on Friday. Patrick continued to manipulate the wiki, coming up with colour schemes: We settled on Blue (4AC6F7), Yellow (F3F778), Green (9ECF3E), White (FFFFFF), and Brown (30251A). We also did transformation of plasmids from the registry plates for J23009, J23032, E0032, E0022, E0040, K156010, and I0500 which were parts that we want to use in our reporter plasmids.

Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

Glasgow,2014,Team:Glasgow#Project#Measurements#Gas Vesicles_-_-_TEXT.html," with a constitutive promoter) that their constructs appeared to work better than the Melbourne BioBrick. Expression of these two biobricks led to slower settling of cells in a buffered saline solution.
Our team decided to insert gvpA and gvpC genes into E. coli on a single plasmid to bring about floating under the control of our recombination switch promoter. The team decided to isolate gvpA from the OUC BioBrick K737017 and the gvpC from K737007 which were both available in the iGEM distribution. The floating assay protocol detail by Melbourne was used to determine whether or not our E. coli were able to float. How we achieved this, and the results of our efforts, are detailed below.
GvpA and GvpC
Before any work could be done with gvpA and gvpC, the genes had to be isolated from the constructs found in the distribution. In order to do this, PCR primers were designed to isolate the gvp genes as well as being designed to add the BioBrick prefix and suffix to the genes. To allow the genes to be translated, a RBS was added into the primers between the prefix and the coding sequence. The gvpA forward primer contained the sequence for RBS 0034 (a relatively strong RBS) and the gvpC forward primer contained the sequence for RBS 0032 – comparatively weak RBS, reflecting the relative amounts of GvpA and GvpC proteins in gas vesicles. The genes encoding GvpA and GvpC were then isolated and amplified by PCR; this was that confirmed by gel electrophoresis of a sample of the PCR.
The DNA was then digested with EcoRI and PstI to allow the construct to be inserted into pSB1C3, the constructs were then transformed successfully into TOP10 and DH5α. The resultant tranformant DNA was isolated by miniprep; the presence of the constructs was confirmed by running the DNA on a gel.
In an attempt to cause GV formation, gvpA and gvpC would need to be placed under the control of a promoter. The first step taken was to insert gvpA into an Ampr plasmid (BBa_J61002) containing a strong constitutive promoter (J23100); to insert gvpA downstream of the promoter, the gene had to be isolated by restriction digest using XbaI and PstI to allow the ends to be compatible with theBBa_J61002 - J23100 plasmid – which has also"

Human Practice Done in Each Region
Fig 4.1 Percentage of teams who did human practice in each region
Fig 4.2 Number of teams who did human practice in each region
In each region, it can be deduced that the number of teams who did human practice projects in each region differ from one another. Graph 4.1 indicates the relationship between the percentage of teams who did human practice projects in each region whereas graph 4.2 indicates the number of teams in each region. The results from graph 4.1 indicates that approximately 90% of the teams in Latin America did human practice projects and roughly 79% of the teams in Europe and Asia. North America scores the lowest among the region with approximately 62% of the teams did human practice projects.
The evidence shown from the 2 graphs is quite surprising especially towards North America. Despite the fact that North America has the most number of teams, it seems that compare to the other regions, North America did not show as much attitude towards human practice, in reference to the data in graph 4.1. It can be concluded that from the values of the percentage of number of team who did human practice projects in each region is different from one another.
Projects Done for Each Type in Each Year
.
Fig 5.1 Number of human practice projects done each year
Fig 5.2 Number of human practice projects done for each type each year
Fig 5.3 Number of human practice projects done each year for each type
The number of human practice projects in each type is estimated to be growing in number in the past years. Taking the data from graph 5.1, the amount of human practice projects done has increased more than expected. This may be caused by the growing trend of synthetic biology and the increase in the importance of human practice projects. Graph 5.2 describes the amount of projects done in each type from the year 2008 to 2013. The observation from the graph can conclude that the amount of projects done in every type increased in every year.
Graph 5.3 also shows the number of projects done in each type from 2008 to 2013. From this graph, it is suggested that from 2011 to 2013, talks has been the most favourable types of projects. It is estimated that half of the total projects of each types occurred in 2013. This may prove that the number of human practice projects is increasing at an acceleration, also as given from graph 5.1. By observing the correlation between the "

pHluorin2
BBa_K2689000
pHluorin2 is a ratiometric, pH-dependent GFP. Its excitation spectrum varies as the pH increases/decreases. This allows pHluorin2 to be used as an accurate biosensor. A special use case is the tracking of proteins that move between different cell compartments and encounter varying pH environments. Compared to pHluorin, pHluorin2 additionally shows higher fluorescence levels. It was developed by Matthew Mahon.
While GFP itself shows a relatively stable fluorescence behavior across a wide pH range (at least too stable to be quantified easily), a look at the chromophore suggests that quite a lot of acid-base chemistry is influencing the fluorescence. Because those reactions are confined to the inner core of GFPs beta barrel structure, the solvent pH does not affect the chromophore in a easily quantifiable way. The idea behind pHluorins is to exploit these characteristics and change the structure of GFP in a way that it interfaces the internal reactions to the solvent pH so that it has a direct influence on their fluorescence behavior. For this purpose Miesenböck, et al. performed a directed mutagenesis approach in which they developed two forms of pH-dependent GFPs: Ecliptic and ratiometric pHluorin.
These pHluorins show a marked difference in their absorption spectra when encountering different ambient pH. The wild type form of GFP has a bimodal excitation spectrum with two peaks at about 395nm and 475nm. While the ecliptic variants of pHluorin show a decreased fluorescence signal with lower pH, the ratiometric pHluorins show a more complex pattern: With lower pH, the absorption at 395nm decreases while the absorption at 475nm increases. This is a key attribute for using it as a fluorescent pH probe.
Syntaxin1A
BBa_K2689001
Syntaxins are nervous-specific integral membrane proteins involved in membrane fusion. They possess a C-terminal transmembrane domain, a SNARE domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain. Syntaxin-1A is involved in ion channel regulation and synaptic exocytosis. It interacts with SNAP25 and Synaptobrevin-2 to form the SNARE complex. This complex formation brings vesicle membrane and cell membrane into close proximity, which leads to merging of both membranes. In neuronal cells, synaptic vesicles store neurotrans"

We visited the fire station to get more information about the fire extinguishing principles for our project, and we also learned that how terrible the fire disaster could be. The firefighters taught us that there is no possible to prevent all conflagrations, but we can make great effort to prevent or reduce the damage. During this workshop, we not only benefited from it for fire-related knowledge, but also came up with some ideas for our project. Hopefully, our project could let the public understand the fire and its dangerous behavior as well as make good application for fire security in the future.
During this summer, a special guest, Prof. David Westenberg visited us from Missouri University of Science & Technology, and  he is a co-advisor of Missouri-Rolla iGEM team. We introduced to him about our project and demonstrated our fire-burning experiments. We discussed with Prof. David about how we can further not only improve our project, but also outreach to the public. Afterwards, he told some stories about his school and his iGEM team'92s project, which we were all inspired by their creativity and its application. It was a unique and thought-provoking experience for both teams, and we looked forward to more interactions with other iGEMers.
This summer vacation, we attended to the iGEM Asia conference at NCTU in Taiwan. At first, we were really nervous because there were only three high school teams, while the others were all collegiate teams. However, we became more confident and prepared as we practiced our presentation repeatedly. We came across many amazing ideas and spent a lot of time discussing with other teams during the conference. The iGEM Asia Conference was not only a chance to make friends, but also an experience to share innovative ideas with people.
  At first, a group of Taichung students planned to bike around the countryside of Taiwan which is originally an entertaining trip. Then, we came up with an idea which is popularizing our project and hope to reinforce kids’ concept of bio-technique. More than that, this can also arouse their interest and creativity in this field.

Vecteur cellulaire
Le vecteur cellulaire a pour fonction d’atteindre la cellule cible et de transfecter l’insert génique thérapeutique .
Il doit posséder certaines caractéristiques pour être un vecteur de ciblage cellulaire efficace. Il doit cibler spécifiquement le type cellulaire d’intérêt, celui à soigner. En tant que vecteur de type phagique, il doit être capable de passer la membrane de la cellule eucaryote et y délivrer son contenu de manière efficace.
Vous allez pouvoir découvrir au cours de ce chapitre sur quelles caractéristiques nous nous sommes basés pour choisir le meilleur bactériophage.
Puis, vous découvrirez plus en détails ses propriétés au travers des différentes contraintes imposées par le DVS concernant sa délivrance tissulaire , l’encapsidation du plasmide thérapeutique et le ciblage cellulaire.

Bio Diversity
Climate change's’ effect on biodiversity
Although climate change in itself does not threaten biodiversity, the aftermath of climate change have severe consequences, such as habitat destruction or loss, which is the greatest threat to biodiversity within a few decadesLeadley, P., Pereira, H.M., Alkemade, R., Fernandez-Manjarres, J.F., Proenca, V., Scharlemann, J.P.W. et al.

Published by the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Montreal, p. 1–132. Technical Series no. 50.. It could lead to migration and/or directional selection, which would affect ecosystems and their function. Should a species disappear from an ecosystem, it would have a negative effect on the fitness of any specie that depends on that species Koh, Lian Pin, et al. ""Species coextinctions and the biodiversity crisis."" science 305.5690 (2004): 1632-1634. . This can already be seen in flowers that have specific pollinators, where the petals have changed phenotype as a result of climate change Toby Kiers, E., et al. ""Mutualisms in a changing world: an evolutionary perspective."" Ecology letters 13.12 (2010): 1459-1474. . This results in a mismatch between pollinators and flowers, leading to one or both having a decrease in fitness.
The consequences is not limited to local ecosystems, whole biomes can be affected. Large portions of Amazonian rainforest could be replaced by tropical savannah, and boreal forests can be expected to expand at the expense of tundra biomes Lapola, David M., Marcos D.

AGTTTAAAGGGAGTCGGCGGAACTCT
Probe designed by our team for Cas 12a. PAM on the large loop of the amplicon. Single base mismatch on the stem with respect to the target miRNA sequence.
Note: The sequences of the probes include a phosphate group at the 5' end (in order to ligate the probes). We nonetheless always ordered the oligonucleotides without the phosphate (because the cost was significantly lower) and                             then performed phosphorylation by means of T4 Polynucleotide Kinase prior to ligation.
For each probe we ran an analysis of the secondary structure by means of available servers online ( NUPACK , MFold ): in all cases the structure of the probe, of its amplicon and of the series of 4-5 copies of the amplicon                             were tested in order to check the absence of unwanted secondary structures. We also used RNAstructure DuplexFold to test the secondary structure of the dimer probe/miRNA: we were not able to find a more suitable tool for                             the analysis of the duplex; nonetheless we believe that this server, despite its limitations with respect to our analysis (no possibility of having a circular probe, no possibility to have a DNA/RNA dimer), was enough to show                             qualitatively the interaction between our probe and let-7a.
SYBR Green I
Two main alternatives are suitable in order to test the efficacy of Rolling Circle Amplification ( Deng et al., 2014 ; Qiu et al., 2018 ). First of all, the amplicons can be tested by means of an agarose gel to verify the size; nonetheless, this method shows some limitations because of the large size of the amplicons.
A more valid alternative is instead to perform a real-time fluorescence measurement by means of SYBR Green I.
SYBR green I is an intercalating dye that preferentially binds to minor grooves of double-stranded (dsDNA) ( Zipper et al., 2004 ). It has also been shown to bind to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and RNA (for which instead SYBR Green II is a more suitable option ( Sigma-Aldrich )), but with a significantly lower performance ( Vitzthum et al., 1999"

Add 600 ml of MQ water + 120 ml of NH4OH (5:1 ratio) in a glass container A (staining bath). Put the container on a hot plate and wait until it reaches 80°C (Set it to 500 initially in the Arec TC until it reaches 80-90°C and then dial down the knob to 350°C; it usually takes about 20 minutes to reach 80°C). Monitor the temperature of the solution using the thermometer from the incubator chamber in the PDMS room.
Add 150 ml of $H_2O_2$ to glass container A.
Add the glass slides into the metallic holder.
Add the holder with the slides into the glass container A. Microscope glass slides must be from VWR with cut edges (ECN 631-1550, 50/pk).
Incubate for 30 minutes.
Take out glass slides and let it cool for 5 minutes.
Let the glass container A cool down also for 5-10 minutes. Dispose the solution into the base aqueous water when the solution has cooled down to room temperature. Rinse it with MQ water and dry it as it will be used in the next step to store the dried glass slides.
Fill the other glass container B with MQ water and load the glass slides into it.
Dry each glass slides with nitrogen and put them into the other glass container A.

DTU-Denmark,2014,Team:DTU-Denmark#Methods#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," that have been actively involved in the laboratory work have received a general safety instruction to the laboratory, in which we have carried out the main part of our research for the iGEM project, by team advisor Ali Altintas prior to starting the work. We also identified when to use personal safety gear such as gloves, safety glasses etc.
In Denmark all laboratories are classified according to the organisms that are handled and different requirements apply to the different laboratories. At DTU, local safety groups are responsible for the safety in the laboratories in the different research groups and departments. These groups specify the rules that every researcher need to follow during their work, and the laboratories are frequently checked by the Danish Working Environment Authority.
On top of the aforementioned division of laboratories into different classes, the laboratories we worked in was also divided into different areas according to what to work with: LAF-bench for sterile work, fume hood for handling of volatile and organic solvents, an area for gel-electrophoresis and gel-analysis due to the involvement of ethidium-bromide etc. For more details see our safety form .
Knowing Your Organism
GMO or not, you should always know the characteristics of the organism you work with. Is it a human pathogen, does it produce any harmful secondary metabolites, is it a GMO etc.? These are all relevant questions that need to be addressed prior to entering the laboratory. In our project we work exclusively with E. coli. The strains we work with are GMOs but with a generally regarded as safety status, meaning that the health risks involved in working with them are minimal. Furthermore these strains will not survive well in nature, but extensive care should still be taken to ensure that they do not escape the laboratory.
Thus the main safety concern when working with these organisms is to keep all GMO material inside GMO designated areas (i.e. the laboratory). Rule number one in preventing GMO escape to the environment is to carefully wash hands before leaving the laboratory and never wear lab coats outside the lab area. Furthermore overcoats, cell phones, bags etc. are not allowed in any laboratory. Another concern is the disposal of GMO waste. All trash that has been in contact with GMOs must be thrown out in special GMO trash containers. The bags from these containers are emptied regularly into locked containers from where they are transported by special transports to get properly disposed of.
Liquid cultures of GMO are disposed of in separate containers and treated with perfektan. The concentration of perfektan needed and the exposure time of perfektan to the liquid GMO cultures depends on the culture mix. Specific instructions can be found here ."

SUMBAWAGEN PROJECT OVERVIEW
Background
Biotechnology Faculty, Sumbawa University of Technology (SUT) was a new university, establish at May 2013 in Sumbawa Regency of West Nusa Tenggara Province of Indonesia. An Island located in east part of Indonesia.
As the impact of the geographical position according to the capital city of Indonesia which located Java island, Sumbawa has limited accessibility to the economic and education sector. There are only two university in Sumbawa, and the SUT in the one and the only technology university in Sumbawa which has Biotechnology Faculty as their prime major, especially in eastern part of Indonesia.

Which these such condition Sumbawagen team started their project from the very fresh beginning. The basic reason that motivated the Sumbawagen team is back to their first survey on introducing synthetic biology to Sumbawa society at 2013. Based on the survey results we had conclusion that most of Sumbawa people are already in touch with various of biotechnology product in their daily life. On the other side this fact does not goes in the same direction with the understanding of Sumbawa society to the biotechnology products. This condition lead our team to go deeper into the topic which involves synthetic biology and the development prospect among  Sumbawa society.

Project: Crispy CRISPR's
Project Background:
Nitrosospira multiformis, a key microbe in sewage treatment centers using the activated sludge process, suffers a high rate of bacteriophage induced lysis(7). Between the high titer of bacteriophage found in sewage, prophage incorporated into its genome, and its natural slow rate of growth, N. multiformis does not reach high concentrations in bio-reactors(7). To combat the prevalence of bacteriophage infection we have cloned the CRISPR 3 system found in Streptococcus thermophilus LMD-9 into N. multiformis(6). Using a novel spacer region we will specifically target three prophage that reside in N. multiformis' genome. The CRISPR 3 system has been shown to acquire additional phage spacers and will provide adaptive immunity to N. multiformis(1).

The wet-lab data showed that the model was correct in its prediction, as a large signal-to-noise ratio was only seen when the system contained more reporter cells than detector and processor cells. Click here to go to the experimental testing for this system.
Discussions and Conclusions
As shown above, the model correctly predicted that the system worked most optimally when the reporter cells were in excess of both the detector and processor cells. One of the reasons that this configuration was the best may be because of signal amplification at each of the quorum sensing communication stages. The quorum sensing mechanism used here is the acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) system in gram negative bacteria. This system works by one cell producing a quorum sensing molecule which can diffuse out through its membrane. Once the extracellular space reaches a certain threshold concentration of AHL molecule, the AHL will begin to diffuse into other cells in the community. If the cell the AHL molecule enters has the appropriate transcription factor present (e.g. LasR for the C12 AHL), then transcription of a gene under the control of the pLas promoter can occur. Therefore, if background expression of the AHL is high enough to reach above the threshold level, then expression of the next quorum sensing molecule in another cell (in this case C4 AHL) will occur. By reducing the amount of detector and processor cells present in the system, the background expression levels of C12 and C4 will be lower, and hence expression of sfGFP by the reporter cell will be lower.
Future Work
The Simbiotics tool has many extra functions that could be useful in aiding the design of Sensynova biosensors. One of the features in the ability to organise cells in a pattern on a 2-dimensional surface (figure 13). This would allow modelling of the spatial organisation of the three cell type on a test dip-stick, which could be used similarly to tests such as litmus paper (for detecting pH), or pregnancy tests (for detecting human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG]). This may or may not provide a more optimal system for the biosensor compared to a mixed community in solution. Unfortunately, there was not time to complete this analysis.

Currently, we don’t compare SR proteins to casein or wool on fire retardant efficiency. Because the cost and time to purify SR proteins are still problems for us so far. We are looking for companies who might have interests in fire retardant bio-materials sponsoring us to solidify our discovery.
 
In summary, our work is a proof-of-concept study of finding and verifying a novel fire retardant natural protein candidate of SR protein through data mining and flame test. Casein and wool have been proved as natural, non-toxic fire retardant bio-materials. And both of them have been patented. The SR protein we found could be the next-generation biomaterial for studying fire retardant effectiveness."

Digestion of G2.3,G3.3 started with Sac1. Double digest not possible because 12 nucleotide spacer isn't sufficient to use bulky and tightly binding HF enzymes. Solution is to do one digestion, purify, then digest again with the other enzyme.

Ashlee sent the L6 prepared plasmid for sequencing, just to check whether the latter part of dCas9 was inserted. If the complete system was not inserted, we would not be able to use this plasmid as a template to create the overlap 3 region. We ran the digestion of the L6 backbone on a gel and it was the correct size, 9.5 kb. We also made Kan 30 plates and made new DNA ladder aliquot. Ashlee ligated the Lambda Red Recombinase system into the L6 backbone for an overnight, 18 hour ligation.
Cultures from yesterday were plasmid prepped: 4 cultures of G5.4 (7/18 plating), 2 cultures from new G4 (7/29 ligation product), 2 cultures from old G4 (7/18 plating), one culture G2.3 and one culture G3.3 (both 7/18 plating). All plasmid prep successful. Analytical digestion of G5.4 (7/18 plating), G4.1 and G4.2 (7/30 plating), G4.1 and G4.2 (7/18 plating), G5.3 (from 7/18), G1.1,1.2,1.3,1.4,1.5,1.6 (from 7/27 plating), G5.4 (7/18 plating). Analytical digestion is shorter (~3 hours with HF enzymes) and will be used to check for correct bands. G2.3, G3.3 digested with longer digestion protocol to prepare for dRBS insertion. This isn’t possible with a double digest because of the short spacer between the two sites, so a sequential approach is used. Then, G2.3 and G3.3 ligated with the annealed dRBS oligos. DNA purified, then cells transformed.

Then, in order to enhance the functionality of MFC device, we get further to introduce a B. subtilis strain with higher output of riboflavin into the co-culture system. Finally, the electrical output reaches 520 mV.
Future work
First, we will construct and characterize the system of acid sensing and orthogonal targeted protease degradation which can be an effective tool in regulating the relationship in synthetic microbe consortia. Additionally, we will reduce the volume of our MFC device with power generation unchanged, so that it will increase current density. We will also make improvements in Shewanella for more electricity output. We intend to weaken any other unrelated functions except for power production in Shewanella and using co-culture system to produce necessary nutrition for its survival.

We electroporated pA13AM into DH5α and plated on ampicillin infused plates. We will know if the transformation was successful by the presence of red colonies as a result of mRFP in the plasmid. We found that our construction of pC13AY failed after running a digest screen as none of the lanes displayed bands at around 3kb, which corresponds to inserted PtrpC and T7 polymerase and 2kb corresponding to the vector. However, the gel may have been showing unique banding patterns for the construct, so another gel will be run to check for any supercoiling or linearized plasmids. We also submitted our constructs pC13BF and pC13BG for sequencing. Colony PCRs were done for pAK13AB, pAK13AC, and pAK13BB. A few pAK13AC and pAK13BB colonies were successful.

Light Control
    To achieve the function of the first generation of our cipher machine, our bacteria should be sensitive enough to the light signal around specific wavelength long and output a fluorescent signal which should be strong  enough to be detected. So we designed several experiments to prove the sensitivity and reliability of the two TCSs.     Firstly, we chose sfGFP as the reporter and exposed our bacteria to red or green light when culturing. After some time, we harvested all the culture and measured the fluorescent intensity .     What’s more , to make our cipher machine more complicated and hard to be cracked, we induced the oscillation circuit. But the key to couple these parts was to prove that the time our “light-sensors” need between sensing the light and output a signal was exactly shorter than the half-period of oscillation. So we tried to measure this delay time of the two TCSs. We also tried to stimulate this process by modeling.     Here we want to show our sincere appreciation to Team HZAU who had provided us with original plasmids the paper used, also to Team XJTLU who had designed the device for culturing the bacteria and measuring the fluorescent intensity.
Logic gate
    In order to validate the feasibility of the logic gate part, we designed experiment from the following aspects.     
1. Qualitative experiment
        We set 4 experimental groups and 1 control group to validate the logic gate qualitatively. The control group is MG1655 without plasmid that contains the logic gate circuit transformation. The 4 experimental groups are MG1655 with target plasmid transformation. And the treatments are: 1) adding nothing, 2)"

Abstract
Biological systems are unique in their ability to combine information and energy to generate complex entities. Genetically encoded networks drive many of these patterning processes. Furthermore, developmental studies have highlighted the importance of gradient formation and cell-cell communication for the generation of cellular patterns in the early stages of life. It has been shown that simple networks can form both static and dynamic patterns. Nonetheless, a system whose pattern formation is dependent on combinations of multiple signals has yet to be demonstrated. Here we address this question by designing a network, involving two different quorum-sensing based signaling mechanisms. Upon introduction in E.coli, the system can sense the relative amounts of two input molecules. Using a pre-defined set of rules, which was selected on its ability to generate spatial patterns, the cell can then express its final state by emitting red or green fluorescence and transmit its state to its neighbors.
Towards an  in-vivo self organizing system...
In recent years, quorum sensing has been of wide-spread interest in synthetic biology. The ability for populations of cells to communicate in such a way that they either relay information or create specific patterns in culture is one which has been used in several studies. Some have relied on two different cell populations (BALAGADDE et al, 2008; BASU et al, 2005) to engineer novel in vitro behavior.
The idea of the project is to build a system which uses two different quorum sensing systems of molecules that enable the cell to integrate three different levels of signal, and emit a different response according to a predetermined rule-set, producing a given fluorescent protein and a quorum sensing molecule.
Our project uses a single population of cells, which all contain the same genetic information. Thus, the different behavior of the sub-populations will only be dictated by neighboring sub-populations.
We also take advantage of the high-level engineering competences found in our Institute (EPFL) by using microfluidic devices in order to culture the cells in an ordered and controllable manner. Furthermore, this will also permit to have control on"

Liam Nolan:
Studying: Bachelors of Science/Engineering(Chemical and Biological)
Interests: Research, piano, choir(x2), soccer, tennis, and everything nerdy...
In his spare time: Spare time? SPARE time?!
Other: Perhaps a little too enthusiastic about cards, Monty Python and Black Books for his own good.
Tom Partridge:
Studying: Bachelor of Biotechnology(Majoring in Microbial Biotechnology) Interests: Besides from being a self-confessed cricket fanatic I love to travel having recently visited Europe and Japan. iGEM has sparked my interest in research as until now I have had only little hands-on experience in the lab. The most exciting aspect of synthetic biology to me is the potential for new and innovative solutions to global problems. I am most interested in the bacteriology/virology aspect of microbial biotechnology and plan to undertake a research project over the summer holidays involving ecology and diagnosis of emerging infectious diseases. In my spare time I love to play cricket, rugby, soccer and squash.
Robert Brennan:
Studying: Bachelor of Biomedical Science, Specialising in Human Genetics
About me: Essentially I live for science and knowledge in general, this is why I jumped at the chance to involve myself in the iGEM competition.  For a few years now I have seen genetics as the most interesting aspect of biology, closely followed by virology and microbiology in general.  At the moment I could think of nothing better than being able to continue on after my degree into postgrad work, such as a PhD, in the same field.
Tam Nguyen:
About me: I am a Vietnamese... Only came to Australia for 3 years and have known about serious research for only 1.5 years... But now, I know, for sure, research is significant and interesting to me.
Studying:Bachelor of biomedical science (Major in Microbiology-Immunology and Physiology (subject to be changed!)).
Interest:Would love to know as much as about cancer and involvement of microorganism in causing cancer. I am really fascinated by what tiny virus can do on our body. And how our body works as a system, and how it defends against microbial enemy, that's always great to know about...That's all about science interest.In my spare time, well I mean real real spare time, can do anything except reading lecture notes and writing reports.
Near future plan:Really looking forward to a summer research course in micro-immune field.

INTRODUCTION
Collaborations between research teams are one of the main bases of today’s scientific world. On several occasions teams obtain precious data with the cooperation of other groups that otherwise would be almost unlikely to get. Thus they will be able to solve certain difficulties as well as help in global research.
Therefore we determined to contact with several teams in order to help them with their projects, just as to contribute spreading SynBio, and complementing also our project making it even better.
CARDIFF WALES
Cardiff team is moving several stimuli-induced plant promoters to Phytobricks standard. After an skype video conference, we decided to send them our pathogen inducible promoter with luciferase reporter (Pr-1a:Luciferase:Tnos). Since both teams use GoldenBraid system assembly, modularity and standardization is guarantee.
COLOGNE-DUESSELDORF
As part of their postcard exchange, we designed and sent them a postcard about ChatterPlant to deliver them to the rest of the teams who took part on this exchange. Later we received a package with several postcards of many different teams. They are all amazing! They also helped us by sending us the regulation about transgenics in Germany, which will help us in our human practices.
UCHILE BIOTEC
As we share the same native language, we ask them to take part in iGEM connecta, our YouTube channel in which we pretend expand Synbio knowledge among spanish-speaking countries. With this, they had the chance to publish a video explaining their current project so they could promote it. On the other hand, they helped us by generating new content which will be very useful to spread SynBio knowledge"
Dundee,2015,Team:Dundee#Forensic Toolkit#Fingerprints_-_-_TEXT.html," unexplored field in forensic sciences. This is due to the lack of reliability of proposed techniques. It has been suggested in theory, it may be possible to age fingerprints based on quantitative changes of kinetic compounds found in fingerprints.
Following the information obtained from the modelling team, squalene was found to be the best compound to target within the fingerprint. Squalene was found to be present up to 21 days once the fingerprint was deposited. When talking to fingerprint experts it was suggested that it would be more beneficial to identify a component that could narrow down the age of a fingerprint to one week or less. Squalene is an intermediate in the pathway to the production of Cholesterol and looking down from squalene we identified squalene epoxide.Lanosterol synthase is an enzyme that converts squalene epoxide to lanosterol in the pathway from squalene to cholesterol (Fig 2).
Figure 2 -Components involved in the second step of the pathway from Squalene to Cholesterol. A. Squalene epoxide configuration, steroid downstream from squalene. B. Lanosterol synthase crystal structure, the enzyme that converts squalene epoxide to lanosterol. C. Lanosterol configuration, the steroid donstream fro squalene epoxide.
Using fluorescent microspheres, we would like to detect the presence of squalene epoxide through the use of its specific enzyme lanosterol synthase. By fusing lanosterol synthase to the fluorescent nanobead, when applied to a fingerprint the nanobead would bind to squalene epoxide, if present, and therefore fluoresce (Fig 3). The current procedure of detecting quantities of chemical compounds in fingerprints is gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Despite the accuracy the current technique provides it comes with the flaw that it completely destroys the fingerprint evidence. A fluorescent biosensor device comes with the advantage of keeping the evidence intact for other analyses.
Figure 3 -Using nanobeads to target squalene epoxide (S.E) contained in the fingerprint to age the print.  S.E is present up until the 7th day after deposition and therefore a fingerprint can be roughly aged. The concentration of S.E increases over the first 5 days as well leading to the possibility of narrowing it down more closely.
Results
Firstly, Human Lanosterol Synthase (LSS) was optimised for expression in E.coli and modified to ensure it was compatible with BioBrick specifications and standards. This gene was then synthesized by IDT ("

Conferences and Debates
The 29th May, 2018, we organized a series of talks on the theme of ethics in science and potential                         misuse of biological research. These talks were open to public but we focused on biological student                         in order to increase awareness for future researchers and engineers.
The first speech was given by Mr. Marc Mainguené in the name of the foundation Anthony Mainguené who                         aim to arise ethical consciousness in the society and promote new ethical behavior especially in management. Mr. Mainguené gave us philosophical definition of ethic and an overview of development                         axis in order to promote ethical way to lead project by forecasting impact on society and integrate                         project among stakeholder. See more at http://www.fondation-anthonymainguene.org/
The second talk was given by Mr. Patrice Binder, expert in biosecurity specialized in the issue of dual                         use of biotechnologies and biological weapons proliferation. During his talk Mr Binder gave us specific                         and detailed case of misuse of biological research for biological weapon production. This speech                         allowed us to better understand potential risks associated with any synthetic biology project.
All thoses talks, along with the discussion that we had with each of them, allowed us to understand the                         stakes that comes with the creation of any synthetic biology project like iGEM. It was very interesting                         to hear many differents perspective and we hope this knowledge about ethics will help us to lead                         our projects better in the future and maybe to be some slightly better scientists."

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#human#essay_-_-_TEXT.html," highly interesting to explore in details different conceptions of complexity in scientific and non-scientific fields.
An interesting interview is not self-evident. It is advisable to practice the dialogue before the real interview so as to make full use of the meeting with the interviewee. Recording the interviews could provide raw material of interest.
Outreach
We managed to have diverse outreach projects targeting several population groups, from high school students to elder people.
If outreach is an interesting task in itself, it could be advisable to stick to a more strictly defined theme or topic to be more consistent. For instance, focusing on activities for a certain age group or on media outreach through television, audio and newsletter could give a coherent whole and give rise to multiple interpretations.
Literature Work
Defining a question to answer is a difficult starting point. One has to screen literature hoping to find interesting, promising hints. Being mentored in the first part could avoid a team to go into a dead end.
As many iGEM teams we were extremely busy with our project. Reading of scientific literature on the topic of human practice is probably one of the first things to be missed out. Doing a weekly journal club on human practice could broaden the horizon of all team members and allow them to discover interesting new points of view.

Warsaw,2014,Team:Warsaw#HP_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM Team took part in Festiwal Nauki (Science Festival)– an annual event held all over Warsaw, organized since 1997. The aim of the Festival is to talk, show and share science with the entire society, to gain social endorsement for further progress of science in Poland. It is also an opportunity for anyone to do science on their own – by taking part in discussions, lectures, workshops, shows and many more events held every day for 10 days.
As a Team, we prepared two things for this occasion: workshop called “Design your own gene” and a stand devoted to synthetic biology and recycling. On our stand we were showing in simple ways what is synthetic biology and what we can do with it. We were also talking about our project, showing that not only bacteria can be used for recycling, but that it is also possible to use some basic trash to create something useful or pretty – like newspaper baskets or crayon boxes from milk containers. Most of our listeners there where young children.
The bioinformatics workshop was dedicated to older listeners, who already knew a little about biology. We were trying to show them what synthetic biology is and how the process of genetical engineering really looks like. Listeners where given a basic program that would show them if the sequence created by them will work as a gene.
This event was a very important part of our Human Practice, where we could meet our target people face-to-face. Overall, Science Festival was a great experience for us and an amazing way to meet and talk with people about synthetic biology and our project. Both children and adults seemed fascinated by the idea of bacteria recycling lanthanides and many people said they are looking forward to see our project become everyday reality.

Purdue,2015,Team:Purdue#TheProblem_-_-_TEXT.html,"reatment, lime and other alkali pretreatment processes, and AFEX (Ammonia Fiber/Freeze Explosion) pretreatment. All of these methods require extremely high temperatures (120 - 300 C), pressures (up to 400 psig), or use expensive chemicals. The high costs of pretreatment for lignocellulosic biomass make second generation biofulel produciton a costly and less efficient process compared to production of first generation biofuels (Mosier).
Digestion itself can be divided into two categories: Mesophilic digestion and thermophilic digestion. Mesophilic digestion is more energy efficient as it can be done between 20 and 40 degrees Celsius; however, the entire process takes up to two months. Mesophilic digestion is often done in batch reactors. These batch reactors are single chamber vessels with an agitator at the bottom and a metal jacket used for heating or cooling. For mesophilic biodigestion, there are batch reactors for each step (pretreatment, digestion, and fermentation). These reactors are left alone after material is added until the reaction is completed. Once one step is done the mixture is moved to a different batch reactor for the next step (Kleijntjens).
Meanwhile, thermophilic produces more biofuel in a much shorter time period, but comes with higher energy costs to maintain an environment between 50 and 65 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, bioreactors capable of thermophilic digestion are more expensive and the bacteria are more sensitive to environmental changes (Petri).
The Processing/Filtration step involves preparing the desired biofuel for use after the process is complete. For ethanol bioreactors this step would involve distillation while for biogas this step would involve scrubbers in order to remove CO2 and impurities. This step varies largely for different types of biofuel but is not dependent on the input material.
Reuse or Disposal of solids is the final step in biodigestion. The solids left over are very nutrient rich making them perfect for use as fertilizer. However, if there are toxins present in the byproduct it must be disposed of in biohazard waste containers (Petri).
