BNU-China,2018,Team:BNU-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," we improved our protocol. Firstly, we used M9 media with equal IPTG added to ensure a reliable outcome. No antibiotics was added to the media. Cultures were incubated overnight in LB media (liquid) with Ampicillin, and OD600 of all cultures were adjusted to the same value using an UV Spectrophotometer. We then diluted the cultures to 10 or 50 times using antibiotic-free media and incubated them in a shaker (37°C, 200rpm). By measuring the OD600 value of samples taken under proper timing, growth curves of different strains could thus be drawn (Fig. 9c and Fig 9d). Conclusively, we found that the strain with GDH gene grew faster than others, while the wild-type one took the second place. The strain with an empty vector transformed grew the lowest, which behaved as predicted, for an additional metabolic burden was added. These results showed GDH does promote the growth of bacteria.
Thus far, the verification of the ability of promoting bacteria’s growth of GDH had been finished. However, our final goal was to make the strain with GDH grows faster than those without a target gene, and becomes the dominant population of the system accordingly. Combining previous works and our data, some discussions are made as follows. We can see from Fig. 9c and 9d that overexpressed GDH helped in the increase of K value, while previous articles showed that dry weight of those with GDH overexpressed accumulated more during the same amount of time. Therefore, we could conclude that overexpressed GDH can improve the metabolic efficiency of bacteria, and such a character has the ability to resist the problem of target strain’s degeneration caused by the unequal distribution of plasmids. Meanwhile, in a fermentation system with vast amount of strains, those with higher metabolic efficiency can be seen as more “advantageous”. However, to what extent can the overexpression of GDH resist the trend of degeneration of strains with target genes remains unknown. The key to this problem is to validate the ability of GDH in keeping target genes. Hence, two tasks are needed to be carried out in this module: 1. Verify if GDH has the ability to keep target genes. 2. Build a persuasive model to answer the question stated above (To what extent can the overexpression of GDH resist the trend of degeneration of strains with target genes?).

Gates
BBa_K1132001 : AND gate with recombinases switching gene regulatory sequences
This AND gate was built with one promoter-terminator couple surrounded by the Bxb1 integrase sites and a second terminator surrounded by the Tp901.1 integrase sites. This system is designed to be activated only in the presence of both recombinases (transcription of the output gene). The switch is permanent.
The input signals for this gate are the production of either one or both integrases Bxb1 and Tp901.1. The output can be choosen at will by assembling this biobrick to any ORF containing an RBS site. We also designed a test Biobrick of the gate ( BBa_K1132031 ) with the RFP protein as output.
This gate can be used in any regulation system, provided that the recombinases are assembled following the promoter of your choice with your specific regulations requirements. For example, if you want to activate the gate in presence of aTc and AHL, you just have to put the recombinase after the promoter activated by LuxR/AHL ( BBa_R0065 ) and the promoter activated by aTc under the repression of"
Edinburgh,2010,Team:Edinburgh#Bacterial#Red light sensor_-_-_TEXT.html,"aved to form a yellow dye that can be easily visualised and absorbance measurements can be taken. This can be used as a direct measure of lacZ activity as lacZ encodes for β-Galactosidase and when ONPG is in excess the production of the visible yellow dye can be measured over time to shown lacZ activation and control via promoter systems.
The absorbance at 420nm was divided by the time taken for the colour of o-nitrophenyl to become visible and was used to calculate a rate of expression.
This preliminary Miller-like assay shows limited useful characterisation date of the red light sensor (RLS) system, and is a good start towards accurate characterisation of the system, which we hope to continue now that a preliminary methodology has been found and tested.
The envZ – RLS.lacZ.YFP (light / dark) cultures did not produce Miller-like results, as was expected and have such not been included in the graphs, they were however run as a negative control to prove that any effects seen were not due to an artefact from the envZ mutant.
Though the data is not entirely useful we believe it may be due to a number of potential causes – such as the cofactor not being expressed properly, weak light intensity unable to activate the RLS system, or insufficient expression of the system as a whole - all of which we could test for given sufficient time, allowing us to improve our experimental technique to account for accordingly. We will endeavour to do so and bring further results to the Jamboree.

Collaborations
Engaging Experts
High impact projects with consequences affecting whole humanity should always be discussed with professionals with different scientific backgrounds. To meet this goal we talked to theologists, legal professionals, safety representatives, astrophysicists, and experts in the field of medicine, agriculture, information technology and many more. Check out the professionals who shaped our project!
Expert Interviews
Safety
Although phages are volatile and challenging to work with, it is feasible to handle them safely provided that they are handled with good laboratory practice and great awareness. To do so, we informed ourselves about environmental and personal protection measures and created special phage-spaces in the lab to reduce contamination risk.
Safety and Security
Education
Inciting interest of young people to shape the next generation of scientists is a core mission of our Human Practice activities. We held an iGEM seminar at a local high school and hosted a school class from Berlin for a course on responsible genetic engineering in our lab. On top, we educated a high school student for a two weeks internship at our lab.
Education
Engagement
The iGEM competition inspired us to reach out, listen, talk and engage with the public. In this spirit, we hosted an inspiring public lecture by Kevin Esvelt, went to TEDx Heidelberg and engaged with the people via our game “evolutionary wheel-of-fortune” and our “Synthetic Biology Wishing Box”. Finally, we created an animated video, explaining evolution and our project in a broadly comprehensible way.
Public Engagement
Responsibility
Developing and improving powerful and high impact techniques in the field of directed evolution requires responsible scientists. To encounter ethical concerns and ensure that our project is not endangering the environment or humanity we thoroughly confronted ourselves and experts with critical questions according our iGEM project.

One of our team members participated his lab to learn the fabrication of microfluidic chip. Dr. Chunhui Wu is our technician who helped us to operate the equipment. We had haphazard workshops with Cheng Lab to discuss the basic principle in Material Science and improvement of our design and experience. Most interestingly, we are open to discuss the potential biological applications of microfluidic chip. We have learned a lot from workshops and fabrication process of chips.
We also consulted Prof. Yanqing Tian, a professor in Material Sciences who has research experiences in biomaterials. Therefore, we held an interview with him to consult biocompatibilities between cells and liquid reagents we used in our design. He gave us lots of useful advice for the selection of biomaterials and reagents.
Exchanging Ideas of Microfludics
On 16th, Sep 2018, we held an online interview with iGEM Team XMU-China. XMU-China made an introduction about the design of their microfluidic system. Their core design is to set up a centrifugation disk to detect the single strand DNAs as biomarkers for diseases in a cell-free system. We were interested in the basic physical principle of the flow parameters in the centrifugal force-driven microfluidic chip. Moreover, we had some communication on the modeling and wiki design.
Exchanging Ideas of Experimental Design
Our ideas first came up in the group meeting with Prof. Wei Chen during discussing the technique of Single-Cell RNA sequencing via microfluidic system as a high-throughput method. Then, we were thinking about whether the technique can be applied not only within cells but among cells. That is the original idea of the project which points out the source of a novel idea.

From March to October, we had fantastic conversations with teams and professors—especially Mr. Yuan from the university’s Art & Humanity department. Through these collaborations, we have benefited from aspects including the generation of the idea of our CCC project, the comparison we made between the public and the researchers, things we should focus on when presenting our project etc. Here, we show briefly the time when we have made significant modifications on our CCC project.

Chainability
Chainability of different transistor-like elements is the key point of our project. In fact, it is only by chaining different transistor that we can create complex logic circuits. In order to test experimentally the chainability of our biological transistors, we added an intermediate step to the production of GFP by activation: a first gRNA (\(gRNA_A\)) bound to dCas9 target a promoter which produces a second gRNA (\(gRNA_B\)) which in turn can activate the production of GFP.
Compared to simple activation, our model changes in the following ways. First of all we have now two distinct gRNAs in our system (\(\text{gRNA}_A\) and \(\text{gRNA}_B\)); this obviously imply the presence of two possible dCas9-gRNA complexes:                 \[                   \frac{d}{dt}[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_A] = R_\text{dCas9} [\text{dCas9}][\text{gRNA}_A] - D_\text{dCas9}[\text{dCas9"

Our Project
Metabolic wires are a new way of connecting logic gates in different cells – their orthogonality and extensibility means there is potentially no limit to how intelligent a population of bacteria can be.
We set out to make three sets of metabolic wires, using trans-genic aromatic enzymes, cis-genic aromatic genes, and ‘sugar logic.’ We also set out to build a population regulation system to showcase these wires, and a new set of degrons to make the system more robust.

HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Humanities#ethics#fuben_-_-_TEXT.html," to look into the source of this reaction that sometimes deemed unreasonable and most times underexplained as “doubt” or “fear” by the science-speaking people.
     It’s undeniable that the most stubborn reactions of the skeptics are doubt and fear, which are usually read as a sign of weakness either of intelligence or of character and therefore despised and dismissed. Explanations of it are usually limited to the simple words of doubt or fear and just stopped there. But fear and doubt also have their origins, and since it’s deemed irrational, then perhaps its source is irrational too. If our mind is largely composed of irrationality, then is it really necessary to speak of it as a plague instead of thinking of ways to understand it?
5. How We Incorporated the Above Framework into the Analysis
     We first locate the stage in which our question belongs to. It speaks of the output stage, and is an assessment in nature. So we trace back to possible origins of such assessment in the 3-D model.
     At the surface level, we reduced the problem to be a profit-based question that have two keywords: beneficial and malignant. Then we went down to the judgment level and classified them as good and evil. We don't need to plunge into long philosophical debates about the concept of good and evil, we only need to go one level deeper to find the emotions triggered by these concepts, in this case we only care about evil, because what's good will be good, and don't need exceptional addressing; so the key words in this level are fear and anger. The next step is identifying the origin of such emotion or attitude, and possible explanations are usually found in disciplines that study human irrationalities such as some schools of thought in psychology, literature, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, archeology, mythology, religion, theology, art, etc.
     A framework cannot substitute thinking, it is not universal and certainly it has imperfections. But thinking like this makes thinking a fun thing to do. Yes, you can do it too, and probably even better!
6. Strength and Weaknesses
     The model is good at origin digging and weaker at solution finding or future predicting; it's more aimed at deepening the understanding of a topic than actually providing a suggestion when it comes to ethical problems in synthetic biology. But it is the same with evolution and time: we can see where they come from by tracing back and recover their footsteps, but we can hardly see where they are going, so there is only one universal advice offered: better safe than sorry.
     Have fun!

We can create « pieces » of living organisms without of their context, stock, reproduce, transmit and assemble them. If we create biologic systems like we assemble “legos”, do not we risk considering living organisms, whose human, like simple assembling of pieces? And in this case, the respect that we consider to have face to them can be altered. Of course, we can consider that our creations are only biologic engines, synthetic distinctive machines of « natural » life forms.
But where is the limit between these ones and the artificial life? The way of one and the other were created change their natures? It is however necessary to qualify the impact what biological synthesis could have on the way we consider life: how reminded François Le Fèvre, when «we synthesized urea, the first organic synthetic molecule, it has an entire debate to know if we created life or not»; and, how emphases Lluis Mir, we could ask same questions at the beginning of chemistry. Two hundred years later, it can make smile.

Control of the evolution of synthetic biology products
Synthetic biology leads to the creation of living organisms which should not have exist without the human intervention and are not the fruit of a natural evolution. Will be able to control it? We are not controlling mechanism of the information storage in the living world, and we are far to be able to predict how will behave a group from its separate elements. We create parts, but will be able to predict emergent properties of their assembling? Furthermore, synthetics organisms, because they are living, evolve; will we be, asked Thierry Magnin, « in measure to control propagation of these lively engines that we construct? » Thanks to their capacity to evolve, do they risk to escape to our control? Willy Rozenbaum observe that the pression responsible of the evolution will exist even for organisms which are not due to this pression; and that « it is more performant and less nocive that will go out of this; because these presion will stay ».

The benefits/risks ratio
To assess the risks and benefits of a science, we have to wonder for what it is intended, and if the risks are taken by beneficiaries. In the case of synthetic biology, risks are taken by the society and it must be the same for benefits. The financial interest of a small community does not have to harm the majority. Currently, the scientific community manages synthetic biology, but some applications,"

Draw something is the game that one person draw some required biochemical terms like t-RNA, chromosome, and the other guess what the picture is. One who paints can't speak or write any words. Bio-hopscotch test the gamer's knowledge of biochemical reactions. You can choose lower difficulty of Draw something for five questions to match higher difficulty of Bio-hopscotch of glycolysis and Kreb's cycle.

It goes without saying that we found it important,  but also very fulfilling to present our project to our peers and connect with them trough common  interests in science.  (There is more to our efforts in presenting synthetic biology to the young, thought. Worrisome  statistics already show, that the young have become less interested in natural science in the recent  years, instead choosing to focus on social sciences, which provide a broad base for acquisition and  processing of experiences and knowledge in real life. High school students are choosing to take final  exams (Slovenian Matura) in natural sciences less, in favor of more socially engaged disciplines, like  history and psychology. Given our own passion for science we are afraid that the students were not  shown the beauty and usefulness of science.-če bi našla kakšne dejanske podatke, da tole tudi  podprem)   We took the saying Children are our future to the heart and made sure to present our project to  children and teenagers as well as adults. We made sure to not only talk about synthetic biology and  our project, but also why science is so important, what had drawn us to it and our experience with it.
PRESENTATIONS IN HIGH SCHOOLS
We had presentations in many secondary school institutions across the country, talking about our  experience and how exciting our project is to our peers. We mostly presented this to students in 3rd  and 4th year of high school, who are just choosing what subjects they should take their exams in and  what university they should apply to. We were hoping to show them that natural sciences are an  exciting and rewarding career path and to inspire and encourage them to pursue science, if that was  their wish. We were glad to see that the students were indeed interested and engaged with us during  and after presentations, asking us questions about the project, synthetic biology, the iGEM  competition and our experience with research.

Results
SDS-PAGE
Gel image indicates that there is a high degree of purity in the resulting fractionation of the cell lysate using the IMAC batch pull down method.
Gel lanes are in order from left to right: Ladder, Negative Control (laemmli sample buffer), Strip Fraction (400 mM EDTA nickel strip), 250 mM Imidazole elution, 100 mM Imidazole Elution, 50 mM Imidazole Wash, 40 mM Imidazole Wash, Unbound Lysate, Crude Lysate from Enzymatic Lysis, and a positive control (BSA - 750 ug/mL).
Gel indicates increasing purity of a protein sample at approximately 51 kDA as the washes and elutions are conducted, at the expense of critically lowering yield (this is expected using the quicker batch method, where the proteins are not uniformly collected)
Results indicate that fractions 5, 4, and 3 ought to be pooled together for concentration verification using BCA and Pierce Concentrator.
BCA pooling:
6 mL of Fractions 3 (40mM Imidazole) ,4 (100 mM), and 5 (250 mM) each were pooled into a 50mL conical for a final total of 18mL.
Pooled fractions were collected into a Pierce 20 kDA MWCO, and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 3,000x g at 22 degrees Celsius. 2mL of concentrated samples remained in the filter, and were resuspended and collected into micro centrifuge tubes.

Biobricks-
First trial - the DNA parts that were used  in Biobricks preparation are: Adiponectin (pUC 57 Adiponectin), DsbA-L (pUC 57 DsbA-L), HSP70  promotor (pUC 57 HSP70), HSP70 promotor (with modifications) (pUC 57 HSP70  modified), UCP1 (pcDNA3.1 UCP1) and pSB1C3 backbone. The process included-  transformation -> extraction and creating a glycerol  stock-> restriction-> gel electrophoresis-> gel products  extraction-> ligation-> transformation.
Details:
DNA  parts and backbone were digested with restriction enzymes: Pst1 and EcoR1
The  transformation was done according to the general  transformation protocol .
At  first, heat-shock transformation to chemically competent BH5? bacteria with the following  DNA parts (separately):
pUC 57 Adiponectin
pUC 57 HSP70
pUC 57 HSP70 modified
pUC 57 DsbA-L
pcDNA3.1 UCP1
The  transformed bacteria were incubated for 24 hr at 37?c.
After  24 hr incubation, colonies from each plate were transferred to liquid medium  and incubated for 24 hr at 37?c.
Plasmid  DNA was extracted using a miniprep kit and concentrations were measured using  nanodrop.
The  plasmids were digested with restriction enzymes Pst1 and EcoR1, following general  restriction protocol .
The  digested DNA parts were tested by gel electroporation, following general  gel electrophoresis protocol .
Results:
The  wanted bands didn’t appear on the gel.
Conclusions:
Since  the desired results didn’t appear on the gel, it was assumed that the  restriction didn’t work. The reason is probably technical inexperience of using  restriction enzymes and inappropriate pipetation and spin down absence.

Parts submitted
Posted by Elena Moreno 20/09/2011
Our parts are on their way to the MIT, accross the Atlantic ocean! Hope they have a nice trip and get there in good conditions. We wish we could've sent many exotic new biobricks, but ligations didn't go as well as expected, so we're finally sending three parts, and only one of them is in pSB1C3. Anyway, here you have a summary:
K514000: F2620 has been ligated to I732019 so that our cells can express lacZ when they detect C6-3-oxo-HSL (the quorum sensing signal produced by luxI). This way they would turn blue in an XGal-agar plate or turn yellow a liquid medium with ONPG, that's how we've tested them.
BBa_K514000
K514001: we've built a signal transductor with F2620 and C0070. The total construction is F2620+B0034+C0070+B0015, but sadly we weren't able to insert it in pSB1C3, so it's in a plasmid with kanamicine resistance. This part would detect C6-3-oxo-HSL and produce C4-HSL in response.
BBa_K514001
K514002: it's a composition of J23119 + I1466 + R0071 in pSB1A2. It works as a receptor for C4-HSL (the quorum sensing signal produced bu RhlI) and activates a specific promotor"

He had always been into cutting edge technology and loves the fact that he is able to work on biology in ways that would have been considered in the not-too-distant past. He thinks iGEM is one of the best opportunities around get undergraduate research done in a relatively young field with incredible potential. As a freshman studying Molecular and Cellular Biology he hopes one day to contribute to the scientific progress of humanity through research. Besides having interests in the sciences, he enjoys experiencing all things Sci-Fi, the cultures of East Asia, the sounds of jazz (especially those of Brazil), and the excitement of e-sports. Also Reddit. A lot of Reddit.
Anthony Chau
Anthony is a junior in Biochemistry. This is his first year in iGEM. He decided to join iGEM because he felt that synthetic biology possessed a potential that has an unprecedented power in influencing the future of biology. He wanted to apply his knowledge and imagination into building innovative biological circuits that could have novel functions and applications. The idea of working with a team of undergraduates to probe the vast potential of synthetic biology seemed truly fascinating as well. In addition, he found the iGEM logo curiously attractive. Anthony is an avid squash player. He also enjoys watching movies that make him smile, laugh, or cry. Lastly, he finds it immensely difficult to decide between a freshly prepared piece of sweet hamachi sushi or a delicately seared piece of medium-rare, rib-eye steak.

Her interest in genetic engineering and awesome science led her to the iGEM team, and she’s thrilled to be working with some of the most intelligent and passionate people she has ever met! Being a part of iGEM is also exciting because she views the future of synthetic biology to be full of novel applications in personalized medicine, humanitarian aid, biotechnology and beyond. Outside of iGEM, Asha volunteers with the Society of Women Engineers, watches Dr. Who and the Big Bang Theory with friends, dances around her dorm room, and maintains her nerd street cred through terrible jokes.

Today we talked to Ewold Verhagen, an expert on optics on nanoscales. He explained how whispering gallery modes work and how to take the small length scales compared to the wavelength into account: we should use Mie theory and not whispering gallery modes and ray tracing. Even though the size of our cavities is very small, he was really enthusiastic about our project and said: ‘This is a whole new field where there is much to discover’.
Arjen Amelink - TNO

We had a great talk with Arjen Amelink, Senior Scientist at the Optics department of TNO, one of the largest research institutes of the Netherlands. Arjen has a lot of experience in the field of micro optics and took a lot of time to brainstorm with us on how to make our project a success. We had a good discussion on to how to reach population inversion, a state where most of the fluorescent proteins are excited, so we will definitely take this into account when setting up our excitation lasers! Also, Arjen told us he was very enthusiastic about our project, but advised us to always keep a real-world application in mind, even with such a fundamental project as ours. He thought that the silicatein, that can assemble monosilica, but also metaloxides, was a promising alternative for 3D printing on microscale. We will definitely look into all these applications and hopefully our project will be useful for a wider range of applications than we already imagined!
Entrepreneurship
Introduction
We believe that it is important to think about the way to implement a synthetic biology project in real life. This is why we have decided to write a business plan about our microlens arrays (MLAs). Our MLAs can be used as encapsulation layer for solar panels resulting in improved efficiency.
We have written our business plan in three steps:

Paris_Saclay,2014,Team:Paris Saclay#Modeling#bacterial Growth_-_-_TEXT.html," \] where $N_0$ denotes the initial population size at time $t=0$.
We still find an exponential growth, but the coefficient $(\lambda-\mu)$ can now be either positive or either negative in function of the values of $\lambda$ and $\mu$.
Stochastic model
Establishment of the model
Analysis of the stochastic behaviour follows exactly the same lines as for the pure birth process, except that in the short time $(t,t+h)$, there is now a probability $\lambda h$ that a particular bacterium gives birth and a probability $\mu h$ that it dies. With a population of size $N(t)$ at sime $t$, the probability that no events ocures is therefore $1-\lambda Nh-\mu Nh$, since $h$ is assumed to be sufficiently smal to ensure that the probability of more than one event occuring in $(t,t+h)$ is negligible.
As state $N$ can be reached from states $N-1$ (by a birth), $N+1$ (by a death) or $N$ (either), we find : \[ p_N(t+h) = p_N(t)\times(1-(\lambda+\mu)N h)+p_{N-1}(t)\times\lambda(N-1)h+p_{N+1}(t)\times\mu(N+1)h+o(h) \] Dividing by $h$ and letting $h$ approach zero then yields the set of equations \[ \left\{ \begin{array}{l}    {\displaystyle \frac{dp_N}{dt}(t) = \lambda(N-1)p_{N-1}(t)-(\lambda+\mu)N p_N(t)+\mu(N+1)p_{N+1}(t)} \\    {\displaystyle p_N(0)=\delta_{N,N_0}}       \end{array}\right. \] over $N=0,1,2\ldots$ and $t\geqslant0$ on which, for $N=0$, $p_{-1}(t)$ is identically zero.

Trc Promoter
LT:BTE in puc57 was recultured in LB-Amp broth from glycerol stocks.  Cultures were minipreped and quantitated using Nanodrop spectrophotometry.
The trc promoter was isolated from pTRC99A plasmid using PCR. Products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification protocol and quantitated using Nanodrop spectrophotometry. Products were verified by running them on a 1.2% agarose gel. Results: The PCR reaction was successful. There is a band corresponding to the 100bp fragment that we expected to see.
Pyruvate Decarboxylase & Alcohol Dehydrogenase
JC:   Since 70/PDC/ADH construct is producing aldehydes at this point (PDC is working), prepared for submission to iGEM.  The construct was digested and ligated into pSB1C3 and transformed into NEB10 β cells. Selected single colonies from LB-Chloramphenicol plates and single colony streaked onto LB-Chl and LB-Amp plates to perform plasmid check. Grew liquid cultures in LB-Chl and performed minipreps and nanodrop analysis.
To confirm s70/PDC/ADH insertion into pSB1C3, 0.5ug of s70/PDC/ADH/pSB1C3 was digested with EcoRI and PstI. Digestions were run on a 1% agarose gel, and bands obtained confirmed s70/PDC/ADH (3089bp) and pSB1C3 (2070bp).
s70/PDC/ADH/pSB1C3 was sent to Nevada Genomics Center for sequencing.

VG:The digest ligation of pSB1C3 and GLF grew red and white colonies. Fifteen white colonies were selected, line streaked, and minipreped. 0.5mg of all fifteen samples were digested with EcoRI and PstI and EcoRI only to confirm a band at 1605 bp for GLF and a second band at 2070 bp for pSB1C3. The samples were run on a 1% agarose gel. All the digested samples appear correct, except for sample six.

Reporter systems
To check the expression profile of our constructs, we used two distinct methods: 1) For the dxs construct, protein fusion with a reporter gene, coupled with microscopy or FACS was used, and 2) for the HRT2 construct, Northern blots were performed. To see the results of these tests, see Characterization.
For our reporter system, we produced pSB1C3-Pcon-dxs (B. subtilis)-AmilCP ( BBa_K1088006 ). The AmilCP, however, proved to be a very poor fusion reporter gene, and we abandoned this construct to focus our attention on GFP. A number of constructs were successfully made, corresponding to  the evolution of our design outlined above (Fig. 9-11).
pSB1C3-Plac-dxs (B. subtilis)-linker-GFP was succesfully cloned and sequenced ( BBa_K1088008 ), as seen on Figure 9.
pSB1C3-Plac-dxs (E. coli)-linker-GFP was successfully cloned and sequenced ( BBa_K1088007 ), as seen on Figure 9. The gel picture shows the result of test digest with a band appearing around 5000 bp. The two constructs have been run next to each other.
pSB1C3-LacI:LVA-Plac-dxs (B. Subtilis)-linker-GFP was successfully cloned and sequenced ( BBa_K1088009 ). Figure 10 shows a test digest with the length of the insert corresponding to the expected length around 5000 bp.
pSB1C3-lacI(N)-Plac-dxs (B. Subtilis)-linker-GFP was successfully cloned and sequenced ( BBa_K1088026 ). Figure 11 shows a test digest with the length of the insert corresponding to the expected length around 4000 bp.

GLOBAL COMMUNITY BIO SUMMIT 2017
This forum is about open community related to biology and it is organized by the Community Biotechnology Initiative at the MIT Media Lab. For three days, 200 selected DIYBio activists from around the world were gathered and shared their works during the summit. We had one representative from our team who participated in the biosummit. In the forum, everyone experienced many diverse sessions and workshops. Our team also introduced this year's project and gave the workshop on how to design microfluidics chip as a continuation of last year’s project development of iGEM Uppsala. The summit covered various topics such as design, enabling technologies, biosecurity and biosafety, diversity and inclusion, creative thinkers, etc. In the forum, we got useful feedback and reached out to diverse communities around the world.
OPENHACK
OpenHack is an organized hackathon with the ambition to help solving humanitarian and social problems. This is a several days long event where aid organizations, and social actors have the possibility to connect with technical talent and coders.
During OpenHack, our team involved itself in the open community which aims to solve problems related to the refugee situation in Sweden. We engaged with programmers and people with various background. From this event we gained knowledge on how to develop an idea, and this knowledge would later prove useful during our project. We saw these days as an opportunity to introduce the field of synthetic biology to other participants and also as a fun team building activity.

PAH
Introduction
This assay allows us to quantify the amount of tyrosine in the sample, thanks to spectrophotometry. The enzyme of interest, PAH, degrades Phenylalanine into Tyrosine. By shining light at the optimal wavelength of the enzyme cofactor, we obtain absorbance readings. Using the Beer-Lambert law, we can then determine the concentration of the amino acid. Subsequently plotting this information (absorbance readings) against time, allows us to determine the activity rate of the enzyme. However, we need to assume that only the PAH enzyme is able to catalyse this reaction.
Considerations
In order to carry this assay out correctly, we need to lyse the cells to obtain what is called a crude extract. This will be a 'soup' of all proteins -including the PAH enzyme- that were contained in the bacteria. Selectiveness for Tyrosine is introduced by choosing the wavelength of the beam to be the optimal wavelength of the enzyme cofactor.
This step has been added to the protocol below in red.

Tuebingen,2013,Team:Tuebingen#Project#Receptor_-_-_TEXT.html," human mPRs can sense progesterone and structurally similar compounds like 17alpha-Hydroxyprogesterone at physiologically relevant concentrations, therefore we believe that other compounds that are related to progesterone can bind to mPRs as well. In their study on female Xenopus laevis Liu and Patiño (1993) found such a correlation between structural similarity and binding affinity.
We chose Saccharomyces cerevisiae as chassis for our biological system due to the fact that yeast possesses endogenous receptors of the PAQR family (Lyons et al., 2004) thus the apparatus for the operation of receptors of that family should be available in these organisms. In fact, Kupchak et al. (2007) showed that many PAQR proteins are able to “activate similar intracellular signaling cascades, suggesting a conserved mechanism for signal transduction”. Also, S. cerevisiae does not use progesterone in its own metabolism and does not possess any progesterone receptors thus should not interfere with our measurement system (Smith et al., 2008). Furthermore S. cerevisiae is a rather well understood eukaryote organism and offers acceptable reproduction rates. We did not consider Escherichia coli since “it is not known if PAQR receptors function the same in this organism as they do in eukaryotes” (Smith et al., 2008). All in all, S. cerevisiae is an ideal chassis organism for our measurement system.
Kupchak et al. (2007) showed that yeast PAQR proteins repress a gene called FET3 in S. cerevisiae. Knowing this, Smith et al. (2008) used the expression of FET3 as a reporter for their study of human mPRs (which were heterologically expressed in yeast) and were able to show that these mPRs, too, repress FET3. Since both yeast and human PAQR proteins reliably repress FET3 we are confident that PAQR proteins from other species will interact with the FET3 promoter, too. In fact, Zhu et al. (2003) obtained evidence that teleost fishes (like Danio rerio) employ mPRs for the induction of oocyte meiotic maturation. Amphibians (like Xenopus laevis) use high-affinity mPRs for the induction of the same process (Liu and Patiño, 1993).
For our measurement system we decided to use membrane progestin receptors (mPR) of Xenopus"

pCOLD (BBa_K1949000) new characterization
Our collaboration started on August the 28th. One of our team members went to Japan for holidays and met the Tokyo Tech team. They presented their projects and due to the high similarity between their last project “SnowWhite” and our project, they proposed to do a lab & model collaboration. They sent us their BioBrick pCOLD, we performed new characterizations to improve their part registry, and gave them our model handbook preview to use for their iGEM project.                       Working with the Tokyo team was an amazing adventure and allowed us to fulfil one of the Silver medal criteria.
Thank you Tokyo Tech team, it was a pleasure to work with you!
PARIS Bettencourt team
Protein expression by OD measurements & kinetics and the establishment of the program SimRNA
Our collaboration started in August.The iGEM Bettencourt kindly provided us with awesome devices to measure fluorescence so we could characterize the expression of our proteins at different temperatures the best way! As we were not familiar with such methods, they explained and advised us very greatly. Without them we would have relied only on colorimetric measurements and could not have improved the characterization of the iGEM Tokyo part which relies on GFP.                        For their project, they needed to model their RNA organelle strands. We helped them for the establishment of the program “simRNA”"

WRKY plates have colonies on them. Unclear whether they are blue or white so left over the weekend in the fridge to develop - will perform colony PCRs on monday.
Re-performed digest and ligation of PDF, PR, GST, P19, Luc. Digest at 55 degrees, then denatured at 80 degrees, then ligated at 16 degrees. Transformed cells but did not have time to incubate and plate cells, so left them at room temperature to incubate over the weekend. Plating first thing on monday.
3 white colonies on TSHH gblock plate and 1 on TSH gblocks. Colony PCR on these successful white colonies. Put fridge over the weekend.
Need to run a gel on monday and miniprep those that have the insert DNA
Also grew more colonies from original TSH/H gblock plates. Ready for miniprep on monday.
Digestion and ligation reactions using the biobrick plasmid and the TSH and TSHH gblocks.
Then transformations using the ligation reaction from earlier and plated out onto chloramphenicol plates.
Gel ran using the cut and uncut biobrick plasmid, there were no bands present.
Planned a repeat luciferin experiment for monday.
Performed a ligation digest of level 0 parts into a level 1 plasmid, which was left in the fridge over the weekend to transform on monday morning.

The Open Lab Blueprint draft created for this competition is meant to be in a state of continual evolution as we get feedback from users. This summer we provided guidance from the Open Lab Blueprint to new labs being established in several settings including an art-science lab at the Art Institute of Chicago, Nova Labs (a community-based Makerspace in Reston, Virginia) and FamiLAB, a community lab/hackerspace located in Central Florida.  Familab has approximately 80 members, and has been in operation since 2009.  FamiLAB approached GenSpace looking for guidance on adding DIY Bio to their offerings, and is now in the process of implementing the Open Lab Blueprint.
FamiLAB is in the process of moving from a 4000 sq ft space to a 6000 sq ft space, and has been consulting with Genspace's Open Lab Blueprint team on the layout of the area that will be dedicated to DIY Bio.
Our first step was to assess the level of interest within the lab and within the community.  Open Lab provided sample descriptions of possible workshops, and we conducted surveys at our open houses, and at our annual makerfaire. The almost unanimous answer to the survey was ""Oh, I definitely want to do the bioluminescence one first.""  In response, Genspace's Open Lab Team provided us with a source for bioluminescent dinoflagellates, and advice on buying equipment needed for running a pVIB transformation workshop.    We are in the process of coordinating with the Orlando Science Center to use one of their classrooms for the bioluminescence workshop while our build-out in in progress. The availability of a pre-tested workshop activity is extremely valuable and saves time and effort. It eases the way for group leaders who want to venture into the biology space but who want to start with an activity that is simple and safe that has been pre-vetted.
In the meantime, we utilized some of the Open Lab Blueprint's tactics for building community. Since our members have a strong background in robotics, we held a meetup to build an OpenTrons fluid handling robot.  This was a great event, people with wetlab experience showed up, learned some"

Note
In order to be considered for the Best Software Tool award , you must fill out this page.
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honour such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
If you are working on software as your main project, please join the software track. If you are creating software as an addition to your main project, please apply for this award.

Tartu_TUIT,2018,Team:Tartu TUIT#Human Practices#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," you could produce it in large quantities for reasonable price.       Main issue with MAAs at the moment is, however, not production of MAA-enriched extracts       but getting the pure compounds. MAAs are reasonably easy to get in large amounts       as by-products of seaweed production or fish farming, but extracting them from these materials is currently       not commercially viable, especially for high purity.       Compared to these sources, advantage of yeast-based biotech is that you could have at least some control over which       MAAs are produced, higher consistency/replicability,  and potential price advantage.       Genetically modified organisms, however, have very bad reputation these days (at least in EU),       so getting it on the market might be very difficult.
What can be the possible difficulties in producing MAA in yeast? What do you think how we can overcome them?
First problem you will run into is cloning and maintaining         MAA biosynthesis pathway in yeast - getting multiple genes into yeast and having them expressed is,         in general, pretty tough. I can't provide much advice there as I primarily do computational work, but          you will need good experimental design with appropriate cloning vectors, good controls and lots of          experiments to confirm genes are getting into the yeast. It will almost certainly require plenty of trial         and error and quite a bit of work. MAA biosynthesis is not strongly expressed in cyanobacteria, so         introducing strong promoters might help with actually getting MAAs. Introducing genes one by one         and monitoring if genes are there and what yeasts produce might be a good starting point.         Assuming MAA precursors are being produced, they will likely be present and kept inside the cell         and in very small amounts, so you might have to grow plenty of yeasts (possibly under UV pressure)         and run series of isolation experiments to see what (if anything) is being produced. Assuming you have         HPLC/MS system and lab scale bioreactors for growing yeasts, detecting gadusol should be reasonably straightforward.         Expect lots of trial and error with cloning. Finally, I would strongly suggest working with experienced         molecular biologist (or several) who did this type of experiments before and have well established protocols and          lab equipment - if you don't have properly equipped lab with proper expertise in house it will be very hard.         Assuming you get MAA biosynthesis pathway cloned into yeast and expressed, next problem will be to get         significant amount of MAAs (enough to do structure determination experiments). This will probably require         optimisation of grown conditions and upscaling of the"

I am currently engaged in an honors degree in microbiology with my research project aimed at creating a recombinant version of African horse sickness virus with a non-structural gene knock out. This project has been both challenging and engaging and I am looking forward to the remainder of the year.
I believe that society is in a revolution in which the great potential of biotechnology is being realized. Modern techniques are advancing our understanding of the fundamental workings of biological systems and new applications are being developed daily. This is undoubtedly a very exciting time to be in the position of young scientist entering a field with the resources and support currently being invested. iGEM is a great opportunity to learn about new molecular mechanisms and techniques. I look forward to meet people who have had years of experience in and share a similar appreciation for synthetic biology. Further I hope to share my experience with the members of our team and in doing so develop lasting friendships.

I’ve decided to participate in IGEM because it is a great learning experience .It provides an opportunity to learn more about the growing interdisciplinary field of synthetic biology and its applications. As a 3rd year student I have gained some theoretical knowledge in microbiology field and being a part of the IGEM team the idea of working in the lab to test the constructs and biobricks compiled in our project is quite exciting.  IGEM is also a good platform to work together with a team of aspiring scientists from different fields of study and with some great researchers as our team mentors there is plenty to learn from them.

To combat this problem we have hosted an event with iGEM Stockholm and Lund which shed light on the growing problem of burnouts and how to prevent them. To further spread the knowledge we have published a booklet about it! The booklet is a summary of useful guidelines and techniques to prevent team members from burn outs. It also speaks about the current situation in iGEM which we have summarised after performing an international survey with answers from current team members and previous team members all over the world.

We modeled the signal-terminator interaction for 2, 4-32 nt signal length and find that the signal sequence binds to the terminator sequence and impedes the terminator folding, on a timescale, that the polymerase doesn't fall off and the output signal can be produced.
Read more
The minimal free-energy structure of the folded terminator including the random signaling part is shown in the figure ""His-terminator"" below:
His-terminator
Our full signal sequence of length 32 nt completely binds to the terminator leading to antitermination.
His-terminator plus signal 32 nt
On the other hand the picture for a signal length of only 2 nt shows that such a small signal length is not sufficient to induce antitermination. But already a signal of length 16 nt binds to the terminator so that it cannot fold completely anymore leading to antitermination.
signal length 2 nt
signal length 16 nt
Furthermore, we explored whether the artificial linker, introduced to allow simulations in kinefold, which can only model intramolecular folding, has any influence on the results.
Read more
As we observed a dependence of the folding time and minimal energy respectively from the linker length, we used linkers of length 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 34, 40, 50, 60, 120 bases, indicated as 'X'. For the minimal energy there is only a very small linker length dependence as one can see in the figure below.
The figure also shows that the minimal free-energy structure for the signal sequence bound to the terminator sequence is much more stable, around 35 kcal/mol, than the minimal free-energy structure for the terminator sequence alone which -31,3 kcal/mol (and thus close to the minimal free-energy for the terminator connected to a signal of length only 2 nt).
Linker length dependence: minimal energy
However, for the folding time the linker length dependence is significant as one can see in the figure below, but only because the production of this linker is also included in the calculations. However, since our system uses intermolecular RNA/RNA interaction, the time for the linker production can be neglected.

Our materials are here and everyone in the fabrication group has returned to Ithaca!  This week, Manny and Mac focused their efforts on getting the plastic cut to the proper dimensions.  Unfortunately, this proved more to be more difficult than anyone could have imagined.  After transporting a rather hefty 48""x48"" piece of plastic across campus from Weill Hall to the Emerson Lab machine shop, we were told that we would have to take it elsewhere to have it cut (plastic is bad for blades).  Disappointed, but never defeated, we decided to try our luck with another machine shop.  Also, carrying plastic around campus isn't much fun, so we held it on the roof of a car instead (not recommended).  Fortunately, no traffic violations were received, and the Clark hall machine shop was more than happy to cut up our plastic for us.

We made cultures of pC13BX colony 1 and pC13CJ colony 4 to make glycerol stocks. We ran PCR of lox sites to amplify by Gibson. We ligated pAK13D with limonene. We preppred cre for reverse sequencing. We transformed holin off of kit plate and plated it. Digested pC13BH preps using EcoRI and PstI and screened alongside T7 polymerase. Results indicate that only the T7 PCR worked. The backbone pC13F and pA13AM were digested with XbaI and PstI, retrieving the T7 polymerase gene from the latter. Gel results for the digestions revealed correct banding patterns only for pC13F. We also miniprepped and prepared for sequencing pC13AU, pC13AT, pC13CB, pA13DC, and pA13DB. We prepared insert from pAK13CR for creating pC13CV. We submitted pC13AG for sequencing. We ran PCRs of pAK13BB and pAK13BU, and digested the inserts with EcoRI and PstI. We also digested pC13CD with SpeI and PstI.

2016 InterLab Measurement Study
Background
For the past two years, iGEM has hosted the InterLab Measurement Study , utilizing iGEM's resources and spirit of collaboration to create the two biggest interlaboratory studies ever done in synthetic biology. These studies seek to standardize the tools available to the synthetic biology community and focus on establishing a baseline for replicability of fluorescence measurements. This year, iGEM teams from around the world tested two protocols that used plate readers and flow cytometry to quantify the expression of five different reporter constructs. The measured fluorescence of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) was used as a proxy for promoter activity.
For this study, we used the following constructs:
• J23101 + I13504 as Test Device 1
• J23106 + I13504 as Test Device 2
• J23117 + 13504 as Test Device 3
• I20270 as our Positive Control Device
• R0040 as our Negative Control Device
All devices and parts were obtained from the iGEM 2016 InterLab Distribution Kit. Devices were made with a pSB1C3 plasmid backbone and transformed in the E. coli strain NEB5-alpha.

Therefore, we constructed constitutively expressed merP, merT, merC (Fig 4). This design was expected to expand the capacity of our bioabsorbent and the baseline of Hg (II) concentration that our biokit can be applied to.
Figure 4: The overall structure of the facilitation module. The expression of MerT, MerP and MerC are amplified by T7 polymerase activated T7 promoter, which maximizes the bacterial Hg absorption capacity via actively transportation of mercury ions into cytosol. (To Read More…)
    Following function test showed that our whole-cell bioabsorbents can absorb more than 50% of 10-6 M Hg (II) in 120 minutes. Therefore, cells expressing certain metal binding peptide engineered via our method may act as whole-cell bioabsorbents that can decontaminate corresponding metal ion from aquatic environment. This design was successfully applied to another homolog of MerR family – PbrR, the lead responsive regulator (Fig 5). Our bacteria achieved an equivalent lead accumulation capacity as the mercury MBP, which proved validness of our engineering strategy.
Figure 5 Our method was applied to PbrR. (A) Sequence alignment of MerR and PbrR. MerR family TFs share a highly conserved homology at their metal binding domains (Brown et al., 2003; Hobman, 2007), which implies that our strategies of bioabsorbent engineering might be applicable to other cases of heavy metals. (B) and (C) Construction of lead MBP. The MBP was constructed by fusing two copies of metal binding domain of MerR in tandem via the same method with mercury MBP. (To Read More…)
    However, there is still a problem remained in the application of our bioabsorbent. It is not convenient to simply remove our bacteria from water or gather up them for recycling process after enough Hg (II) has been absorbed. Therefore, a time-delayed autoaggregation design was introduced. We chose Antigen43 (Ag43), which mediates visible autoaggregation conferred on the bacteria population in static liquid [11], as our autoaggregation effector. We designed a time-delayed device in which the expression of Ag43 was in response to the presence of mercury with a time delay (Fig 6). Besides time-delayed"

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html," basic frame of part assembly. Chain is an abstract straight line where different parts can be placed on and connected together. Part is the basic unit of chain, and chain can have as many parts as possible.
To go beyond DNA, and to unify the data structure of Species, we extend the concept of chain in MoDeL to include all the parts we can describe, including RNA, protein, and even compartment, compound and substituent, etc. Parts of DNA, RNA and protein, are all originated from DNA, and they are considered as “Sequence”. Sequence can be connected to other parts of sequence on a chain. On the contrary, parts of compartment and compound are considered as “Non-sequence”. Parts of non-sequence cannot be connected to any other part on a chain, which means, they can only exist on a One-Part-Chain. Substituent is used as a substitution of any other part, so it can be either sequence or non-sequence.
It is important here to mention that the Sequence/Non-sequence division is only a rule guide the modeling. It is not a constraint to Chain-Node model. Actually, we choose to maximally preserve the flexibility and leave all the freedom of constructing a species to users. Users are allowed to construct ANY species they can using Chain-Node Model. For example, one can create a strange species with compartment, compound, and DNA parts on the same chain, which makes little sense in biology. So, it is really up to the users to decide how to use Chain-Node Model in modeling.
Abstract Concept of Node
Node is used to characterize binding structure in biological complex. Node is an abstract concept of binding site or site that can be bond. Links always exist between a binding site and the sites it binds together, indicating the relationship between them. We use trees to represent the binding structure in complex. The parent node represents the binding site, and the child node represents the bond sites. For example the binding structure of TetR dimer is considered as a TetR2 node with two TetR nodes as its children. There is one exception though, the ROOT node. ROOT node is used as the top node in a tree. It can only have one child and no parent. The function of ROOT is to indicate that its child is the last binding site in this tree, and it binds to nothing any more.
In the reactions of promoter repression and activation, the promoter is repressed or activated after binding with repressor or inducer. So its properties are changed, and it is not the original promoter any more. This is an example where binding changes"
TU-Eindhoven,2016,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," this lesson the steps of a protocol for cloning are described in an interactive way. The steps that are included in the lesson are: digestion, ligation, transformation, culturing, sequencing and expression. We filmed some of these steps and used those videos in the lesson. This lesson is aimed at final year high school students.
Figure 2: Presentation slide from one of the lessons
The goal of our education course is to connect the knowledge that students already have about synthetic biology together and to fill in the gaps in their understanding of synthetic biology. This includes the societal effects of synthetic biology and the process of forming an opinion on how we should deal with those societal effects.
Together with several biology or chemistry teachers of high schools in the region of Eindhoven we discussed our synthetic biology lessons. With their feedback we adjusted the lessons so they could really fit into the curriculum of the high schools. There were some schools that are very interested to use the lesson package, they will use the lesson package this school year and hopefully in the coming school years. One of the schools, Novalis College , replaced their 15 year old lesson program about ethics in biotechnology by our lesson about ethics in synthetic biology. The interesting and actual cases in our synthetic biology lesson were very appealing for the biology teacher of this school. Other schools used the lessons as an extra to the current curriculum with the possibility of using it in future years. Other schools that will make use of the lesson package this year are: Carolus Borromeus Lyceum and Augustinanium .

Toulouse,2014,Team:Toulouse#Result#experimental-results_-_-_TEXT.html," 300 µL of a bacterial suspension in the wells of an Elisa plate.
Figure 10: First tips capillary system
NB: the yellow carton was used to stabilize the system and kept it straight.
- After one hour, the tips were removed from the bacteria suspensions and the bacteria content within the tips was monitored with a Thoma cell under the microscope.
We experienced several problems with this system:
- The liquid level decreasing so badly during the course of the experiment that we did not have enough liquid to fill the Thoma cell for counting.
- The bacteria were moving, therefore preventing us from accurately counting them (but that's the point of swimming, no??? ;-)). Taking into account this problem, we decided to estimate the bacterial concentration by streaking the tips content on agar plate instead of using Thoma cell and microscopy.
Second tips capillary system
And then the revolution came! We found a multichannel pipette :D The same protocol was performed except that the parafilm was used to avoid the air entrance between the tips and the pipette and therefore the loss of liquid.
Figure 11: Second tips capillary system
Improvement of the second tips capillary system
However this system was not optimal it is why we decided to use blu-tack instead of parafilm:
Figure 12: Improvement of the second tips capillary system
At that point, the protocol was approved and the final test could finally start! :-)
There was just one tiny problem… we did not have our optimized bacterium transformed with the chemotaxis module!!! That is why we concentrated our efforts on WT B. subtilis strain.
The main goal was to find an optimized control and to analyze the eventual chemotaxis of the WT strain. To avoid osmolality bias, we wanted to find a molecule which was non-attractant and with a similar molecular weight than that of the N-Acetylglucosamine (221.21 g/mol). Our first idea was to use fuchsin (Molecular weight: 337.85 g/mol).
At the beginning, the experiment was conducted with only one negative control, the fuchsin and different NAG concentrations: 25 mM, 250 mM and 500 mM. The tested strain was B. subtilis 168:

UCAS,2016,Team:UCAS#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," how the iGEM competition has contributed to the development of synthetic biology and its industrialization. After the speech, we also talked with some investors from different countries, and learned that how government policy and support can influence their decisions, which is actually what synthetic biology lacks. We also discussed what makes a investor to support an idea or a start up focused on synthetic biology. Although it is really difficult for a project in laboratory to meet criteria for commercialization, we were really inspired how synthetic biology can make people live better in the future.
CCiC 2016 at SYSU
On the first weekend in September, we attended Central China iGEM Consortium (CCiC). CCiC is a national consortium held for iGEM teams in Mainland China, with the aim of imitating the procedure of Giant Jamboree in Boston and providing a platform for iGEMers to exchange ideas (Fig. 5). This year, hosted by Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, 28 Chinese teams came to CCiC, including PKU, SYSU, NJU and Tianjin University.
Fig. 5
As a new team taking part in iGEM for the first time, we benefited a lot from it. We earnestly listened to other teams’ presentations, learning how they construct speeches and PPT and design their posters and souvenirs. Above that, we were lucky to meet tons of brilliant ideas on project design, data analysis and human practice.                         During the poster session, we introduced to interested attendees the disasters antibiotic abuse may cause and tried to arise their awareness of careful usage of antibiotics (Fig. 6).
Fig. 6
In the morning on 4th SEP, we gave a presentation on our own project: the Ultra-sensitive Controllable Antibiotics Scavenger (Fig. 7). We explained our design and other work in detail, as well as introducing tremendous damages caused by antibiotic residues and our special design to solve this problem with the technique of SynBio. After presentation, we received a lot of attention from teachers and some other teams, further answering their questions about our project. We also got valuable feedbacks from other teachers and instructors

Motile - represents motility of the cells
Bio-chemical model integration
To split off the code that connects to the JSim application, which runs bio-chemical models, such as the ones that we have written in CellML, we put this code into it's own class, ModelSims. Currently this just uses the Sin Operon Model for influencing sporulation, but this can be easily expanded to cover other aspects of our project which have been modelled, such as metal intake.
This code calls a command line application, jsbatch, with parameters from the bacterial agent cell, parses the JSim output and returns a value which is used by the cell to make decisions. This code is run for each cell thread when it wants to run the appropriate model for the decision that it is currently making.
Database classes
The way in which the cell threads, the database and Microbase interact.
There are a number of classes which deal with communicating with the central database, which stores all of the data about each run of the simulation cell and each cell in that simulation.
DAO - a data access object that provides an interface to the database.
PopulationDAO - communicates with the table that records data about the current simulation run. This includes all of the parameters such as chances of state changes such as sporulation and germination, various rates of import/export, environment size, etc.
BugLog - communicates with the table that records data about all the bacterial cells throughout all of it's life, recording every state change.
Bug - communicates with the table that records only the most recent data about all the bacterial cells in each run of the simulation. This includes what state it is in at the moment (eg spore), how much cadmium is contained within, if it can germinate, etc.
PendingBug - communicates with the table that records data about bugs that have been created as daughter cells. This is a class which Microbase uses to manage the running of bacterial cells or 'tasks' on many machines.
Microbase classes
Classes written to interface with Microbase include the Responder Implementation. This class manages how the population simulation is run across a distributed system by Microbase.

Computing Definitions
Throughout this article some programming knowledge is assumed, but here are some selected definitions of terminology:

Northeastern_Boston,2015,Team:Northeastern Boston#Written Investigation_-_-_TEXT.html," fixed. This “peer review” creates a more robust program, often performing better than standard commercial software. In the field of synthetic biology some of the same principles apply.
The international genetically engineered machine competition is characterized by camaraderie and scientific cooperation. iGEM has evolved from a small independent study course at MIT, to an event involving hundreds of different universities and organizations. Much of this growth has been driven by the open source nature of iGEM. Students, professors, and industry professionals who are involved in the competition know the fruit of their efforts will become completely accessible to future participants. The competition supports the usage of other group’s research through awards. To qualify for a gold or silver medal a team needs to further characterize or improve the function of a previously submitted part. In doing so the competition has built a culture of working together for a common cause.
Outside of iGEM many companies and individuals are also supporting an open-source culture in synthetic biology by making their biological machinery or processes for editing organisms freely available. One example is DNA 2.0, a company which designed a series of fluorescent proteins using their own time and resources. The genes to produce these proteins were then released for public usage. This may seem unorthodox but it fits into larger business plan. DNA 2.0 provides a number of products and services such as gene construction, or design. An open source effort by DNA 2.0 could therefore spur innovation from others, and support commercial growth for both companies.
Almost every facet of human life has been touched by the advent of personal computing. We may see similar effects as synthetic biology moves past its beginning stages. Already the principles behind genomic editing are being used across many industries such as agriculture, energy, chemical synthesis or pharmaceuticals. Complex projects may involve the synthesis of dozens of different molecular pieces or use many engineering processes. In the beginning of the computer age a single person with enough time and knowledge could create functioning code, possibly for commercial gains. On the other hand, a biotech startup may face a host of problems if they want to move their idea from paper to process.  A company or individual interested in starting their own project will require significant capital. Computer code can be compiled and functionally tested in seconds. Genetic experiments may take weeks or months.
How the future plays out for synthetic biology will depend on how these issues are dealt with today. Certainly the argument is more complicated than open-source being “good” or “bad."" But, regardless, the continuing support for an open-source culture from organizations like iGEM could have serious ramifications for how people interact with the technology in the future"

Tianjin,2013,Team:Tianjin#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," Tianjin University Lab-Safety Management Regulation and Tianjin University Lab-Safety Responsibility Regulation. These regulations perfected the regulations related with lab-safety, and helped to build up the lab management system of Tianjin University. Teachers from Tianjin University are now compiling a book named Basic Knowledge of Lab-Safety for College Students. To regulate the use of chemicals in our unversity, an Integrated Management System of Chemicals is also developed. For students whose majors are related with chemicals, they have to be trained about safety rules. Only after passing an lab entrance examination can they enter the labs for studying and working. Besides, postgraduates are equipped with special protection equipments to ensure their personal safety.
Plague Inc Competition
Figure 2. Plague Inc Competition
To help students enjoy themselves while learning knowledge about safety, we held a Plague Inc Competition after studying and discussion. This game required participants to spread viruses around the world to make human beings die of terrible epidemics. In the process of virus transmission and infection, players need to strengthen their infectivity and resistance against antibiotics. Many students showed great enthusiasm to this game, and took part in our competition, two of whom are awarded with prizes.
This competition enabled students to enhance their awareness of safety before conducting research work. It also tested their ability of making strategies and overcoming difficulties, which also  helped them to implement their research plans efficiently.
The 3M Lecture
Figure 3. The 3M lecture
We also invited a professional lecturer Mr. Wang Enye from 3M to give us a lecture on Lab hazards and Self Protection. In the lecture, he talked about 4 aspects:basic knowledge about lab hazards and self protection, recognition of lab hazards and risk control, Respiratory hazards and self protection, and eye,face,skin hazards and self protection. The lecturer encapsulated the important technical fundaments of laboratory safety.The emphasis on the fundamentals will help the student and practicing scientist to understand the concepts and apply then accordingly. Some of the lab management officials and student representatives of related departments attended the lecture.
Regulation and Education
Tianjin University made and revised three regulations in Dec, 2012-Tianjin University Lab Management Regulation, Tianjin University Lab-Safety Management Regulation and Tianjin University Lab-Safety Responsibility Regulation.

Mapping
Mapping Platform for Biological Systems : Figure 5
Once the functional description has been constrained and the architecture instance costs determined, the mapping process becomes one of selecting functionality and assigning it the services provided by the architecture instances. This is only possible once those two steps have been done such that both spaces are specified in the same semantic domain [6]. This happens at a variety of abstraction levels. In electronic system design, a more abstract level may include the assignment of services such as execute, read, and write to an ALU and memory interfaces respectively. A lower level of abstraction may assign a 4-input AND operation to either a single 4-input AND gate or to a collection of three 2-input AND gates as a simple two level logic circuit.  The selection of a final mapping is based on the resulting costs and the designer's objectives (i.e. the a single 4-input AND may have a smaller area requirement than three 2-input ANDs).
Mapping in synthetic biology is a complex process. Not only does one need to assign functionality to available DNA sequences but the assignment of functionality to a sequence may either preclude or enhance the selection of functionality to other parts available to the design. Specific mappings may create chemicals not present in other mappings, express genes with a higher or lower probability, and react faster or slower in the given environment. A mapping tool should attempt to predict these relationships when possible and highlight parts which make a given mapping more likely to be successful in practice. Figure 5 illustrates mapping issues.
Clotho will provide the ability to create user designed plug-ins which will help bridge the gap between the functionality desired and the many ways in which it can be physically implemented. A large part of the future work in Clotho will be design views which allow designers to test tradeoffs between the assignment of various BioBricks to specific functional portions and to view the tradeoffs of such decisions.
Project Architecture
Orthogonalization of concerns is the separation of communication, coordination, and computation as described by PBD. This aids in reuse, debugging, and system analysis. The added modularity allows for system expansion as well as configurablity. Therefore each aspect of the Clotho system is classified as to what type of operations it is involved with and the communication between components is explicitly separated from the computation of each component. The coordination of the system is also removed from each individual component and maintained in a central location. Figure 6 illustrates Clotho's overall system architecture.
Clotho is based on a core-and-hub system which manages multiple connections, in which"

He saw the primer dimers at the bottom of the gel and did not think to even look for faint bands at the 2 kb level where the lysis piece would appear. So the Gibson did in fact work, but Vincent only found this out retrospectively on Tuesday of the following week (this wiki post is written with some tardiness).
Sunday, 21 August
Vincent took out the plates from the BL21 transformation. The results were spectacular: thousands of colonies. He then picked one colony from each plate to use for liquid cultures. He did not forget the antibiotic (as he usually does). The idea was to have liquid cultures ready for an IPTG platereader experiment on Monday.
Vincent also ran a miniprep on the C5-T7-RFP cultures, but got a very low yield of DNA (9-10 ng/uL).
Monday, 22 August 2011
Nadine made 2 Gibson reactions (equimolar ratios):
LacI and pSB3K1 Pconst-TetR, to assemble pSB3K1 Pconst-TetR Ptet-LacI plasmid
RFP and J61002 backbone, to assemble J61002 Plac-RFP plasmid
She also made negative controls, where only the backbone has been mixed with water, and transformed everything.
Vincent ran a platereader experiment using the liquid cultures of T7-RFP plasmids. Results should be appearing shortly.
Vincent received all 18 of the primers he needed to make the T7 promoter variants. Here is the list of these primers (this indexing will be used in the gel pictures):

He recommended a rapid, sensitive and cheap initial filter to reduce the total quantity of samples that will be processed by our final sequencing step. Therefore, we developed a prescreening method based on dextrin-capped gold nanoparticles (d-AuNPs), which changes color properties upon aggregation ( Baetsen-Young, et al, 2018 ).
Figure 5. Prescreening method for gene doping. A ssDNAp is added to the extracted DNA and when complementary strand are creating the secondary structure, the d-AuNPs are stabilized.
2.1 Background Information
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have unique highly specific spectral absorption properties ( Sepúlveda et al, 2009 ), large surface to volume ratios, and an ability to interact with DNA. Due to their characteristics, AuNPs have emerged as robust colorimetric assays. Baetsen-Young et al, (2018) have developed a direct colorimetric detection of DNA by d-AuNPs. They were able to visualize the presence of the unamplified pathogen Pseudoperonospora cubensis in a concentration ranging from 29 fM to 2.9 aM DNA using a single DNA probe.
Upon increasing NaCl concentration, d-AuNPs destabilize and form aggregates leading to a color change from red to purple. However, when a single stranded DNA probe (ssDNAp) hybridizes with a specific target double stranded DNA molecule (dsDNA), a secondary DNA structure is formed as shown in Figure 5. D-AuNPs can interact with this secondary structure, making them more stable and preventing them from aggregation. As a result of the d-AuNPs-dsDNA interaction, the solution with target DNA will have different refraction properties compared to non-targeted DNA and give a visual indication of target DNA presence ( Baetsen-Young et al, 2018 ). The prescreening"

Some participants were concerned that acidification of the soil due to acetic acid or unregulated side reactions occurring underground could be harmful. Ground stability would have to be monitored, especially if future development was planned near the wellsite.
While a large majority of participants did see similarities between hydraulic fracturing and CAB extraction, almost half of the participants thought that CAB extraction would be a safer and less damaging procedure to use for fracturing rock. Approximately 10% of the participants would prefer to use hydraulic fracturing, since it has been in use for many years and a number of the issues surrounding this procedure have already been addressed, whereas CAB extraction seems very experimental and would need much further testing before it was ready to be used.
Almost one-third of the participants were most concerned about bacterial contamination of the environment. CAB extraction has been designed to have the bacteria contained within bioreactors and not directly applied to the carbonate rock, helping to prevent contamination of the environment. As well, a kill switch module will be used to prevent proliferation in the event of a contamination. Most participants agreed that regular and thorough testing of water and soil samples would be necessary to ensure that the acetic acid was not causing any minor effects to the surrounding environment. Since Alberta is land-locked and we do not experience earthquakes, nor do we construct buildings with the infrastructure needed to withstand them, careful monitoring of seismic activity and ground stability would also be of high importance.
Finally, when asked about alternative sources of energy, our participants were quite evenly divided. Almost half agreed that it is important to keep our minds open to new technologies, whether they be unconventional or green. Those in support of unconventional sources argued that the Canadian economy is dependent upon the production of natural resources, and that it would be best to develop the resources we have rather than rely on other countries to supply us with necessary energy sources. Those in support of green technologies thought that a change in our lifestyles to greener thinking (using electric cars, reducing our greenhouse gas output) is more important, and investing in wind and solar power would be more beneficial. One participant thought that we should look at natural energy-producing systems, and use those as models for a completely new type of energy source (spoken like a true synthetic biologist in the making!). And if those methods fail, we could always try to engineer E. coli to perform cold fusion.

Overview
 
This year marks the 10th anniversary of iGEM. The decade witnesses the progress and boom of iGEM—more teams sign up for the competition and more programs of high quality are produced. Meanwhile, it is a trend which the open-minded iGEMers of XMU comply with that the communication among teams from all around the world is more frequency. We were active in communication and collaborations with counterparts at home and abroad, as well as propaganda and popularization of synthetic biology and iGEM. A biweekly newsletter, which was cofounded by iGEMers of Paris Bettencourt University and us, XMU team, provided broader communication and colorful later issues and had attracted participators from 30 teams. Besides, we enjoyed net-video conference with domestic and overseas counterparts and study visits to other iGEM teams. Moreover, during the popularization in Xiamen Library, we managed an iconoclastic way that we started with a hot issue, GM food (genetically modified food), which is worldwide popular.
 
Newsletter
 
There is no doubt that iGEM needs a communication platform to share our idea, ask for and receive help. Though we have Meetup, iGEM CC, Facebook and Twitter, indeed, these platforms fail to became popular.
 
We are committed to build an open and easy-to-access platform, on which iGEMers can share their information and exchange resource conveniently within the shortest time.
Based on this suggestion, iGEMers of Paris Bettencourt University and we cofounded an information exchange platform named Newsletter on July 28. As a biweekly electronic journal, it is in PDF format and free for readers. Till now 40 teams from Asia and Europe have participated. In general this electronic newsletter includes two major parts: project update and the introduction of team members. We sincerely hope that through this platform, every team will have a better access to share information and progress, gain feedbacks and favors on their own projects from their peers and even get to know some young promising synthetic biologists. In addition, there are also going to be special issues publishing with interviews of iGEM alumni and advisors from part of college teams in competition.
 
On this platform, iGEM teams from all around the world introduce their programs, share details of experiments, ask for help, and reply to requirements from counterparts. In addition, special issue offers access to peripheral issue, such as interviews"

The handing over took place at the University of Stuttgart where the team also introduced itself to Dr. Wolfgang Kuster. The students work on the development of a biological tube cleaner, based on the use of enzymes. Their tube cleaner aims to be more ecofriendly than the usual chemical cleaning agents. The project focusses on the degradation of waste containing keratin, like hair and leavings of soap and fat in the tube system. The students want to create a biobrick containing keratinases, lipases and esterases in combination to degrade these contaminations and wastes in a biotechnological way. To improve the protection of the environment the students put a lot of ambition into their research project of public utility.

Abstract
At the beginning of our project, we were aiming to design a bacterial neon light. In order to maximize fluorescent signal, we designed a positive feedback loop. However, our pilot study indicated a massive leakage problem, and this positive feedback circuit was entirely out of control. Trying to fix this, we asked around in a regional meet up in Peking University. We weren’t surprised when we found out that half of the teams suffered from promotor leakage and nearly all of them had troubles controlling expression. So we shifted our attention to a more practical issue and designed Neon Coli, the Necessary Expression ONly E. coli. We improved the original positive feedback circuit and made it tunable, which enables it to optimize expression, facilitate signal detection and assist in synthetic biology computations. Throughout the year we have been using questionnaires and interviews to investigate how Neon Coli is going to help other iGEM projects. The following results are from the largest batch that we sent out at CCiC.

Tsinghua-A,2018,Team:Tsinghua-A#Background_-_-_TEXT.html,"ulocytes and mast cells. F: The presence of the allergens induces the crosslink of FcεRI receptors, leads to the release of mediators.
    These IgEs circulate around with the serum, a fraction of IgEs will bind to the α chain of so called high affinity receptor FcεRI with its constant region in its heavy chain. FcεRI is expressed in the plasma membrane of basophil granulocyte in the blood, and its tissue-embedded counterpart, mast cell. The rest of IgEs remain solutes in the serum. Basophil granulocyte and mast cell both contain pre-synthesized mediator components, like histamine, neutrophil chemotactic factor, platelet activating factor, etc, storing in the vesicles inside the cell.
    When this guy encounters the same allergen the second time, IgEs in the surface of his/her basophil granulocytes and mast cells may be pulled together by the allergen, since the variable regions of different IgEs target on the same allergen bind to different epitopes of the allergens. The aggregation of IgE results in the aggregation of FcεRI, which subsequently triggers intracellular signal transduction, finally leads to calcium influx, then the vesicles in the cell fuse with plasma membrane, and the mediators are released. The mediators directly induce allergy symptoms. For example, histamine released from basophil granulocytes will bind to vascular endothelial cell nearby, mediating contraction of endothelial cell, inducing increase in vascular permeability and blood flow, and local swelling.
    Currently, the most commonly used allergen test methods can be roughly divided into two classes. Some methods, like skin prick test, intradermal test and patch test, belongs to the first class. People’s skin is directly exposed to a variety of common allergens. The tester observes whether there are signs of hypersensitive response. In other methods, blood sample from individuals to be tested are collected, and immunological technologies like ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, see figure 2) and RAST (radioallergosorbent test) are utilized to determine the concentration of IgE target on specific allergen.

Most likely we wont use RS3, but we can assign it a restriction site just in case. For example NcoI could be used instead of NotI to do the directional cloning into pEG202.

METHODOLOGY
Mutated Firefly Luciferase
The original intention was to use the Photinus pyralis luciferase biobrick (BBa_I712019) as a base and to increase its efficiency by using the primer BBa_K360114 (as registered) due to previous design notes as referred in the part design section of this briobrick. After achieving this, a punctual mutation S284T (also known as S851T) was induced to change its emission spectrum from green to red by means of a PCR with special primers (which are also referred in the biobrick part design). The biobrick name is BBa_K360115; unfortunately, we were never able to find out why it was not functional.
Click Beetle Luciferase
By the middle of the summer, we decided to try the luciferase from another organism: Click Beetle, specifically the Promega Chroma-Luc™ Reporter Vectors pCBG99-Basic Vector Restriction Sites and the pCBR-Basic Vector Restriction Sites, where the first one has a green emission and the second one red. The intention was to work with these vectors as a means of having a previously-known-to-be functional luciferase, so that once the LRE biobrick was ready, characterization could be feasible. The first step was to extract the coding sequence of the luciferases from these vectors by means of PCR and also to standardize them by adding the prefix and suffix with the following primers:
Forward Click Beetle luciferase
GAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGAGATTAAAGAGGAGAAAATGGTGAAGCGTGAGAAAAAT
Reverse Click Beetle luciferase
CTGCAGCGGCCGCTACTAGTATTATTAACCGCCGGCCTTCT
The second step was to ligate it into the BBa_J61002 plasmid with a J23101 promoter, and to transform it, having as an output several colonies which were then grown overnight to check whether the luciferases showed any brightness. The protocol followed for the assay is mentioned in BBa_K216015 biobrick, in the Experience part. In this first assay, no luminometer was used; so eventhough we added 1μL of 100mM luciferin and waited in the dark room for ~30min taking pictures with a SLR camera with high ISO (~400), for about 30secs to 1 min exposure, nothing was observed.

""Synthetic biology is a relatively new science with tremendous potential to change how we view and know the life science,                                  but like many developing technologies, it has provoked ethical concerns from the scientific community and the public and                                 confronts demands for new regulatory measures"". (Prof. Bracha Rager-Zisman, Department of Microbiology                                      Immunology and Genetics, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev) .
Synthetic biology promises significant advances in areas such as biofuels, specialty chemicals, agriculture, and medicine                                  but also poses some potential risks.
Many concerns might stem from the field of synthetic biology. For example modifying an organism for medical purposes or                                  environmental care is still a debate in our culture. The lack of knowledge and the complexity of this field arise many                                  questions and concerns among the general public. Furthermore, similar concerns are expressed by scientists who specialized                                 in other fields of research. We thought that as we modify organisms in our lab enabling them to preform new functions,                                  we should learn our limitations and the complexities are involved in synthetic biology. We aimed to study the bioethical                                 issues that may arise from our project to  ensure no harm can be caused by our product.
Shimon Glick describes several ethical issues related to Synthetic Biology from a                                  Jewish aspect in a paper he published a few years ago:” Synthetic Biology: A Jewish View” (1):                                 Ethics raises many issues and controversy in science. According to Judaism philosophy, man is                                 considered as a collaborator with God; his motives to research are pure.                                 His goal is to improve mankind and its surroundings. However, there are many risks                                 when we deal with science, like deliberate abuse or dangerous miscalculations.
Meeting with bioethics experts
During the summer, we met several experts from the bioethics field, who gave us general new ethical insights that might be                                 relevant for our project.
First, we met with Prof. Ute Deichmann, an expert in History and Philosophy of Science. Prof.  Deichmann"
ICT-Mumbai,2017,Team:ICT-Mumbai#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"in, which is a light-powered proton pump. The resulting proton gradient can then drive native ATP synthase to form ATP, required for glutamine synthetase activity.
Proteorhodopsin requires retinal for activity. Retinal can be synthesized by E. coli when transformed with part BBa_K1604022. This part contains five genes under control of an arabinose-inducible promoter that code for enzymes that catalyze the formation of retinal starting from FPP farnesyl diphosphate.
To demonstrate that our idea works, E. coli will be transformed with two plasmids — BBa_K1604022, and a plasmid that contains genes coding for glutamine synthetase, blue protein synthase, and proteorhodopsin under control of an inducible promoter. As activity of proteorhodopsin is dependent on light, the cells will be exposed to a source of visible light.
Final construct...
We look forward to expressing all genes required to assimilate ammonium into indigoidine from the ychH promoter as a single operon. To prevent metabolic burden on the cell, instead of transforming E. coli with multiple plasmids, we will integrate all the genes in the genome, thereby also eliminating use of antibiotic-resistance genes to maintain plasmids within the host cells."
Edinburgh_OG,2017,Team:Edinburgh OG#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"f et al. (2015), so we knew it was possible to create a working system with these phages.
P1 was chosen as it is a well-characterised phage, with a high efficiency of packaging and more than twice the head capacity of λ (Trempy et al., 2004). Any cells lysogenised with P1 gain resistance to T7 (Goodgal, 1956). In an ideal     scenario this would not be a problem, as all lysogenised cells should contain a CRISPR system and thus should be resistant to T7 anyway. However, in practice it is possible for a cell to be lysogenised but for the CRISPR system to be non-functional,     so that the cell retains antibiotic resistance but cannot be killed by T7. For this reason, we chose an additional lytic phage – T4.
Like T7, T4 is a purely lytic phage with no lysogenic stage (Miller et al., 2003). T7 and T4 are both well-characterised model species, though to our knowledge T4 has not previously been engineered using BRED (Bacteriophage Recombineering of     Electroporated DNA).
The Targets
We decided to target two genes, which together allow us to target all members of the prominent ESKAPE group of resistant pathogens. This group has been singled out as the most important players in nosocomial infections, due to their ability to 'escape' the effects of antibiotics. The ESKAPE group consists of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp     (Rice, 2008).
The blaKPC (KPC) gene codes for Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases, and has been found in a number of Gram negative pathogens including the 4 in the ESKAPE group (KAPE) (Arnold et al., 2011; Robledo et al., 2011;     Marchaim et al., 2008). KPC confers resistance to a number of β-lactam antibiotics including the carbapenems, which had previously been relied upon as a “last resort” antibiotic for use when others fail (Tzouvelekis,     2012). Similarly to the other ESKAPE pathogens, KPC has a large global distribution (Figure 5).
