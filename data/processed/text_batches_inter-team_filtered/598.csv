NAIT_Edmonton,2015,Team:NAIT Edmonton#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html,"Joe really is Mr. Congeniality. As our Public Relations expert he has really gone above and beyond all of our expectations. Throughout the project, Joe was our public voice and was in charge of all external relations such as collaborations, looking for sponsorship and even managing our Twitter account. In addition to public relations, Joe was also heavily involved in lab work. He assisted David in developing our silver stain protocol, helped develop our experimental design with Mattéa and also created our team's Human Practices project!
A day without our friend Joe is very quiet, and almost lonely. His presence (and sneeze) fills the entire room with a kind of light and positivity that many people lack or take for granted. Joe has the ability to see the silver lining in the darkest storm cloud and for that, we are very thankful. Thank you, Joe! May your beard grow strong and great.
Abbie Gottert
Abbie is one of the most caring, friendly and empathetic people you will ever meet. Between assisting with Logo and Banner design, reviewing the literature, helping Johannes out with the policy and practices, and assisting with lab work, she finds the time to have a full time job and maintain a balance between them. Always concerned with the well being of the group, she goes out of her way to make sure that everyone stays healthy, happy and mentally sound.
Thank you so much, Abbie. Although you couldn't be with us all the time in lab, we always knew you were there in spirit - whether it be a GIF image sent in chat or popping in in the late afternoon after your other shift. ""Good friends are like stars, you can't always see them but you know they're always there."" Abbie is our good friend and has been a shining star in our team.

Joy is joy.
The trails that each human being transits throughout a lifetime can lead to meeting incredible people. We are very happy that our paths came across one truly valuable and amazing girl; Joy.
A real treasure chest, she was good at every aspect our project needed; lab work? You got it! Coding? Consider it done! Making molecular animations? Easy for her! Nonetheless, her biggest trait is her kindness and empathy towards others; assets that make her a true friend, one you wish to always hang around with. Though she might be quiet when working in the lab, one could occasionally glance at her face and get a nice smile as a response. Such priceless, unspoken moments could convert our days into memories. Memories that will accompany us throughout our lives, throughout"

Middle School
During September we had the great pleasure sharing our knowledge and enthusiasm with a group of local middle school students at Vikingaskolan in Lund. It was a very rewarding experience full of interesting discussions on how best to minimize plastic pollution and how to incorporate an ecoconscious attitude in everyday life. Their creativity and willingness to go the extra mile to protect the environment left us feeling more inspired and motivated than ever.
Julia, Emma and Naomi starting the workshop by communicating important concepts related to microplastics and their environmental impact.
We focused the discussions around concepts that we knew had already been brought up by the teachers prior to the lecture to make sure that the level of the material was suitable. With the help of more approachable analogies we communicated important concepts related to microplastics and microplastic pollution; from where the problem stems, the adverse environmental effects and current research on how to combat their dispersion. Each topic was then discussed in smaller groups where the students got the opportunity to discuss their perspective on the topic and to jointly come up with suggestions on how they could aid in reducing the plastic pollution. Some of ideas that were brought forward by students were:
Avoiding synthetic textiles
Reusing plastic bags when grocery shopping
Collecting big plastic fragments with boats and recycling them
Discussing the adverse effect of plastic pollution with friends and family
Buying glass bottles instead of PET bottles.
Increasing the washing machine loads and using synthetic clothes more than once before washing.
Introducing tax on plastic products
During the discussions we were careful not to control the way to which the students arrived at their conclusions, but simply encouraging them to think freely and outside the box, daring them to trust themselves and their own instincts. We felt that this was the best approach to showing them that they themselves were more than capable of coming up with excellent strategies to facilitate environmental sustainability, with the hopes of changing the mindset of it simply being a chore to a personal lifestyle choice.
Through our project we learned that the abundance of microplastics can be mitigated through a simple change in attitude toward plastic consumption among the general public. Thus, we found the exchange with the younger generation to be a very important step in our conviction of communicating the importance of ecoconsciousness. Future societal change will be dictated by the youth and by encouraging them to rally behind the enviroment"
EPF_Lausanne,2014,Team:EPF Lausanne#Envelope stress responsive bacteria_-_-_TEXT.html,"pxR responsive promoter
We aim to estimate the time elapsed between the activation of a given transcription factor and the synthesis of an associated reporter protein by comparing these two signals. We want to explore this idea with our engineered CpxR transcription factor (leading to IFP signal upon activation) and its regulatory sequence promoting the transcription of RFP.
We obtained a RFP sequence under CpxR responsive promoter from the Calgary 2010 team ( BBa_K339007 ) and noticed that the regulatory sequence was missing. After obtaining their theoretical sequence by cloning strategies ( BBa_K1486048 ), the promoter was still both non-responsive to stress and leaky, as RFP production was not correlated to the activation of the transcription factor (same signal in both stressed and non-stressed cells). We used an other strategy and replaced the regulatory sequence by the genomic region between CpxR and CpxP (which is thought to contain the CpxR responsive promoter) in both orientations ( BBa_K1486049 & BBa_K1486050 ). This time the RFP signal was very low, most probably due to the fact that the sequence we inserted was not fully specific to CpxR thus being unoptimal for such an experiment. An experiment containing only the promoter before the CpxP coding region should be tried. The issue is still of great interest and should be studied.
Split Luciferase & Stress Responsive bacteria
The initial plan for the development of stress responsive bacteria was to evaluate signal dynamics of CpxR with both split IFP1.4 and split luciferases (firefly and renilla).
The reasons for which we initially wanted to make use of split luciferases in our project were the following:
Fast and reversible signal (quasi-instant)
Light excitation not needed (minimal autofluorescence) => simplification of the signal detection and processing mechanisms
Signal highly correlated with concentration of substrate => very modulable
Small concentrations of substrate are needed
To explore how split luciferases worked, we aimed to reproduce past experiments making use of this technology. We thus set ourselves as objective to study the signal dynamics of CheY/CheZ in E.coli 2 before fusing split luciferases with CpxR.
CheY and CheZ are two proteins involved in the bacterial chemotaxis pathway. It has been shown by split luciferase complementation assay that these two proteins do not interact in presence of chemoattractant, but do interact (CheZ being the phosphatase of CheY) in absence of chemoattractant or presence of chem"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," = £110).
Expected QALYs gained was calculated using 70 as lower a bound for life expectancy. The national life expectancy at birth in the UK is 81, [22] however for those who have NSCLC, and thus are likely to have smoked, life expectancy is at least 10 years lower. [23] The quality of life score is assumed to be 1, i.e when someone is cured of NSCLC, the years of life gained are assumed to be in perfect health or any other factors that reduced their quality of life were not considered to be due to NSCLC. Thus QALYs gained = 70 - current age. If an individual is over 66, QALYs gained are taken to be 5, as the statistics used were for 5 year survival.
Cost per QALY was calculated by dividing expected cost by expected QALYs. If this is less than £30000, screening for the next 6 years is cost effective for that patient.
When building this model we tried to use reasonable estimates to ensure we do not overestimate the cost effectiveness of our test.
You can download our spreadsheet here .
The model showed that is is cost effective to screen most people who have smoked.
The American Cancer Society recommends screening for people: [24]
between 55 and 77 years old,
who currently smoke or have quit smoking in the last 15 years
who have at least a 30 pack-year history of smoking
We entered the details for someone at the lowest thresholds: someone aged 55, quit smoking 15 years ago, has a 30 pack-year history of smoking along with the average American’s build: male, white, no history of cancer or any lung diseases, college educated and a BMI of 27. [25] They would cost £6900 per QALY to be screened, making our tool extremely cost effective by the NICE £20,000 per QALY target. It would therefore be cost effective, by our analysis, to screen people with our system with even lower risks of developing NSCLC. This is mainly due to the low cost of our test and significantly improved surival rates when NSCLC is diagnosed in earlier stages.
The one significant assumption we may have over-estimated is sensitivity, as it is unlikely to be 100% in reality. However, for the same individual it would remain cost effective to screen even if sensitivity were reduced to 34% (£19,800 per QALY). This would never be ethically acceptable, given the number of cases of cancer you"

Quantitative analysis of signalling networks
Motility of Escherichia coli cells in clusters formed by chemotactic aggregation Justification: The past second has positive weighting, the previous 3 seconds have negative weighting. E coli compares past and present concentrations by comparing the average occupancy of the receptors over the 4s. Models reflecting this system have been developed by Segall et al and Schnitzer, cells compare their average receptor occupancy between 4 and 1 s ago c1-4 to the average receptor occupancy during the last second c0-1 . Hence b= c0-1 - c1-4 . If b>0, the cell reduces the tumbling rate to Ttumbling from the ambient value T0 , 1s-1 e.g. b>0 don't tumble. b< 0, tumble at a rate of 1s-1

On Torque and tumbling in swimming Escherichia coli Justification: The tumble angle appears not to be dependant on the concentration gradient of chemoattractants/repellents. Nor is there correlation between the length of the run and the change in direction. The program uses a gamma distribution that fits the data collected by Berg and Brown. Several groups though, have observed that the tumble angle is not noramlly distributed but suggest that non-normality was only due to the experimental methods used e.g. in the capillary tube. Tumbling can cause a change in direction when as few as one flagella moves out of the bundle.

The characterisation
For a while it seemed that Edinburgh was in a better position to characterise some of the BioBricks than Mexico. We had a reporter system for our LovTAP (which due to a delay at Customs they had not received) and we had successfully mutated our red luciferase.
We had agreed that we would share any significant results we achieved from the characterisation of LovTAP. Unfortunately, this never came to fruition; at the date of the wiki freeze neither LovTAP nor the red light sensor were showing any difference for us in readout in response to light. We gave Mexico what information we could but it was too late and of too little relevance to alter their own results.

I would like to thank all my teammates, teachers, instructors, friends, people who have gave me courage to overcome depression, and most importantly my parents. Without you, all of you, I couldn't have attained all these fantastic achievements today.
Lucinda: iGEM forces me to tackle challenges, communicate with my friends and families, and deal with mental workload by focusing on one thing at a time with a reasonable schedule.      It was hard, but with passion and collaboration we persisted. Thank you to y'all!
Charles: iGEM fascinates me in not just academic challenges, but the journey pushes me out of my comfort zone and enables me to learn new skills boldly. But the most precious treasure of iGEM is its people, every iGEMer. Million thanks"

We paid great effort to the safety issue and we have been dedicated to improving the knowledge of synthesis biology from classes and tried to share the part we contribute to the worldwide. We innovatively plot a new way of spreading the spirits of IGEM by starting our own community and we will never stop sharing and communicating.
--Luojun Wang, author of USTC_SOFTWARE human practice
Human Practice,""the C project""
Although we do software, we also keep eyes on promotion of synthetic biology and sharing our own program. Therefore, we started a long term human practice, “the C project”, since this summer.“the C project”, as we call, consists of three parts: Curriculum, Communication and Community.
Curriculum
As a IGEM team, we try to let people as many as possible to know what synthetic biology is. Therefore, advisors of our team, Haiyan Liu and Jiong Hong, have established a set of synthesis biology curriculum this summer. We have done many works related to human practice on the curriculum.
Jiong Hong(in the right picture), advisor of our team, gave lectures introducing safety and ethnics issues of synthetic biology.
Luojun Wang(in the head picture), members of our team, gave lectures promoting iGAME.
A survey* on how students know about synthetic biology and their interests for tutor game was made.(*the survey statistics comes from a sample of 240 students. Numbers of undergraduates, masters and PhDs are 160, 60 and 20)
Analysis of the results of the survey The first chart shows students' favorite game types for iGAME, and the second chart shows their knowledge of IGEM project.
The Circos Map
We tried many methods to plot our survey more straightforwardly and clearly before we finally chose Circos mkweb.bcgsc.ca/circos . Circos is biological software used to plot genome elements and relationship.

In the graph, there are three circles. The inner circle stands for their knowledge of synthetic biology, and middle circle stands for their interests of iGame. Deeper the color is, the more they know of synthetic biology or the more they are interested in iGame.

Team Cultivation & Purification:
Today we performed lots of purifications. This time we used a Ni-NTA column, because it seemed to work better than the TALON column. Therefore it was reloaded newly before starting the purifications. The purified samples were BPUL produced on 09/03 and 09/05 as well as ECOL produced on 09/04. The results were not that promising, so maybe we harvested the cells too early. They start dying more or less when we expect them to produce our (toxic) protein. So we think we had to let some of them die, so that the rest will produce our protein. The next fermentations should endure at least 12 hours.

Module 3: Gene Guard
Containment is a serious issue concerning the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the environment. To prevent horizontal gene transfer of the genes we are expressing in our chassis, we have developed a system based on the genes encoding holin, anti-holin and endolysin. We are engineering anti-holin into the genome of our chassis, where it acts as an anti-toxin, and holin and endolysin on plasmid DNA. In the event of horizontal gene transfer with a soil bacterium, holin and endolysin will be transferred without anti-holin, rendering the recipient cell non-viable and effectively containing the Auxin Xpress and Phyto-Route genes in our chassis.

Testing
Horizontal gene transfer is currently an increasingly pressing topic in the field of Synthetic Biology. It is the main limiting factor which is halting the release of GMO's to the environment as while we know what our genetic construct will do in our own chassis we are unsure what it will do in another organism. In order to prevent this issue of genetic containment we have designed a novel toxin/anti-toxin system, the Gene Guard.
In this module we wanted to first test the necessity of this system by performing experiments to see how long E. coli would retain the plasmid in soil as well as under optimal conditions. Then we tested whether the Gene Guard was assembled correctly at each stage. Finally, we wanted to perform an experiment where we transform control cells and our Gene Guard cells with the holin-endolysin plasmid. Is Gene Guard necessary? Moreover, does it work? Stay tuned to find out.

After that, we also participated the fifth CCiC held by ShanghaiTech University in September. CCiC, Conference of China  iGEMer Community, is an annual meet up in China held by Chinese iGEM teams. The  schedule of the meeting is the simulation of Giant Jamboree in Boston, consisting of project presentation, poster display and so on. It is an excellent  time for all the iGEM teams in China to spread the idea of biosynthetic to the  public of China and to interact with other teams ahead of time to make progress together. We undoubtedly seized the excellent opportunity to demonstrate our  project to all teams in China and learn from others. During poster display, we had close conversations with several teams, making proposal on the problems we  came up while listening to presentations of other teams, communicating with  teams sharing the same track with us and advising each other for better  promotion. The special event, trouble shooting also inspired us in several  aspects, such as the form of our presentation and the style of our poster.
During the time of photo shooting for all  the participants together, we were honored to have a special moment chatting  with Mrs. Megan. Her enthusiasm and smile gave us lots of strength to go on  overcoming any obstacles to come.
Meanwhile, we were more than glad to see  everything going well for all the teams in Nanjing we once communicated with.
3.CSU-China
This year we also formed close connection with CSU-China , which is a team setting foot on iGEM for the first time. To begin with, we introduced everything about iGEM to them as comprehensively as possible. During their time of building up a real team, we offered timely help and advice feasible to solve their problem through social media.  It was indeed a pleasure to offer a hand as we are a more experienced team. Except for that, it surprisingly became a chance for us to learn more novel ideas about what else can be done in iGEM.
We genuinely hope to hear good news from them in Boston!

Manufacturing Method: TERRA is composed of 3D-printed supports, as 3D-printing is more accessible, lower-cost, and allows for rapid prototyping. While traditional machining, such as milling and turning, would result in tighter tolerances and more accurate parts, we realized the cost of manufacturing parts in a machine shop were high. In fact, many of these parts only include clearance holes, which will serve its purpose as long as they meet a minimum dimension.
Material: Since our team chose to manufacture our system with 3D-printing, we chose to create our parts with ABS. The typical material for 3D-printing is resin, as it is inexpensive, but resin lacks the resolution needed to create the negative features on certain parts. ABS is stiffer and allows for more accurate parts and is more durable than resin.
Motors: We chose to incorporate stepper motors to the XY-plane as it allowed for a minimum step resolution of 1.8 degrees, which translates to 0.20 mm per step. Stepper motors also allow for microstepping, which allows us to further improve the resolution to 1/16 of a step, or 0.0125 mm. The typical well to well distance of a 384 well-plate is 4.5 mm, so the higher the resolution, the more accurate the dispensing of fluid.
Building the First Prototype
The first iteration of the XY-stage was composed of 3D printed parts and HDPE machined parts. We chose to do so in order to test the accessibility of each manufacturing method. All parts were modeled in Creo Parametric and STL files were generated for 3D-printing using a UPrint SE and ABS stock material. The machined parts were created from HDPE stock and milled using a manual NC mill.
Since the first design was part of the prototyping stage, we had chosen to use open ended timing belts in order to have the freedom of adjusting the design of the XY-stage with the least amount of dimensional constraints. We realized, however, that the timing belts were difficult to maintain the correct amount of tension without a proper tensioner, which would not be possible to integrate to our system. Also, it would be difficult to standardize if the user were to cut their own timing belts according to how well they put together their XY-plane.
When designing the XY-stage, we decided that we would like the default, starting position of the plate holder"

In Mind the Gut, we are determined to fight the stigma associated with mental health by raising awareness of the physiological nature of disorders such as depression and anxiety. We're directly tackling this through the science sprouting from of our lab work: by drawing the focus to the physicochemical connection between gut microbiota and the brain for the treatment mental health disorders.

Background Events Interviews Art and design Ethics Safety
Background
We've been involved in discussions with patients, practitioners,scientists and volunteers in charities to inquire about mental health issues. We also plan to use this as an opportunity to create awareness for the gut-brain axis which is quite a nascent field of research. This helps us ensure the relevance of our project to patients. We've organized events in collaboration with artists, museums and mental health organisations in order to start discussions with the general public and incorporate their ideas into our project. As of now there are two aspects that are needed to be considered:
A few words on stigma - Education and public engagement: We have all heard of the word stigma. And in Mind the Gut, we set ourselves the goal of really understanding what it entails. Two main components of our iGEM project, Genetic Engineering and Mental Health served as the platform to devise what this concept really is about. And from those things we learnt, we couldn't but take action to ultimately bring forward more innovation and happiness to this world! .
An evolving project - Integrated human practices: The way we learnt in Mind the Gut was through doing things. Talking to people beyond the bench allowed us to interact with different communities in a dynamic way. Finding out the impact of mental health treatments on people's lives allowed us to tackle the most common side effects and dosage concerns around medication. We therefore built genetic circuits incorporating new and improved biobricks assessing these purposes.

Many bacterial chemoreceptors belong to a family of transmemberane methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) [3]. Each chemoreceptors on the bacterium has a periplasmic binding domain and a cytoplasmic signaling domain that communicates with the flagellar motors via a phosphorelay sequence involving the CheA, CheY, and CheZ proteins. This signalling pathway modelling result will determines the threshold chemoattractant concentration.
In addition, modelling of chemotaxis of bacteria population is also valuable for us to capture the overview of movement of bacteria around the plant root; therefore it can potentially inform our project about how and where we can place our bacteria.
II. OBJECTIVES
1. Use the modelling result to determine, with certain numbers of chemoreceptors, the threshold of chemoattractant concentration where the bacterium is able to detect and the saturation level of chemoattractant where the all the receptors on the bacterium are occupies. As it is believed that the auxin should be placed at a region near the root(0.25 cm [4]), therefore it is essential to obtain the number of chemoreceptors needed on individual bacterium that enables it to stay close enough to the plant root.
2. Model the bacterial popolation dynamics in two conditions: experimental and natural.
Under experiment condition, the chemoattractant diffuses all the time from the source. However, in real soil, the root produces malate all the time, therefore we assume that the distribution of chemoattractant outside the root is steady and time-independent. Hence, the modelling of bacteria population chemotaxis will be built with different patterns of chemoattractant distribution.
III. DESCRIPTION
1. Chemotaxis Pathway
The chemotaxis pathway in E.Coli is demonstrated in Figure 1. MCPs form stable ternary complexes with the CheA and CheW proteins to generate signals that control the direction of rotation of the flagellar motors [5].  The signaling currency is in the form of phosphoryl groups (p), made available to the CheY and CheB effector proteins through autophosphorylation of CheA[1].CheY-p initiates flagellar responses by interacting with the motor to enance the probability of ‘run’ [1]. CheB-p is part of a sensory adaptation circuit that terminates motor responses [1]. MCP complexes have two alternative CheA autokin"

This was done in an attempt to glean some information about the transformation efficiency, as well as to hopefully attain sufficiently isolated colonies.  However, given the calculations, it is likely that there will still be too many cells even on the 1:100 dilution to get the deisred paucity of colonies.  Only used a single negative control consisting of the yeast cells plated onto a dropout plate.  Did not use an empty plate as a control.  Thus, if we find contamination on the control plate, we will not know whether it was due to the transformation mixture or the actual plate.
Is should also be noted that, due to timing issues, the cells were left sitting for considerable amounts of time at various steps during the protocol.  For example, after being centrifuged the final time, they were left sitting in the centrifuge for about 20 minutes before being resuspended in fresh water.  If anything, this should have a significant effect on the transformation effeciency.
Also linearized DNA:
Tried to make reactions that were multiples of 17 uL for use in the transformation protocol.  Put in about 0.5 ug of DNA per 17 uL.  Heat inactivated the PstI, but this would have been ineffective for BstEII.  Thus, cleaned up all reactions using a PCR purification kit.  Eluted in volumes that were identical to the original volumes of each reaction (either 36 uL, 53 uL, or 70 uL, accounting for the loss of 2 uL in the column).  However, concentrations were not measured, so it is possible that the DNA was at different concentrations than we assumed.  Should have taken concentration measurements beforehand, or else there will be no basis for standardization.  At this point, will merely have to observe whether the transformation efficiencies on each plate are comparable to each other.
Placed all plates into incubator around 11:30 pm.
Competent E. coli cells:
Used overnight culture of HB101 to inoculate a large culture of SOB media (500 mL). Monitored growth until the OD was around 0.0741 according to the nanodrop, which we have reason to believe corresponds to 0.741.
Will test the competence of these cells tomorrow.

Gene Doping in Society Surveys
We handed out surveys both during the train debates and in the public transports and streets during our time in China. From the start we focussed on reducing any survey response effects, which are unintended psychological effects influencing the responses of the respondents. We found alarmingly high numbers of people interested to use gene doping for performance enhancement among the general public in both The Netherlands as well as in China. This reinforced our project, to promote responsible use of synthetic biology. The topic certainly caught public interest and one person even wanted to contemplate longer before sending us the survey over the mail as can be seen in figure 9.
Figure 9. A survey sent to us by one of the people we met on the trains and who wanted to think further about the topic. We thank him and everyone else who contributed.
Survey hypothesis and results
We had the following hypotheses with results:
We expected a general fear of gene technology due to a lack of information supply on the topic to the general public both in The Netherlands as well as in China.
Most people are not afraid for gene technology in both countries and there seems to be only little difference between both countries. In The Netherlands only 11.2% is afraid of gene technology, which is 13.7% in the People’s Republic of China. In addition, more than 75% of the respondents in The Netherlands indicated they would like to be more informed about developments in biotechnology through e.g. debates.
We hypothesized that people would be hesitant to use gene doping because the phenomenon will sound new and thereby dangerous to many people at this point. Based on a paper by Connor et al. (2009) that did research on the tendency towards doping use in athletes, one would expect that less than 12 per cent of the respondents from the general public would take gene doping for performance enhancement.
For the Dutch population this prediction is still relatively close to the 16% that actually wants to use gene doping for purposes other than just medical. For the Chinese population this prediction is clearly wrong as there 55% is open to using gene doping for performance enhancement. Together, given the extra pressure that is generally put on athletes, these figures provide us with an alarming estimation"

Additionally with this library the amino acid frequency is improved towards a balanced ratio in between the different kinds (Dueber) .
Each approach could generate up to 415 DNA sequences, which is roughly 1,07 billion. On the level of the amino acid sequence there are 3,2 million possibilities, since each residue can be taken by 20 different amino acids.  For the assay we therefore need a high throughput method.
We adapted work of DeLoache, Russ and Dueber using the violacein pathway to measure the import effectiveness of tripeptides. The pathway consists of Violacein A (VioA), Violacein B (VioB) and Violacein E (VioE). It converts tryptophan into the green product prodeoxyviolacein (PDV). The first two enzymes, VioA and VioB, are expressed in the cytosol, and the third one, VioE, is targeted to the peroxisome with a PTS1 sequence. The degree of import can be measured by the intensity of green colour of the colonies. An efficient import signal leads to a strong import of the VioE into the peroxisome and subsequently to white colonies, because the intermediates cannot diffuse into the peroxisome to its respective enzyme. DeLoache et al. showed that there is a proportional correlation between the concentration of the green product PDV and a red fluorescent substance. The concentration of this product displays the import efficiency of the respective sequence.
This assay has been used for the evaluation of the generated PTS2 sequences. The VioE-PTS2 plasmids are harvested and cotransformed with a VioA-VioB plasmid. Each plasmid contains a specific auxotrophy marker. Consequently every growing colony contains both plasmids. To evaluate the respective sequence the concentration of the red fluorescence is measured. The more fluorescence is detected the more VioE is in the cytosol. Therefore the respective PTS2 is not that efficient. The other way around a low concentration of the fluorescent substance correlates with an efficient import via the respective PTS2.

Paris_Bettencourt,2017,Team:Paris Bettencourt#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," just for students; some spaces are for researchers to help them with their research and experiments, and others aim to help in prototyping projects that will eventually be commercialized. This large variety in our interviews was a great value as we got very diverse and complete answers to our questions.  Here are the main points that we extracted from those interviews: FREQUENTATION The frequentation of fablabs is very variable depending on the day or the time of the year. Some people come once for a short amount of time just to print something, while others are regular members and part of the community. Depending on the fablab, the number of regular members ranged from 10 to 100 per month. The time actually spent on the machines is very short though, about only 10% of the weekly time — while the rest is spent on the conception, etc. BIOLOGICAL PRINTERS VS TRADITIONAL ONES? When asked whether biological printers would ever replace traditional ones, most agreed that they won’t. While the idea of using only biomaterials is attractive environmentally speaking, and the use of biomaterials has been rising in the past years, it is not realistic that they would completely replace plastic and other materials in the near future. Also the cost of biological printers is very prohibitive, and when the machine is used as an educational tool for modeling and manufacturing, this extra cost is not justified since there are much cheaper 3D printers. So the general idea was rather that the two could coexist. GMOs AND PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE As our biological 3D printer contains genetically modified bacteria and GMOs don’t have very good publicity in France in general, we wanted to assess the interest and acceptance of the different fablab communities regarding GMOs and biotech in general. The answers depended a lot on where we asked. In fablabs open to the general public, there was concern that something might go wrong if GMOs were used for anyone to use, without clear knowledge of the impact it could have on the ecosystem if the GMOs were to escape the machine. Some though were aware that the bad opinion of GMOs came mostly from sci-fi movies, and that GMOs are being used in research, medicine, food, etc. a lot more that most people are aware of; they thought that scientists should work more on communicating their research, its use and the associated risks to the public. In fablabs such as La Paillasse and Pasteur where GMOs are already being used routinely, the opinion was that the public has yet to realize that solutions brought by GM organisms actually make sense, especially regarding oil, climate"

Bacteria and block matrix
We could obtain the heat resistant E. coli strain BM28 (derived via directed evolution of strain MG1655 zba::kan) [ 2 ], which endure temperatures up to 50°C. This is very important to us since we have chosen a matrix named GELRITE to immobilize our bacteria. It can be penetrated by light with only little refraction and it contains a minimum of nutrient to enable growth and protein synthesis but it polymerizes at 46°C. To ensure an even distribution of the bacteria we need to add them into the liquid gel which in turn means that they need to endure more than 46°C for at least 2 or 3 minutes.
How the final construct should work
By addition of S-Gal to the GELRITE matrix a fully functional AND-gate should lead to dark spots/colonies when hit with blue and red light. For proof of principle, we also used gfp coupled to fluorescence detection.
Since the red light sensor is active in the ground state, one needs to shut down the signalling. This can be achieved by irradiation with light of 650 nm [ 3 ].  Afterwards, bacteria get hit by both far red light (705 nm [ 3 ]) and blue light (465 nm [ 4 ]) beams. Cph8 consist of the extracellular membrane domain cph1 and the intracellular part envZ. The red light induces the autophosphorylation at the cytosolic site of cph8[ 5 ]. This leads to phosphorylation of ompR [ 6 ] which subsequently binds to the ompC promoter and enables transcription of the supD t-RNA.
When YcgF senses blue light it dimerizes and binds to the repressor YcgE. The formation of the YcgE-YcgF complex leads to the unbinding of YcgE from the YcgZ promoter which activates the transcription of T7ptag (T7 polymerase with the amber stop codon mutation). However, translation of this mRNA is only possible if enough supD tRNA is available.
This AND-gate should ensure that expression of T7ptag is only induced when both wavelengths hit the bacteria. Since the reporter gene is under the control of a T7 promoter, lacZ or gfp expression is only enabled when the generated T7 polymerase binds to the T7 promoter.
The red light signal transduction pathway is supposedly also an osmolarity sensor, mainly dependent on aspartate [ 7 ] concentration,"

I’m doing my M.Sc. in Systems Biology. I joined the iGEM team because I wanted to take active part in a research group (a really special one :-)) and because I wanted to spend the summer holidays working and having fun with wonderful people. Although I enjoy the wet lab, lately I’m getting more and more interested in bioinformatics. For me computers are still mysterious machines that perform some kind of magic but  we managed to reach a level of cooperation. During my free time I love dancing, especially salsa and other Latin dances. I also enjoy practicing yoga and swimming. My favorite cake is Gulerodskage, carrot cake.

Kevin and Chris ran a PCR to produce a component for the final construct for the Multidirectional Promoters Project. The first reaction did not yield the expected results. Two more were prepared for comparison.
Tuesday, June 19, 2012
Hannah and Kevin extracted plasmids from the CBAR cultures again to get a higher yield for sequencing. Victoria and Alexander worked on the Codon Optimization construct by culturing insert components. They also extracted plasmids with the desired components for the final construct. These components were digested, run in a gel, extracted, and Cleaned and Concentrated. Kevin and Chris ran a gel to compare the PCR runs set up yesterday. This showed that the PCR runs had not yielded the desired components. Another PCR run was prepared and run a lower temperature for better annealing. Hannah ran a gel of her CBAR plasmid digests to see if they contained the correct parts. Unfortunately both gels showed that the plasmids were self ligations of a single component of the construct.
Wednesday, June 20, 2012
Victoria developed a new method for the assembly of the Codon Optimization Project. Hannah designed primers for the main construct for the Multiple Start Codons project. Kevin and Chris ran gels and extracted components for the final construct for the Multidirectional Promoters Project. They also ran another set of PCR to make more of the three components for the CBAR assembly they will need to do. Kait and Alexander extracted plasmids containing components for the Codon Optimization Construct.

Kait and Victoria sent a construct for sequencing. Hannah compared the effects of a more concentrated LB broth on the growth of DH10B. Kevin completed a storyboard for an animation describing one of the projects. He also isolated components from the PCR runs set up yesterday through the use of gel electrophoresis.

Additionally, another module may be implemented to further optimize the platform for terpenoid production. P. pastoris utilizes a great part of the molecules produced in the mevalonate pathway to feed its sterol pathway, starting with the production of squalene. Silencing the squalene synthase gene, ERG9, would enable the use of precursors for terpenoid production.  Although P. pastoris has no known RNAi mechanism, it has been shown that introducing genes for Dicer and Argonaute from Saccharomyces castellii successfully provides S. cerevisiae with the silencing mechanism. Introducing the AGO1 and DCR1 genes, together with an antisense sequence for the ERG9 gene, a separate module for the platform is generated.

METU_Turkey_Software,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software#test_-_-_TEXT.html," we are still waiting      to hear from 33 teams. 74% teams participated with one or more members      to the survey.
75% of participants were interested with synthetic biology field      for academic purposes.
Browsing the Registry of Standard Parts
56% of participants think that it is not easy to search      for the parts in Registry of Standard Parts. Many comments      indicate a need for a better search engine and more flexible keyword      search options, especially excepting aliases. Also many are longing      for recognizable parts names, which will ease searching with keyword.
Partnership with Google and enforcing standardized parts names     are suggested
As a global organization iGEM can offer the Parts Registry in     different languages and more illustrations describing how the system     works.
Content of Registry of Standard Parts
57% of participants agree that the number of parts registered      in the Registry of Standard Parts is not enough for their projects.
55% of participants think that there are enough and      useful parts distributed in iGEM Plates that we can use in our projects.
Even though most agree the number of parts in the registry is impressive,     still they find it limited when it comes to design different devices     for diverse applications especially in different species other than     E. Coli. Participants believe that if there are more functional standardized     parts, especially protein coding sequences and promoter-RBS , they can     design devices according to the needs of the community instead of designing     what can simply be assembled into a device.
Encouraging development of vectors and standards for new species     and new standardized parts in different research areas is suggested.
Enforcing submission of right DNA sequences and working conditions     for each part is suggested.
Few recommend expanding iGEM into a collaborative effort rather     than an undergraduate tournament, which will increase the number and     the diversity of the parts designed and submitted all throughout the     year.
Submission to the Parts Registry
52% of participants said that they have not encountered      difficulties during submitting parts. Even though participants      are satisfied with the web interface of the registry, most complains      about the pSB1C3 as the new standard plasmid to submit DNA.
71% of participants are like minded with our team's      opinion, which is that The nomenclature of part IDs such as construct,      device, composite parts, protein generator, is confusing as there      is no consensus on how to use them correctly.
Terminology and categorization used on iGEM’s Parts Registry should     be re-described and correct use of terminology should be enforced during     the submission process.

An improved agitation of the liquids in the fuel cell would increase the speed of mediated electron transfer and thereby boost the power output. When MFCs are applied in a sewage treatment plant, where the medium is already flowing this agitation could be achieved without requiring additional energy.
The power output of the fuel cell is highly dependent on the cathode reaction. By using another electron acceptor than potassium ferricyanide it might be increased. Oxygen for example has a much higher standard potential than potassium ferricyanide (+1.23 V / +0.45 V). Using it as an electron acceptor might almost triple the cell potential.
Using E. coli provided an easy way for creating and testing biobricks. However, introducing the biobricks into another chassis might yield even better results.
The performance of our fuel cell and microorganisms does not yet allow for an economic application, but our work shows the potential of using synthetic biology in this matter. If more work is put into the design of fuel cells and the genetic engineering of power-generating microorganisms, the technology will hopefully be beneficial in the future.

I just earned my Bachelor's degree of Biological Sciences at the University of Bonn where I majored in Microbiology and Biotechnology. I am currently attending the Master's program Microbiology and Biochemistry at the University of Göttingen specializing in Molecular Genetics, Microbial Cell Biology and Biochemistry. This will be my first iGEM participation and I am eagerly looking forward to working on our project. It will be an opportunity to work independently and on our own responsibility and to learn a lot about lab work in general. I am looking forward to take part in the international competition to gain valuable experiences that will broaden my horizon.

“Using the biosurfactant in oil and gas production is a new approach for the industries. It would be an option for Enhance Oil Recovery (EOR) instead of using synthetic (chemical) surfactant. Conventional recovery types recover only 20% of oil in reservoir. Today, advanced technology allows production of about 60 percent of the available resources from a formation. By optimizing the amount of biosurfactant injected to the well, we could bring as much as 60 percent of the reserve to the surface.
Consequently, there are few things to consider before using the biosurfactant. Extracting oil and natural gas from deposits deep underground is not as simple as just drilling and completing a well. Firstly, the biological safety issue will come up related to bacterial usage for biosurfactant production. The second one is the safety issue in association with work risk, such as fire and accident caused by the reaction of biosurfactant and oil. The last point is the cost of production. The industry may select it as more cost effective than the other substance. The ITB_Indonesia iGEM team is becoming a part of EOR development. Good job.”

β-Lactamase
What is β-lactamase?
β-lactamase is an enzyme encoded by the ampicillin resistance gene (ampR) frequently present in plasmids for selection. Structurally, β-lactamase is a 29 kDa monomeric enzyme (Figure 1). Its enzymatic activity provides resistance to β-lactam antibiotics such as carbapenems, penicillin and ampicillin through hydrolysis of the β-lactam ring, a structure shared by the β-lactam class of antibiotics (Qureshi, 2007).
Figure 1.3D structure of β-lactamase made using the Embedded Python Molecular Viewer and Maya.  We used spatial modeling to better understand what our proteins such as β-lactamase look like and how they interact in our system. To learn more about how we used spatial modeling to inform systems our design, click here .
Many advantages come from working with β-lactamase. It shows high catalytic efficiency and simple kinetics. Also, no orthologs of ampR are known to be encoded by eukaryotic cells and no toxicity was identified making this protein very useful in studies involved eukaryotes (Qureshi, 2007). β-lactamase has been used to track pathogens in infected murine models (Kong et al., 2010). However, in addition to its application in eukaryotic cells,β-lactamase has been found to have an alternative application in synthetic proteins as well. β-lactamase is able to"

The best way ever to preserve lithic relics
an innovative biochemical method to resolve erosion.
View Our Works
The inscriptions on Precipice are one of the most common and fundamental forms of traditional Chinese relics. Due to having been carved in open areas plus the exposure to sunshine and raindrops, which is often the case for most of them,the Inscriptions are weathered readily. Currently, there are quite a few methods to resolve this phenomenon but some of them are not used properly which occasionally cause the damage for the Inscriptions. Our research project aims at using microorganism method, which is to put a plasmid with the ability to convert bio-oriented oxaloacetic acid to oxalate acid into the cell of E.coil, inducing the cell and the product will react with one component of the Inscriptions-- calcium carbonate-- to generate nearly insoluble calcium oxalate monohydrate to adhere to the Inscriptions for protection. Another E.coil with the ablility to secrete lipase has also been constructed; we aim to add this cell when we are cleansing the Inscriptions to resolve the oil substances on the surface of them. By constructing these products, we are able to protect the relics either from human errors as cleaning and protecting or from natural damnification.

Substrate Set
Our substrate screening experiment produced a large number of interesting substrates for our detection assay. We looked at the raw fluorescence measurements, but we also applied statistical analysis to identify the peptides that had significant differences between the three venoms. In addition, we modelled the enzymatic activity of the venoms based on our measurements.
Figure 1: Significant substrates found in our experiment, by looking at the signal difference between the three snakes after the 60 minutes timepoint. BA represents Bitis arietans, BG represents Bitis gabonica and NN Naja nigricollis. Significance here is defined by log10(p) < -9.
You can find the plots of logarithmic fluorescence signal and time of all the substrates here .
The relative signal of each substrate between the three snakes was also analyzed. You can find that part here .
Lastly, we looked at the fluorescence output in terms of enzymatic activity. We fit a non-linear model in the reactions and calculated their rates. You can find the models for all the substrates here .
Figure 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d: Non-linear model fitted in fluorescence measurements. The sequences of the peptides can be seen next to their well numbers. J12 is cleaved by all three venoms, N21 by Bitis gabonica and Bitis arietans, B17 only by Bitis arietans, and O22 only by Bitis gabonica. Background noise has been deducted from the measurements.
Figure 3: Occurrences of enzymatic rates of the models for each snake venom.
LacZ Device
Purpose
If β-galactosidase is used as a reporter in our biosensor, we would have an output of our device that depends on two subsequent enzymatic reactions. We want to model how the enzymatic activity of the first reaction affects the kinetics of the secondary reaction, and find some optimal time for the first reaction to run, if we want the combined time of both enzymatic reactions to be as short as possible.
Background
In investigating if our prototype would be a viable option for in-field detection we decided to meet with Andreas Lausten, Co-founder of VenomAB, a producer of breakthrough solutions to modern antivenom monovalent production . As per his recommendation our system would ideally have to give a rapid response. As of yet, our assays had shown response time above 45 minutes for certain venoms, and we should seek to reduce the response time. In doing this we would have to amplify the"

For efficient organisation, the expiry was documented before the run (siehe figure PI-PACE). This enables several team members to carry the experiment forward, without decrease in quality. The PACE run was successfully performed for 137 hours, displaying an acceptable phage titer in comparison to the literature (Esvelt et al., Nature 2011; Pu et al., Nature 2017). Sadly, we were running into another problem, which was highly reported by Kevin Esvelt - phage washout. The results of our plaque assays showed no infective phages in our lagoons after the 23. timepoint, corresponding to 137 hours of PACE. In addition, we could not reveal any mutations in our sequencings in a number of eight plaques which were picked for detection of potential mutations in the N-terminal domain of the RNAP.
Figure 11: Design of the Accessory Plasmids for the Evolution of Cas9
The AP consists of five subparts that are devided by homology regions for Gibson assembly (numbers). It carries an expression cassette for the transcription of a gRNA (between 1 and 5).  GeneVI (2-3) is under control of a that can be activated by the Cas9-rpoZ in context with the respective gRNA. luxAB accounts as a reporter for fluorescent readout of geneIII activation (3-4). The whole plasmid can be produced with different origins of replication (4-5) to modulate the copy number and by exchanging the geneVI part with the RBS.
Facing these problems, the general experimental design of our PACE device, as well as the bacterial strains and the inducer concentration were investigated for potential mistakes. Based on the observation, that we can detect phages even after almost six days, we focused on the induction of mutagenesis during our PACE run. As the mutagenesis is induced by arabinose and inhibted by glucose, we primarily concentrated on the glucose and arabinose concentrations in our PACE apparatus. Therefore, our modeling hypthesized a too high glucose concentration in our medium, as well as a low arabinose concentration, which could be a reason for neither mutations in our picked plaques. Together with this theoretical assumption, we developed an alternative PACE setup for testing of the induction of mutagenesis during PACE.

During the restriction digest I had to incubate the cells 20 extra minutes in the 37 degree and then it was placed in the pcr machine.  The bands were very unclear and we were not certain if the plasmids were cut as we did not have enough control.  This mistake allowed us to realize that a control is essential as the cut promoters did not differ very much from the uncut plasmid in the number of base pairs.  Also, our ladder was very bright compared to the bands and we were informed by Traci that it was the result of it being too concentrated.  After cutting the bands out I had to do 3 of the gel extraction by hand.  There was not"

We interviewed several people, including a Member of Parliament and one of the people behind iGEM Watch. We also acted out a play about the future influenced by synthetic biology that was written by Chris.
Two A-level students stayed with us for a week each and helped us out with the science and art parts of the project. In addition, we talked about our project at an event at the Natural History Museum. For more information on our outreach and to listen to Radio iGEM and read Chris' play, visit our Outreach page.

In Vitro Immune System
Diversity is an important feature of biological systems, and it can be harnessed to serve as a useful tool in synthetic biology.
Many organisms have molecular mechanisms to generate diversity at the DNA level in order to accelerate evolution. This is true in particular with host/pathogen interactions, where the host must mutate to protect itself from the pathogen and the pathogen mutates to evade host defenses. One important example of such diversity generating mechanisms is found in the Bordetella bacteriophage BPP-1. Bordetella is a genus of bacteria that can infect the mammalian respiratory tract, causing diseases such as pertussis (whooping cough). The infectious cycle of the Bordetella bacteria involves a switch between a non-infectious and an infectious stage with different virulence factors and surface receptors expressed. Interactions between bacteria surface receptors and phage tail fiber proteins are extremely specific. The tip of each virus tail-fiber is a protein called the major tropism determinant protein ( Mtd ), which binds to the hosts’ surface and allows the phage to infect it. In order to successfully infect both phases of the host bacteria, the BPP-1 phage uses a complex genetic mechanism to generate diversity at the host-recognition site of the Mtd protein.
Though the general structure of the Mtd protein is constant and very stable, its active ends are extremely variable. Each phage produces a slightly different structural variant of the protein, with the hope that at least one phage can successfully bind to the host and infect it - akin to the way our immune system produces numerous variants of antibodies so that at least one can bind to the antigen of interest.
Others have utilized phage display techniques in order to exploit the Mtd’s natural stability to generate enormously diverse protein libraries. These pursuits have been conducted in vivo, using the BPP-1 phage’s native diversity generation system (Overstreet). Our team hopes to develop a fully in vitro system using synthetic diversity generation techniques to express and select for Mtd variants of interest.
We plan on first generating a diverse DNA library of the mtd gene. Next, we plan on using mRNA-display as a means to detect and screen for the variants"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Toxicity Theory_-_-_TEXT.html,"1991). However, certain cases allow oxidation of molecules by molecular oxygen, e.g. the presence of a paramagnetic center other than that of the molecular oxygen and good catalysts for one-electron reduction such as the transition metals copper and iron. The arising ROS are mostly the superoxide anion (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and singlet oxygen (1O2) (Halliwell, 1991). O2- attacks thiols and ascorbate as well as iron sulfur clusters in proteins and thus disrupts the protein’s structure and leads to a loss of its function. Furthermore, it is able to reduce transition metals such as iron and copper, e.g. Cu(II) to Cu(I). It tends to form the highly reactive hydroperoxyl radical (•OOH) under acidic conditions. The degradation of the superoxide anion happens by spontaneous dismutation into hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen (Masoud et al., 2015). Hydrogen peroxide itself is reactive as well. The exact reaction mechanism in the cell is unknown due to its reaction speed. However, it is known that hydrogen peroxide reacts with reduced copper and/or iron ions to form hydroxyl radicals. As a weak oxidizing agent it attacks thiol groups and reduces glutathione (Liu et al., 2015). Hydroxyl radicals are highly reactive and react with almost every molecule. Since it is highly reactive, its reaction rate is limited by diffusion. The reactivity of hydroxyl radicals derives from its high standard electrode potential (+2.3 V). Therefore, it is able to oxidize almost any molecule other than ozone (Zhang et al., 2018). There are several origins for the different types of ROS: Superoxide anion is formed by autoxidation of distinct dehydrogenases and certain reductases, e.g. glutathione reductase. Non-enzymatic production is achieved by autoxidation of certain cellular components such as ubiquinols. Hydrogen peroxidase derives from several oxidases and the superoxide dismutase. UV radiation breaks it down into hydroxyl radicals (Mignolet-Spruyt et al., 2016). Other mechanisms for the generation of hydroxyl radicals are the Fenton and/or Haber-Weiss reaction (Fagali et al., 2015; Kehrer, 2000). Haber-Weiss:     Fe3+ + •O2- → Fe"

Hello, dear reader!
Today we’ll get the results of DH5α growth, it contains bio bricks for bioremediation, accumulation and to detect Hg in medium LM (LB + mercury chloride) 2ug/ml, 5ug/ml and 10ug/ml.
Where +, ++ and +++ means low, medium and high growth, respectively. As we could observe, as our biosensor and bioaccumulator don’t hold MerA (mercury reductase) protein MerA, those doesn’t express resistance to higher Hg concentrations than 2ug/ml, unlike our bioremediator, that, as we could evaluate on previous tests, it grows in 10 times higher concentrations. Because of this, our tests for absorption and detection in mass spectrometry and spectrofluorometer will be done in concentrations at lower or equal to 2ug/ml.
Today we transferred transformed DH5α with bio brick BBa_K516030 in liquid and solid medium LB with chloramphenicol 34ug/ml.
In parallel, the test with mercury and the new constructions, we’re also isolating wild bacteria from the contaminated stream and Negro River. Yesterday we made the test with different antibiotics in solid LB, and the result was:
Ampicillin 100ug/ml and streptomycin 20ug/ml:
Tetracycline 12ug/ml:
Chloramphenicol 34ug/ml and kanamycin 50ug/ml:
The result on the following table, comparing the colony’s size in LB medium + antibiotic to the colony’s size on LB medium without antibiotic.
Where +, ++, +++, ++++ and +++++ represents quantitatively the colony similarity between growth on medium with antibiotic related to the colony’s size on medium Luria-Bertani.
We made inoculum in liquid medium of each sample (A1, A2; E1, E2; P1, P2, P3; S1) for total DNA extraction!

Characterization
Phosphate-sensitive promoter characterization is somewhat difficult. Only when phosphate concentration is below 4uM could there be response. However, it is conflicting that phosphate is essential for bacteria to survive. Moreover, many complex medium, like LB medium, could not fit this requirement. So strict control of medium components is in need. Finally, we singled out the MOPS minimal medium designed by Frederick C.Neidhardt in 1974 [4] which is a kind of synthetic medium with MOPS as buffer agent rather than KHPO4/KH2PO4.
We developed a protocol for low-phosphate induction experiment designed specifically for phosphate-sensitive promoter characterization. See more.
We appled the real-time plate reader as our testing tool to detect whether the promoter works or not, ultra-sensitively respond or graded respond.

Promoter engineering methods
3.1 Overview According to the papers and our characterization results, we realized that modifications of both phosphate- and nitrate-sensitive promoter are necessary when integrated into our whole project. The modification of former one is especially vital because the order of magnitude between susceptibility thresholds of BBa_K216005 and desirable one is nearly 100 times. To solve this question, we have collaborated with our modelers to extract the key factors from two corresponding TCSs. In addition, we conceived several potential solutions to further improve our responding sensitivity if time permits.
3.2 Affinity of response regulator(RR) binding site
To fine-tune RR binding site is one of the promoter engineering process. The detailed Flow chart can be seen on the right site. Error-Prone PCR could provide us with a large-scale promoter library which could be used as the ‘seed bank’. We could screen several ones which meet our needs.
We have tried to construct the promoter libraries of PphoBR, Pugp and K216005 by error-prone PCR. Unfortunately, we did not get the ideal promoter library, further experiment is still in progress.
3.3 the number of histone kinase (HK) molecules
Lu Zhou’s experiment has proved that HK concentration could influence the proportion and sensitivity of stimulated cells. Curve colors represent different strengths of induced HK expression[5]
It is interesting to find that TCS is highly homologous system. Firstly, both HK and RR coding genes share some highly similar motif. Secondly, HK and RR coding genes in each TCS are all transcribed in the same polycistron. Moreover, it has been proved that HK translation rates are significantly lower than RR"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time"
Duke,2018,Team:Duke#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," was added as a large component of the drug.  [6] However, Cremophor EL is believed to cause hypersensitivity to other drugs. This is an issue because most cancer drugs are used in sequence or in combination with other drugs because cancer is incurable. [16] 80% of women with ovarian cancer use adjuvant chemotherapy, [13] and Cremophor EL could intensify the already strong side effects of chemotherapy.  We used homology modeling to develop protein models for the five necessary genes to determine active site architecture and catalytic functions. These models were then used to consider possible mutations to the genes in order to produce alternative taxane products with enhanced solubility. Enhanced solubility would allow us to use the great cytotoxic potential of taxanes in the future while alleviating the problematic toxic side effects.
Social and Political Involvement
The drug gained a lot of political attention in 1989, with main controversies stemming from the uniqueness of the activity of taxol (microtubule stabilization instead of destabilization) verses the preservation of biological diversity. Environmentalists attempted to classify the Pacific Yew as a threatened species. This failed, but resulted in the Pacific Yew Act of 1992, which outlines specific harvest policies. However, there was also the issue of privatization of scientific property. In 1991, the National Cancer Institute (NCI, the main organization responsible for development and funding of taxol as a cancer drug), the Bureau of Land Management, and Bristol-Myers Squibb created the CRADAs (Co-operative Research and Development Agreements), essentially giving BMS exclusive rights to publicly funded research of taxol from Pacific Yew trees.  This event, coinciding with increasing costs of pharmaceuticals, sparked a movement for ‘lay participation in biomedical practice.’ [13] So, instead of seeing this as a fight between biodiversity and drugs, this can also be viewed as an attempt to gain more participation in the policy of medicine. In thinking about our project, and its impacts on society, we would like to support more participation and patient rights in the clinical process of drug development. There should be more transparency, more patient input, and to foster this we held a seminar to invite public opinion on genome editing. We want to encourage public participation and hope in the future, knowledge about the process and decisions that go into drug research and pricing are made more publicly available.

These results confirm that pSB1A8YL replicates in Y. lipolytica, and the chosen uracil selection marker allows for selection of transformants.                     To further assess the functionality of pSB1A8YL, the possibility of counter selection was investigated. This was done by growing colonies containing pSB1A8YL on plates containing 5-FOA. Colonies appearing on these plates were then transferred to selective dropout media not containing uracil. As no growth was observed on the latter plate, this proved that pSB1A8YL supports counter selection.

DESCRIPTION
2. Cloning capabilities in E. coli
In order to test this, we decided to produce a device using BioBricks from the distribution kit which would allow us to easily assess whether the clonings were successful. When deciding BioBricks that would allow this, we received inputs from the SDU iGEM team. We ended up choosing the strong Andersson promoter/strong RBS BioBrick ( BBa_K880005 ) and pair this with three chromoproteins: amilCP ( BBa_K592009 ), amilGFP ( BBa_K592010 ) and mRFP ( BBa_E1010 ), which would allow us to easily pick transformants and visually inspect if the cloning was successful. The cloning flow is shown in Figure 6.
Figure 6: Cloning flow of the test of pSB1A8YL in E. coli. The expression of the chromoproteins should yield a color ouput detectable by visual inspection.

DESCRIPTION
The BioBricks were retrieved from the distribution kit, and assembled with our plasmid as carrier backbone using standard 3A assembly and transformed into chemically competent E. coli DH5α cells. The transformants yielded colored colonies (See Figure 7), and the identity of the constructs were confirmed using restriction analysis and PCR (data not shown). These results confirm that pSB1A8YL can be used for cloning in E. coli and supports the BioBrick standard.

Design
TnrA-pAlsT -RFP
Main goal of this part is to show TnrA protein’s repressor activity on pAlst promoter and derepression of this promoter in the presence of NH3. Thereby we combined TnrA protein’s and pAlst’s gene sequences on the same biobrick. As a reporter, we put RFP gene sequence in front of the pAlst sequence. To make sure the repressive protein TnrA is produced in a high amount, we combined TnrA-pAlst-RFP gene sequence with T7 promoter which has a high transcription rate. Also, we put a Lac operator which LacI protein can bind, between this sequence and T7 promoter, in order to create a controllable system. We searched to find an expression vector working in harmony with this system, peT45-b expression vector was serving this purpose. . When we ordered our genes, we put RFC10 prefix site on 3’ end of TnrA-pAlst-RFP gene sequence and also BamHI restriction enzyme recognition site for cloning to peT45-b. We added RFC10 suffix site on 5’ end of the same gene sequence and also XhoI restriction enzyme recognition site for cloning to peT-45 vector, again.
As shown above,we planned to clone the ordered TnrA-pAlst-RFP gene into peT45-b vector by using BamHI and XhoI enzymes. Final construct after this cloning is, T7 promoter-Lac operator(LacO)-HisTag-TnrA-pAlst-RFP, respectively. Besides, a constitutive promoter called LacI promoter and LacI protein sequence in front of that, found on peT45-b vector’s another part. It is obvious that this part is IPTG-dependent, so Western Blot can be performed easily with the help of His Tag.
According to this system, under the absence of IPTG; TnrA production  will be repressed, pAlsT promoter will be derepressed and RFP won’t be produced. If IPTG is present,  TnrA will be produced , pAlsT promoter becomes derepressed and red colored bacteria will be observed with"

St Lawrence School - Bacterial Superheroes
Our team was keen on making children in York enthusiastic about science and the wonders of Synthetic Biology! With this in mind, they set out to St Lawrence School, where they spent one day running a workshop with students from years 3-6.
The workshop, called 'Bacterial Superheroes', introduced the children to some of the special powers bacteria can have, such as surviving in extreme temperatures, changing the colour of their environment, glowing and, of course, producing gold. Then, children were encouraged to invent their own type of superhero, bacteria which can solve a worldwide problem, by using some of these properties.  Children came up with amazing ideas, which they drew on paper and presented in front of the class. The best ideas received prizes. Here are some of the ones that caught our eye:
Using bacteria which can survive in the cold and glow, to populate icebergs; in this way, icebergs will glow at night and ships will not run into them anymore.
Bacteria which can be eaten and, once in our stomach, produce a special substance (iGEM York suggestion, pheromones). Then, you offer the person you like the same type of food with bacteria, and once the bacteria produce the substance inside them, they fall in love with you.
By the end of the workshop, children learnt what bacteria are, that not all of them are bad, that they can be modified in the lab by scientists to have special properties that these properties can lead to the invention of useful products. And that science can be fun and they themselves can be scientists one day.

Calgary,2010,Team:Calgary#Community#Podcasts#Transcripts_-_-_TEXT.html," synthesize killer bugs in his basement is a little far-fetched.
Alex: Yeah people need to understand that this kind of work requires more than a few test tubes. What kind of things would a disgruntled scientists need if he wanted to synthesize an evil organism?
Dev: Well besides the need for precise chemical synthesis of gene fragments from somewhere such as a gene synthesis company, synthesizing self-replicating life requires high-throughput sequencing facilities so that you can be sure you have the right sequence, sophisticated designing strategy, and multiple steps of quality control. Among other things.
Alex: So this sort of thing couldn’t be done alone in your garage.
Dev: Assuming your garage isn’t extremely well equipped.
Alex: But people aren’t just worried about their safety in the sense that harmful organisms could be created, there is also a lot of concern revolving around the ethical implications of our newfound capacity to chemically create life. There’s a lot of use of the phrase “playing god”.
Dev: But is this a real worry? I mean it’s not like we can now create new organisms or animals.
Alex: Well there is a concern that as we further this technology, we will be able to create organisms that did not come to us through natural Darwinian evolution, and even gain the ability to use this technology to genetically design humans.
Dev: That sounds almost like something out of science fiction.
Alex: At this stage in the game, it sort of is, but that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t be aware of the ethical risks associated with the advancement of our capability to synthesize life. The Vatican’s response to the creation of replicating synthetic life by Craig Venter and his team was actually fairly positive. “If it is used toward the good, to treat pathologies, we can only be positive” the Vatican’s top bioethics official, Monsignor Rino Fisichella, told Italian state-run television news programme TG Uno. The head of the Italian Catholic bishop’s conference Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco said that “intelligence can never be without responsibility”
Dev: Well I think that that properly sums up the attitude that we should have towards instances like this. The advent of synthetic life represents a momentous step forward in mankind’s ability to combat many of the problems facing us, but we need to ensure that those tools are not abused so as to cause harmful results.

Exeter,2017,Team:Exeter#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," reactor page . By using a known initial concentration, recording the flowrate of the water and calculating the volume of the metal binding reactor, we were able to input the same values into our model.
We collected the outflow water into 100ml samples, then measured the concentration of mannose in each sample using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography. Using the known flowrate, we calculated the time intervals from the volumes. Graphs were then plotted of output concentration against time for both the models output concentration values at the timestep intervals and the experimental data.
This enabled us to calculate a scaling factor which takes into account the frequency of collisions and binding constants. The scaling factor is dependent on the flowrate and volume of reactor as we became aware of the fact that the collision rate is affected by the time that the ions will be inside the reactor, which depend on both of these factors. Comparing to the experimental data also made us aware that the number of E. coli per unit area calculated from the scanning electron microscope was out by a large factor. This is potentially due to the E. coli aggregating making it difficult to count the number of them in the image. With this correction to our model, Figure 4 shows that the output from our model now agrees with 6 of the 8 data points obtained through experimental measurements.
Figure 4: Experimental Data against Model Output.
Error Handling
Our model works by calculating how the ion concentration changes over discrete time steps, or iterations. During the development of this model it became apparent that, while running online, if the number of iterations exceeds a maximum value then an error occurs. As such, we have made some changes such that if the number of iterations exceeds 150,000 then the model starts again using larger time steps in order to reduce the number of iterations. This process repeats several times and allows for the model to predict outcomes for reactors which can run for up to 174 days.
Stakeholder Engagement
Veolia Water
We contacted Veolia Water Treatment Plant, a current treatment plant that removes metal ions from contaminated mine water,     to obtain feedback on the model, particularly to find out whether there were other outputs that it would be useful for the     model to produce. Their response was that we had covered similar bases to those required at their treatment plant.
In order to inform the future implementation of our research we ran the model with values provided by a representative from Veolia water treatment plant to see how our metal binding reactor system would work at an industrial scale. We were provided with data for the minewater intial concentrations, final effluent permit limit (desired concentration), the"

Outreach Events
We attended many events to inform the public on synthetic biology and our project!
Life Science Open Day
In February we represented iGEM on the open day at Delft University of Technology.
Figure 13. Representing iGEM at the TU Delft Open Day.
Bioengineering Kick Off Event
We presented our project for the first time during the Kickoff of the Delft Bioengineering Institute. Here we met Clive Brown, Chief Technical Officer of Oxford Nanopore Technologies, who showed great interest in our fusion protein.
Figure 14. One of our team members pitching our project to the Chief Technical Officer of Oxford Nanopore Technologies.
Intergenerational TU Delft iGEM BBQ
We believe iGEM doesn't stop after the competition. Not only do many teams continue their project, the iGEM experience creates intergenerational bonding. Therefore, we organized an intergenerational TU Delft iGEM BBQ for which we invited old team members since the beginning of TU Delft in iGEM.
Figure 15. Our Intergenerational TU Delft iGEM BBQ.
OWee
During the first week for freshmen in Delft, there is a big event organized called the OWee. Here, we presented our project with beetroot juice. Beetroot juice has been speculated to improve physical performance, which we wanted students to test on our running track. In the meantime, we would of course tell them all about our project!
Biofiction Film Festival
During the Bio-Fiction - Science, Art & Film Festival, we watched several short movies focused on the ethical issues surrounding new biotechnologies. This was followed with a discussion headed by four panelists: Alexander Armstrong from TU Delft iGEM, Oriana van der Sande, Tobie van Dalen, and Zoe Reddy. The focus of the discussion was the influence of art on how we view and understand new scientific and technological developments. Alexander provided his thoughts on the accuracy of the science presented in the movies to complement the other panelists thoughts on the artistic merits of the films.

UC_Chile,2012,Team:UC Chile2#Bactomithril#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," ADF-3 in salmonella. With this plasmid we can obtain the sequence of the spider silk protein ADF-3.
April 2-8, 2012
We transformed the backbone pSB1K3, so that we could amplify it when our primers arrive. Later we made and ordered the primers for our next experiment: basically the same constructs as before (GFP Reporter Plasmid) but with ADF-3 instead of sfGFP.
Ulises met with Dr. Angélica Fierro, and she accepted to be our advisor in protein modeling! Besides, we contacted Cheryl Hayashi, a well-known scientist that works with spider silk (she even spoke at TED!) [link: http://www.ted.com/talks/cheryl_hayashi_the_magnificence_of_spider_silk.html ]
We asked her if she could send us the genetic sequences EF595245 and EF595246, but later we knew that those parts are not compatible with our purposes. They are fosmids and the silk sequence is only a small portion of those clones.  The fosmids are low copy number and difficult to propagate. Then, it´s  better to work with ADF-3.
Additionally, we wrote to Dr. Sang Yup Lee, author of one of the paper “Native-sized recombinant spider silk protein produced in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli results in a strong fiber”. They produced and spun into fiber a 284.9 kDa recombinant protein of the spider Nephila clavipes in E. Coli, and we asked if he could send us his spider silk protein. Unfortunately, we didn´t receive an answer. April 9-15, 2012  The School of Engineering at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile makes every year a fair of entrepreneurship and technological innovation called Ingenia. The deanship of the Faculty of Engineering is so interested in us that wants that we form part in a conversation table to spread information about iGEM and Synthetic Biology. We will have also our own stand in the fair! On Wednesday the whole team had a meeting with Professor Rodrigo Guitérrez, and our advisors Dr. Fernán Federici (Postdoc student at Cambridge) and Dr. Mónica Vásquez (specialist in cyanobacteria). We presented them our projects and advances.  They suggested that we:  Must not forget the human practices  Should characterize existing biobricks  Should delimit and focus our projects: the time and resources are limited.   Have to consider"

This was our thought, because 1.1 Red_mazF was also able to kill 1.1 Blue_ccdB  even when they were not induced with IPTG. But our thought was disproved, because 1.1 Red_mazF was  also able to kill 2.4 Red_mazF (see plate 6), so maybe 1.1 Red_mazF already mutated. 2.4 Red_mazF was  even not able to eliminate 1.1 Blue_ccdB (see plate 5). Another reason why 1.1 Red_mazF is stronger  than its fellow 2.4 Red_mazF could be the fact, that 1.1 Red_mazF didn´t produce as much chromoprotein  red than 2.4 Red_mazF. Because of that 1.1 Red_mazF had less to do and thus more time for other  methabolic reactions, what made Red_mazF stronger (Fig. 31).

Dairy One is a dairy data management company that assists farmers in making decisions on their farms. Blane Murray from the Muranda Cheese Company uses Dairy One’s services, and referred us to the company. We spoke with John Tauzel and James Zimmermann primarily for feedback on our app. Dairy One supported the Somatic Cell Counter idea for its innovative idea and convenience. For the cost calculator, they noted that calculating the overall profit/loss of the farm rather than looking at individual cows would be more beneficial. They suggested that the cow data show the effectiveness of the farmer’s practices, so that the farmer can review productivity and make long term decisions.

Blane from the Muranda Cheese Company looked at our prototype and noted that the temperature sensor could be in the way if the teats are too close together. He suggested that we remove extraneous components on the outside of the shell that could be destroyed if the cow kicked. He also mentioned that we should try to get the modules inside the shell in a way that would not affect the liner.

Bill Morgan of Scipio Farm remembered our ideas from before and gave us a thorough analysis of what he thought of the various aspects of our project. He first gave his opinion on the milk shell. The iodine application through sponges and UV light between milkings of cows were both especially supported. They would both prevent the transfer of bacteria and hinder the growth of bacteria to begin with. The temperature sensor would be effective because a temperature change in an infected quarter of the udder is a common indicator of the occurrence of mastitis. Bill Morgan was overall very enthusiastic with our modified shell, and told us that many farmers including himself would invest in the purchase of a new device that would decrease the occurrence of mastitis. Usually, shells are a one-time purchase and only replaced when there is a better product in the market, which means that farmers would be willing to spend the money for an improvement of quality. Currently, shells range cost $40"
SYSU-China,2013,Team:SYSU-China#Project#Future work_-_-_TEXT.html," controlling gene expression. The naturally occurring miR-122 target has mismatch to microRNA-122 but can still function with knockdown efficiency. We have noticed that the team Heidelberg 2010 has used the target design of miRNA-122, or homogeneous two copies and heterogeneous four copies. But in our design, we need to best reduce leakage expression of suicide gene so we have tested for 1, 2 and 4 copies of targets rather than characterizing mismatch combination of miR122 targets.
Thirdly, the Tet system. Detailed principle of the Tet system refers to parts description page. The Tet-on system is turned on by adding doxycycline to the medium and the Tet-off system is on without doxycycline. If we use the Tet-on system, doxycycline is required to maintain selective pressure which is inconvenient for further clinical use as patient should take additional medicine all their lives. Thus if we preferred the Tet-off system, doxycycline should be added right after introducing the pathway to cells, most likely before or in the pluripotent stage. Whether the use of doxycycline will interfere cell pluripotency or directional differentiation is under investigation. Despite Tet system, there are other modules available as pathway switches. No matter which system we choose, this part should reach to following standard as: low leakage expression, high fold increase, less interfere to normal metabolism in human cells and easy to control.
Fourth, fine-tuning of parts. To achieve our initial goal, killing cancerous and wrong kinds of cells while leaving the normal hepatocytes alive, more rigid standards should be reached. Despite the well-functioning of independent parts, we need to think about the sensitivity and speciality of the whole pathway, the tolerance of FN or FP results. Two of our parts are responsible for it: the leakage expression and fold increase of Tet promoter and the knockdown efficiency of the miR-122 target. Since the expression of Tetpromoter varies among different cells due to the differences of integration site, such tests should be performed after our constant expression cell line is built.
Pluripotent test in iPSC
To confirm the availability of our pathway to iPS cell line, a perquisite requirement is that such pathway will not interfere iPSC pluripotency or at least its benefit outweights the costs. There are two main concerns for the application of our design: the use of doxycycline and the leakage expression of suicide gene. By controlling the dosage of doxycycline or even change a whole new switch system and prepare for alternative suicide"

Edinburgh_UG,2018,Team:Edinburgh UG#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Cole RM. Minicells of Bacillus subtilis [Internet]. Vol. 114, JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY. 1973. Available from: http://jb.asm.org/
As they have no chromosome, they are unable to reproduce and proliferate in the environment. Minicells have been shown to retain plasmids, and are therefore presented as a promising novel chassis for Synthetic Biology. It would be possible for minicells to perform any plasmid-encoded function you desire, and would solve the first problem for environmental release. However, minicells presented problems with purification due to their small, inconsistent size. After discussion with experts in the field of biotechnology to try and resolve these issues, it was suggested that we instead try to remove the chromosome by some other means. This suggestion led us to completely change the design of our project; to instead look at maxicells.
Maxicells are bacterial cells which have lost their chromosome, and are therefore unable to reproduce and proliferate in the environment. These maxicells can be used for Synthetic Biology, as they retain any plasmids they possessed prior to chromosome destruction, which we have defined as the “instructor plasmids”. Maxicells would then be as functional and safe as minicells, without the costly, time-consuming purification steps.
While maxicells are unable to reproduce and cannot release any chromosomal genes into the environment, it is nonetheless still possible that advantageous genes from the instructor plasmid could escape by horizontal gene transfer, the most notable of which being the antibiotic resistance marker used for plasmid selection. We have approached this problem in three ways, which we have termed our Triple Lock System:
The colicin kill switch, which aims to fully degrade any plasmid DNA in the maxicell after a defined, programmable time-frame.
Our semantic containment system, which ensures that any native prokaryotes will be unable to read and express the instructor plasmid DNA, as it will be written in a different language.
The alternative selection marker, triclosan, which removes the need for an antibiotic resistance gene to be encoded on the instructor plasmid, thereby preventing the spread of antibiotic resistance.
The design of our project then fell into three overarching sections, which will be detailed below:

Sydney_Australia,2017,Team:Sydney Australia#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," attraction to metal ions will cause the entire protein, insulin and all, to bind to a nickel column and separate it from the other proteins of the cell.
TEV Protease Cleavage Site
TEV is a sequence-specific cysteine protease derived from Tobacco Etch Virus. Because of its high specificity, it is commonly used for deliberate protein cleavage. In our project, we will use it to exclusively detach Winsulin from the nickel column, leaving the his tag and Ecotin/YNCM tags behind. This should provide us with a pure elution of Winsulin.
“R” Arginine Cleavage Site
Arginine acts as a recognition site for Trypsin Protease which we will use to specifically remove Proinsulin from the his tag and YNCM/Ecotin tag in a similar way to TEV. We have chosen to use Trypsin in these constructs because it allows us to further simplify the processing of proinsulin. Trypsin naturally cleaves the C-peptide from proinsulin which, following disulfide bond formation, leaves the active form of insulin. This is the way it works in our body, so we are confident that it will work here too.
iGEM BioBrick Suffix
Contains the restriction sites that are necessary for BioBrick compatibility including SpeI, NotI & PstI. We have also added an additional BamHI site at the terminus of our E. coli expressed constructs for ligation into pET-15b.
Ecotin Tag
Ecotin acts as a signal sequence to target the translated protein to the periplasm of the cell. There are a number of advantages that make it a good choice over other tags.
Relatively low metabolic burden due to its small size
No interaction with other proteins within the periplasm
Is native in E. coli and contains a disulfide bond meaning it undergoes through an oxidative compartment that may assist in the formation of the disulfides in Proinsulin and Winsulin.
It has already been shown to successfully target proinsulin to the periplasm (Malik et. al. 2007)

Test result
1. Simulated the production of inhibitors with different concentrations by adding different concentration of arabinose
In order to construct the environment with different concentrations of inhibitor and find the threshold, we use the PBAD promoter to achieve this. In the wet lab, we chose the CI-PR circuit like the picture (Fig. 1) to do this experiments.
Fig.1 the circuit constructed to measure
When we added enough arabinose, the CI inhibitor could repress the pR promoter fully, so the RFP can’t be tested. Also when the inhibitor was not enough, the promoter will express RFP which stands the killer gene’s expression..
Firstly, we use the model to simulate the relationship between the arabinose added and RFP intensity. We got the curve below (Fig. 2):
Fig. 2 this curve is about the corresponding RFP intensity under the different concentration of the arabinose.
This curve describes the in-promoter activity have a relationship with the different concentrations of the arabinose. That means when we add different concentrations of arabinose, the in-promoter’s activity will be different. We regarded the concentration of arabinose 0.003% as a threshold, the corresponding in-promoter is thought just be repressed regarded as the threshold. Thus we can say the in-promoter can have different responses to the inhibitor.
After the simulation, we added different concentrations of arabinose to construct different concentrations of intracellular inhibitor in the wet lab.
After the pre-experiment, the arabinose concentrations we chose are listed in table.1. The negative control is the strain containing the empty pSB1K3 and the positive control is the strain containing the device in Fig.1 on pSB1K3 without adding the arabinose.

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.
