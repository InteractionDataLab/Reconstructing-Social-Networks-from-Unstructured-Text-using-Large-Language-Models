Measurement of Fluorescence
For measurement of a fluorescence response in our sensor chips we used three different methods.
First, the Gel Doc™ XR+ (BIO-RAD) was used, exciting with UV light for an exposure time of 1 s.
Second, we used our own device WatsOn with blue light for excitation (450 or 480 nm) and special filters infront of the camera for selecting the appropriate emission spectrum. You can read even more about building your own WatsOn here .
Third, we used the Synergy Mx microplate reader (BioTek), putting the sensor chips into the lid of a common clear well plate. GFP was measured with an excitation of 496 ± 9 nm and an emission of 516 ± 9 nm and iLOV with an excitation of 450 ± 9 nm and emission of 495 ± 9 nm.

Paris_Bettencourt,2013,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Detect_-_-_TEXT.html," used both standards for cloning the crRNA. .
   Also this is verified by colony PCR and by sequencing. For the cloning of the tracrRNA-Cas9. part we used standard BioBrick cloning, inserted into pSB1A3 and sequence verified it. We achieved the same for the pRecA-LacZ. part (pSB1C3 and pSB1A3 backbones) that was submitted to the parts registry.
Killing assay to verify targeting specificity
   For the characterization of the Cas9 and the gRNA anti-KAN we performed a killing assay . Therefore we co-transformed the Cas9 with gRNA anti-KAN into host bacteria that contain the KAN resistance gene cassette as well as without the cassette. In the KAN resistance bacteria, the CRISPR/Cas complex generated generate double strand breaks that killed the bacteria. After co-transforming the plasmids, we plated the bacteria on the one hand on the single antibiotic where the resistance is carried by the Cas9 plasmid as well as on the single antibiotic which resistance is present on the gRNA plasmid. As the two plasmids contain the same origin of replication, this will selesct for only the single plasmid and hence a non-functional CRISPR/Cas system. To get a working system, we plated the co-transformed bacteria on both antibiotics, of which the reistances were on the two plasmids. As we can see in Figure 6, if we select for both plasmids, we get a reduced number of colonies in the strain that contains the target sequence, the kanamycine resistance cassette. We attribute this reduced number to Cas9-induced cleavage of the chromosome specifically at the KanR casette, with about 99% efficiency. This leads after repeatedly double strand breaks generated by the CRISPR/Cas system to cell death which explaines the reduced colony number.
  
Figure 6: CRISPR anti-Kan plasmids target specifically kanamycin resistant E. coli.
We introduced our CRISPR-based DNA cleavage system to two strains of E. coli: one WT (blue bars) and one carrying a genomically integrated kanamycin resistance casette (KanR, blue bars). The strains were co-transformed with two plasmids. One with the Cas9 construct, the other with the anti-Kanamycin gRNA. WT E. coli could be efficiently transformed with one or both plasmids, as determined by selective plating. However, KanR E. coli could not be"

High School Promotion
This year, to further popularize the basic knowledge of synthetic biology, we set our sight on high school education. After early communication and preparation, we successfully held a seminar at The Affiliated High School of Huazhong University of Science and Technology on Jan 7th with over 200 high school teachers and students presenting. On the seminar, we introduced the concept and basic knowledge of synthetic biology and iGEM and presented our 2015 iGEM project to them. Students showed great interests in our presentation and were amazed by all the novel ideas of iGEM teams in the past years. After the presentation, we sent out questionnaires to the audiences and received exciting feedbacks. These high school students said that they were introduced to a new world of biology and a new technology that they didn’t learn before in their textbooks. They asked us various questions about synthetic biology and iGEM on the questionnaires. After the seminar, we discussed with the teachers from The Affiliated High School of HUST about the possibility of forming a high school team to attend the competition. They listened to our suggestions and felt promising to form a new team in the future.
Since then, we also invited some students to our lab several times, taught basic laboratory skills and the progress of our Filter project. Hopefully next year we’ll have a new iGEM high school team in the Giant Jamboree!

Warsaw,2009,Team:Warsaw#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," with DNA into the cell. This method is mostly limited to plants and yeast and has low therapeutic potential [7]. Current mammalian mitochondrial transformation techniques like electroporation are also limited. Whole process takes place ex vivo and causes irreversible mitochondrion destructions which make its efficient reintroduction to the cell almost impossible. The conjugation between bacteria and mitochondria free from these side effects. Moreover, this phenomenon has been proven to act in vitro. Conjugative plasmid had been placed in mitochondrion, where the expression of encoding genes occurred [22]. More recently a conjugation between two strains of bacteria within the cytoplasm of a mammalian cell has been observed . These findings suggest that conjugation between a bacterium and a mitochondrion is feasible [10].
Bacterial systems of protein secretion
Bacteria in natural environment use diverse, effective transport and secretion systems. In gram negative bacteria like E. coli common are type I secretion systems e.g. well characterized hemolysin secretion system. Hemolysin is responsible for pathogenicity of some E. coli strains. Systems using fusion of protein of interest to hemolysin C-terminus result in secretion of the protein into the growth medium[6] The same method can be use to secret bacterial proteins into the eukaryotic cell. It is currently used by designing new generation vaccines[5].
Induction of apoptosis by p53
Mitochondrial outer membrane permabilization MOMP is one of the main programmed cell death mechanisms. The process is regulated by PTPc complex and Bcl2 family proteins [17]. Many cancer types involve disruption of this process therefore inducing MOMP in the tumour cells is regarded as potential therapeutic solution. Factors inducing MOMP include p53 protein. It is mutated in almost half of the cancer cases. Protein p53 by acting as a transcription regulator in the nucleus arrests the cell cycle and induce apoptosis [18]. In the cytoplasm p53 interacts with mitochondrial membrane and can enter the mitochondrium. It has been proven that these processes induce apoptosis and do not influence the cell cycle. In the mitochondrium p53 is an effector protein that activates soluble (cytochrom c, Smac) and insoluble (AIF, EndoG) apoptototic factors. Moreover interaction of p53 and Bax protein in vitro leads to permabilisation of lipid bilayer analogous to mitochondrial membrane. [12] Because p53 is inactive in tumour cells many research groups focused on designing gene therapies based on p53 gene delivery. Most frequently adenoviruses and eukaryotic pl"

Designing an Expression plasmid for Chlorite Dismutase
The Expression Plasmid Backbone
For the expression of chlorite dismutase (Cld) we selected a  commercially available expression plasmid called PBP-38-441 from DNA 2.0. We had worked with this plasmid earlier during our Molecular biology training period and were satified with its performance. As shown in Figure 1 The plasmid contains the coding sequence for the purple chromophore “Tinsel” under the control of two Lac operators that sraddle a strong promoter from the T4 bacteriophage. The lacI repressor, which normally shuts of gene expression until induced with IPTG, is present on the plasmid, along with a kanamycin resistance gene for plasmid selection. The Tinsel cassette consists of the protein coding sequence and an RBS that can be excised from the plasmid at two BsaI sites that leave non-complimentary non-palindromic ens as shown below. The ability to turn Cld on and off  was a desirable feature in our design because of the possibility that  continuous strong expression of Cld might pose a selective disadvantage for cell growth.
Figure 1.
Shown is an annotated plasmid map for the commercially available, lacI regulated expression plasmid PCB-38-441 (from the DNA 2.O chromophore “Paint Box collection. The Tinsel Cassette situated between flanking BsaI sites includes the RBS and produce a strong purple chromophore when induced with IPTG. An expanded view of the sequences that border the coding sequence is also shown up to the flanking BsaI sites at either end. The sticky ends produced by BsaI digested are shown in red.

Fill in Elements
In order to match biological processes which corresponding to lines that represent some sorts of interactions, we must make it clear that what are the objects of these actions, namely, what X/Y/A/B/C/D represent. As the output of the system, A/B/C/D is less restricted; almost anything that can be inserted into a expression casette could be a candidate of A/B/C/D, such as protein, siRNA, ncRNA. For X/Y, in mammalian cell, generally we would think of two different inputs as two different drugs. So we screened mammalian inducible expression system, and finally chose Dox & TM(tamoxifen, a kind of drug) as input X & Y. Now let’s see what’s in the network: Tet activate B/D and repress A/C, while TM activate C/D and repress A/B.
It’s time to fill in the lines, but before that, we need to know more about how these expression system work to complete the puzzle.
For X, namely Tet, there are two distinct expression systems available: Tet-on and Tet-off. We chose Tet-on system because it’s relatively easy to manipulate in circuit design --- all you need to do about activation lines is to put B&D behind a Tet-on expression promoter. As for repression lines, we managed to use Tet-inducible shRNA to knockdown A&C.
For Y, namely TM, the core of TM expression system is the Cre recombinase, which can recognize loxP sequence and perform two distinct sequence-editing activities. When two loxP sequences share the same direction, Cre will remove the sequence between two loxP along with one loxP, and when two loxP sequences face toward each other, Cre will inverse the sequence between them and damage both loxP to make sure the intermediate sequence won’t be inverse back again. [picture, Cre bi-activity] In TM inducible expression system, The Cre recominase is modified by adding an ER binding domain, which will automatically adhere to ER, thus Cre will be located on ER where it has no activity. When TM is added to the system, ER binding domain will be blocked, thus Cre will then be able to drop off the ER and travel into nuclear to execute its recombinase activity. Bi-activity is indeed an interesting feature, and"

OVERVIEW
RESULTS
Overview
A critical component of measurement and modeling in synthetic biology involves standardization of values to ensure accurate conversion and comparison of data between different experiments for validation. Reproducibility has therefore become a necessity for confirmation of results in various experiments, as well as providing a sufficient standard of comparison. The InterLab study aims to address this goal through the characterization of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) with studies conducted by labs across the world. As GFP is utilized as an almost universal reporter in experiments, it is crucial for standardizing fluorescence values for comparison. Lambert iGEM shares this vision of reproducibility in synthetic biology and participated in the InterLab to help achieve this goal.
In the spirit of collaboration, we worked with the University of Georgia iGEM Team to conduct our experiments and compare results in order to optimize protocols and recognize changes that can be made to ensure increased reproducibility. We performed our experiments and obtained measurements in tandem to limit variables, and analyzed our measurement curves to compare differences. One of the critical components we realized affected the measurements was a reconstitution of the particle solution and the time the particles were allowed to settle. We resuspended the particles after obtaining plate reader data indicating that was the factor affecting the values. Throughout this experience, we have learned the critical need for reproducibility and hope to pursue future opportunities with the InterLab study!

Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," to sit in the corner of a storage room, this design has a groove for the user to slip a strip of latex/cell-coated paper to allow for ongoing monitoring of an environment. A worker can gain an instant reading periodically by taking a photo of the plate using the app designed for this purpose. A fresh strip can be placed into the plate every hour/day/month depending on the need, and the constant groove ensures a consistent placement of the sensor strip in the room. This eliminates the impact of airflow, ventilation and height, meaning the readings will be comparable.
Swing tag
As an alternative design to a sticker, a swing tag could be attached to nets of fresh fruits, such that the customer can gain an average ripeness rating of the bag.
Initial Designs - Visuals
The three most promising designs are the fruit sticker, the plate, and the industrial sticker. The first meets the needs of Avocados Australia; the second could be used by FPA and the third by Zespri. These three products were chosen to be the focus of further product evaluation. Initial designs were sketched and rendered online:
Production
Prototype
iGEM Hamburg 2016 have been working with us in many ways, and one of the main points of collaboration was the creation of a prototype of our plate design. Their nanoscientist, Steffen, rendered our plate design online, and created a 3D printed prototype for us!
Given stickers are a less unique design, and are also not allowed at the Hynes Convention Centre, we did not make a prototype.
Evaluation of Impact
Areas for Improvement
There are some drawbacks associated with this specific design of the technology that should be considered.
Firstly, despite the cells being immobilised in the latex coating, genetically modified E.coli cells are in contact with fresh produce intended for consumption and could potentially be consumed themselves. Due to unease in society regarding GMOs, and also heavy legal restrictions surrounding the release and applications of GMOs, there is anticipated to be a large backlash or consumer concern raised about this issue.
Hopefully outreach events similar to the ones we held, and a growing understanding of synthetic biology will help to diffuse this concern. That being said, regulation of the strength and one-directional permeability of the latex coatings will need to be strict from a biosafety point of view.
Another consideration is the latex allergy. A portion of the population has a non-life threatening allergic reaction to latex. It is unknown whether the quantity or application of latex in this case will trigger such reaction, but it must be noted as a consideration nonetheless.

Mixing Device
Overall
When the embedded device work with the mixing device , the overall effect diagram is like below.
This underground irrigation system not only reduces the losses of water, fertilizer and bio-pesticides but speeds up the weeding and killing pests efficiency by omitting permeation time.
Which is more economical and practical.
Materials & Cost
We use 3D printing technology to produce two part of devices. The material is photosensitive resin -Somos GP Plus, which is a low viscosity photosensitive polymer, with the advantages of excellent waterproof, durability and hardness. It could be used for making solid, precision parts. Other part of the water pipe is PE texture, which has the characteristics of high strength, corrosion resistance, non-toxic and low-cost.
3D printing is not suitable for the volume production. If our device use the mold to produce in batches, the unit price will drop to a very low level.

Performance & feedback
We put the device in the soil to test it performance. And we got conclusion that the effective watering radius of our device can up to 25cm, which is equivalent to the moisture that 20 - 30 wheat individuals are needed. Moreover, the water saving effect of this device is far more than traditional irrigation and sprinkler irrigation system.

We planned to generate various mutated forms of lux pR, and we seek to modify and improve its efficiency. But before we do any experiments, we need to confirm one thing: does the efficiency of lux pR matter?
There are a lot of promoters, activators and repressors in the system, so any one of them likely contributes little to the whole story. How to make sure? By using our mathematical model, naturally!
We assume the mutations alters the transcription efficiency. Efficiency refers to the relative rate of transcription driven by the promoter when AHL-luxR complex is bound. First of all, we reset the transcription efficiency of activated lux pR on the Neon plasmid to 20%, 50%,100% and 150% compared to the default value we used in previous parts. The initial concentration of AHL is 10-6 M. A series of plots are generated.
Figure 6     Impact of lux pR efficiency (on Neon Plasmid) on the Performance of the System
Clearly, the efficiency of lux pR on the Neon plasmid significantly affects the behavior of the system. An efficient/sensitive lux pR promoter results in a faster increase of GFP concentration. This also accords with our further experimental data.
Tuning the activity of the lux pR on the safety catch promoter also alters the behavior of the system. We set the lux pR on the Neon plasmid as the original one, while remaining AHL concentration as 10-6 M, and then tune the efficiency of lux pR on the safety catch plasmid to produce the plots below.
Figure 7     Impact of lux pR efficiency (on Safety Catch Plasmid) on the Performance of the System
Obviously, the effect of lux pR promoter on both plasmids can interact can produce a variety of results. A heatmap shows how their interaction alters the productivity of GFP. The color indicates the relative concentration of"

FAFU-CHINA,2016,Team:FAFU-CHINA#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," result in the death. However, proteins from both of the Cry and Cyt families are harmless to human,other vertebrates and plants. In addition, they are completely biodegradable which lessen the potential hazard to our environment. Therefore, people are widely using Bt. to control pests in order to prevent the loss of agricultural production and spread of human disease.
Cry4Aa, Cry10Aa, Cry11Aa, Cry4b, Cyt1Aa and Cyt2 toxins from Bt ssp. israelensis (Bti.) have great toxic effect on mosquito larvae. Different types of Cry proteins' toxicity to different species of mosquitoes can vary a lot. For example, Cry4b shows no toxicity to Culex while Cry4Aa does. However, mutagenesis of certain region of Cry protein can make it show toxicity to the species it never has before.
The Cry protein is consisted of three functional domains. Domain I is a seven α-helices bundle. It can insert itself into a membrane by using its hydrophobic helices α4 and α5 to insert into the phospholipid bilayer. The pore formation occurs on its α3 helix. Domain II and domain III are two β-sheets which are involved in the receptor interactions. Domain II contains extremely variable loops, which are the binding site of the receptor. Domain III has the function of stabilizing the toxin.
Cyt proteins have a single α-β domain which do not bind to receptors but can directly insert into the cell membrane and then form a pore causing cell death. Although Cry and Cyt proteins are two big families of δ-endotoxins, they are far related. Cyt1 and Cyt2 are two types of Cyt proteins found in Bti..
Generally, Cry proteins are believed to exert toxicity by interacting with the proteins on the brush border membrane and then insert into the membrane which takes multiple steps. At the beginning in mosquitoes' gut, the Cry stalline inclusions are cleaved at the disulfide bond to release the Cry pre-toxin. Then the soluble proteins are activated by being cleaved again by intestinal protease. When toxins reach to the brush border membrane microvilli, they bind to the proteins"

We documented the characterization of our parts , on the “Main Page” of its Entry in the Biobrick Registry.
We submitted our new parts to the Biobrick Registry.
Our main implication was on the safety of our project as it is in the field of Medicine & Health. One question articulated by our team was ‘How can we terminate our system in the case of an adverse effect occuring in the body?’ We approached this challenge by using autologous proteins present in the body already. We have also designed our parts under tetracycline regulatory operon therefore in the presence of tetracycline antibiotics, our desired proteins production will be inhibited.
Gold Medal
We helped AUC-Turkey High School Team by mentoring and training them in their project including experiments, human practice and designing their parts.
We also collaborated with METU Turkey team by giving them some of the biobrick parts present in the kit plates which they have ran out of.
We used human practice as a gateway to approach and evaluate problems that are related to our project such as heart attacks and ischemia. We separated our approach into four modules. These are Identification,Clarification, Specialization and application. Our aim in these modules where to first identify the main causes of heart attacks, engage and inform people of the potential health risks, research and evaluate how many people are aware and what we can do to increase"

Blog #13 - Teaching Module Wrap-Up
By NBailly 16:32, June 05 2014 (CDT)
Today Nina and Arne discussed last class's experiment. Arne explained to the students the meaning behind the values measured, and how the students can use the value to determine the concentration of riboflavin in their vanilla pudding samples.
Subsequently, Nina explained the students how we are going to manipulate regular E. coli cells, using synthetic biology methods, to carry out the desired functions. The students also learned, what role promoters play in gene regulation, and how our iGEM team wants to regulate the expression of the genes artificially inserted into the E. coli cells.
Now we have individually discussed all aspects of our project. Therefore, Nina summarized all the topic together with the students, and outlined the link between all these different topics and our iGEM project idea. In doing so, we almost arrived at the end of our teaching module ""Synthetic Biology"". Next class, we will visit the biology-chemistry course of Kaiser-Karl-Gymnasium for the last time, and do some career-exploration in synthetic biology and related fields.

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2018,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#Price Model_-_-_TEXT.html," the medical demand in t period, which can refer to the using rate of medical facilities or medical expenses. Others variables are: w means wealth, p means price, A means age, E means education status, Ω means other environment variables. This function means that demand of health is decided by price, age, education and other environment variables.
Solutions to the problem of this model generally show that the rate of return on health capital must equal the opportunity cost of said capital. Thus, increases in the depreciation rate over time cause the optimal stock of health to decrease. If the marginal efficiency of capital curve is inelastic, gross investment grows over time. In practical terms, this model thus predicts that older people will have more sick time and time spent on increasing health and have higher medical expenditures than younger people. Another implication is that since increases in wages shift the marginal efficiency of capital curve to the right and increases the curve's slope, an increase in wage will increase the demand for health capital.
Budget and Visitor Demand Curve
Suppose the consumer's budget for a fixed time is Y, the other commodity price is Po, and the price of the visit is Pv, then the total amount he spends is Y. As shown in the figure, the point M is the number of consumptions for other products in the absence of a visit, and the point N is the number of visits when no other items are purchased, and the budget line is MN. The equilibrium point of the consumer is at point E, which is the tangent point of the indifference curve U2 and the budget line. At point E, the slope of the indifference curve is equal to the slope of the budget line. The marginal replacement rate (MRS) is the rate at which the consumer is willing to use other commodities instead of seeing a doctor. The slope of the budget line is the opposite of the price ratio.
Fig 1. The relation between commodity and treatment frequency
After having a budget curve, consumers will be treated. As shown in the figure, the horizontal axis represents the number of visits, and the vertical axis represents the sum of other commodities. Consumers choose between visiting and other products. From V1 to V2 to V3, respectively, the increase in the number of visits indicates that the visit is cheaper than other products, and the price of the visit changes.
The graph mainly shows the income effect and the substitution effect. Among them, the income effect is from U3 to U3', indicating that the income has increased, so that the consumption of other commodities will increase, and the number of visits will increase. U3’ represents the budget"
Toronto,2018,Team:Toronto#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," a bioreactor, we need to understand at what rate the E. coli grow, and how they respond to environmental conditions. Bacterial growth can be separated into four phases:
The Lag Phase: Little growth is observed.
The Exponential Phase: Exponential growth is observed after the cells get used to their environment, and so long as the limiting substrate is still in surplus.
The Stationary Phase: No growth is observed, death rate and growth rate are approximately equal.
Death Phase: There is no more substrate, thus the population dies.
If N is the concentration of biomass population, then the exponential growth phase is given by:   $$\dot{N} = \mu N$$  where μ is the specific growth rate, the “rate of increase of cell concentrations per unit cell concentration” (h − 1) [7]. μ depends on the substrate concentration; the relation is given by the Monod equation:   $$ \mu(S) = \mu_m \frac{S}{K_S + S}$$  where S is the substrate concentration (in mol L − 1), and KS is the Monod Constant (in mol L − 1). As the substrate is consumed, more biomass is being created at the rate of:   $$\frac{dN}{dS} = -\gamma \frac{dS}{dt}$$  where t is time. γ should be interpreted as “the ratio of the mass of cells formed to the mass of substrate consumed” [7].
The Model
Figure 1. The Bioreactor Design
Call the ’Main Reactor’ (M.R) and the ’Flotation Tank’ (F.T). Let Xu be the concentration of E. coli (in mol L − 1), Xw the concentration of particle bound to the surface of the E. coli (in mol L − 1). Below we will outline the steps of the bioreactor seen in Figure 1.
All the substrate, waste and cellular population is homogeneously distributed between the F.T and the M.R. Initially there is no particle bound to any of the cells, i.e Xw = 0.
When activated, the bioreactor begins to pump solution from the M.R to the F.T at rate D, this is represented by D(N + Xu + Xw + S).
In the F.T, the cells are floating on the surface, and are scraped off and removed. Thus only Xu and S remain within the solution, which is pumped back into M.R at rate D. In practice, a cellular filter alike the one used"

In 2010 iGEM competition, Queens-Canada team submited Halorhodopsin from H. salinarum as biobricks and inserted this gene into C. elegans. However, it was not well characterized. This year, we are trying to clone halorhdopsin from N. pharaonis, which has already been successfully introduced and proved to perform complete light cycles in E. coli , to our biobrick system1. We aim to characterize the efficiency of this Halorhodopsin to be a well-documented biobrick and a useful tool in E. coli .
 
In previous iGEM projects, various light sensors have been developed, including red light sensor (UT Austin, 2004), green light sensor (Tokyo-Nokogen, 2009) and blue light sensor (University of Edinburgh, 2010). They are all light-induced fusion transcription factors that trigger gene expression under the control of specific promoters, facilitating simply on/off switch and light-coupled communication. However, our design makes Halorhodopsin not only a dynamically tunable light sensor – by coupling with chloride sensitive promoters (e.g. Pgad), but also an energy converter – by storing solar energy as osmolality potential and further converted it into electricity. Our project would provide a wilder scope of applications from signal transduction and gene regulation to energy generation.

David Babson David obtained his B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and his Ph.D. in Chemical, Biochemical and Environmental Engineering from Rutgers University. He is a postdoc at the University of Minnesota's Biotechnology Institute and plans to do something with his life someday. David is obsessed with good food, Canadian whiskey, and political news. He is passionate about skiing, traveling, and ranting about republicans. David gets his caffeine from numerous cups of coffee throughout the day. He avoids the sun preferring to hang in the shade, but will use ample sunscreen when venturing out.  His TV alter ego: Brian Griffin from Family Guy.
Sarah Bloch Sarah is a PhD student in Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics who hopes to use her synthetic biology experience to land a career in industry.  She loves to spend her time cooking, reading or playing with her puppy Buster.  She prefers cold caffeinated beverages - an iced coffee in the morning and diet soda with lunch.  Being a grad student, she spends most of her time indoors slaving away at the lab bench... but when the occasion arises, she uses sunscreen or well-covering clothing to block UV rays.  Her TV character alter ego: Liz Lemon from 30 Rock.
Mark Held Mark received his PhD in plant genetics from the University of Western Ontario, in Canada and is currently working as a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Minnesota.  If he’s not in the lab, he enjoys cooking, gardening, fly-fishing and of course playing hockey during the winter as any good Canuck would.  Mark’s tanning regime generally involves developing a really bad farmer’s tan early in the summer, which gets progressively worse throughout the year.  His TV alter ego: Randy Marsh from South Park.
Dana Morrone Dana holds a PhD in biochemistry and his future goals are in the fields of agricultural biotechnology and science policy. His interests include reading, traveling, building furniture and global domination through enzyme kinetics. He does not drink caffeinated drinks, this is not due to religious reasons, but because he would be awake all night. He doesn't really use sunscreen because he's not a fan of the beach and usually ends up swimming only at night if he's had any caffeine. Charlie Townsend"
Freiburg,2011,Team:Freiburg#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," community-wide Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) ranked the I-Tasser as the best protein prediction method in the server section.  The method of the I-Tasser can be divided into 4 stages: Stage 1 is called threading. In this stage the sequence or parts of the sequence or motifs are compared with already known protein structures to identify evolutionary relatives and predict secondary structures. This gives a sequence profile and together with the query sequence it is threaded by LOMETS, a server combining seven threading programs which evaluate the sequence respectively the templates with an individual score . The top templates are selected for further consideration.  Stage 2 is responsible for structural assembly. The structure is modeled ab initio by aligning different templates from the threading. This is a very complex process and different programs are involved. Stage 3 is a model selection of the achievements of stage 2 with a following refinement of the predicted models.  Stage 4 announces the function of the predicted molecule by its structural conformation comparing with already known proteins of PDB database.  The predicted models are all evaluated by the C-Score, which assesses the quality of the prediction. It has a value from -5 to 2; the more positive the C-Score the merrier and more plausible the predicted structure is.

We received this pdb file with a C-score of 0.53. Obviously this was not a realistic model, since the folding would obviously be impaired by so many Histidines everywhere. But is was useful for finding several good locations where the Nickel could fit in in respect to the requirements it has for binding ligands. We manually fit in a Nickel ion, as it was crystallized in the mentioned PDB file, and measured the distances and evaluated the 3dimensional orientation of the Histidines towards the Nickel. Histidines can coordinate ligands with their free electron pair pointing planar away from the imidazole ring. What we further"
Calgary_Entrepreneurial,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Risk_-_-_TEXT.html," weaknesses. These include the primarily technology-focused background of our key members and the high costs that we will incur in bringing our first product to market. These weaknesses are things we need to remedy and constantly assess for risk. In terms of our overly technical backgrounds, we have brought on a dedicated advisory board in order to bridge some of the gaps in our knowledge and experience. In addition, in our management section , we have made a plan to bring in key players at critical times in the first years of operations in order to better fill some of the most important gaps. This is also reflected in our budget. In terms of our high requirement for finances, we have developed cost-effective options for producing our first product and have plans to cut costs should we need to, such as suspending future research and development activities.
Key Opportunities and Threats
Several key opportunities can also be seen in our SWOT analysis. These include the significant market opportunity we see in Alberta with the increased monitoring that has been mandated by the Alberta government, as well as the ability of our product to enter additional markets down the road. Opportunities are things that we need to prioritize or optimize. Based on the clear market opportunity, we are focusing our efforts on making this our first target market. As we develop our first generation product however, we will be optimizing our detector device for easy transitioning into a second market.
Finally, we need to consider threats, which are perhaps the most important component of this. For us, threats include the potential for a significant time for market for our first product and the potential for a competitor to enter the market. If we could not compete with this competitor, this could pose significant difficult for us in achieving our target market potential. As we are aiming to develop a lower-cost alternative to existing technologies already in the market, there is also the possibility that potential competitors would try to litigate us as they see us as serious competition. As an early-stage venture, this could pose serious risk to us. Threats need to be countered as they have the potential to critically disrupt our business. To this end, we have several strategies in place. If competitors offering significant advantages over us were to enter the market, we could again consider switching into an alternative target market. In terms of a possible litigation against us, we are actively ensuring that we protect ourselves legally and perform our due diligence. Finally, although our time to market for our first product is significant, by optimizing the design of our detector device and moving into research and development for future generation products while we bring our first product to market, we will ensure that subsequent products will have a much quicker development time.

Z0842: (from 6/28) 40.4 ng/uL => 40.4 ng/uL * 1 uL = 40.4 ng => 40.4 ng / 0.025 ng/uL = 1616 uL
For plasmid DNA, the NEB Taq PCR instruction manual indicates that we need 0.1-1 ng/mL of DNA in the final 50 uL reaction.  This means 0.05 ng of DNA for 1 ng/mL in 50 uL.  If 2.0 uL of plasmid DNA is added to each PCR reaction, this means that the desired concentration is 0.05 ng / 2 uL = 0.025 ng /uL.
Because we read online that one should use 1 ng of template for the entire reaction, we ended up diluting the plasmid in each case to 0.5 ng/uL and using 2 uL of each per reaction.

Looked at plates to discover that the transformations had barely worked, if at all.  Observed colonies on the following plates: positive control 256 (1 colony), 54, P0661, CFPx2 (1 colony), and 259 (1 colony).  Approximately 16 hr 20 min in the incubator.  Since the transformation mix from yesterday had been saved in the fridge overnight, decided to add some more LB to this and then to replate it after an incubation perdiod.  Added 200 uL of LB to each and then placed in incubator with shaking for 4 hr and 8 min. Will prioritize replating the following parts: 323, 266, 329, DD21, DD25, and 1A.  On a fresh plate for each part, added 50 uL to half the plate and 200 uL to the other. Put in incubator at 4:57 pm.
Also decided to replate the parts that only had a single colony per plate.  Did a streak from that one colony for half of the new plate and use 200 uL of transformation liquid from yesterday on the other"

Schematic view of reading SBML
The class ReadSBMLFile is used to extract all useful data from a SBML file and send them to the class “val_func”. Since each class represents one term of the the expression. all the terms will be push into a vector. In another word, another container has been created used to place a list of ""val_func"", of course you can realize that Nth list of ""val_func"" accommodates all the informations related to Nth species in this Biological system. Finally, all the containers will be packaged orderly and send to the Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSO) part or the Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) part for the next step. Here are the components of class “val_func”.

ShanghaiTechChina_B,2016,Team:ShanghaiTechChina B#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," The Dynamic curves of different concentrations of SNP releasing NO. The SNP concentrations are 10 μM, 100 μM, 1 mM, 10 mM and 0 μM (control) in each group. Data are means(SD) (n=3 samples per group). The dot line indicates the average rectal NO concentration in IBD patients.
The data reveals the temporal changes of the released nitric oxide (NO) concentration in SNP-LB solution. From the dynamic curves, we could see that even low concentration of SNP could continuously release NO for 5~6 hours or even more.
Previous research has measured the rectal NO concentration of IBD. The average rectal nitric oxide (NO) concentration ~60 ppb (60 nM) in normal people and ~5,500 ppb (5.5 μM) in IBD patients which is dot lined in Figure 4[3]. The pathological NO concentration is within the range of the SNP-released NO concentration.
Thus, we could use SNP solution to mimic the rectal NO concentration in IBD, and keep it for hours. So we can put our engineered E.coli under pathological condition in vitro, to initiate expression of the therapeutic peptide.
NO (Nitric Oxide) Sensing Module
Microbiome have evolved several biological NO (nitric oxide) sensors to detect the existence of nitric oxide in the environment, including SoxR protein, FNR family, NorR protein and so on [4].
NorR protein is σ54-dependent, AAA transcriptional activator, with a N-terminal regulatory domain, a central AAA domain which is regulated by NO molecule, and a C-terminal DNA binding domain, which will bind to promoter pNorV to initiate transcription when activated.
Figure 5. The mechanism of NO (Nitric Oxide) sensor by NorR protein. NorR protein is produced by E.coli. Once binds to NO molecule, it is activated. Then NorR will further initiate the transcription at the promoter pNorV.
We integrated this system into E.coli, which would be able to detect NO existence and then express the therapeutic molecules, i.e. EGF peptide, to treat IBD (Figure 6).
Figure 6. The utility of NO (Nitric Oxide) Sensor in treating IBD. The rectal NO concentration is abnormally high in the gut of IBD patients. So, NorR proteins produced by E.coli will bind NO molecule, and then initiate the transcription and expression of EGF peptides. The expressed EGF peptides will contribute to the recovery of"

Cultivation
The cultivation of our bacteria was performed in test tubes (16cm long, diameter is 3cm) filled with 5ml LB medium. The incubator was kept at 37°C and 260 rpm shaking frequency. Chloramphenicol was added to each media. Chloramphenicol was added from a 1000X stock stored at -20°C for a final concentration of 25 µg/ml.
Measurement
Cells were washed by PBS twice in order to clean the medium. Measurement was processed by LSRFortessa, the channel was 488nm/510nm. The data was exported by FCSDiva as .fcs files. If one cell's FITC value is higher than 103, we believe that the cell is colored. We calculated the ratio of colored cells in total cells. The ratio*100 was set as the unit of the device's strength.

We can see that the values are not the same as Anderson’s Promoters. While we got the correct tendency. The value of the device-3 is lower than the NC’s, we think this may be caused by the fluorescence pollution.
Future
In this year’s competition, we constructed a series of sensors to measure the pollutant in water. We have added the E.coli-based Cu ions sensor to the MFC and it was proved that the device can sense the Cu ions concentration. Although we have completed the primary goal, we still have much work to do.
Our device can only detect the concentration of the pollutant while it cannot detect which pollution it is. We will couple the device with a system to monitor which pollutant it is before measuring the concentration. Different chromoproteins can be used in the system to distinguish different kinds of pollution.
Besides, we will try to develop the ribB report gene."

Isopropanol Precipitation
For an increased concentration of DNA, precipitations with Isopropanol were performed at cooled temperatures. Therefore, 1/10 of volume of 5M NaCl solution was added to the respective tube, followed by an additional 1 volume of chilled Isopropanol. Tubes were stored at -20°C for 30 minutes. A subsequent 30-minute centrifugation step at 4°C was then performed. Next, the remanent pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and centrifuged for another 15 minutes. Ethanol was finally carefully removed and the DNA resuspended in an adequate volume of deionized water.
Analytical Enzymatic Digest
In comparison with Preparative Digests, analytical controls were reduced to a significantly lower volume. Usual Master Mix aliquots contained 6 µl of water, 1 µl 10x  NEB Buffer, 0.5 µl of each enzyme, and 2 µl of test DNA (~300 ng) which were thereupon added to a PCR tube. Digests were commonly performed at 37 °C for two hours.
Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
Towards PCR and enzymatic digest analyses, agarose gels were prepaired with 0,5x TAE and Agarose concentrations between 0.7 % and 0.9 % (w/v). At 65 °C, 1 µl of 10,000x GelRed was added to the Gel before a one hours polymerisation step. As a marker, 1 µl of GeneRuler 1 kb DNA ladder was loaded. Gel runs were commonly performed with voltage ranges between 80 V and 130 V for 45 minutes.
Gel Extraction
When extracting PCR bands or digested fragments from an agarose gel, the QIAquick Gel extraction Kit from Qiagen was used. Steps were performed in accord with provided user‘s manuals, including three deviances: centrifugation steps were always performed with or with less than 17,900 g, columns were rotated by 180° after washing and last, DNA-binding columns were heated to 50 °C for two minutes before the final elution step.
Cell Culture
Growing Conditions
Cells were cultured in DMEM complemented with 10% FCS, glutamin (2 mM), 100 units/ml Penicillin and 100 ug/ml Streptomycin"

Record date of receipt on each bottle to assist with inventory management
Label and date solutions when prepared with name of chemical or mixture and any applicable hazard warnings.
Consider storing chemicals by hazard class. Within a hazard class, store alphabetically.
Classes:
Corrosive acids (Organic and Mineral Acids: acetic, glacial acetic, butyric; Oxidizing Acids: nitric, sulfuric, perchloric, phosphoric)
Corrosive bases (ammonium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide)
Explosives (ammonium nitrate, nitro urea, picric acid, trinitroaniline, trinitrobenzene, trinitrobenzoic acid, trinitrotoluene, urea nitrate)
Flammable liquids (acetone, benzene, diethyl ether, methanol, ethanol, toluene, glacial acetic acid)
Flammable solids (phosphorus, magnesium, ethyl acetate)
Oxidizers (sodium hypochlorite, ethyl acetate, benzoyl peroxide, potassium permanganate, potassium chlorate, etc.)
Poisons (cyanides, cadmium, mercury, osmium, acrylamide, ethidium bromide, sodium azide)
Water reactives (sodium metal, potassium metal, lithium metal, lithium aluminum hydride)
Flammable compressed gases (methane, acetylene, propane, hydrogen)
Oxidizing compressed gases (oxygen, chlorine)
Poisonous compressed gases (carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen chloride)
Store flammable and combustible materials in an approved storage cabinet.
Do not store chemicals on the floor.
Store hazardous chemicals no higher than eye level.
Liquids should be stored on shelves with a lipped edge and in spill trays in case of breaks or leaks.
Store acids in a cabinet by themselves, preferably in the ventilated storage area beneath chemical fume hood. Nitric, perchloric, chromic and sulfuric acids are strong oxidizers and must be kept isolated from organic acids.
Store bases in a corrosives cabinet.
Store highly toxic materials in a closed, dedicated poison cabinet.
Do not store chemicals in fume hood, as this prevents proper airflow, reduces available work space and may increase fire or spill hazards.
Do not store hazardous chemicals under a sink.
Store chemicals away from heat and direct sunlight.
Keep a chemical inventory.

Tuebingen,2015,Team:Tuebingen#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Cre recombinase system, e.g. in mouse knockout models. While inducible tissue specific knockouts are already possible
, up to now no systems have been described that allow a light inducible or locally limited activation generation of gene knockouts be Cre recombinase activation. We hope that our work will be able to allow the generation of such systems that could be used to study the effects of genes within a cell population or between neighbouring cells.
For the generation of the Dronpa caged Cre recombinase we will use biobricks containing the 145N Dronpa, wild type Cre recombinase, Delta1-19 Cre recombinase and serine-glycine linkers of different length. After discussions with experts on protein structure prediction (Birte Höcker, MPI für Entwicklungsbiologie) we decided to try out different linkers instead of trying to predict a possibly working solution. During these discussions we noticed that the N-terminal part of the Cre recombinase (AA1-19) seemed to be rather flexible, because it was not part of the crystal structure we looked ( pdb: 3GMV ). Therefore we decided to also try the caging of a truncated version of the protein, in case the fusion of Dronpa to the wild type N-terminus allows to much movement freedom of the protein domains.
Figure 1: Hypothesized caging mechanism of Dronpa proteins. A and B show the caged Cre recombinase (green) with the N- and C-terminal Dronpa fusions (blue and lightblue). Linkers between proteins are shown in red. C and D illustrate the inactive cage. The Cre recombinase is in complex with its target DNA (pdb accession code: 3mgv, 2iov).
Introduction
For our memory system we needed to create a reporter device that will be switched on by our activated writer protein, the Cre recombinase, and permanently retain this status. Because the Cre recombinase is able to cut out DNA sequences that are flanked by loxp sites, we decided to build a reporter cassette that would express only RFP without activation and switch to luciferase expression after activation of the Cre recombinase. We choose the Nanoluc(R) luciferase (designed by the Promega corporation ) as final reporter for our system, because luciferase allows an easy readout that is at the same time very accurate. The expression of RFP in the non-activated cells is supposed to ease testing of the reporter device.

Introduction
As a team, one of our favourite parts in iGEM have been collaborations. They reminded us that iGEM is not only a competition but a chance to share and let other teams be a part of your project, and that is wonderful. Below is shown the different universities that have collaborated with us. By clicking in the index or in the images you can go directly to the explanation.

When explaining Printeria to people, we see they are reticent to use it because of the genetically modified bacteria that we do. A part of our project is to fight the stigma against synthetic biology and Harvard was claiming for teams disposed to do so. 
Collaboration
Their collaboration was about doing a report of your project and then Harvard team would create a series of newsletters and articles to show how we are using bacteria and demonstrate that we are doing it taking into account demanding security measures. However, throughout the summer they changed their mind and now they are doing a magazine instead of a series of articles. They will distribute it in their university and of course in the Giant Jamboree. You can download our report by cliking in the button below.

University Festival
To gain people’s appropriate understanding about GMOs, we should start from explanation of basic information, for example “What is Gene Recombination?”, “What is DNA” and so on.
Because we want people to feel familiar with Gene Recombination or DNA, we hold an educational workshop in Hokkaido University Festival that was held from June 11 to June 14, 2015. This workshop was our third year participating in University Festival. Because Hokkaido University Festival gets different visitors, we could explain the question described above to wide range of people through the poster session or experiment.
We also took the questionnaires and survey that how does the impression of people to Gene Recombination change between before participation in our workshop and after that.
Poster Session
We made posters on following topics.
What is DNA
How DNA is familiar to us
What is synthetic biology
What is iGEM, and what are our activities
Experiment
We conducted an experiment detecting a DNA extraction from banana. Our aim was to make participants feel more familiar to DNA.
Protocol
Crush one third of banana with spoon to break its cell wall.
Mix 30 mL of 10% saltine water and 2.5 mL of detergent. Saltine water takes away negative electric charge form nucleic acid, and detergent breaks cell membrane.
Pour 1 and 2 into a beaker through coffee filter to filtrate them.
After 5 minutes, pour 40 mL of 100% ethanol into the beaker slowly.
You’ll see some white lump, which is exactly the DNA!
Questionnaires
We took questionnaires to our participants, and we got 91 answers.
Results are shown on below.

NTU-Taida,2012,Team:NTU-Taida#Human Practice#Safety-in-iGEM_-_-_TEXT.html,"ating the environment, we would like to know what do medical doctors think about biosafety problems in synthetic biology. Therefore, before the interview with doctors, we had collected the safety information from several teams that won the safety commendations from 2010 to 2012. During the interview, we demonstrated how iGEMers deal with biosafety problems and get feedbacks from the doctors.
So, how do these teams assess the risk of these new BioBricks or genetically modified microorganisms? Lab safety courses were common among iGEM teams before entering laboratories. Consulting biosafety group representatives was adapted by some teams, too. There were several teams that followed the guidelines or laws of GMOs (genetically modified organisms) in their own country, and modified them into a new guideline for future iGEM teams. To monitor or to avoid spreading of BioBricks into environment, the methods showed even more diversity: adding a barcode or watermark that can be easily identified by others, using toxin-antitoxin system to avoid the transformation of plasmids into other organisms, or creating a new way to select plasmids without using antibiotics…..etc.
The details of “safety in iGEM” are shown below. And to see feedbacks of the doctors about biosafety of our project, see Doctor Interview
2012 Calgary
In their project, they use two genetically modified products, FRED and OSCAR, to detoxify tailing water. They illustrate that there are four common major safety concerns with their project:
Engineered bacteria may be harmful to the environment
The engineered bacteria may outcompete the naturally occurring bacteria
Gene may be transferred from synthetic bacteria to natural organism
The genetically engineered bacteria may undergo mutation and evolution.
They design the mechanical engineered controls and biological engineered controls to solve the problem.
For the mechanical engineered controls, the final product containing FRED will be made within one-time use closed containers, with one-way valves. The bleach will be released to the operator to destroy FRED prior to proper disposal. Also, OSCAR is designed to work in a closed system. But it may escape by adhering to the belt. To counter this issue, they treat the belt with UV irradiation as it exit the bioreaction solution, which will destroy OSCAR without affecting the generated hydrocarbon.
For the biological engineered control, a “Ribo-Kill-Switches” system is introduced to the design, which contains micrococcal nuclease and CviAII restriction enzyme and will initiate cell death through degradation of genomic and plasmid DNA. Once the bacteria escape the closed biore"

To improve the promoter activation model, a larger and more consistent data set has to be obtained. We need to conduct fluorescence measurements over a wide range of DNT concentrations. Besides that, possible detrimental effects of its solvent (acytonitrile) have to be investigated. Also, the induction of the N genes with rhamnose might influence the measurements in an unexpected way. Doing all this is unfortunately not possible in the time span of this iGEM project.

Parameters that could be adjusted further is then the extension time but also the denaturation time. If the reason for the too short sequence is the limit of in extension time or not enough denaturation, increasing these two factors would then probably solve the problem.

Primers were designed for making BioBricks out of the separate genes from  the nisin operon. For this, the sequence of the transposon Tn5307 was used, a transposon that contains the nisin operon, and of  which the sequence is known.1 This sequence is close to the sequence of the transposon Tn5276, the transposon which will form the template for making the new BioBricks. The primers for making a BioBrick out of PNisI with a RBS were based on a sequence found in a research paper that documented the identification of this promoter.2
The list of primersequences can be found at THIS PAGE LINKLINKLINK.  It was decided to combine the genes NisR and NisK as one BioBrick and NisF, NisE and NisG as one BioBrick, because these genes are related in function or work together.
 
There were also primers designed for making a BioBrick out of the sfGFP(Bs), the primersequences can be found at THIS PAGE LINKLINK. This sfGFP was originally optimized for Bacillus subtilis. When it was tested in Lactococcus lactis, the sfGFP(Bs) was shown to perform really well in L. lactis as well.3

A collection of constitutive promoters was also desirable for the toolbox. We decided to use the CP promoter collection and test it in Lactococcus lactis, that was BioBricked by the Uppsala iGEM team of 2013. The CP promoters are registered as BBa_K1033219 (CP1), BBa_K1033220 (CP8), BBa_K1033221 (CP11), BBa_K1033222 (CP29), BBa_K1033223 (CP30), BBa_K1033224 (CP41) and BBa_K1033225 (CP44).

The ""chef"" E.coli also includes two pathways. The first synthesize LuxR, in the presence of AHL( the product of LuxI), it binds to the promoter LuxR and LuxS( the meal) is served, YFP is emited to show this process.
In sum, the hungry customer orders the meal by giving out signal ""luxI"". The ""chef"" containing luxR, senses the ""order"" signal and prepares for the meal-LuxS. The dinner service is accompanied with yellow fluorescent. When the customer is full, IsrR synthesis is inhibited, the aiiA degrades the remaining IsrR in the cell, thus the production of LuxI is stopped. And meal is no longer served.
Part III: Neon Lights
Detail:
In the project of neon lights, we intended to have E.coli engineered for emitting one color of luminescence during exponential phase and another color during stationary phase, so that it is convenient to identify the growth phase and may also be utilized for other purposes.
To achieve this goal, we chose BBa_J45992, a stationary phase promoter, and BBa_J45996, a promoter that is only active during exponential phase and assemble different luciferase under the control of the promoters. Parts of various luciferases have been obtained from the registry submitted by the team of Cambridge in 2010, for example, BBa_K325210, BBa_K325229, etc. System of degradation, such as ClpXP, can be used to optimize the project by degrading the previous luciferase when the latter is being produced, to make the latter color purer and the process of color changing faster. In addition, the fluctuation of the lusiferase activity due to the growth should be taken into consideration.

We then performed a colony PCR to amplify the ferrochelatase gene to confirm its presence within BL21 and DH5a E. coli cells.
We further optimised the PCR to obtain clean PCR products for our in vitro test (fig 2).

Week 7
(12th - 18th September)
Following the PCR amplification another gel cast to clean up the products and allow or better in vitro testing.
Using our amplified PCR products and transformed cells we performed an in vitro test of the commercial Cas9 by digesting it for 30 minutes at 37oC. This showed that the Cas9 cuts our PCR product at the right location and that our in vitro testing is appropriate as well.
The in vitro testing was performed the vitro test under similar condition to optimise the Protocol. Using pre temps, then re amplified and cut just the top 1000bp band for purity and then for Cas9 in vitro test.
Fig 3. Shown here are results of a colony PCR using the ferrochelatase as a primer, which allowed for our vitro testing of the Cas9 proteins as ferrochelatase is cut by our Cas9 at 990bp. This gel was to clean up our PCR amplification products for future in vitro testing.

Modelling
In order to model the chemotactic motion of the engineered bacteria, a simulation program was designed and produced.  The simulation models the motion of a population of bacteria in a small environment composed of two chemoattractants.  This page provides an overview of the simulator followed by an in-depth discussion of the mathematical model used [1,2].  The inputs to the model and the possible outputs are highlighted.  An analysis of the assumptions made in development, and resulting shortcomings of the tool is also conducted.
Overview
The simulation tool, as shown in the alongside figure, models the chemotactic motion of a population of bacteria in a small environment (a petri dish).  As in the project setup, two chemoattractants (shown in red and green) are present in the environment and influence the motile action of the bacteria.  The representative bacteria take the colour of the chemical towards which they are attracted, and move about the environment according to a movement algorithm.  Various options are available to the user of the tool to specify the experiment setup (see later) and the panel on the left allows for this.
The tool may be viewed at this link .  It is necessary to install the Unity Web Player to run the application.
Development Tools Used
The simulator was developed in the C# language and utilises the Unity3D graphics engine.  This engine was chosen as a development tool above other platforms such as MATLAB or Java for a variety of reasons.  Firstly, the engine is free to use and supports different development environments including easy web deployment.  Secondly, the ease of implementation allowed the developer to prototype and deploy iteratively for the team.   Functionality such as graphical user interface integration was provided and allowed more time to be dedicated to the modelling of the bacterial motility.
The Movement Algorithm"
SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Antitumor action_-_-_TEXT.html,"In the framework of recombinant phage gene design we decided to fuse the adenovirus 5 penton base to the D protein of the Lambda phage. The protein D extraction from Lambda phage genome has been lead by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with several couple of primers. The same  strategy has been applied for the adenovirus 5 penton base extraction which has been extracted from a plasmid coding for the virus offered by Dr. Karim Benihoud (UMR8121, CNRS/IGR, Villejuif, France).
After the fusion protein formation, this one is introduced in a BioBrick plasmid. This plasmid contains a resistance against an antibiotic to confirm the transfection of the recombined phage into bacteria and a reporter gene, like GFP, with eukaryotic promoter, the CMV of the Simian virus 40 (SV40), to confirm the transfection in eukaryotic cells. This strategy permits us to prove that the bacteriophage is able to infect eukaryotic cells.
Unfortunately, we have not been able to build the fusion protein in time. However, scientific literature show that the cell vector , a Lambda phage type, confection is possible by fusion of the penton base with the D protein (Stefania Piersanti et al. 2004). The central sequence of the penton base , amino -acids 1 to 571, fused with the bacteriophage offers a transfection in eukaryotic cells, like the use of the RGD fragment responsible for the entry of the virus and the exit of the endosome, fragment 286 to 393.

Results
Design of the fusion protein
For the fusion protein design, we decided to extract separately the adenovirus 5 penton base and the D protein of the Lambda phage thanks to primers containing a BalI restriction site on the protein D reverse primer and the penton base forward primer. Moreover the finale fusion protein contains specific BioBricks fragments to its prefix and suffix.
For these 2 genes extraction we used the following primers:
First and second pair for genes extraction:
D protein of the Lambda phage:
Forward : 5' ATG-ACG-AGC-AAA-GAA-ACC-TT 3';
Reverse : 5' AAA-AAA-ATC-CCG-TAA-AAA-AAG-C 3'.

Database
A MySQL relational database was designed and implemented to hold both physical and non-physical parts. The database was populated manually and using the file upload feature of the BioBrickIt web service. A set of generic parts was all that was required for this research, but the database contains several other parts which are available from the 2008 iGEM Subtilin receiver. The database is online and can be accessed via the BioBrickIt Service at http://msc.jannetta.com:8080/BioBrickIt/ .
JSim server
When accessing the BioBrickIt service on http://msc.jannetta.com:8080/BioBrickIt/ , a simulation of the generated motif can be requested. This is done by adding simulate=yes as a parameter to the URL. For example requesting a simulation of the generic constitutive promotor can be obtained with: http://msc.jannetta.com:8080/BioBrickIt/GetMotifModel?motif_name=motif_constitutive_promoter&simulate=yes .
Taverna workflows
We used Taverna Workbench to create 3 workflows. The first workflow (Figure 3) makes use of the BioBrickIt Webservice to determine the presence of restriction sites in a provided sequence.
The second workflow (Figure 4) retrieves the sequences of provided physical parts using the BioBrickIt service. It then concatenates the sequences. The intension is that this workflow be extended or embedded in a larger workflow that could conver a CellML model to a sequence.

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#blog_-_-_TEXT.html," The factor that we want to observe is the strength of the activation of the Lux promoter. The read-out is made by the fluorescence. The data was gathered over several time points in order to be able to observe the dynamic behavior. More precisely, the read-out of the promoter activation is made by the relative fluorescence, which corresponds to the ratio of the absolute fluorescence over the Optical Density (OD). We consider that the concentration in GFP per cell is proportional to the relative fluorescence. As we try to avoid fitting the saturation events, we chose to normalize with respect to the highest value before a certain amount of time, which corresponds for each experiment to the apparition of the saturation.
As a first approach, we only try to fit the steady state value. As the signaling molecule is inducing the production of GFP, we chose to use an Hill function to fit the function [GFP] = f([AHL]) at steady state.
If Hill functions fit these two curves good, the parameters used are surprising. For our system, we suppose that AHL binds to the regulator protein LuxR. This complex called Rlux dimerizes before binding to the promoter to induce its expression. Thus, the dimerization event makes cooperativity emerge from AHL molecules. It is translated for a Hill function by n > 1. In this particular case, one could expect to find n=2 (as it is a dimerization event). Nevertheless, the n found are on the order of magnitude of 1 (0.89 for the non-riboregulated promoter plasmid and 1.22 for the ribo-regulated promoter plasmid). The data points were collected in triplicates and this allow us to have a look at the variability (namely standard deviation) around each value. Where the switch happens, the variability is higher (it is expected because the output GFP is more sensitive to variation of the input [AHL] around the switching point). Therefore, the inflexion points could need some improvment, by taking more points around this identified sensitive region. Moreover, this critical concentration of AHL was the one that was expected given the litterature and our system. We observe that it needs a higher [AHL] for the riboregulated system to be activated than for the non-riboregulated system.
We modeled leakiness as an offset in the Hill function : [GFP] = g([AHL]) = f([AHL]) + aLeakiness. We obtain the expected information that the signal over noise ratio is greater by one order of magnitude for the riboreg"

And most important, we hope that our efforts will be able to inspire the future generation of iGEMer's and the newest members of the iGEM community; high school students.
I remember, along with my fellow teammates, learning about PCR by cutting up little paper nucleotides and putting them into a brown bag and then having our hands act as the ""polymerase"" that would pluck the nucleotides out and match them with the template strand we were given. I remember taking away very little from this ""lab"" other than a few paper cuts. In subsequent years, I went through a few internship programs where I was able to learn in greater detail the steps of PCR, eventually learning how to design primers, program the machine, and setup my own reactions. However, I believe that if we truly want to bring synthetic biology to the public, we have to allow them the opportunity to actually do PCR, not through a paper bag which is conceptual understanding, but a real reaction where the end products are the real deal, actual amplified DNA. We still have a ways to go... the enzymes have to become cheaper pipettes need to become cheaper, but designing a below 50 dollar PCR machine is the first step in this endeavor.
C.H.I.P: Cheap Homemade Innovative PCR
Our first design for C.H.I.P. was modeled after a more conventional PCR machine design. This first prototype used two peltier units, stacked on top of each other, to heat a customized aluminum block that sat on top of the two units and held the PCR tubes. In order for our system to have feedback, we embedded a temperature sensor in the aluminum block to detect the temperature of the wells that held the PCR tubes. The sensor then reported back to an Arduino UNO, which then regulated the energy flow to the peltier units, thereby heating and cooling the block and tubes while closing the control loop. However, after much testing, this design proved to be unoriginal, expensive, and inefficient. While the conventionality of the design itself did not pose an issue, we realized that the parts used to assemble it were not as well-known or easily accessible to the general public, which we felt would take away from the possible applications of this machine. In addition, although the price of this first prototype was relatively inexpensive in contrast to laboratory grade PCR machines, the price still ranged in the hundreds of dollars. Lastly and most importantly, the greatest issue with our design was the inefficiency of the hardware; we found that the"

In the final test we used plates with 0.1M of IPTG. This time we used ab Impföse to bring the different strains together. After growing overnight we detected that the red strain killed or overgrew the blue strain on every single plate.
Figure 15 E.coli XL1 pUC19_blue_ccdB against E.coli XL1 pUC19_red_mazF on agar plate with IPTG. The plates show that the E.coli XL1 pUC19_red_mazF grows over E.coli XL1 pUC19_blue_ccdB. In a we let them grow straight to each other and mixed them in the middle. In b we did the same as in a just with 2 red strains. C shows that the red strain grows even when everything is full of blue E.coli. In d we used each strain and plated them over each other.
BioBricks
After we had our positive clones for the main project we used the positive sequenced pJET clones to assemble the BioBricks.  We decided to make four composite BioBricks. The composite parts are also the main parts of our project.  One BioBrick contains the MazE antitoxin and the red chromoprotein. (Figure 1)

EuropeanCommission (2006). SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE ON"
Edinburgh,2009,Team:Edinburgh#ethics(publicperception)_-_-_TEXT.html," fact that 21% were unaware of this technology indicates that more efforts need to be made to introduce and explain it to the general public. Our team is of the opinion that lack of public knowledge about science hinders scientific development, as has been demonstrated by the negative connotation attached to genetically modified food in the UK because this has not been properly explained to the public.
It was surprising to find out that more people were happy for synthetic biology to be used for medical purposes rather than environmental. Perhaps unsurprising was the finding that the least number of people were happy for this technology to be used for food purposes.
We were happy to find out that a great majority of people were not opposed to synthetic biology.  As 76% of the people who answered Not Sure to this question were from a non-scientific background, it is likely that they fall into the category of people who are not familiar with advances in the field of genetic engineering.
Trivia: The two people that answered Yes to this question were of Christian background; however, due to small population samples, this is likely to be a mere coincidence.
It was very encouraging to find out that the majority of people had great faith in synthetic biology. Now it is up to us to live up to their expectations!
This answer demonstrates that most people are concerned with the Environmental and Health effects of synthetic biology, as well as unknown consequences of new technology. This shows that we need to take great care to make our research safe, and to be able to demonstrate and prove its safety in a transparent, unbiased way.
It is also clear that in general the responses above indicate that a great concern surrounding synthetic biology stems from the unknown aspect of its effects, perhaps suggestive of the fact that this technology should be thoroughly trialed and tested in the laboratory before it is released and applied in the environment or elsewhere.
Interestingly, religion was ranked as the least important concern.
Answers 8 and 9 demonstrate that, although people have high faith in synthetic biology, they make it clear that this technology should remain in the “right hands”—that is, in the hands of specialists. Perhaps we shouldn’t be expecting DIY genetic engineering kits anytime soon?
And finally, to the most important question....
Although the answers are divided on this question, we were very excited to find out that the majority of people answered that they would be happy for our genetically engineered microorganism to be released anywhere for detecting landmines. Only a small percentage of people answered that they would not be happy for it to be released (including the two who are opposed to genetic engineering!).  If and when our system proves to be a feasible and"

Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html,"ounced to actually use them, which shows how patent can impede research and innovation: getting a license may be dissuasive, especially in France where the Research budget is limited.
The next answers are related to the current iGEM projects. The poll shows clearly that patents have been a problem for 10 % of the participants, which is not that much. But still :  they do have been a concern in some cases. The relatively low number could be explained by the aforementioned reasons about the providing of non-patented tools by the iGEM organization.
It could also be explained by the redundant solutions offered by the living matter in general and the synthetic biology in particular. For instance, our team specifically picked a Dispersin gene that was not patented, though others were available (whose commercial use was protected).
Nevertheless to the question : “have other IP concerns (copyright, trademark) have negatively affected your current iGEM project ?” about 67% of the participants answered yes, which is considerably more, but as we have not even been concerned by such a problem, we find it hard to explain why this number is so high.
Our sole conclusion on this matter is that the IPR often does affect iGEM projects, even if in general the patents are not the limiting IP tool for them.
May a project be built on patented materials?
19% of the survey participants said that their team’s project used patented materials. This means that privatized knowledge and the iGEM contest are compatible in some way or another. However, the potential industrialization of these teams’ work will probably be restricted because the commercial use of something built on patented material is forbidden. This is a shame as one of the iGEM objectives is to generate projects that may have economically viable applications.
It is also surprising to note that 48% of the participants do not know whether their work is based on patented information or not, which shows a lack of information on their project material. Besides, it could stab them in the back if they were wishing to industrialize their ideas. Several questions were asked on the use of patented material. As it was discussed before, it is the most important IP issue in iGEM.  Nonetheless, only 20% of the survey participants said that their team’s project used patented material.
Furthermore, two thirds of the iGEM team members believe that using patented work would not stand in the way of patenting their own one. This is quite surprising because obviously one’s research cannot be patented if based on protected materials. This statistic is very interesting as it shows how much most of the i"

Short Overview
DNA Extraction from plant leaves:
DNA extraction kit Macherey & Nagel. Extraction was performed according to protocol. The leaf pieces were either frozen with liquid nitrogen and afterwards added to the mortar and pestle or water was added.
Open the Pollen:
Ribolyser:
6500 rpms* two times performed *30 seconds duration of the rotation *30 seconds pause
Media (cultivating bacteria):
LB = 20g LB powder filled up to 1L
Competent cells KRX from promega were used for transformation. Heat shock transformation were tested with the promega provided protocol and with the protocol from the iGEM Bielefeld team 2014:
Transformation via heat shock
Thaw 200 μL Chemo competent E.coli cells on ice
Add 0.5-5μL plasmid to 200 μL chemocompetent cells
Store cells on ice for 10-30 minutes
Heatshock for (60-)90 seconds at 42°C
Transfer transformation reaction to 1 mL SOC or LB Medium and incubate 1 hour at 37°C
Centrifuge 30 seconds at 11000 rpm and plate on selective LB Medium
Incubate overnight at 37°C
Plasmid isolation was performed with the analytic Jena plasmid isolation kit. The enclosed protocol was used. It was changed a bit as the elution step was done with water instead of elution buffer.

Week 3
During this week and the previous ones the whole idea of this human practices project and the code for it evolved. Thus we start with several scrapy spiders and initial implementations of data display, text analysis and the first interesting findings on our private github repository. During this week the main task was to fix the several scraping scripts and expand them to generate more data.
Week 4
While the bug fixing and expansion of the srapy spiders was still going on, we started to put the data in R instead of JSON format, in order to start doing statistical analysis.
Week 6
After thinking about how to ideally put our data into a nice homepage, we decided to use the R-package shiny. After reading into how that actually works Nikos was the one to make the first step and implement our scatter-plot app.
Week 8
Since we had a more elaborate app layout in mind and only few people were willing to do it with bootstrap, we had to look into ways of creating an individual app without using this. The funny thing is that we ended up with bootstrap all over our wiki and our software tools - including this one.
Week 9
During this week we started doing real progress. The second app - the timeline - was impelmented, we created a homepage draft and finally we"

Safety
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
No. None of our software projects raise research, public, or environmental safety issues.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise safety issues?
No. We do not plan to develop new parts in our projects.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at our institution?
We do not plan to conduct any wet experiments that involve DNA manipulation. Our instructors and advisors think our projects do not raise any safety problems.
4. Do you have any other ideas to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions?
It might be helpful if there are more comprehensive learning materials that promote awareness of biosafety issues. It would be more desirable if the materials are interactive, as users can actively learn with fun.

Parts Submitted to the Registry
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts on the Registry than on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
When should you put parts into the Registry?
As soon as possible! We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better recall you will have of all details surrounding your parts. Remember you don't need to send us the DNA to create an entry for a part on the Registry. However, you must send us the sample/DNA before the Jamboree. Only parts for which you have sent us samples/DNA are eligible for awards and medal requirements.
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If"

Week 1 - Planning
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
Ideas are discussed - we decide to concentrate on pigment outputs - Different colours are researched - we come up with the possibilites of red, orange, green, violet, blue and brown
Monday
Brainstorming; each team member researched their own ideas for our project.

Tuesday
Afternoon presentations - possible projects included
Bacto-Stat
Counterfeit Bill Detector
Traffic light-obedient bacteria
Light-induced pigment production
Predator prey bacteria + a parasite
Modelling pesticide resistance
Galvanotaxis
Wave-pulse bacteria
Ai2 quorum sensing system
Conclusions
Decided to concentrate on a pigment output. Wednesday plans involve discussing ideas for pigments, following the same meeting pattern used on Tuesday. Ideally the  pigment output would be a new registry part which could then be connected to any input system
Wednesday
Investigated possible outputs, with a kind of bacterial printer in mind.
Colour Wheels
3 possible kinds of colour wheels were thought out. By using bacteria producing each of the three colour in a wheel, a wide range of colours may be created by altering the ratios:
Primary school style: BLUE, YELLOW, RED
True colour wheel: YELLOW, CYAN, MAGENTA
Autochrome: ORANGE, GREEN, VIOLET
Viable Pigments
In an ideal system, we would have lots of pathways making different coloured pigments from a common precursor.  One can dream...
Carotenoids - RED, ORANGE, YELLOW
Biobricks exist for part of the system
Apparently you can go from yellow to white (cool)

Pseudomons aeruginosa - RED, GREENISH/BLUE
"
Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus is of particular interest in our project. We have aimed to target the most common strain of bacteria that is found in chronic wounds, and although our main focus has been staphylococcal biofilms, can you tell us more about the gram-negative bacterial composition of the chronic wounds that you studied.
Answer: I am not a diabetologist. I just wandered into the infections that are common in diabetic patients. We know that diabetic patients are usually more vulnerable to infections than a normal person because of deranged defense systems. One of the problems that they usually have is a wound that would not heal. Such wounds (ulcers) occur more in the foot. The ulcer then becomes secondarily infected. In the first week of an infected ulcer, S. aureus is the most common and earliest organism involved. Then Pseudomonas spp. comes in. Gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes like Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroides spp., respectively come in later to complicate the milieu of bacterial flora present in the ulcer.
Question: Current treatments rely heavily on antibiotics and debridement of the wound biofilm which have proven to be minimally effective and contribute to widespread antibiotic resistance. We have worked on the development of a spider-silk based wound healing technology; we will conjugate the antimicrobial proteins to the silk, aiming to degrade the bacterial biofilm matrix of chronic wounds. How can we adapt this wound dressing to target both gram-negative organisms and the anaerobes that you have studied.
Answer: I believe that any material that can disrupt biofilm would be very useful in the management of infections caused by bacteria that produce biofilms. Coupling this with a suitable antimicrobial agent that is capable of killing the bacteria within the biofilms will be novel. A broad-spectrum antibacterial agent that can kill anaerobes e.g. the Bacteroides spp. anaerobic cocci and Clostridium spp. as well as the facultative organisms like S. aureus, and aerobic bacteria like Pseudomonas spp.  Coupling clindamycin (an anti-anaerobic drug and staphylococci) plus gentamicin (for Pseudomonas and facultative organisms) with the spider web that you are trying to develop may be worth investigating. When the biofilm is degraded the antibiotics can then be released into the wound. Another antimicrobial agent that can be tried is piperacillin-tazobactam, as"

Investigator: Roman, Saskia
Aim:
Isolation of plasmids pSB1C3 and pTUM104, to check for uptaken inserts by an analytical restriction digest.
Operational sequence:
The putative positive clones were picked and used for inoculation on monday, 1 am. Thus, the plasmid preparation took place at 3 pm. Four clones of each plate had been picked. The plates were stored in the fridge, at 4°C. The plasmid preparation was performed as described in the manufactueres protocol (Quiagen). Elution was done with 40 µl of elution buffer (Kit) at room temperature, with the columns having been incubated 5 minutes at room temperature before the final centrifugation.

The Return of GOT
It’s mid-July, fans have been eagerly waiting for this since the last episode aired on March 2016, but the moment has finally come, WINTER IS HERE! GOT season 7 has finally returned, blessing us with and extra 7 episodes that have long awaited! For seven weeks, our week would start by entering the lab on Monday, working till 12, having lunch, and then gathering around in our conference room to watch the new GOT episode. It was extremely fun to indulge in an activity that didn’t require thinking about cells and microscopes. However, that ritual soon came to end with the last episode of the season. However, we vowed to meet up when the new season premieres and watch the first episode all together, for good time’s sake!

TEC-Costa_Rica,2016,Team:TEC-Costa Rica#Project#System#Signaling_-_-_TEXT.html," we wanted to have versatile BioBricks, we ordered them without promoter nor RBS; reason why we had to assembly the BioBricks with the corresponding promoter and RBS. Based on the Anderson collection, we selected the J23101 to express constitutively the BioBricks and the LacL regulated promoter R0010 for the one we wanted to induce.
We assembled devices of BioBricks K1903010 (RFP-Intein N DnaB), and K190312 (Intein C DnaB), with the promoters R0010 and J23101 respectively, shown in figure 3. We tried to assemble both of the devices in one construct, BioBrick K1903014, but we didn't validate the construct size as detailed also in figure 3.

Protein analysis
Although we didn't where able to confirm BioBrick K1903014 assembly, we analyzed the proteins expression by an SDS-page. In this gel, there are two strong bands. One near 30kDa and another one near 20kDa. The weight of the RFP with the intein is 27kDa, so it is probably the band close to the 30kDa marker. The weight of the RFP without the intein is 25kDa, but there is no band near this size. The 20kDa band might be the DnaB IntC fragment, with a size of 18kDa.

Under construction
For further results we need to validated the intein C DnaB's (K190312) protease activity, reason why we need to re-assemble K1903010 and K190312. By analyzing this construct’s function, we would proof the intein release mechanism of our system.

Cas9 Modelling
We managed to write a code that would enable anyone to predict the time taken to achieve homoplasmy using the appropriate model for Cas9 activity. This program is also designed to be flexible in the sense that various input parameters can be changed to fit the parameters of your experiment. For more information, please read a complete documentation of the program under the 'Modelling' page.
