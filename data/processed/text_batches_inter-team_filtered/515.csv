Bidirectional Promoters
Scientists are frequently confounded by wayward promoters; that is, promoters which do not produce   the expected proteins. Some bidirectional promoters are known to exist, but which way they promote   and the degree of expression has not been quantified. This project will test the directionality of   several BioBrick promoters to answer these questions.

Circuit Model
Initial Design
This construct tests the directionality of selected promoters. A small non-coding sequence lies between two restriction enzyme sites; this is the area where each promoter will be inserted. Upstream from the promoter sequence lies a RFP reporter. Downstream codes for a GFP reporter. Thus, as promoters are ligated into the promoter placeholder, the cell fluoresces red, green, or both, indicating the promoter directionality.
Sources
The initial construct for this project utilized the reporters of non-BioBrick parts available in a neighboring campus lab. The Salis Lab generously allowed us to use samples of the pBAC plasmid and mFTV3 plasmid to assemble the construct.
Assembly
The pBAC vector was PCR amplified with 40 basepair overlaps complementary to the ends of the reporter inserts. A RFP reporter and GFP reporter were simultaneously PCR amplified from the mFTV3 plasmid, both containing a 40 basepair overlap sequence complementary to the ends of the adjacent piece.
These parts were finally assembled using the CBAR, or Gibson Assembly, reaction. Gibson Assembly utilizes three enzymes.
An exonuclease, which chews back the overlapping sequences of each piece from the 5' to 3' ends
A polymerase, which fills in the gaps left in the DNA from the exonuclease
A ligase, which heals the nicks in the annealed DNA strand
Annealing the pieces together provided a construct devoid of an actual promoter sequence. By digesting the construct with restriction enzymes flanking the promoter placeholder and inserting promoters isolated from BioBrick parts, the construct fulfilled its purpose.

Pasteur_Paris,2017,Team:Pasteur Paris#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," that we are a multidisciplinary team. When we have our final prototype, we will come back to City Hall to talk about their potential support in the development of our project.
Airparif
AIRPARIF is an organisation responsible for monitoring the air quality in the Paris agglomeration. On August 11th, 2017, we met with Thomas Alcaraz, engineer at Airparif, that gave us the opportunity to become members of the Airlab, a broad ecosystem with a network of actors in the fight against air pollution. It positions itself to push the structures of Ile-de-France and to develop employment and the economy around the fight against pollution.
7th morning of the HEIQA college of experts"" (Health Environment and Indoor Air Quality)
On October 26th, two of our members, Azéline and Juliette, participated in the working morning of the HEIQA panel of experts. They attended a series of conferences on indoor air quality and could interact with allergy and health specialists and people working on the development of indoor air cleaners. This conference confirmed and backed a conclusion we had formed: there is still too little work and studies on indoor air while it is the most dangerous and toxic. Creating an indoor pollution database would be an excellent initiative. Azéline and Juliette then attended a conference on air purifiers with a presentation of the state of the art existing models. It turned out that systems that have the most chance of success in the future are those that do not consume energy (passive), that do not produce more pollutants after use, and that are not too expensive. Azéline and Juliette then had the opportunity to present our project aether, which received very good feedback.
3) Current state of the art air purifying devices market
Categorized as luxury products a few years back, air purifiers are emerging as a necessity product across the globe very fast, especially in developed economies. With increasing industrialization and expanding vehicle fleet, the quality of air across the globe is lowering at an alarming rate. In addition, coal used in thermal power generation and as a fuel source in households across many emerging and underdeveloped economies, is significantly deteriorating indoor air quality. Due to depleting air quality, people are encountering increasing health risks such as asthma, lung cancer and other respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. In the face of these statements, the demand for air purifiers has been increasing globally over the last few years.

Deinococcus
Deinococcus species are hardy gram-negative bacteria that can survive acute radiation exposures up to 10,000 Gray units of ionizing radiation. 5 Deinococcus species genomes' have been sequenced at this time, including Deinococcus radiodurans - the most infamous member of the phylum Deinococcus-Thermus that is so tough it's been named 'Conan the Bacterium'. We hope to expand the sequence information in this phylum and enable sequence similarity studies in the future.

Safety
Safety for the public, environment and the biologist working in a GMO classified lab is important. When classifying a GMO its pathogenesis and ability to spread from one host to another are the two main focus points. Reference: World health organization, third edition, 2004 - Visited: 16.09.15. [WHO]
When added up they imply level of risk for a specific organism. The leveling ranges from 1 to 4, where one implies for an organism that has no pathogenesis towards humans and is unable to  It is important for us a synthetic biologist’s to recognize a level of danger and act accordingly.

Hackarium
We had an opportunity to visit Hackarium, located in Lausanne, Switzerland back in June. Hackuarium was founded in 2014 – a fairly new community lab.  We were fortunate enough to interact with the biohackers at Hackarium and we are potentially working together on the beer project by providing them with some sample strains for them to sequence.  Their “Beer Decoded: the 1000 Beer Genome Project” recently got funded on
Kickstarter.
Clearing up confusion in the registry
As part of the main activity of the 2015 London iGEM Bootcamp we attempted to perform a digestion, ligation and transformation of a simple biobrick and backbone with a promoter. However, not all was as it seemed! The simple biobrick we had chosen to ligate into a biobrick backbone was an mRFP coding biobrick ( BBa__I13507 ) to be found in well 21P, plate 4 of the 2015 distribution.
Upon transforming the final product of the restriction + digestion we did not, however, get any visible mRFP production from our cells. Noticing something might be up, we checked the sequencing results for this part and discovered that it did not match the part's proper sequence. After doing a quick BLAST search through the registry using an iGEM registry BLAST tool we discovered that well 21P, plate 4 of the 2015 distribution actually contained BBa_I13602 . Looking at the history of the part, we can surmise that in 2011 BBa_I13602 was pipetted into the well intended for BBa__I13507. It's also interesting to note that the two codes could easily be confused when hand written on something like a microfuge tube.
To prevent teams from getting caught in this mix-up in the future we have submitted a part with the correct sequence for the RBS, mRFP and double terminator (and we have even included the original barcode). YOu can find this corrected biobrick here .

Team Nevada 2011 Abstract:
A Cooperative Relationship Between Cyanobacteria and E.Coli
for Production of Biofuels
In light of the growing energy crisis, much research has been devoted to finding economical means of producing renewable fuels.
Traditional methods for obtaining biofuels have relied mainly on the fermentation of agricultural crops. However, there are a number of problems with this approach: the reduction in land available for food production, relatively low levels of CO2 biofixation, and large biomass requirements. Our project aims to overcome these problems by utilizing E. coli for the production of biodiesel (C-12 fatty acids) and bioethanol. In the past there have been a number of examples of biofuel production in E. coli; however 30-40% of production cost is based on media costs (Galbe et al., 2007). Our project will surmount these high production costs by engineering the cyanobacteria, Synechocystis PCC 6803, to secrete large quantities of glucose that will feed our biofuel-producing E. coli. Cyanobacteria and E. coli will be co-cultivated in an apparatus that allows for the mutual transfer of carbon to produce biofuels. Not only will this project provide an efficient means for producing biofuels without the need for a carbon source, but it will also create a novel cooperative system between bacterial species that may have further industrial implications.

Week 5
With the simulation program finished, I have been the whole week making runs and changing conditions to see the effects in the biestable behavior. I have used some computers, including my personal laptop, but the effort to my computer is considerable and it sometimes turn off because of the heat. A run can last several hours, so I have to be patient. I have checked the behavior of the simulation in different conditions, changing promoter strength, changing repressors per promoter, etc, and finally I exported this data to .csv files. After this, I plotted this information to compare the results.
Week 6
I have been this whole week still plotting the information I got from the simulation. Now the wiki freezing is close and I have to start also to write the text for the wiki.
Week 7
Last week here! Eventually, I have spent many hours writing and documenting all the things I have worked in. Now the text is ready to upload to the wiki page. I have enjoyed a lot this year learning different things here in the dry lab.

Leiden,2016,Team:Leiden#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," we enhance the performance of our             bacteria, by placing             them in a bioreactor.
Figure 1: The designs for our bioreactor.
The total             system is displayed in figure 1.
We are             discussing the possibility of making a prototype bioreactor together with our             university, as well as an industrial prototyping facility called ""BPF"". As soon             as this works on a small scale, we can research our potential for making an             industrial variant.
Mars             Case
Whilst             perchlorate""s presence on earth is a problem, it is a barrier to our existence             on Mars. Perchlorate accumulates easily in plants. In research mentioned             before, 79 % of all perchlorate in solution ended up in plants tissue. This             makes any plant grown on Mars inedible. This is the case, supposing that plants             are even able to grow in such high perchlorate concentrations. Out of all             Martian soil, 0.5-1% is perchlorate. This is in mass percentages, meaning that             1 kg of Martian soil contains up to 10 g perchlorate. When dissolved in water,             the perchlorate dissolves. Perchlorate salts generally have high solubility.             The perchlorate with the smallest solubility is potassium perchlorate (KClO4-).             At the most, one can dissolve 15 g of potassium perchlorate per liter of water.             One can, however, dissolve up to 2kg of sodium perchlorate per liter. So,             consider moist Martian soil. The water in the soil now has a concentration of             perchlorate ranging from 0.11-16.1 mol/L. Honghzi He et al. have tested plant             growth at various perchlorate concentrations. 3 The highest             concentration was 500 mg/L, this is a factor 30 lower than the lowest             concentration found on Mars. At these concentrations, plant growth is already             significantly decreased. The plant, C. indica only grew up to 68% of its             natural height at 500 mg/L. This means that farming for food in Mars is not             viable, unless the perchlorate is reduced.
The question             is, what kind of vegetables should one grow for survival on Mars? Researchers             from Wageningen University have found that the following plants grow best on             Mars: tomatoes, Mustard, stonecrop, cress and wheat. Unfortunately, these are             not the most efficient plants.

Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!

Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.

Summary
One of the industries that greatly contributes to the antibiotic resistance problem is the fish farming industry. To achieve high yields and profits, many farmers are now applying intensive farming methods which involves the misuse of antibiotic usage. Our first idea was to solve this problem by engineering a bacterium that can sense the pathogen and swim towards it. After arriving there, a neutralizing agent will either be released or produced and excreted on the spot. Antibiotic resistance shield The overuse of antibiotics has led to the development of antibiotic resistances. Although this problem has already been popping up in scientific and newspaper articles for over 30 years, its threat is one that can no longer be ignored. The US Department of Health and Human Services estimates that annually over 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths in the United States are caused by antibiotic resistance. Moreover, it is approximated that by 2050, 10 million people will die annually due to antibiotic resistance. The ‘antibiotic apocalypse’ needs to be prevented, so action should be taken now!

During the Benelux Meetup we attend an extensive workshop.
Citation Wageningen iGEM Team 2017
""""The goal of the workshop was for each iGEM team to get out of their expert point of view and discover what the needs or problems would be for the end-user of their project. The teams were to find out: What would it mean to use the technology in practice? Three to six people of each iGEM team were coupled to a small group of another team. Next, one team got to shortly explain their project as 'developer'. The other team was to ask questions as 'end-user' about how the use of the technology and its influence on their lives or work. After 15 minutes, the roles were reversed. The experts and alumni iGEM teams were also invited to participate.

Brainstorming
As described before, combating the development of antibiotic resistances was a project we thought worth working on. Nevertheless, we did not consider the application in fish farms as a feasible option anymore. So, we went back to brainstorming. Here, we thought about a new potential application: fighting (the formation of) biofilms, for example in industrial pipelines and on boat hulls. Additionally, we came up with ideas to remove biofilms from food and"

The SecB pathway is the mostly used way for the extracellular production of recombinant proteins.    SRP can be used for proteins that fold too quickly and incorrectly in the cytoplasm and TAT allows the secretion of poteins that are already folded.
In our project we use the SecB dependend pathway to secrete the enzymes.    We needed to optimize the expression level with appropriate promotor strength to prevent the formation of inclusion bodies.    Additionally it’s important to achieve high secretion levels which is a known problem in recombinant enzyme secretion.    The efficiency of the protein secretion depends on the host strain, signal sequence and the type of protein to be secreted (e. g. high protein size causes limited enzyme secretion).

Wikipedia edit-a-thon
Official poster of the event
Realizing that the openness of iGEM is in agreement with the principles of the Wikipedia, the world’s most used source of information, we organized the first brazilian edit-a-thon for biology related subject!
Even though Brazil has a number of great research labs and millions of university students, wikipedia articles in portuguese are of much lower quality than the ones in English. Moreover, people are not trained and empowered to change this and so to improve it with their own expertise. Thus providing and stepping stone for bringing people closer to the “Open Knowledge” world is also set to change the culture of the restricted academic knowledge in Brazil.
Teaming up with Wikipedia Brasil and the USP Synthetic Biology Club, we organized a pilot event, with team members, people from university laboratories, start-ups and even high school students. Even though few people participated, we managed to add more than 6000 new words to the wikipedia and, more importantly, introduced people to the world of open science!
Engagement of team and community to make knowledge available to all!
This official edit-a-thon, with support of the Brazilian Wikipedia, and it will be the basis for many more to come. The event was shared with people around Brazil and we got feedback from people from different cities and states that now want to organize and/or take part on further events, empowering people to produce good and open content. We are excited to see how, in the future years, this small initiative could empower people to make science more open,

stock 5.6 1000: 4mL LB + 1mL E. coli overnight + 1mL phage 5.3 stock
Stock 5.6 10 has the highest titer. To amplify phage to a high titer, we should consider lowering the number of phage particles we add to liquid culture.
Selection test
We tested our proposed method of selecting for small phage using concentrated top agar (4.26 T7 Phage Selection Method).
0.5mL of E. coli + 20 μL -5 received stock + 20min incubation + 5mL of agar at various concentration
As the concentration of top agar increases, the number of plaques and the size of the plaques both dropped. This suggested that our method of selection should work.
We tested ×8 top agar and even fewer plaques formed on it (5.3 T7 Phage Selection Method Test):
However, concentrated top agar solidify so fast that we weren’t able to get it even spread on the plate. We decided to try warming up the plates in 37°C incubator for 3 hours before use (5.9 T7 Phage Selection Method Test #2). Our plates are much prettier this time.

It takes continued reflection, and occasional readjustments, to the organizational aspects of the project (for example, how team members communicate) to keep things moving forward. As one example of this reflection and readjustment, members with extensive lab experience recently led a discussion about to include in the lab notebook, to make sure that everyone is on the same page and information about experiments is recorded consistently.
Community
Reach out to the local community, carefully listen to any concerns and questions and respond honestly.
We make an effort to respond thoughtfully to those who reached out to us with sincere concerns on social media. In addition, we have reached out to Friends of the Earth, an environmental group that is also located in the Bay Area and has been critical of synthetic biology. We hope to start a dialogue that builds on our common concern for the environment, and we hope that they can provide constructive criticism that helps us stay true to our vision of producing a more ethical and sustainable cheese. Finally, this project is helping to build the DIYbio community in the Bay Area, attracting people and resources to our community labs so that they can continue their mission of providing the education and tools to make science more accessible.
Themes from Discussions
Our project is motivated by the desire to find a more sustainable and humane method of cheese production. However, we acknowledge that it is not enough to simply have good intentions - we need to consider potential unintended consequences (good or bad) of our actions. So, we had a brainstorming session to think about the potential risks and concerns that may arise - even those that may be very unlikely. We included some concerns that members of the public have communicated to us. No matter how unlikely, we believe it is important to be open and honest about these potential concerns and welcome dialogue from members of the public about the potential risks and benefits of our project. We continue to have ongoing discussions about these issues and how best to address them.
Complexity vs. simplification
-We tend to value decentralization and as a participant in the DIY movement, our organization is all about making science more accessible. A concern is that we may make the cheesemaking process more complicated and thereby less accessible – more dependent on expert knowledge and industrial capabilities.
-Some people think it could theoretically be done as a “homebrew” process, but this would be more likely to distribute yeast into the environment (conflicting with other potential concern below)
-Someone suggests that an alternative use of the technology is to replace the caseins in other products that use casein as an extract, to “veganize” other products that"

The lack of visible hair degradation could be due to the low concentration of KerUS actually present in the culture compared to the amount of hair in the tube.  It could also be a result of non-optimal temperature and pH for KerUS activity.
’Old’ Biobrick: For this assay we decided not to weigh the hair and feathers.  Instead we used more pictures instead to document changes.  No hair or feather degradation could be observed in any of the tubes.  There was also no discoloration.  This, much like the skim milk plate assays, tends to suggest an issue with the creation of the biobrick parts.
Considerations for future experiments: We would like to conduct more replicates of these experiments.  Future considerations also include replicating the experiments with a higher concentration of KerUS, and optimal pH and temperature for KerUS activity.
As a supplementary control, the experiment should also be replicated with no hair to determine whether the discoloration is truly due to the plastic cap and not the hair.
Miniprep:
The protocol can be found on our ‘Experiments’ page.
During a lab weekend hosted by Geekstarter and the University of Lethbridge we were able to miniprep and run a gel to confirm the transformation of the non-biobrick KerUS plasmids.  The gel shows a plasmid band at the the same size for all KerUS miniprepped samples, and suggests a successful transformation.
Modified: When it came to miniprepping the biobrick version of KerUS we created, the results obtained using the equipment and miniprep kit at our school was less successful.  We hypothesize this is largely because we were unable to obtain highly concentrated alcohols to add to the kit, and possibly because of the DNA shearing as we use a dremelfuge (dremel tool centrifuge created in our first year of iGEM on 2014).  To solve these problems a different miniprep protocol was developed.
The results obtained using this protocol are unclear.  There seems to be a large smear of DNA on the gel as opposed to two clear bands (two because of the supercoiled and relaxed conformation of the plasmids).  This once again seems to be due to shearing of DNA with the centrifugation.  After realizing the error with the synthesis we realize that the problem with the miniprep is just that the bacteria do not contain the plasmid. "

According to the information provided on two websites, we identify and seperate all the domains from DEBS1.
3. Generating new polyketide by “programming” domain in module.
After identifying and obtaining the sequence of each domains, we assemble the domain in the order of what we want. Then we can test whether the PKS are expressed correctly and the polyketide synthesized as we want.(figure.2) GC content of PKS DEBS1 sequence is very high, so we have the codon optimized to make it suitable for E.coli[7].
3.1 Standardzing the domain.
We first assemble the domain as original DEBS1+TE, to find whether our reconstructed domain works.(figure1)
Figure1: Standardzing of domains
At the same time, we try to exchange position of domain with the same function. We exchange the domain KR and ACP and insert the didomain DH+ER into different module to know whether our standardized domains works[8].(figure2)
Figure2: Repositioning and insert of domain inside module.
Thirdly, we obtain the loading module from diffenent organisms.
Loading module is the first module in polyketide synthase that recognize the starter unit of the polyketide chain and initiates the polyketide synthesis[9]. It include at least two domains that AT and ACP. Some loading modules may contain KS. The loading module influences the efficience of polyketide synthesis as it start the synthesis process.
We choose loading module of PKS of pyoluteorin[10] and amphotericin[11]. Erythromycin’s starter unit is propionyl-CoA and The starter unit of Amphotericin are acetyl-CoA. (Figure3)
Figure3: Exchange of loading module
Starter unit of Pyoluteorin in two PKS database is different that malonyl-CoA in ASMPKS and acetyl-CoA in MAPSI. We compare the efficience of that loading module between two concentration of substrates.
The loading module of Amphotericin contain an redundant domain DH that can’t modify the starter unit or any other polyketide unit[11"

After a successful test reaction at 10uL, we repeated our linearization PCR with a volume of 50uL. Our confirmation gel indicated a successful linearization, although some of the sample streaked above the 10 kb ladder.
We then attempted a transformation of our new chemicompetent Y. lipolytica using our control D17 plasmid. Our transformant cells were then incubated in liquid selective media for outgrowth. We also attempted a transformation of our linearized PCR product from the 50 uL reaction, but later realized that the linearized plasmid was unfit for expression of any genes at this point and so the transformation plate was discarded.
Created YNB+CSM-Leu medium (leucine-deficient) and YNBcasa (uracil-deficient) medium. Attempted to transform Y. lipolytica with pXRL2, ultimately to test if we can miniprep yeast with our protocol. Unfortunately there was no obvious yeast growth on the transformation plates.

Thesis week is upon us! This time around, we struggled a lot less to work as a group and write as a group. The early organization probably helped. We turned in a much more cohesive paper.
We received an invitation to speak at TEDx! This is exciting. We get to tell people about our project, but we also get to bring more attention to the unmet need for modern contraceptives! Our team is really happy about the opportunity to present on such a large platform.
In lab, we had some successful yeast and bacteria transformations, some successful Gibsons, and confirmed Y. lipolytica’s antibiotic resistance.
We also finally received IRB exemption for our questionnaires! This means we can now officially use our questionnaires to gather information about the women who may not have adequate access to modern contraceptives.
After outgrowth in liquid selective media, our cultures repeatedly failed to show colonies when plated on selective media. In order to address this, we redid our protocol for making chemicompetent Y. lipolytica cells after performing a final plating with the last of our transformant cell stock. We also performed transformations to reamplify our D17 plasmid in anticipation"

No matter how expensive the medicine is and how uncomfortable and inconvenient he feels, they cannot choose to reject taking it in order to keep alive. Thus, many patients get accustomed to this method and complain less. It is the one example after another that lets us know how fragile life can be, how incapable current technology can be, and how long the way we should spare no efforts to go.
As for our project, due to their education background, most patients we interviewed have no idea what synthetic biology and what gene therapy are. They even never consider the safety of their therapeutic regimens being used now. They just follow the doctors’ instructions because they don’t want to take more risks. It is okay for them to keep alive so some of them hold negative attitudes towards our idea. While there are still a lot of patients in favor of our research, and hope we can make it. They really hope that a painless, safe, high-performance, and safe therapy can replace the current method. More importantly, we believe that as researchers, we are supposed to shoulder the responsibilities of raising the public awareness about individual health, safety of treatment and social justice."

There are some ways to fight against the antibiotic resistance, such as restricted politics [1]. As a researcher, one effective way is to produce more new antibiotics. However, the new antibiotics development is virtually empty [2]. Fortunately, some researches showed that antibiotics can be synthesized by using synthetic biology methods. Relationship between antibiotics and polyketide, as well as its mechanism of synthesis show us an approach to solve this problem[3].
2.Our goal: Programmed synthesis of polyketide.
Polyketides are a large family of compounds that represent a wide range of pharmacological effect [4]. And polyketides can be the precursor of many antibiotics. The natural antibiotics such as erythromycin and vancomycin are all the downstream products of polyketides[5]. Polyketides are synthesized by polykeyide synthase (PKS). They are structurally complicated because of the complication of modular PKS. Combining the modularity of PKS and synthetic biology’s principle, we can standardize the PKS and assemble them just like LEGO blocks [6]. In this way, many different assembly lead to various polyketides, which provide a wide range of compounds with biological activities to search for new antibiotics[7]. Our team tried to standardize domains and “programme” PKSs to synthesize custom polyketide. By synthesizing new polyketides, we can help to discover and screen new antibiotics[8][9].
3.Introduction of PKS
PKS is the assemble line of polyketide. PKS are very complicated that contain several kinds of domain in one module. Each module catalyst to extend,modified or terminated the polyketide chain. The PKS we choose is type I PKS,which is highly modular. The modularity of type I PKS are reflected in three aspect. First, the gene cluster of type I PKS are modular that each enzyme corresponds to the unique sequence of gene cluster. Second, each enzyme of PKS has only one function. Third, the process of polyketide synthsis are modular that each module modify one unit of polyketide chain[3].
3.1. PKS: The Domain
PKS is the assemble line of polyketide. PKSs are so complicated that each PKS is composed of a number of modules which contain several kinds of domains[10]. Each module has catalysed functions for extending, modifying or terminating the polyketide chain. The PKS we choose is type I PKS, which is highly modular. The modularity of type"

Also, it can simultaneously detect and differentiate Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus and S. aureus from a positive result (blood culture). Currently under development are additional specimen claims – nasal and wound samples. Nasal claim will be able to determine colonization status and the wound claim will add to the rapid identification of positively infected patients. Obtaining positive results in a timely fashion aids clinicians in the prevention and control of infections.
Method
Specimen is prepared by transferring an aliquot of positive blood culture into a buffer team and then vortexed at high speed.
Cell suspension is lysed (via vortex and centrifuge) and heated. Then the lysis is cooled. Molecular reagents are reconstituted and the sample undergoes PCR. Results are obtained in about 1 hour.

Genotype MRSA uses DNA Strip Technology to identify both S. aureus and S. epidermidis cultures. Therefore, coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci are differentiated. Simultaenously, the product can also detect Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus and S. aureus , which is incredibly important for therapeutic purposes. The test is performed from an overnight culture and guarantees results in only 4 hours.
Method
Culture is isolated from a sample or a primary culture is used.
DNA is extracted via methods producing amplifiable DNA from bacteria (for example     QIAamp DNA Mini Kit from Qiagen).
Nucleic acids are selectively replicated in an amplification reaction. In the next step, the amplicons are chemically denatured, since detection on the DNA•STRIP® is done using single-stranded DNA. During the conjugate reaction, the specifically bound amplicon is marked with the enzyme alkaline phosphatase and is then made visible in a colorimetric detection reaction. In this way, a specific banding pattern develops on the DNA•STRIP®. Using a test-specific evaluation template, the test result can be read out quickly and clearly.

With more senses being touched, it is easier to leave a clear message in people. This way we hope to use the internet as a mayor communication platform, where users from around the world can learn about biotechnology while they have fun.
We first gave a series of informational sessions in several high-schools of our city. Synthetic biology was presented as a very versatile tool which could help anyone create new solutions for existing problems. iGEM was discussed as very important part of biotechnology, the relevance of a global competition, where students from all around the world applied their knowledge in a effort to improve the status quo of millions of people.
During the workshops, we introduced the students to the Parts Registry and explained them the way it operates. We also taught them briefly how can they search for parts they need and how can they add their own.
Workshop #1 (August 4th, 2012)
What is the material and equipment of a Lab and how to use it?  The objective of this workshop was to introduce the team, our projects, give a very complete definition of Synthetic Biology, a description of the iGem competition and introduction to some basic protocols and equipment used in the Lab. We agreed in this first session students should become familiar with the facilities, equipment and laboratory instruments and for their introduction to practical protocols they learned to prepare growth medium (LB) and use a micropipette. There were a lot of questions and interest from the students who were more than happy to learn how to participate in the workshop.
Workshop #2 (August 21st, 2012): Bacterial DNA: Purification of Plasmid DNA (Miniprep)
This workshop had as a goal to share with the students one of the most basic and used protocols in the development of a Synthetic Biology project, the purification of plasmid DNA. In order to do this, we gave a clear explanation of the principles of bacterial DNA, the differences between genomic and plasmid DNA with the basis of their extraction and purification. They integrated teams and purified plasmid DNA (pUC19) from Top10F E.coli.
Workshop #3 (September 13th, 2012): Karyotype and Chromosomes

Paris_Saclay,2014,Team:Paris Saclay#Ethics#Round Table_-_-_TEXT.html,"? Is one of these two aspects more visible than the other? For instance, if the scientific aspect is more visible, we may miss the artistic trait, and only think that it is a scientific work. Thus, could someone be a scientist as well as an artist? Are the two titles compatible? We thought that artistic and scientific traits could coexist together in a person; however, according to the background of the person, one aspect may prevail over the other.  Art is also a way to report uncommon practices and to raise questions about established facts. Science allows to bring a different perepecive to the artist in order to deliver their message.
Media in art is already very diverse: blackboard, stone, body expression… Thanks to biology a new medium appears: living beings.
Biology
However, can we define precisely what a living being really is? Synthetic biology raises this question. Is there a limit to tinkering with nature? We realized that we did not share the same definition of life. For some of us, a living organism is something that is able to reproduce itself. However, a computer program could also reproduce itself. Would it therefore be a living thing as well?
For example a lot of grains (such as corn and wheat) belong to cultivars that are selected by humans according to their advantages: yield, resistance to pests… but we do not call them GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms)! Whenever someone alters the genome, their responsibility is very important because there is no fundamental difference between making a hybrid and making a GMO. If there is a human desire to create a certain cultivar, it may be just a more time-consuming version of a genetic modification made directly in the laboratory.
Recently we have been introduced to some GMOs such as:
Alba rabbit from Eduardo Kac (Febrary 2000). The use of fluorescence is innovative.
Plant from Eduardo Kac (2003-2008). This hybrid plant comes from the cross between human and plant DNA.
Human bio-art with Marion Laval-Jeantet’s work. Indeed, she transfused horse’s blood in order to test “limits of the embodied conscious”.
Basis of art
An important question must be raised: Is the use of animals in art considered as animal abuse? Is the animal’s pain the only criterion that we should consider when we use animals in art? We believe that it should not be the only one, but it should be primordial for the decision and should be very well questioned. After all, it is the artist’s choice and they should justify their choice to use living beings in their"

Collaborations
As we all know, iGEM is a team competition. It needs us not only to work in our own team, but also to cooperate with other teams. This year, ZJUT-China has cooperated with Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing Normal University, Zhejiang University and the Chinese University of Hong Kong in different degrees of all wet experiments, modeling and human practice. In the process of working with other schools, we constantly improved our own project and helped with other teams’ projects.
BNU-China
On April 1, 2018, we came to Beijing Normal University to communicate with BNU-China. We shared experience in project innovation and team management. BNU has given us a lot of valuable advice. In addition, we are actively seeking collaboration on projects. Fortunately, this year's BNU-China’s project wants to achieve a self-enrichment system that replaces traditional antibiotic screening to reduce the use of antibiotics. And our project is working on solving the problem of superbugs. So we found the opportunity to collaborate. In order to make the government and the public aware that biology lab may exacerbate issue on superbug, we have jointly drafted a manifesto calling on the government and the public to pay attention to biosafety issues and improve relevant laws. It is hoped that through our efforts, the current status of bacterial resistance will be changed.
BIT
On May 31, 2018, we came to Beijing Institute of Technology to communicate with BIT. During the meet-up, we shared experience in team member selection, team management, modeling, and experimental skills training. This is very helpful for us who have only one-year's experience of iGEM competition. In addition, we have established long-term online contact to discuss issues we encountered during the competition.       BIT also gave us a lot help in the process of perfecting our project. In order to improve the performance of our light-controlled system, BIT presented us a plasmid containing BBa_K2305016 after we actively discussed problems with them. We applied this part to our light control system and made a positive attempt to improve our parts/project.

Fudan-CHINA is collecting interesting and impressive reasons for failed experiments. A brochure will be designed, printed and handed our at Giant Jamboree to share these interesting experiences. Here are some experience from our team members:         Xiaoyu Yang: The first time I pure protein. After centrifugation at 18000rpm, the suspension with protein was directly poured away as a bacterial solution by us. This behavior directly led to our three-day useless working. After awakening, we went to the 4℃ cold storage to “cold” down.         Muchan Gao: When I added the last buffer WB of the plasmid, when we were happy, we dumped the centrifuged liquid.         Wenzhong Teng: Do you know how to dye protein gel? Yes, boil it with coomassie blue R250 for about 5 minutes. But do you know how to make a gel hard enough to knock out sound on plastic? Just boiled it until water evaporated and you will get one!
With these impressive experiences, we hope every one of us can be more careful about labs and find more interests in iGEM competition and synthetic biology."

Modelling
The goal of our modelling is to help our team get a better understanding of what our system and protein does.
We modeled in MATLAB using SimBiology.
We modelled both translation and transcription rates to get the protein amount for the overnight cultures we tested in our spectrophotometry lab.
To do this we made the model in figure 1, using rates from the 2017 Ediburgh_UG team (https://2017.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh_UG/Model.) and pSB1C3 copy number from the iGEM registry http://parts.igem.org/Part:pSB1C3 .
Our results showed that we got approximately 1x1011 proteins in the final sample.
This result is based on the absorbance values in the spectrophotometry lab for the nitrophenyl octanoate (0.75 in 1500 seconds) as well as the reference from Gupta et. al. (2014). This was converted to a 40µM concentration of 4-nitrophenyl octanoate, which is 3.13x1016 4-nitrophenyl octanoate molecules in our system.
This gave us a reaction rate of approximately 208 4-nitrophenyl octanoate molecules produced per second.

Communications and meet-up
Because it’s the first year for us to take part in iGEM, we were quite unfamiliar with the progress, and about how to choose a project and how to organize a team. We invited NPU-China to guide us from the beginning of the process.
XJTU-China, NPU-China, and NWU-China held the first iGEM meet-up in north-wets session of China. We shared our projects with each other, and the other two teams shared their experiences with iGEM with us. We keep communicating on the WeChat with all kinds of problem.
XJTU-China’s aid for conducting DNA Time Capsule
We helped them contact Mawu Primary School in Xi'an, enabling their DNA Time Capsule activity to be implemented smoothly.
Standardizations of parts
Problems occurred while NPU-China tried to construct the plasmid. They failed to ligate 5 fragment onto the vector pSB1C3. So we offered help and successfully construct the plasmid.                 The electrophoretogram are as shown below.
OUC_China

Lastly, we responded to all stakeholder input by making a value sensitive design by which we managed to answer all needs and preferences of our stakeholders to come to an optimal method.
1. Anticipation
As a first stage in Responsible Research and Innovation we focussed on addressing the need for gene doping detection as well as on making an assessment of the challenges constituting gene doping with respect to the future.
1.1 Relevance of Gene Doping Detection
Due to a lack of an implemented detection method it is hard to assess whether gene doping is currently happening. We can say now however that it is a more eminent threat than you might have expected.
Gene doping is a real problem. As the science improves the usage will expand. Testing is going to have an impact, in lots of diverse ways. This group have expertise and are willing to engage in transparent, open debate. I think @wada_ama and many others should talk to them. https://t.co/zrO6GQFSVz
— Paul Dimeo (@pauldimeo2) August 30, 2018
In the timeline in figure 1 some of the most prominent events in gene doping development are sorted in time and as it appears gene doping might already be happening.
Figure 1. Timeline of gene doping use and development in society.
Timeline
2003: Genedoping
The World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) puts gene doping on the list of prohibited substances.
2004: Marathon mice
Geneticists at Howard Highes Medical Institute engineered so-called marathon mice that could run twice as far as normal mice by changing only a single gene, PPARdelta. ( Wang et al. 2004 )
2006: German Coach (Thomas Springstein) Suspected of Genetic Doping.
Thomas Springstein was a one-time coach of the German Athletics Association (DLV). He was convicted partly based on e-mail conversations, which were aquired by the police during a raid on his home. These e-mails brought up references to Repoxygen, a banned substance meant to be used in gene therapy to treat patients with anemia. Repoxygen helps to induce a controlled release of erythropoietin (EPO), a substance that stimulates the production of red blood cells, thereby increasing the amount of oxygen the blood can deliver to the muscles. It was under preclinical development by Oxford Biomedica as a possible treatment for anaemia but was abandoned in 2003. ( Michael Reinsch, 28 January 2006 ).

Six hours of incubation at 37℃, 200 rpm
1000 µl of the 6 hour time point culture was pipetted into an eppendorf tube and kept on ice until further use in a box with ice at 4℃.
100 µl of these cell cultures were transferred into wells of a 96-microtiter plate.
However, while analyzing our results, we realized that we did not set the ‘gain’ setting for fluorescence measurement in the plate reader to a fixed number across the different measurements. Therefore, we need to repeat this measurement.
Aim Correlate OD600 measurements in our plate reader to colony forming units (CFU)
We first diluted the overnight cultures of the negative and positive control 1:8 and measured OD600 in our plate reader. We then further diluted these cultures to target OD600 0.1, confirmed by our plate reader and plated onto plates in several dilutions.
Aim Calibration experiments for the Interlab study
LUDOX, silica beads and fluorescein experiments as described on our interlab page were also performed. As described above, the fluorescein calibration needs to be repeated.
The exact protocol can be found here and the results of these experiments can be found on our Interlab page .

East_Chapel_Hill,2017,Team:East Chapel Hill#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," the agar to allow growth of ΔcrcB, we plated WT and ΔcrcB together, and one without WT. All plates had either no buffer, or 20mM/50mM of MES (pH 6.5, slightly acidic), or 50mM of TRIS at pH 8 (slightly basic). All plates had 1mM fluoride.
In this experiment, we show the role of pH contributes to fluoride toxicity. When we grew ΔcrcB on pH 8 in 1mM fluoride we saw robust growth regardless of the presence of Wild Type because fluoride is not entering the bacteria. On non-buffered plates our results mirrored our previous results, ΔcrcB can grow on high concentrations of Fluoride only after the Wild-Type grows. When we buffered the plates with MES pH 6.5 we observed even more delayed growth of ΔcrcB compared to the unbuffered plates when grown next to Wild-Type, and this delay was dependent on the concentration of buffer. This results show the the Wild-Type are increasing the pH of the plate as they grow, thereby providing protection to the ΔcrcB on toxic concentrations of Fluoride.
A Colormetric Assay Using Phenol Red to Confirm Wild Type’s Effect on pH
July 29th, 2017
To confirm our hypothesis that Wild Type E. coli are increasing the pH of the agar plates, we prepared a similar set of plates, but with the pH indicator phenol red, for visual confirmation
Phenol red appears red at basic pH and turns yellow at acidic pH. In the absence of a buffer, wild type is able to alter the pH of the plate visibly turning it red. Accordingly, once the region of the plate where ∆crcB is plated turns red, the E. coli can grow.
To further confirm our results, we prepared the same plates with a MES buffer, which kept the agar at a 6.5 pH, which is slightly acidic.
Upon addition of the buffer, the change in pH was delayed, so fluoride could enter the cells and inhibit the growth of the ∆crcB strain.
Testing for Optimal Fluoride Levels and Dilutions for CHOP Growth
July 31st, 2017
CHOP and ∆crcB (E. coli with the Fluoride Channel deleted) were added to 50µg/mL chloramphenicol plates and observed over the course of 4 days.
The plates had increasing concentrations of F with CHOP and ∆crcB to determine the level of fluoride that leads to the greatest"
BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#EvelynNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," colonies showed a pink/red tint it was the best way to verify the results. As the robot did not pipet properly when we did restriction digest we added an extra amount to each plate.  The values for the final sample after the ligations were not still about 5 ul off.  However, when transforming with the alpha cells I had to use contaminated SOC which really affected the outcomes.  The manual sample and robot 1 sample worked.  However, while I was away the plasmid prep of the robots ligations was not saved.
8/1/2011-8/5/2011
After my vacation, the robot was up and ready to do a ligation.  I ligated BBa_J23101 and BBa_I14033(Pcat) manually and the robot did two trials with the same parts.  Unfortunately, when the total volume was measured the first robot trial had a total volume of 15.8ul and the second trial had a total volume of 7.7ul.  We believe the volume issues are due to bubbles while pipetting.  The ligations were then transformed and left overnight in a 37 degree incubator.  I then did a restriction digest on Pcat and BBa_J23100 as we were running low.  However, when it was run on a gel the pictures were inconclusive so I decided to do restriction mapping.  I did a single digest with Xbal and then a double digest with Xbal and PstI.  The restriction mapping proved that the ligation did in fact work.  The next day the ligations were still not pink and therefore it was necessary to leave it in the incubator longer.  It took about two days for the colonies on the plates to turn pinkish and therefore I decided to test a different promoter BBa_R0040(Ptet) before we moved forward with the robot ligations.  I also ligated Pcat in order to compare the two promoters.  After the transformations, it was obvious that Ptet was a better promoter for BBa_J23100.  The transformation for Ptet only needed about 18 hours while Pcat needed about 24 hours.

Especially the talks concerning co-cultures offered interesting insights like the research of Hannes Löwe from the TU Munich, who co-cultivated
Pseudomonas putida
and
Synechococcus elongatus
(cscB strain from Daniel Ducat) for efficient production of bioplastics. As we also wanted to take advantage of a sucrose over-producing cyanobacteria strain the research of Hannes Löwe showed us an optional product of our co-culture. In addition to that, we listened to talks which involved parts of our project. Therefore, we visited the talk of Katja Bettenbrock from MPI Magdeburg who used the Glf importer of
Zymomonas mobilis
in
Escherichia coli
and tested if the type and capacity of glucose transport influences succinate yield and productivity in two-phase cultivations. Since we use ´Glf as an exporter in
S. elongatus
, Katja Betterbrock’s talk showed us an interesting usage in
E. coli
.
At the Microbe Slam, we met the iGEM team of Hamburg. During this event, several students and researchers presented their work and combined it with poetry and humor. Jens Rudat from the institute of technology in Karlsruhe, who was the winner of this years’ Microbe Slam, explained what bacteria in space might have in common with caffeine, while Wael Yakti from Leibniz-institute of Vegetable and Ornamental Crops in Berlin narrated the epic battles of fungi in environmental co-cultures.
Since there were several companies at the congress, we approached them and talked about methods and products we could involve in our project. Macherey-Nagel gave us a huge variety of kits to isolate DNA from organisms that are hard to break down and Zymo research offered us kits for isolation of plasmid and genomic DNA from bacteria. Both were used to isolate genomic DNA to amplify specific genes in our project.
Additional to that, all of our advisors and our member who participated in the congress presented a poster concerning their latest research. Thus, Miriam presented the results of her bachelor thesis concerning toehold switches in cyanobacteria, Kai showed his latest outcome in unconventional secretion of

Propaganda of iGEM from Tianjin University
TUST-China is a new player in the iGEM game. In our school, iGEM was not widely known. Team iGEM-Tianjin came to help us propagate synthetic biology and iGEM game when we began to build a team. A lot of students came and they showed a strong interest in synthetic biology and iGEM. What surprised us was that not just students in the biology  college , many students of other colleges such as finance and law wanted to learn more about iGEM. The support of the students and the success of the meeting also gave us more confidence in iGEM.
Social Engagement
We are willing to introduce the advanced science to the public. Therefore, we went to a community near our campus, Shangdeyuan Housing Estate, and organized a workshop. People aged ranging 4 to 65 engaged our events and workshops to know more about synthetic biology.
The residents showed their curiosity about what synthetic biology is. Therefore, we introduced the biosynthetic products around us and the significance of genetically engineered organisms. Though they expressed concerns about genetically modified foods, we used vivid examples to dispel their wariness to some degree.
To evoke enthusiasm for science in children, we prepared several interesting experiments that were easy to carry out. To our surprise, children were quite into them. We also played games while educated them about knowledge of biology like making the cell model with the eraser, teaching them the structure of the cell, drawing DNA on a blackboard etc. Even though our activities had finished for a long time, people were reluctant to leave.
Education
TUST-China also went to Tianjin Haihe Middle School this summer and our instructor went with us. We interacted with the students and let them answer some questions. For example: ""Are you interested in biology?"" ""Has anyone ever heard of synthetic biology? Do you know it?"" ""Can you guess what is the main research in synthetic biology?"" The students are very positive to answer our questions"

We received 97 valid answers, and the statistic result can tell us something about people’s opinions.
In the general background part, all of our participants have heard of gene therapy before and believe it’s possible to cure OA through gene therapy. This result shows that the recognition of gene therapy in this group is relatively high.
When comparing gene therapy and traditional therapy, most students think treatment efficacy (87.6%) is the biggest advantage, and safety (97.9%), as we expected, is their biggest concern. Though all the students thought curing OA is possible, 35.1% of them agreed that the side-effects brought by gene therapy will be a more serious problem. When asked whether they will choose gene therapy if its cure rate is 2-3 times higher than traditional therapy with all other condition equaled, the answer is about 50%-50%. Because gene therapy is not mature now, they worry about potential safety risks.
As to opinion on safety issues, interruption of patient’s genome, risk of insertional mutagenesis or even carcinogenesis concerns the participants most(47.4%), followed by doubt on effects and control of the gene circuit(25.8%). To our surprise, the answer doesn’t show preference on E.coli or virus vectors(35.1% for E.coli and 34.0% for virus), and 30.9% of them think neither of vectors is safe in treating OA. We proposed several solutions to improve safety, 51.5% of them think replacing the virus vector or use non-integrated virus vector should be the first step. The other half agree on the importance of other factors such as quantity control and antigen removal, which we’re working on.
Conclusion
Back to top ↑
Nowadays the concept of gene therapy is promoted in public, though it’s still theoretically possible with a few successful cases. Safety risk is still the biggest problem, and people know that. In the strict sense, our project is not the typical gene therapy that corrects the abnormal gene; we combine synthetic biology with gene delivery and expression to generate curing effect—it’s more accurate to call it “therapy using genes”. However, we may face some same problems in authentic gene therapy, such as viral vector problem, tumorgenesis, and multigene disorders (specificity problem). Also, the regular problems of synthetic biology application may exist such as immune response and how to control the circuit. We come up with corresponding solutions to minimize safety risks and hope further advancement in this field could better our job.

We designed a novel toolbox to gain the complete control over all major functions of the peroxisome. The toolbox is our solution for improving the engineering workflow and predictability of synthetic constructs. Interested? Find out how.
Scientific background
The root problem
Synthetic biology is an engineering discipline. And while we are able to plan our constructs with tools like biobricks, a major difference to e.g. electrical engineering is that they are not nicely isolated on a chip, but surrounded by all types of interfering agents. One of the major issues regarding protein expression in a novel chassis is unwanted and unexpected crosstalk between engineered pathways and the native cellular processes of the production host. A further issue is toxicity of the products or intermediates of the pathway. Both can greatly change our system’s behaviour which in some cases leads us to having to trial-and-error find a solution, making our previously modeled optimization useless.
Our approach
The natural approach of organisms to deal with metabolic interference and toxic byproducts is subcellular compartmentalization. This has proven to be a functional solution in naturally occurring pathways in eukaryotes as well as new synthetic pathways for biotechnological application. Thus, the creation of a synthetic organelle presents a suitable strategy to increase the efficiency and yield of non-native pathways. A common approach is to build up artificial compartments from scratch. Many breakthroughs have been achieved in the last decade, however the creation of a fully synthetic compartment is yet a milestone to reach for. We on the contrary want to start by engineering artificial compartments through orthogonalization.
The peroxisome is the ideal starting candidate as it has many advantages over other compartments, including it being able to import fully folded proteins and not being essential in yeast under optimal growth conditions. Our project’s aim is to"

BioBricks are useful for us because we can look for required BioBrick parts from their registry and recombine genes easily. When we want to introduce many parts into one plasmid, however, we have to repeat the process; restrict enzyme digestion and ligation. It takes us too much time and sometimes we lose time for other experiments.
We want to reduce the time required for the recombination of genes and get time for verification of the expression and the effect of genes.
Golden Gate assembly is one of the ways to make it possible.
Some teams like 2011 WHU-China have used this assembly. But they didn't seem to spread Golden Gate Assembly through other iGEM teams. So, we created plasmid backbone parts ""BBa_K797013"" to make it easier to use Golden Gate assembly.
We also created software which designs primers for Golden Gate assembly.
What's Golden Gate Assembly
Golden Gate Assembly is developed by Carola Engler, Ramona Gruetzner, Romy Kandzia and Sylvestre Marillonnet.[2]
This method enables us to introduce plural gene segments into one plasmid all at once.
Fig.1 BsaI recognition sites.
Fig.2 irreversibe ligation
Fig.3 conventional method.
Fig.4 Golden Gate Assembly.
Golden Gate Assembly takes advantage of the characteristic restrict enzyme ""BsaI"".
Most restrict enzyme cuts its own recognition sites. But BsaI recognizes the sequence ""GGTCTC""(Figure 1) and cuts downstream of the recognition site as shown in the Figure 2. And BsaI activity is independent of the sequences of the downstream of the recognition site.
Restrict enzyme digestion and ligation are completed by just one PCR because once DNA is cut and ligated irreversibly, the recognition site of BsaI disappears. We create the"

B.Interview Report (With Patients)
During the summer vacation, we paid a visit to the In-patient Department of Cardiology Unit, Higher Education Mega Center Branch, Guangdong Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine three times. We interviewed tens of patients with the diversity of conditions and conducted a questionnaire investigation. We found that the three main methods were percutaneous coronary intervention, surgical coronary revascularization and medication, which are recognized internationally as standard therapeutic tools. However, none of them can help patients get rid of lifelong treatment. Although patients with the same disease are treated with the same plan, the levels of physical and mental tolerance and the clinical effect varies greatly from individual to individual. It is hard to say whether a therapy will come into effect.
We tried to promote the concept of synthetic biology and introduced our idea for the treatment of myocardial ischemia. Most of the patients did not have a chance to receive higher education, which makes them not very aware of our research. To our delight, a large quantity of the patients we interviewed show great interests and hope we can make it. Some of them even said they are willing to have a try if our therapy succeeds. More significantly, the experience of the therapy and how their life is affected are what can be told, and that still gave us different perspectives. Certain typical examples are as follows:
Mr. A
Gender: Male
Age: ~80
Disease: Myocardial ischemia , hypertension
Duration: ~15years
Therapeutic regimen: Surgical coronary revascularization , medication
The grandpa we interviewed is one of those who recover well after his operation in 2003. He has continued taking medicine since then. However, hypertension, a common complication of myocardial ischemia, was examined in 2013, so he had to change the drugs he used to take. And now his condition stabilizes. He could have convalesced at home and taken medicine on time, but he had to stay in hospital because he cannot be paid enough compensation from the Public Health Insurance if he is only treated at home. We also learned that the operation cannot cure patients’ disease, and it still relies on medication to extend the time of their physical deterioration. Many expensive imported medicines such as Plavix are not listed in the expense sheet, so only taking medicine has caused a huge financial pressure.
Moreover, the society is not justice as we expect, and many people don’t have any public or commercial health insurance. They cannot afford the overwhelming medical fee, so someone has no choice"

Week 1
looked at the correlations of the different feedback in the system. To see which parameter has the biggest influence on the system and which parameters could be changed to create subpopulations. Fixed bugs in the system with help of Ronald.
Week 2
With changing the parameters with the biggest correlation different populations can be generated. The LuxR production rate is changed to do so. However, this does not correlate to reality yet. Subpopulations are simulated, but further research is needed to create a system that can be tested in the lab.

Expand the old quorum sensing model to 100.000 parameter sets. This needed to run on the server because it took too long on a single computer. Because the server did not save the work properly it needed to be done a few times. So it took a full week to get results.

make the subpopulation system, write the equations and try to get the best parameter sets by searching for a statistical method that does so. For the quorum sensing system.  look at the quorum sensing system with and without feedback.
August
Week 1
Test changes in highest parameter from the quorum sensing system to see if there is a change in GFP production. This is both done for the system with and without negative feedback.
Week 2
Set up the subpopulation system and run it with a few parameter sets. When it worked I changed the concentrations in Arabinose and Glucose in the system. Had some bugs with putting different arabinose and glucose concentrations in the system. Remco helped me solve this.
Week 3
To set up a normal distribution for the quorum sensing part different methods are tried. fixing bugs when making the normal distributions. Plot the amount of GFP vs time. The subpopulation system ran on the server for a couple of days with 100.000 parameter sets. There is searched for the parameter set with the highest RFP, and also for the set with the lowest RFP.
Week 4
Parameter analysis with the best sets, got from the confidence interval. Put the models, quorum and subpopulations together. This did not work out the first time, but the second it did.
September
Week 1
plot normal distributions of the separate systems.
Week 2
look for differences in production of GFP by tweaking the parameters.  Chose the best sets to work with for the combined system. Found four sets that can give the responses we want.

He expressed much interest in our game, and got really high score. When we asked him, he said he had touched similar game before, and he made a positive comment on the edutainment form, which made us know that our process is beneficial.
Fig.7.The foreign friend is playing Bio2048.
With everybody’s suggestion and the high praise, we hoped our achievement would be taken into class, because the biology knowledge in game agreed with the contents in book and the students preferred the original class tools. We introduced our outcome to students and teachers who were glad to help us access application in class. Puyang lecture was the first time to take Bio2048 to class. Students had high enthusiasm to play our games. After that, we contacted with educational services to try the game in class.
Fig.8.Bio2048 in class.
STEP 03, Inspiration
During the period that we learned and thought about our project, we considered to take some actions to seek inspiration. We hold a lecture with UESTC-China in Puyang Junior High School. We introduced synthetic biology with some well-known examples at first. Then, it was time for the students to build their own plasmids. They added the functional genes like Bioluminescence gene into the plasmids. So the plasmids carried the information of the light emitting gene. “The plasmid carried the information of biological characteristics” inspired us: was DNA able to carry a wide variety of information? Along this idea, we explored the DNA information storage.
Fig.9.We are building the plasmids together.
When we were designing our software, we hoped the idea would come from the public. After all, the final software achievement will return to life. We did street interviews, from campus to market. We wanted to hear the voice of the public’s imagination to the DNA information storage system. In surprise, we received many useful information from the communication. A young man’s opinion left the deepest impression on us: he nearly had higher expectation for the storage capacity, equipment volume and storage speed. He had special interest in our project and gave us great help to decide the property and function of software.

Sometimes, we would be restricted in the knowledge we already have. In terms of creativity, we are far from children. To have a future blueprint of our project, we talked with pupils about the DNA information storage in the activity, “To Be Scientists Tomorrow”. They"

applied design
We have applied synthetic biology to solve a real problem in a completely new and different way from any other solutions available. First, Insubiota changes the production of insulin: the industrial production would be much easier, cheaper and sustainable. The current production of human insulin is done by heterologous production in E. coli: the A and B chains of insulin are produced separately, purified, joined by a chemical reaction and then the final product is ready, this makes the process more expensive and time-consuming.
Insubiota would change this method completely: the final product is a probiotic, in other words, the microrganism itself. That means that there's no need for expensive purification steps, you just need to grow the microrganism and lyophilize it to be used.
Second, Insubiota changes completely the insulin therapy: the person would not need to take several shots of insulin. Once lyophilized, the product can be mixed to a beverage or a food and be consumed. Once in the gut, the probiotic will start producing the required insulin according to glucose levels. This would be very useful and would improve the quality of life of many people that suffer with diabetes, specially children.
We have applied different concepts of synthetic biology, genetic engineering, molecular biology and microbiology to design a complete solution. Insubiota includes a glucose-responsive regulatory system based on small RNA; an insulin analog capable of being produced by bacteria and be absorbed by the intestinal cells; and a kill switch system based on the CRISPR-Cas9 regulated by light, all this in a probiotic chassis that was chosen to be the most suitable for insulin delivery.
Our name, Insubiota, comes from the words insulin and microbiota the two basis of our project and the two things that we wish to cause a complete change: the insulin therapy and production and the way we see microbiota.
chassis
The chassis choice is a very important step of our project design, not only because it has to respond positively to our genetic circuit, but mainly because it has to behave as a probiotic and cause no harm to its host"

However, the use of GMOs is now considered a possible solution to many of the issues currently impeding further space travel. For instance, NASA are currently exploring the use of genetically modified algae in integrated life support systems and the use of GMOs to synthesise useful materials for constructing and maintaining habitats is widely documented.
In order to facilitate the expansion of synthetic biology into the extra-terrestrial arena there would need to be a paradigm shift in the legal framework surrounding GMO use and reconsideration of the function of planetary protection laws. Comprehensive risk-benefit analysis would need to be undertaken in order to rework any legislation, compensating the risks of cross contamination with highly efficient life support systems and habitat creation. In this chapter we will examine the current regulations governing space exploration in order to understand the current scope for the use of GMOs extra-terrestrially and subsequently identify whether any changes would need to be made.
Regulations governing GMOs in Space with specific reference to Mars
Mars poses a unique risk when considering contamination. Life has yet to be found on Mars and as such we have no idea how it would interact with terrestrial organisms or even if it uses DNA as genetic material. As such it could pose a unique danger to human life as is often popularised in the media. However terrestrial life could also pose a unique threat to it, our highly sophisticated immune defence systems and the array of microorganisms we bring with us could feasibly completely outcompete any life that there is on Mars. This could deprive us of the opportunity to study a completely new tree of life and answer questions on how life originally formed on our own planet.
The laws governing exploration of outer space were set out in the United Nations Outer Space Treaty of 1967 and set out the framework from which more recent regulations have expanded upon (UNOOSA, 2018). Key to our report are the principles stating that
'States shall be responsible for national space activities whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities'
'States shall be liable for damage caused by their space objects'
'States shall avoid harmful contamination of space and celestial bodies.
These three principles determine that any GMOs employed in space are the responsibility of the State which deploys them, regardless of whether it is a commercial or a governmental expedition. Any damage caused by GMOs are the responsibility of the State, COSPAR (The committee on space research council) has expanded this to include potential damage to native life on foreign bodies (COSPAR, 2008).

Considering the  requirements of our project, Bacillus  subtilis, a Gram-positive model organism in lab study, is chosen to be the  chassis in our project. Its ideality can be illustrated in the following  aspects:
Safety
Safety issues concerning synthetic biology are always challenged, especially when it comes to the area of medical treatment. From bacteria  hosts to biowastes, the public has never ceased to raise worries. To ease concerns from the public, researchers try their  best to minimize biohazards involved in every step of their experiments. Regarding safety  issues, we, 2012 HKUST iGEM team, therefore chose to use B. subtilis, a non-pathogenic chassis.
Low degree of  virulence:
Inhabiting gut as a part normal flora, Bacillus subtilis is considered to be a  non-pathogenic organism to human. Rarely has infection case in human been  revealed resulting from B. subtilis. According  to Edberg (Edberg 1991), B. subtilis does  not produce significant quantities of extracellular enzymes or possess other  virulence factors that would predispose it to cause infection. In the other  word, B. subtilis possess low virulence to human and presents low risk of  adverse effects to human health.  
Establishment of  Integration vectors:
The discovery of natural integration  in Bacillus subtilis raised great  attention in the field of molecular genetics in 1978. Due to its natural  integration, a series of integration vectors for B. subtilis were designed later for different purposes. In our  project, we employed an integration vector not only because of its stability in B. subtilis but also because of its  advantage in safety. The employment of integration vector to some extent  minimizes the risk of antibiotic"

China - Communist Government/Market Economy with high public investment in industry
The major insulin manufacturers hold the majority of the market share in China; ""Due to technical barriers, China’s insulin market is mainly occupied by Novo Nordisk, Sanofi and Eli Lilly, of which, Novo Nordisk accounted for 60.3% in 2012.""[17] In 2013, China had 114 million people with diabetes - the most in the world. This number is ever increasing, due to improved awareness and diagnosis as well as changing lifestyle habits. The chinese government and industry are working quickly to nationalise their insulin production. Current projects include:[18]
Tonghua Dongbao Pharmaceutical - 367.2 million yuan ($59.21 million) to build a new 44,000-square-meter facility.
China's Zhuhai United Laboratories said in 2011 that it planned to invest ¥1 billion ($151.4 million) in a new insulin plant that would provide for 10% of the country's insulin market.
In addition, foreign investment in China’s API market continues to grow;[18]
Eli Lilly spent $350 million to expand its insulin cartridge manufacturing in China.

Product Design
By utilizing effectively extensive feedback from experts and after numerous iterative circles, our team developed a versatile, innovative solution to detoxify wastewater from active pharmaceutical substances, Biotic Blue. Aquatic pharmaceutical pollution is a looming problem which accelerates antibiotic resistance and causes adverse ecotoxic effects on marine ecosystems. The main source of pharmaceuticals ending up in the water is human consumption, an inescapable activity for our well-being. The key to limit or even prevent pharmaceutical pollution is to detoxify wastewater from pharmaceuticals before released to rivers or the sea. Solutions for treating wastewater from pharmaceuticals exist, but their adoption is either still posing threats to the environment or it’s too costly. To come over these barriers, we developed Biotic Blue, an enzyme-based solution for degrading pharmaceuticals. What makes Biotic Blue unique, is the fact that it can be implemented before the biological treatment stage in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Implementing it at this treatment point prevents the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, inhabiting the activated sludge. Sulfamethoxazole-free water leaves the WWTPs and does not pose an ecotoxic threat to the aquatic environment when released. The immobilization of our mutant enzyme on magnetic beads and the smart employment of a magnet makes Biotic Blue energy efficient and cost-effective. However, the greatest potential of Biotic Blue to be broadly adopted by WWTPs lies in its capability to embed a combination of immobilized enzymes, enabling it to purify wastewater from a mixture of pharmaceuticals.
Problem Description
Over the past years, global consumption of pharmaceuticals has been on the rise. This will continue to increase as lifespan increases, boosting chronic and age-related diseases [1]. The majority of these pharmaceuticals end up in the aquatic environment after their usage, either in their initial biological active form or as metabolites. Indicatively, between 30 and 90% of orally consumed pharmaceuticals are excreted in the urine as active substances and end up in the water reservoirs after they pass through the sewage system [2].
Pharmaceutical usage in veterinary activities, such as factory farms, aquacultures and pet treatment, contributes to aquatic pharmaceutical pollution. However, this usage is not considered to be the primary source route. Neither is the improper disposal of unused or expired pharmaceuticals, which are flashed down or poured in the drain, or residues leaking from pharmaceutical manufacturing [3],[4]. Excretion of active pharmaceutical substances after human usage is documented to be the primary source of pharmaceuticals in"

Trigger RNA-Toehold-GFP System
We aimed to show Toehold switch system’s incapability of protein expression when it is alone, which means the Trigger RNA and Toehold Switch must coexist  for protein expression. To observe  Toehold swtich’s and and Toehold Swtich-Trigger RNA’s coexisting results both, we designed Toehold switch and trigger RNA in different biobricks. Because of origin incompatibility process, we had to clone these two different gene sequences into different plasmids. Thus we cloned Toehold-GFP into ColA originated PColA plasmid, and Trigger RNA into ColE originated PSB1C3 plasmid.
The ordered form of Toehold G-blocks is shown above. We preferred to use T7 promoter, which is a very strong promoter in this gene’s design. Thus there won’t be any difficulty in Toehold-GFP RNA’s production. The RBS of GFP presented in Toehold structure. To clone Toehold-GFP sequence into PSB2C3 and pColA plasmids both, we added RFC 10 suffix region on 3’ end and RFC 10 prefix region  on 5’ end of Toehold-GFP. We also put BamHI restriction sitebetween Toehold and GFP. After GFP expression, which shows that Toehold-trigger system works, any protein could be replaced with GFP.  In our project, GFP will be replaced with TEV protease.
Trigger RNA, which turns on Toehold switch system, is shown above in its ordered form as G-Blocks. In the design of this biobrick, we used T7 promoter, which has a strong mRNA production rate. By doing these, an enough amount of Trigger RNA will be produced to open Toeholds. There is no RBS in this product, because Trigger RNA doesn’t codes a protein. Its only task is opening Toehold switch in order to produce protein. To clone Trigger RNA sequence into PSB1C3 plasmid, we added RFC10 prefix on 3’ end and RFC10 suffix on 5’ end.

We plot the transfer function as in experiment data processing. Tune the parameters and the model is feasible.
Outlook
Exactly，all of the experiments we have done is to improve the channel capacity and reduce the disturbance from the noise at the same time. Anyway our final target is to make sure that we can transfer more information when the environment is noisy. Our team focuses on comparing performance between two ways to get fluorescent protein (EBFP), namely, to express the protein directly from the gene, or to independently express two proteins and let them assembly afterwards to become the same protein as the one in the first way. Beside analyzing the experimental data by calculating channel capacity of two systems we wanted to know if there are any difference between two circuits in amplifying the inputs or responding to the noise. And we also want to know which frequency of noise makes our circuit worse and which signal-to-noise ratio may have a higher channel capacity?
So we have these simulations first and we will conduct more experiments to collect data and confirm our conclusion.

Our project is about information flowing through gene-regulatory networks and it contains both theory of information and biology. The human practice we did fit our project very well. We show the students who have no idea about what synthetic biology is the fun it have and also make the cross subjects knew by more people. We all think we have did a meaningful practice and help promote development of the cross subjects which is also the aim of iGEM. In a word, human practice gives us a chance to tell more people about our idea and the makes more people realize the charm of synthetic biology.

IvyTech_SouthBend_IN,2014,Team:IvyTech SouthBend IN#progress_-_-_TEXT.html," bake on a hot plate is performed on the wafer (after the photoresist was spun on) to remove any solvents and harden the photoresist.  The wafer’s soft bake is started at 65° C and after three minutes the hot plate temperature is raised to 95° C for an additional seven minutes of baking.
We then performed a post exposure bake for 1min at 65 ° C then raised the hot plate to 95 ° C for additional 3 minutes. After PEB the wafer is developed by placing it in a bath of developer and gently swirled for five minutes to develop the pattern in each wafer.  The wafers are removed from the bath, rinsed with isopropanol and air dried.  The wafers are then brought back down to the nanotech lab and images are taken of them with the optical microscope. We the measured the thickness on the profilometer and found we hit our mark at 80,162 Å .
The procedure we used came from a microfluidics nanotechnology negative lithography lab. In preparing the wafers they are cleaned with acetone, isopropanol, deionized water and dried with an air can. The wafers go through a dehydration bake on a hot plate at 110° C for three to four minutes to remove any residual liquids. A HMDS application is performed on the wafers to improve photoresist adhesion to the wafer substrate. HMDS is applied to the wafers by putting them into a sealed but non-vacuumed chamber with an open bottle of HDMS for 15 minutes.  After removal from the chamber the wafers go through another dehydration bake on a hot plate for 15 seconds at 110° C.
Week of 10/5/14 through 10/11/14
This week we began work on the nanotechnology aspects of our project. The main focus was working on the microfluidic channel, the volume of space that is going to hold the water sample while the biochemical reaction for beta-galactosidase is taking place. We used negative lithography to cast a master mold of a chamber we designed and thought would be best suited for our device. After the mold was cast and sent through numerous bake sessions, it was inspected and determined to be an acceptable mold. We then made a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mixture with a 10:1 ratio with a curing agent. After pouring it into the mold, great care was taken to ensure there were no bubbles"

Single Cell ODE Model for the Recombination Module
1 Overview
The ﬁnal module in our construct is the Recombination module. In this module, we use Cre recombinase to separate the         origin of replication from the rest of the plasmid. Plasmids whose origin of replication has been recombined out         are referred to as ”knocked out” plasmids.
In our model, we seek to model the knockout eﬃciency after some set amount of time has elapsed since the introduction         of Cre recombinase into the cell culture, which we deﬁne as
. That is, it         is the proportion of plasmids whose origin of replication is knocked out from the original set of plasmids. Here, we         start the simulation with Cre being constitutively produced from the Time Delay module at the same concentration.
The system of reactions generally follow the analysis of Cre recombinase in [1] and can be visualized as in the diagram         below.
In the construct, there are two lox sites on the plasmid which ﬂank the origin of replication. When both lox sites         are bound to two Cre molecules, the plasmid (S) can undergo recombination where the plasmid is cut and separates         into two plasmids (P1, P2), in which one has the origin of replication and the other does not.
As shown in the diagram above, the binding of Cre to the lox sites can be in diﬀerent orders. Notably, the binding         of Cre to molecules to a lox site is cooperative, meaning that the binding of the second Cre to a lox site is made         more favorable when the ﬁrst Cre has already bound to that site.
Once there are four Cre molecules on the same plasmid, the Cre recombinase can catalyze a recombination reaction to         produce a recombined product"
Illinois,2009,Team:Illinois-Tools#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," Consumption
This weight minimizes the number of reactions that have ATP as a reactant.  This allows for a more natural flow of events through the pathway. A pathway that consumes large amounts of ATP would be impractical because organisms can only produce a limited amount of ATP.
Known Enzyme Data
Using this weight limits the number of reactions which do not have enzyme data listed in the KEGG database. Synthetic biology requires that the enzyme and gene data for the reaction is known. If we do not know that information, then we can’t synthetically create a pathway.
Fewest Changes to Host
When creating a new metabolic pathway, it is important to consider the host in which the organism exists. This weight allows for the fewest changes to the host organism. For example, if the host organism is e.coli, and the fewest changes to host organism constraints is heavily weighted, the program will choose as many pathways that already exist in e.coli as possible in order to get from input to output compound.
Node Order
This constraint limits the number of nodes that are highly connected. Ideally, we don’t want compounds such as water and ATP, which are in many reactions, appearing in our pathway as primary compounds from the input to the output. By weighting this heavily, a scientist will be able to narrow down the final pathway faster.
When using the program, the user can define up to six different inputs.  A dot product of these six inputs against six parameters defined by the program will be used to check each edge of the matrix while assigning the weights.  The six parameters defined by the program include:
1) number of reactants
2) number of products
3) net positive ATP consumption
4) a 1 if there is no enzyme used, a 0 if there are enzymes used
5) a 1 if its not in organism, a 0 if within organism
6) 1 for node order.
Algorithm
The algorithm we used is the bidirectional dikstra. We took this algorithm from graph theory to handle our large data set. The weights are assigned based on the user-defined parameters. This determines the ""length"" of the edge. Essentially, this algorithm branches out from both the starting and ending compound taking the smallest step possible after calculating the weight of all possible next steps. When the two paths connect you have found the ideal pathway. Although there can be multiple minimal pathways of equal weight, this algorithm guarantees a minimal total weighted pathway between the compounds.
Results
Depending on whether the user specified 1 or 3 pathways, IMPtools will generate and display the top pathway(s"
