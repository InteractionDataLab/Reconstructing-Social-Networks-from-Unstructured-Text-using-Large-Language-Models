by plane
Amsterdam can be reached by plane through Schiphol Airport, with connections to all main airports in the world. There are very frequent and direct train connections from the airport to:
“Amsterdam Zuid” railway station, the railway station to reach VU University. Travel duration is 7 min.
“Amsterdam Centraal Station”, the railway station to reach the city centre. Travel duration is approximately 15-20 min.
Train tickets can be bought at Schiphol airport from the yellow ticket machines near the platforms at Schiphol Plaza. Tickets are also available from the ticket offices, which are situated close to the red/white-checked cube at Schiphol Plaza. Staff at the ticket offices will also be able to provide you with train departure information. From these railway stations it should not be too difficult to get to your hotel by tram, metro or bus.
You can plan your trip in advance on the website of the public transport company in Amsterdam (GVB) , or on the journeyplanner website 9292 . For only train travel,use ns.nl
Be careful when going by taxi to and from Schiphol. Some drivers do not like to make short trips. Our experience with taxis from Connexxion is generally positive. This company also runs a hotel shuttle service .
by train
Amsterdam Central Station has intercity and high speed connections to mainland European cities and to London. Schedule information and booking via nshighspeed.nl .
by car
By far the best option to reach Amsterdam by car is to use “Park & Ride” facilities, i.e. drive to a secured parking site in the outskirts of Amsterdam and travel by public transport to your hotel or campus.
Watch out: Except for parking at the [P+R] facilities, parking anywhere else in Amsterdam is surprisingly expensive! And parking violations have extremely annoying and expensive consequences: fines are high and your car may be towed away, costing additionally EUR 150.-.
Getting around in Amsterdam
Students can get around Amsterdam by public transport, or by using a rented bike. Public transport and bikes are the main and quickest means of transport in Amsterdam.
Public Transport
Public transport in Amsterdam is run by the GVB, the public transport company in Amsterdam. Several types of tickets are available. For example, a ticket valid for 2 days, giving unlimited access to public transport (tram, metro and bus"

Part4: THU-E Sweet Pressure Part
This is a plasmid  providing selection pressure for the evolution and enrichment of tryptophan  overproduction microorganism phenotype by glucose utilization.The selection  pressure was based on the tryptophan dependent maltose  hydrolase expression which functioned in a maltose-sole carbon source culture  condition. It is achieved by cloning E.  Coli maltose hydrolase gene (malQ)  downstream of our previously constructed tryptophan biosensor which is controlled  by the strict araBAD promoter in amalQdeletion  strain E. Coli JW3379.A random ribosome binding sequence (RBS) library upstream  of malQwere constructed. 48 strains  from the library were selectedbased onthe growth difference between maltose and  glucose M9 minimal culture condition. Strain 3-4 with the RBS sequence“AAAAAAATGTGCT”  was selected and named after sweet pressure part strain.
The  performance of the sweet pressure part strain 3-4 was further measured in a  tryptophan addition fashion. The colony from LB agar plate was picked up and  cultured in M9 medium with 8g/L glucose for overnight. On the next day, seed  medium was transferred to fresh M9 medium in 24 well plate with2, 4, 6 and 8g/L  maltose as single carbon source, respectively. Initial OD600 was set  as 0.16. When OD600 of the medium reached 0.6, 0, 0.5 and 1g/L  L-arabinose, 0 and 1mM was added as induction. The growth curve was measured  and shown in Figure.3.
It could be found that for conditions of 4 or 6g/L maltose in M9 medium, when  inducer arabinose was added as 1g/L, strains induced by 1mM trypt"

Conclusion: phaCAB grown in acetoacetate grows very well at 10 mM in M9S, this is confirmed with the new promoter constructs whereby all phaCAB growth much better than empty vector.
Compiled sole carbon growth
phaCAB on M9 minimal and supplemented media
phaCAB growth in sole carbon sources under M9M. M9 minimal grown with phaCAB shows that 3HB is a poor carbon source at all concentrations tested. In addition, acetoacetate is poor as well at low concentrations, however at 10 mM acetoacetate, there is a spike in growth whereby it outperforms glucose. Glucose itself permits strong growth, especially as the concentration is increased from 22 mM to 167 mM. This said, ANOVA analysis showed that there was no significant difference between these values (F 2,6 = 2.745, p < 0.1424). Data points show final time point after 6h growth for each concentration. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6h. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
phaCAB growth in sole carbon sources under M9S. M9 supplemented media grown with phaCAB displays similar results to those seen in M9M media. 3HB is once again the poorest carbon source, while acetoacetate has an optimum at 10 mM. Glucose performs very well in this situation as a sole carbon source. When submitted to ANOVA analysis, the sole carbon sources showed significant difference from each other (F 2,6 = 8.622, p < 0.0172). Testing the null hypothesis that there is no difference between sole carbon sources reveals the following. Applying a t-test shows that while 3HB and acetoacetate are not significantly different as carbon sources (p = 0.2341), both 3HB and glucose (p = 0.0256) and acetoacetate and glucose (p = 0.0488) act differently as sole carbon sources. Data points show final time point after 6h growth for each concentration. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6h. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.

K2020003
– mutated expression system for subtilisin E in E. coli (S221Y) The BioBrick named K2020002 for the expression of subtilisin E in E. coli is the basic component of this new part. Therefore, it consists of the promoter BBa_R0010 , the ribosome binding site BBa_B0034 , the leader sequence pelB BBa_J32015 , the newly created BioBrick K2020000 and the terminator BBa_B0010 like the expression system itself. The whole expression is based on the usage in E. coli, so the sequence of the subtilisin E gene from a wild type Bacillus subtilis was optimized for E. coli codon usage. The sequence was partly ordered from IDT ( BBa_K2020001 + BBa_B0010 ) and then cloned into BBa_J04500 , a protein expression backbone, which already carries the LacI promoter BBa_R0010 and the ribosome binding site BBa_B0034 . Afterwards, a mutation in the active site of the enzyme was introduced by performing site-directed mutagenesis (SDM). The codon AGC of serine221 was substituted with TAC, which codes for tyrosine, so serine was exchanged against tyrosine in the catalytic triade of the enzyme. We were not able to exactly detect the expression of the modified proteases via SDS gel, so we proceeded by executing a skim milk assay on agar plates containing IPTG and the needed antibiotics. Therefore, we streaked out the cells containing the modified expression systems on these plates and incubated at 30°C for three days.

III: Verification of the function of STAR element
In this part of our experiments, we verified the function of STAR element in the plasmid courtsey of 2018 SJTU-BioX-Shanghai (The sequence of Antisense and STAR Target was from 2016 Imperial College London). The gene circuit on the part is pCons-STAR Antisense-t500 (between the two multi-cleavage sites on both sides of the gene circuit) and pCons-STAR Target-GFP or pCons-STAR Target-RFP. The STAR Antisense gene express STAR Antisense, and STAR Antisense binds the STAR target, thus activates the expression of GFP gene or RFP gene.

Yes, we know which proteins dimerize. We understand how proteins dimerize as well, by interaction of domains like leucine zippers and so forth. But why? What is the point of dimerization?
Previous researches have underlined the important advantages of dimerization, including differential regulation, specificity, facilitated proximity and so on. [citation needed] The influence of dimerization in noise propagation is hardly touched due to the difficulty in controlling experiment variables. Synthetic biology provides powerful tools to carry out experiments otherwise impossible in designed systems. This is exactly what we do.
Traditionally, we evaluate the impacts of noise using variance-related statistics, such as coefficient of variance. These quantities can only describe how concentrated the output is around the mean value, but cannot tell us how well we can infer one of the correlated random variables from the other. Channel capacity makes a better criteria of noise because it more scientifically depicts the information dissemination process."

Best measurement approach
E.g. cheap and easy methods for characterization
Best modelling
Best new biobrick (natural)
This biobrick should be something really crazy...
Best new biobrick (engineered)
E.g. light switchable promoter system. Each team leader is to think about his project - if there is potential to win one of the special prices, we can all help this team!

Rethink your characterizing experiments precisely (assays, etc.), think of positive and negative controls, etc. Ask Prof. Skerra or our advisers, when it comes to the characterization of your enzymes!
Application? Did you finish your project? That is to say, that it would be great if had brewed a beer at the end
Modelling: One negative thing last year was the fact, that the modelling based on literature data. We should link the modelling with the lab- work this year, so ask Fabian what data he will need.
Crowd founding: Platform already exists - we could create an own iGEM sub-folder
Track choice: There are several tracks and we have to choose one favored track (e.g. ""food and energy"") and a second one (which one?)

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them. Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a more"

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," team of Groningen print their bacteria. The team of Groningen wanted to create a stable biofilm containing their biofilm-forming bacteria, by using our 3D-printer to improve the biofilm.
Two experiments were therefore designed. The first experiment was printing with the bacteria in alginate in a certain structure. By adding calcium chloride to the alginate, a gel forms with the bacteria encased. By using a plate filled with LB agar, the bacteria would be able to survive and create a biofilm. The team members of Groningen printed with their own bacteria, B.subtilis, in a form of their own choosing. The Groningen team prepared beforehand their own bioink (Sodium alginate+bacteria), calcium chloride and LB agar plates.
.
To make the solution they pasteurized 100 mL of 1%(w/v) sodium alginate with appropriate antibiotic, and autoclaved 100 mL of 0,1M calcium chloride to acquire sterile solutions. The LB agar plates were made using standard protocols. They had grown their bacteria overnight in 5 mL LB with appropriate antibiotic. The overnight culture was then spun down, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was then resuspended in 100µL LB and mixed with 500µL sterile sodium alginate to make the bioink, and transferred into a 1mL syringe  Before printing on the LB agar, 500µL calcium chloride was added to enable formation of the hydrogel.
The Groningen team then proceeded with printing with their self-made bioink. They were able to print on two agar plates, in the form of a house and a flower. They noted that the controls of the printer,  weren’t very user friendly, but after a while they got the hang of it. In the end they agreed that the Biolinker was functioning as a 3D printer. .
The second experiment, was measuring the  selectivity of alginate. The membrane should only let sodium ions (Na+) ions pass through to be a selective bio-membrane. Since the previous experiment proved that the 3D-printer was able to print the bacteria in the gel, the next aim was to prove that the printing of a biofilm made of alginate would be selective. The Groningen drew a square on carrier material, on which they printed the alginate in “full color”. The alginate filter was then placed in a self-made voltmeter system, where the filter would separate the fresh from salt water. This separation of salt and fresh was not acquired. This was due to the salt water"

Growth of bacteria with our bio bricks in medium LM (LB + mercury chloride) it’s in progress!!! DH5α transformation with bio bricks didn’t work! We made the transformation again, DH5α with BBa_K516030 and BBa_I712074. We’re hoping that no it will grow!!!
In parallel we have the tests with mercury and the new constructions. We’re also isolating wild bacteria from the stream contaminated with industrial residuals and from Negro River. Yesterday we transferred to solid medium LB and the result was:
Wild Bacteria resistant to high Hg concentrations from Negro River – A1*, A2*
Wild bacteria resistant to high Hg concentration from stream 40 (contaminated with industrial residuals) – E1*, E2
Wild bacteria resistant to high Hg concentrations from stream 40 (contaminated with industrial residuals) – P1*, P2, P3
Wild bacteria resistant to high Hg concentrations from stream 40 (contaminated with industrial residuals) – S1*
*Resistant to 100ug/ml
Today we made a test for kanamycin (kanamycin 50ug/ml, tetracycline 12ug/ml, ampicillin, 100ug/ml, streptomycin 20ug/ml and chloramphenicol 34ug/ml) of those unknown bacteria (samples A1, A2; E1, E2; P1, P2, P3; S1).
Today we also had progress with our tests for bio bricks sequencing, started on September 2nd (For more information, access September 2nd ). We made a new PCR with different concentration of PSB1C3 with BB_Essential + K346004. We used the primers VF2 and VR.

We did not performed tests with others pollutants such as the xylene. Therefore, the sensibility of our biosensor to those pollutants should be assesses in future experiments.  For a convenient reason and as we could not evaporate toluene within our laboratory, we only performed bioluminescence assay using liquid toluene. Future work could consist in the creation of an isolated and hermetic room in which gazeous toluene could be add ad our drone flight to perform air sampling.

Edinburgh_UG,2017,Team:Edinburgh UG#HP#Interdisciplinarity_-_-_TEXT.html,"$ and discipline $j$, measured in Euclidean distances.                 (Note: some versions of Rao-Stirling Index include parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ [6]. But, they are inapplicable                 to this study and are not discussed here.)
The measurement of disparity ($d_{ij}$) is less straightforward than variety $(i, j)$ and balance $(p_i, p_j)$. We devised                 a simple framework based on the Biglan's Axes, a well-established categorisation of disciplines, to semi-quantify                 each discipline in the following three qualities [8]:
Foundational – Applicational: is the knowledge gained of pure academic interest (e.g.                     philosophy), or of applicational value outside academia (e.g. software engineering)?
Hard - soft: if a paradigm exists to be followed (e.g. engineering) or if qualitative                     discussion is the only requirement (e.g. philosophy)?
Life - non-life: is the discipline concerned with living organisms (e.g. biology) or is                     the discipline unconnected and unapplied directly to any living organisms (e.g. software engineering)?
We score each discipline from 1 to 7 for each of the three qualities. Euclidean distance $(d_{ij})$ is calculated                 by using the scores as three-dimensional coordinates. For example, a subject with scores 3, 6, 7 would have                 a coordinate (3, 6, 7) in a (x, y, z) format. We then used the data to calculate a diversity value for each                 team.
Data Collection and Analysis
It should be noted that we have collected and analysed the data in the following way:
iGEM teams with an ambiguous or incomplete record on disciplines of team members were excluded from the analysis
iGEM teams that received a blocked medal were excluded from the analysis, as a blocked medal does not correlate                     with the quality of the project
Datasets from different years were analysed separately, as the award criteria were not consistent throughout                     2013-2015
We respect the achievements of every iGEM team and we promise that the sole purpose of the collection of data                 was to understand interdisciplinarity in synthetic biology. Data was collected from publicly available iGEM                 team websites.
Results
Distribution of discipline diversity is grouped by medals (Gold, Silver, Bronze and None; Figure 1). Disappointingly,                 no significant difference in interdisciplinarity was detected between medal winners in any year (p > 0.1                 for all combinations; ANOVA).

PT7, T7 promotor; RBS, ribosome binding site; 2TM, double T7terminator; birA, the biotin ligase gene; accA, the α biotinylated subunit gene of Propionyl-CoA carboxylase; pccB, the β subunit gene of Propionyl-CoA carboxylase; sfp, the phosphopantetheinyl transferase gene.
Here, we use T7 promoter and terminator to stay the same with our plasmid pSB1C3 carrying the genes encoding DEBS1 PKS so that they will be co-expressed under the same condition. RBS is placed between every two genes in order to ensure the transcription of every gene. Since the sfp gene knocked into the prp operon was frame shifted, we worried about whether it works as expected. Therefore，we constructed two chassis, of which one carries sfp(chassis 1) while another(chassis 2) doesn’t, and we will verify the activity of the sfp by transforming them into the E.coli BL21(DE3) separately with pSB1C3 carrying DEBS1 at the same time and see if there will be any difference between these two strain of E.coli BL21(DE3) under the same condition.
Construction
Since we didn’t have much time to buy Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) to get gene accA and pccB from it by pcr. Besides, the Saccharopolyspora erythraea NRRL23338 we already had is not suitable to provide the two genes we needed[3], we chose to synthesize them. Meanwhile, we gained sfp and birA by pcr from E.coli BL21(DE3) and optimized their sequence by site-specific mutagenesis. Then, we constructed the pSB4A5 chassis by digest and assemble them step by step.

Overview
As part of our overarching project goal to optimize the production of curli fibers, we took a closer look at the cellular pathway involved in this process. As protein expression level can be tuned relatively easily with ribosome binding sites, we chose to focus on optimizing the stoichiometric ratios of protein expression for the proteins involved in the production pathway. To this end, we developed a mechanistic model of the general curli pathway that can be applied to any system involving the curli proteins.
To constrain our model, we defined the following objectives:
1. Maximize the concentration of extracellular fibrils
2. Minimize the concentration of intracellular fibrils
3. Maximize cellular resource usage efficiency
The first objective focuses on maximizing the production of our desired product: the secreted and polymerized csgA. The second addresses the toxicity induced by accumulation of intracellular protein aggregates. And lastly, the third aims to minimize the inputs needed to make the production process as cost and energy efficient as possible.
The pathway itself is been broken down into the following five modules: Transcription, Translation, Periplasmic Export, Extracellular Secretion, and Aggregation and Polymerization.

The naturally occurring genes corresponding to curli are organized into csgBAC and csgDEFG operons. csgD is a regulatory protein, and thus is not applicable for the expression of foreign plasmids. To increase transformation efficiencies, the plasmid that we used placed all the relevant genes on a single plasmid, csgBACEFG.
The rate of transcription is primarily governed by the plasmid copy number and promoter strength. Although RNA polymerase and a number of other transcription factors are also involved in the transcription of mRNA, transcription factor binding achieves equilibrium much faster than transcription, translation, and protein accumulation, so it can be at considered to be at steady state on the time scale of proteins. Thus only the concentration of the plasmids are assumed to have a large impact on the rate of transcription.
$$g + RNA_{pol} \overset{\alpha}{\rightarrow} g + RNA_{pol} + mRNA$$
The rate of transcript degradation is dependent upon transcript stability, which is in turn affected by"

Our collaboration efforts have lead the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology 2016 iGEM team to West Lafayette to visit the Purdue University iGEM team. Our goal of the trip on August 10th, 2016 was to travel to Purdue to make use of their fluorescence microscope. This machinery, which we learned later on in the day go for about 800,000 dollars, was used to capture crystal clear images of our yeast. However, before we could use this awesome machinery we had to first drive the hour and 45 minute trek up to West Lafayette. This meant waking up around 6:00am and drinking various drinks ranging from coffee to energy drinks to get our bodies going in the morning. The drive through the backroads was a peaceful one with music and conversation. Then we hit the college town of West Lafayette. Coming from a relatively small campus, it was a mess trying figure our way through the random one-way streets as we made our way to the parking garage. Our contact, Barrett Davis, was super helpful as he rode his bike to show us exactly where to park. After successfully parking on the third floor, we made our way downstairs to introduce ourselves to Barrett.
The route we took on our drive.
Once acquainted we made our way to the Chemistry and Seed Commissioner building where we were told we would be heading to the basement where the microscope was housed. Once we arrived at the bottom floor we were introduced to Dr. Schaber who was the microscope specialist at Purdue University. Dr. Schaber explained to us the basics of the hardware and software he was using then it was time to get to work. After using a very old and crude fluorescence microscope here at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, it was a shock to see the clarity of the pictures and the ease at which they were captured. After a couple hours and focusing on the cluster of cells we wanted, we felt confident that we had enough of our cells pictured for our results.

After the wonderful results of our pictures we were all extremely hungry and decided we should walk around campus to try and find something to eat. Luckily for us, Purdue University is a very large campus that offers a wide variety of food options. As we sat"

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Choices_-_-_TEXT.html,"imal kidney tubules, which are the main site of accumulation.
Heavy metals such as cadmium have been shown to be involved in reactions that produce reactive oxygen species which leads to amplified lipid peroxidation, damage to DNA and an upset in calcium homeostasis (Manca et al., 1991; Kumar et al., 1996; El-Maraghy et al., 2001; Mendez-Armenta et al., 2003; Lopez et al., 2006).
There is evidence that cadmium serves as a competitive ion to calcium as it blocks all known calcium influx routes and also interferes with any neurotransmission initiated by calcium (Viarengo and Nicotera, 1991; Guan et al., 1988; Usai et al., 1999). However there is also evidence that cadmium ions increase the concentration of calcium in a cell – this concentration is usually cytotoxic leading to cell death (possibly the mechanism by which cadmium kills) (Orrenius and Nicotera, 1994).
Cadmium causes bone demineralisation
Exposure has also been linked to bone demineralisation. Cadmium was also responsible for causing a condition termed Itai-Itai Disease initially reported in a population in Toyama, Japan (Nordberg, 2004). The condition is characterised by the weakening of the bones, resulting in pain especially in the spine and leg bone areas. Progression of disease starts off as a gradually debilitating condition whereby the patient may find walking almost impossible. From that point onwards, the additional symptoms onset rapidly – these include kidney disorders, extreme pain, and bone breakage from the slightest of disturbances (an example is coughing). The end result is death (J.W. Hamilton, 2009).
Cadmium may cause cancer
It has also been recently suggested that low level exposure to cadmium can increase cancer risks, and cadmium has since been classified as a human carcinogen (Jarup and Akesson. 2009).
Cadmium is also a neurotoxic agent
Cadmium also has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, even though the amounts reaching the brain are small (Pal et al., 1993). The significance of the blood-brain barrier and cadmium neurotoxicity are confirmed in rat experiments, where infant rats suffer a larger degree of cadmium toxicity than do adult rats. The adult rats would have had more time for their blood-brain barriers to become established in comparison to newborn rats (Wong and Klaassen., 1982"

Networking amongst iGEMers
Apart from the science-related communication, we also find the personal exchange between the teams to be a valuable asset of iGEM. Through the huge field of participating teams from around the world, it is possible to establish valuable connections to other likeminded science students from different parts of the world. To come into closer contact with other european teams, we participated in both the german, as well as in the european meetup, in Marburg and Munich, respectively.
The German meetup in Marburg
German iGEM teams had the opportunity to connect with other teams in order to collaborate or to just learn about their projects at this year’s German-wide iGEM meetup in Marburg.
Three members of our team - Selina, Nico and Robin- didn’t shy away from the long distance and set off for Marburg to attend the German iGEM meetup from June 22 until June 24. On Friday afternoon we arrived at the Campsite Lahnaue, where we were already welcomed by some members of team Marburg. After the tents were set up we slowly entered into conversation with other teams and later spent a lovely evening in Marburg’s old town doing a pub crawl.
On Saturday morning the exciting part of the meetup began. Thirteen teams presented their projects at the first poster session at the local University. It was a promising chance to receive some early criticism or general opinions on one’s undertakings.
After the revealing poster session an executive member of the German Association for Synthetic Biology – GASB e.V. – introduced us to their company an its activities and goals.  Furthermore, several guest lectures, among them former iGEMers, gave interesting talks about synthetic biology. Watching the soccer world cup together, we let the evening find a comfortable end.
On Sunday morning we joined another poster session. For us young scientists it was a great way to practice for the upcoming Giant Jamboree in Boston and the familiar atmosphere even encouraged everyone to be open and come out of oneself. One special feature of the poster session was the embedded competition for the best poster. So, at the end of the meetup every team was given some constructive advice on the layout and content of their work.
Thanks to the perfect organisation of Team Marburg and Team Bielefeld 2017. We lacked nothing and had a great time in Marburg.

SCUT-China,2014,Team:SCUT-China#Project#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," modifying or terminating the polyketide chain. The PKS we choose is type I PKS, which is highly modular. The modularity of type I PKS is reflected in three aspects. First, the gene clusters of type I PKS are modular that each enzyme corresponds to the unique sequence of gene cluster. Second, each enzyme of PKS has only one function. Third, the process of polyketide synthesis are modular that each module modify one unit of polyketide chain[11].
PKS is comprised of a series of module that contain several domains. Each domain have only one catalyst center with defined function which works well though it’s a part of module. The domains we used are as follows: a ketosynthase (KS), an acyltransferase (AT), a dehydratase (DH), a ketoreductase (KR), an enoylreductase (ER), an acyl-carrier protein (ACP), and a thioesterase (TE).
AT selects an extender unit and charges ACP with it; KS catalyzes a decarboxylative condensation to elongate the polyketide; ACP transfers the newly-formed β-ketoacyl intermediate to processing enzymes; KR can stereoselectively reduce the β-keto group and control the orientation of an a-substituent; DH can catalyzes dehydration to yield a trans-α, β-double bond; ER can stereoselectively reduce the double bond and control the orientation of α -substituent. TE can catalyze the intramolecular cyclization of a polyketide to create a macrolactone[10][12].(table 1.)

The domain KS, AT, and ACP are resposible for the elongation of the polyketide chain. And the DH, ER and KR are the processing enzymes that modify the newly-form unit of polyketide chain. TE can terminate the elongation of polyketide. The AT can select the substrate and the processing enzymes can modify the unit, All of that finally determined the structure of polyketide chain[13].

Introduction:  Today, a meeting will be held with David in order to check our designed primers for PCquad for pET22b as well as how to design sequencing primers.  The order for our gene block and primers will be made when they are done.  Today will also be the presentation on PCR by Nithin and Tyler.
Meeting with David: David mentioned that the designed primers for PCquad pET22b looked fine.
Sequencing primers:  Between 500-700 bp from each other Two primers within gene for sequencing.  Avoid repetitive regions and follow general primer design guidelines. Sequencing primers were designed about 500bp from each other.

This would then confirm the presence of our protein, therefore we ran initial tests of this method by running dilutions of the ordered ferritin solution in addition to other things. This method worked extremely well for staining ferritin controls, although the E.coli samples lack the bands, which is problematic as this indicates  either there is no ferritin being produced, or this stain isn’t sensitive enough for the amount of ferritin produced. FIGRUERUEURE
On a happier note, our work with gibson assembly has finally produced one of our constructs, the fusion of the heavy and light ferritin chains to an E-coil. Because this method appears to be relatively successful, we intend to order more primers and use Gibson assembly for the construction of other parts as well.
Week 19: September 2 - September 6
We got more Gibson primers for the creation of the fusion proteins containing TALA and TALB connected to ferritin. The pieces were PCRed out and the Gibson reaction was attempted and subsequently transformed. All of the resulting colonies did not contain our desired part and this may be due to the presence of template vector originally used for the PCRs. Therefore we will attempt to DPN1 treat the DNA in order to chew up the original vector.
Week 20: September 9 - September 13
The western blots for beta-lactamase and the TAL constructs appear to look good, despite the very faint bands seen on SDS-PAGE. Therefore it is possible ferritin is being expressed as well, but is too difficult to see due to background. We may attempt to try to clean up the sample through some crude purification techniques such as treating the sample at 75C, exploiting the stability of ferritin. Alternatively, once we attach the his-tag to our main coil-ferritin construct, we can try to observe ferritin experssion through western blots as well.

2014 Igem Project
Fixing Nitrogen and Sensing Light
What was our goal?
There were two key components of our project:
Richard and Caroline were working in the Pakrasi lab, and had been using genes from cyanobacteria to get nitrogen fixation working in E. coli. They were testing nitrogen fixation by running acetylene reduction assays and designing experiments to test the optimal criteria (ie. E. coli strains, temperature, pH, nitrogen source) to get maximal results.

Rachel Dobson
Molecular Biology & Genetics Undergraduate
Rachel is a smiley, enthusiastic second year student, studying Molecular Biology and Genetics at UEA. Over the last two years at UEA, she has also developed an interest in cell biology and is keen to continue further studies in this area. She has really enjoyed her summer, from getting to know the other iGEMers while chilling and playing games by the lake, to listening to a wide variety of music while carrying out aspects of wet lab. Rachel likes the variation of tasks that she has been able to undertake as a consequence of participating in this rewarding competition, both the practical and research side, as well as taking part with the elements of human outreach. When Rachel is not in the lab she is usually filling her time being very active, for example she supervises a weekly cooking class for a local charity, and more recently she has been improving her badminton skills.
Rebecca Lo
Molecular Biology & Genetics Undergraduate
Rebecca is about to enter her final year at UEA. After university she plans to pursue a career in academia with a particular interest in plant genetics. She greatly anticipates an iGEM filled summer. Applying for iGEM was an easy decision for her as it brought about the opportunity to meet students with similar interests to her, gain research experience, and of course have 10 weeks of awesomeness! Currently, her greatest joy would be to get revenge on Khadija in Peg Wars. She loves KPop, especially songs that blows your brains out, only difference is you do you the shooting. She also loves playing team sports but can be rather competitive; someone always gets hurt! She has a long list of accidental injuries, of which none are to herself, so you have been warned…
Russell Gritton
Biomedicine Undergraduate
Russell is a third-year Biomedicine student looking forward to a career in cell biology research. He sees iGEM as a fantastic opportunity to become a part of a new, innovative branch of science with many real-world applications for the future, and is therefore excited to be a part of this year’s NRP UEA team. He particularly likes the creative side of the project and is the main user of the team’s Twitter, as well as having designed the Wiki and many of the graphics on it. In his free time Russell enjoys good music and good company, and is currently trying to learn the ukulele.

2.1 Our goals
2.2 Genome deletion
Background
This module is concerned with killing the E. coli bacteria after successful drug protein production and encapsulation. Killing will be activated by an increase in temperatures from 28°C to 42°C.
Model for cell death
Based on the genetic circuit , we know that
The lambda cI promoter is repressed by the protein cI that is produced constitutively under the strong promoter J23114.
At 28°C, functional protein cI will bind to the lambda cI promoter to repress it. Restriction enzymes DpnII and TaqI will not be produced.
When there is an increase in temperature (from 28°C to 42°C
[1 ]
[2 ]
), there will be a de-repression of lambda cI promoter, causing restriction enzymes DpnII and TaqI to be produced.
Our goals
We aim to:
Explore how temperature correlates to restriction enzyme concentration, and see how it affects the population of live cells, so as to characterise the effects of temperature on cell death.
Develop a model of the number of dead cells as this correlates to our live and dead cells assay. (hyperlink to assay). From this, we can monitor the rate of killing and perform data analysis to obtain the necessary parameters.
In summary, our model will allow us to characterise the effects of temperature on the parallel production of restriction enzymes DpnII and TaqI, that are required to kill E. coli. We can also characterise the extent Dam methylase can protect E. coli against cell death. (not yet done)

Holly Parker
During the summer I was working on the characterisation of the promoter parts which we were using, I received help from Fatima Ulhuq, Alex Finney and John Allan. These people helped me familiarise myself with the protocols and towards the end of the project they all helped with last minute Western blotting. I also worked on designing the Hardware, for which I received a helping hand from a volunteering freelance engineer (Zachary Holmes) who was not part of our team. He used the Dundee's Makers Space to put the hardware together. The hardware was then used for our proof of concept experiments which were carried out by Kieron, Darren and John. Outside of the wet lab I was part of the presentation team and together with Rachel and Fatima Rehman we received a lot of helpful feedback from John, Alex and Fatima Ulhuq as well as our Supervisors, Frank Sargent, Fordyce Davidson and Tracy Palmer. Many thanks to everyone who helped.
Darren Scrimgeour
I worked in the Dry Lab, focusing on Human Practices and how it affects our project. Throughout the summer, we spoke to several government bodies including Food Standards Scotland and the Department for the Environment for Food and Rural Affairs regarding our project and how we could improve.  I also organised a day at the Glasgow Science Centre displaying interactive experiments, with help from Professor Nicola Stanley-Wall and Erin Hardee, and co-organised a debate with the University of Edinburgh Undergraduate iGEM team, and the debating unions of the Universities of Dundee and Edinburgh.
Rachel Elliott
In the wet lab, I had a lot of help from our advisors Fatima Ulhuq, Alex Finney, John Allan. They taught me the basic skills needed to begin the project and helped me to work through lab problems as they arose throughout the summer. Fatima and Alex helped to design the lysis experiment we used to test our modified toxins. The other members of the Wet Lab, Holly, Chris and Kieron were also always there to lend a hand when needed. I was also part of the presentation team with Holly Parker and Fatima Rehman, we received extensive advice from the three aforementioned advisors as well as Lucas Morales and Professors Frank Sargent, Tracy Palmer and Fordyce Davidson, and the rest of team.

Parts & Device
Project Concept
Two monoterpene synthetic systems were designed by combining two monoterpene synthetic enzyme genes which are already on the parts’ list, and γ-terpinene synthetic enzyme gene we submitted as well as two protein devices.
One device is E. coli IPTG-inducing γ-terpinene synthetic pathway, and the other is yeast-based γ-terpinene synthetic pathway.
Expression in S. cerevisiae
The device in this yeast-based monoterpene synthetic pathway uses the S. cerevisiae cells which constantly express monoterpene synthetic enzyme by introducing each gene of monoterpene synthetic enzymes at the downstream of TEF promoter. GPP is constitutively synthesized in yeast cells and its volume is enough for intracellular monoterpene synthesis. Thus a certain monoterpene is easily synthesized by transferring this device into yeast cells.
Expression in E. coli
The device expresses only when BL21(DE3) strain is used as the host. In this device, each monoperpene synthetic gene is under the control of tac promoter, so the expression of each monoterpene synthase gene is induced by adding IPTG. By changing the dose of IPTG and the timing of addition, the monoterpene volume changes and the intensity of scent also changes.
However, E. coli does not have enzyme to synthesize geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), a basal material for all monoterpene synthesis. So one has to directly add GPP to the medium or transfer the DMAPP transferase gene (ERG20).
How the Pathways Function
In the two pathways we designed, the behaviors of insects on the plate can be controlled via the scents that can be regulated by the types of monoterpene synthases, the volume and the timing of IPTG addition and the location of colonies on the plate. In our pathways, yeast and E. coli cells become a conductor to orchestrate insects.
Biological Assay
Purpose
To evaluate the effect of limonene on the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster.
Materials
The first-third instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster Canton S (CS) as a wild type strain.
Method

BNU-China,2014,Team:BNU-China#investigation.html_-_-_TEXT.html," to specific aspartate residues in CheY and CheB. Phospho-CheY enhances CW rotation of the flagellar motors; phospho-CheB has high MCP methylesterase activity that helps to change the CW rotation to CCW rotation, and they will be inactive because of loss of phosphoryl group through spontaneous self-hydrolysis. CheZ further enhances the dephosphorylation rate of phospho-CheY to ensure rapid locomotor responses to changes in the supply of signaling phosphoryl groups to CheY. The signaling activities of chemoreceptors have two-state corresponding to two movement patterns separately (Fig. 6).  Receptor complexes in the CW signaling state activate CheA, producing high levels of phospho-CheY.  Receptors in the CCW signaling state deactivate CheA, resulting in low levels of phospho-CheY. Thus, the behavior of the flagellar motors reflects the relative proportion of receptor signaling complexes in the kinase-on and kinase-off conformations. For example, attractant ligands drive receptors toward the kinase-off state; subsequent addition of methyl groups shift receptors toward the kinase-on state, reestablishing the steady-state (adapted) balance between the two states and restoring random walk movements.
Fig. 6  Chemotaxis pathway. Reactions and components that augment CW rotation are depicted in green; those that augment CCW rotation are depicted in red.
Left: The flagellar motors of E. coli spin CCW by default of Che-Y; the signaling pathway modulates the level of phospho-CheY, the signal for CW rotation.
Right: The cartoons depict receptor ternary complexes in kinase-active (on) and kinase-inactive (off) signaling states.  Changes in chemoeffector occupancy drive the complexes toward one state or the other.  During sensory adaptation, changes in receptor methylation level shift signaling complexes toward the opposing state to restore a balance between CCW and CW signal outputs.  The actual stoichiometry and structure of receptor signaling complexes are not known.  Note that receptor methyl groups are attached to specific glutamic acid (E) residues in the MCP cytoplasmic domain, forming glutamyl methyl esters and neutralizing the negative charge on the glutamyl carboxyl group.  Charge neutralization probably plays an important role in controlling receptor output state.

Our Project
Dr. Farley on Indigenous Peoples
How will our project affect the sustainability and cultures of indigenous peoples?
Dr. Ned Farley: Sustainability is kind of the new topic, and when I say new it’s about ten years old but, it’s new for academics. It’s a new topic of discussion because anthropologists always look at the past more than the future, but what we have realized is that we cannot ignore one for the other. The past, the present, the future, they are all intertwined into culture, and how people use their culture, how they carry it, how they experience it. And so that, kind of in a fast nutshell there, really was a cause in sparking my interest in your proposal and the potential outcomes for that because, and I’ve even brought this up in my anthropology class, the idea of being able to increase rates of sustainability with little to no overhead or capital investment is exactly what humans have looked for since they started writing things down on paper. When we take a look at, for instance, domestication, the domestication of maize [eventually corn] allows people to live in urban environments in the southwest. It is a means of survival; it allows them to grow into large numbers and to flourish….. And so when you came to me yesterday, I think your concern was really great because even though it is not a direct laboratory concern, and that is really where your energies have been spent. You will transform the culture no matter what you do, no matter how hard you try not to, you are always going to affect it. What is awesome about your study is that they could create enough surplus where they could feed themselves. So, now it becomes indigenous again where I live off my herd, and sell it for cash. Right? And that’s powerful. If you can do that without disturbing the balance between biology and culture. You win, hands down.

For the most audience from CHC, their major was Biology, meanwhile, several students major in Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics attended our lecture as well.
As this probably was the first time for those students to get a general idea of Synthetic Biology and iGEM, we mainly attempt to clarify the concept starting from brief idea of Synthetic Biology to a specific iGEM idea and how it function as well as several fundamental notions of basic parts.
Therefore, our lecture can be divided into two sections. The first section included both a introduction of Synthetic Biology, iGEM, and our team. Simplified words and sentences over how Synthetic Biology born, revealed the genuinely tremendous landscape of science for the whole audience from the stuff they were continuously bustling with. With the click of mouse linked to slides, their attentions have been transferred from Lanzhou University to MIT where the annual iGEM Jamboree was held. Additionally, to enhance our audience’s interpretation of iGEM project, we described the project of our last year iGEM team which mainly focused on the disposition of the heavy metal in the aquatic environment. To gain the best effect, those elusive mechanisms were avoided but the essential core of idea was exhibited.
Afterwards, we turned our attention to the brief introduction of those fundamental parts in an iGEM team.
Choose the most proper species, especially those model organisms according to your design of project. If a novel method needed to be functioned in a prokaryotic cell, several bacteria such as E.coli and B.subtilis might be taken into consideration. While if you need a eukaryotic organism, you may need"

DESCRIPTION
Results & Discussion
1. URA3 insertion
In order to integrate the URA3 gene into the genome of the Y. lipolytica PO1fΔKu70 strain, we first constructed a pCRISPRyl-derived plasmid which contained a protospacer that targets the PEX10 locus. This protospacer was used previously for successful disruption of PEX10 8 . The pCRISPRyl-derived plasmid (pIW357) was constructed through the Gibson assembly of a 60 bp fragment containing the protospacer of interest into the AvrII linearized pCRISPRyl. Subsequently, pIW357 was purified from selected E. coli DH5α transformants and a double restriction analysis was performed with PstI and AvrII (Figure 12). As the purified pIW357 was no longer digested with AvrII, the protospacer had been correctly inserted. In addition, the protospacer insertion was confirmed through Sanger sequencing (data not shown).

Lethbridge_HS,2017,Team:Lethbridge HS#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," developed a different expression construct specifically for use in E. coli BL21(DE3) which takes advantage of the T7 RNA Polymerase expression construct in the DE3 cassette. This will provide tighter epxression control and help to prevent leaky expression of the tyrosinase. Additionally, the double terminator B0015 was added to increase control over the system. In order to maximize production of the tyrosinase and limit unnecessary energy expenditure by the cell, a transcriptional terminator will ensure energy is not wasted on transcribing an overly-long mRNA transcript. The melA expression construct is the improved part that we were able to characterize the most (see Results ).
The crtY-crtZ parts, containing RBSs native to Pantoea ananatis had been previously developed by Chris French of the iGEM07_Edinburgh group  (2007-10-24, parts BBa_I742155 and BBa_I742158 ). These had previously been expressed under constitutive promoters such as J23103 but not under a T7 promoter that can be used in E. coli BL21(DE3). We kept the native RBSs on these genes and incorporated it into a new part under the control of the T7 promoter ( BBa_I712074 ) and the terminator BBa_B0015 . As with the melA expression construct descried above, these new control elements will allow users to specifically control when expression starts through an IPTG induction system, as well as limit leaky expression.

Hi! Misses, Mister, E.coli &co. I am in a sabbatical year just before complete my last year of my master degree, so I was fully available for iGEM during the last two months, when everyone was at school or at work.  I enjoy to work in a team and to do different thing like lab work, sponsoring... The overnight work was very funny due to the good mood of the team. We are going to set MIT on fire. So, see you there!! And after this?? Lets go to Australia to see what's going on around Biology !!!!
Carole Rabouille
I am a biochemistry and biotechnology student at insa Lyon currently in my 4th year. I thought that it was a huge opportunity to participate at the iGEM competition! First of all to learn some more about microbiology but also to live a great teamwork experience, a way to exchange with people from all over the world. And finally it is a lot of fun!
Marie-Amédée Galbrun
Like a lot of us, I studied biochemestry and biotechnology at Insa de Lyon. I'm very interessed in Microbiology. I enjoyed my summer at IGEM, the team atmosphere. I'm found of sport especially gymnastic and dance. Happy to be part of this adventure!

Hey ! I’m learning biochemistry and biotechnology at the INSA, but also salsa, rock and rugby. I’m proud to be part of the first INSA-Lyon iGEM Team for this great adventure ! The iGEM competition offers a fantastic opportunity to work like a laboratory, in a team and in a good mood, and improve our own skills and knowledge. Let’s build a smarter cell together !

RIVM Kennisparade
We also presented our work at the RIVM (the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and Environment) during their “Weekend of Science”. The public, which consisted mostly of children and their parents, could attend multiple workshops and presentations organized by the institute. We had a stand where we could put our project on display.  By making a comic on biosafety ,  we educated children on the safety aspects that come with the use of GMOs. Moreover, we presented our project using our poster and distributed the postcards of the iGEM postcard collaboration . The children liked the colorful comic and postcards, and while they performed some childproof science experiments, the parents wandered around our stand. The families could take both postcards and comics home, to read them further and think more about the issues we presented.

Biosafety on social media
To this day, social media is a great platform to reach the wider public and our target audience. Apart from keeping our followers up-to-date on our project progress, we also used the platform for public education, posting several memo’s conveying the messages of biosafety, ethical analysis and more. Take for example the biosafety post below. This post is a simple and approachable way to learn about the basic safety measures we take inside the lab. We even got a reply from the iGEM Foundation!

PURPOSE
DR. CHE-HONG CHEN
Stanford ALDH2 Researcher & TAIES Cofounder
Dr. Che-Hong Chen is a molecular biologist and geneticist researching the ALDH family at Stanford University. In September 2017, Dr. Chen came to our school to give a talk as a part of our Research Speaker Series. In his talk, he discussed the misconceptions about Asian glow and its actual cause: ALDH2 deficiency. From this talk, we learned that there is a lack of awareness about this serious problem, and were inspired to develop a simple solution to mitigate the adverse health effects of ALDH2 deficiency.
.
DR. STEPHANIE HSIEH
Medical Doctor
We consulted Dr. Stephanie Hsieh to learn more about ALDH2 deficiency and about different types of treatment from a medical perspective. She believes that the health risks of drinking are overshadowed by those of other cultural habits, such as betel nut chewing and smoking--both have long been a part of Taiwanese culture, and their hazards are more publicized. In Taiwan hospitals, free screenings for oral diseases are provided for people over 30 who smoke and chew betel nut, but few provide screening for ALDH2 deficiency. (Interviewed by Catherine C, Tim H, Iris H, and Emily T)

To find out what is currently being done by healthcare systems, we called multiple hospitals in Taiwan. Like Dr. Hsieh said, all of the hospitals we called have a “Smoking Cessation” department, where patients can go through programs to quit smoking and get checkups for smoking-related health effects. When we asked about ALDH2 deficiency, however, we were surprised to find that most prominent hospitals in Taiwan do not have any form of testing for ALDH2 deficiency, and the few that did were part of extensive blood tests and expensive (2180 NTD). This helped"

Heidelberg,2009,Team:Heidelberg#Eukaryopedia_-_-_TEXT.html," protein expression in eukaryotic cells can be regulated on many different levels, this article concentrate on the regulation of transcriptions.  Only a small percentage of the human genomic DNA is transcribed into mRNA. On the opposite, a huge part of the human genome is involved in regulating the transcription of coding sequences.  To initiate transcription of a gene eukaryotic RNA-polymerases have to bind to several general transcription factors to establish the so called initiation complex (IC), which is able to bind to the DNA. The binding occurs upstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS) in a region called core promoter, this part of the promoter often contains specific elements like the TATA-Box (consensus sequence, TATAA/TAA/T, about 30 bp upstream of TSS [50] ) and the GC-Box (consensus sequence TGTGGCTNNNAGCCAA)  app. 80 bp upstream of the TSS [51] to which the IC can bind. Further upstream is a part of the promoter which is referred to as proximal promoter. Containing specific sequence elements, this part of the promoter is highly important for the transcriptional regulation. Transcription factors can bind to these response elements thereby up regulating or down regulating the gene transcription. Proteins methylating or acetylating the DNA are also involved in gene transcription regulation by remodelling of the chromatin structure.

Drugs
CPT
Camptothecin (CPT) is a cytotoxic quinoline alkaloid and a  topoisomerase I inhibitor isolated from the Camptotheca acuminata (Camptotheca or the Happy tree). It was discovered during a screen for natural anti-cancer drugs in 1966 but it is not not used in cancer therapy due to its severe side effects, but there were various derivatives developed to increase the benefits of this drug while decreasing its negative effects [52] . The two CPT analogues have been approved for cancer chemotherapy today are topotecan and irinotecan. CPT acts by binding to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex using hydrogen bonds and thereby preventing DNA-religation, inducing DNA damage and ultimately causing the cell to die [53] .

Discussion
During our experimental process, we found that the given       time in transformation protocol was rather shorter than that we really cultured. And the transformation efficiency       was pretty lower than we expected, and we were not the       only one who ran into this situation."

Results
After we have successfully cloned our plasmids into the E.coli, we did miniprep to obtain purified plasmid DNA. Then, we did restriction map and sent the samples to BGI for sequencing. The results are shown below.
BBa_K2197300
Restriction Map
After mini prep, we used the same restriction enzymes EcoR1 and Pst1 to do restriction digestion and gel electrophoresis. However, the size of K2197300 and the backbone pSB1C3 are almost the same, thus we cannot prove by the Gel photo.

Sequencing Result
With the help of team 2017 Hong_Kong-CUHK, we sent our plasmid to BGI for sequencing. We aligned the sequence we ordered from IDT (As the template sequence 99593011 below) with the sequencing result received from BGI (as the aligned sequence below). And here is our analysis.
The black area indicates the two sequences are the same which those red strips represent there're some mutations.

Conclusion
From the results above, we can say we have successfully cloned the DNA that IDT sent us into the cell. However, as what we have mentioned in the experiment page, we found that the cells cannot express GFP. Then, we aligned the sequence registered in iGEM with the one that IDT send us, we found that the sequence containing 'tactagag' is missing.

Their intra-bacterial tri-stable switch responds to inducer concentrations in the bacterial environment. As such, the diffusion of the inducers in the environment were modelled in the outer model, and the inducers enter the bacteria at each outer point via free diffusion through the bacterial membrane. The inner model interaction processes and constants are provided by the HKUST team’s modeller. The three reporter proteins (x,y,z) and the three inducers (i1,i2,i3) interacted through the idealized equations in Figure 5. The implementation of the interaction processes can be found in the “user_bacteria_interactions” function of “user_parameters.c” control script, which can be found in “hkust_collaboration.zip”.

Survey
We dispersed two hundred questionnaires and half of them were passed to students majoring  in biology. Finally, we got one hundred and sixty-five questionnaires back.
Our research shows that 98.78% students believe keeping our intestinal tracts healthy is necessary and 80.61% members hold the opinion that the pathogenic bacteria in intestinal tracts really threaten a lot to our healthy. However, 92.73% say that they know little about the pathogenic bacteria nor its negative effects. So it is so important for us to pay attention to the health of our intestinal tracts.
As 91.25% students know Escherichia coli which is symbiotic with human body does good to us and more than half of them like to take artificial methods to keep their intestinal tracts in a good state. This response offers a positive background for our project which suggests that people are looking forward to any method to solve this serious problem.
61.82% of students believe and like to use our engineered Escherichia coli as a medical treatment to cure the illness of intestinal tracts
Excitingly, more than 60% of students believe and like to use our engineered Escherichia coli as a medical treatment to cure the illness of intestinal tracts caused by pathogenic bacteria and if our engineered Escherichia coli can achieve our expected results (killing pathogenic bacteria more quickly and completely, and functioning for a long time once taken in),nearly 70% of them would like to use our method instead of the traditional way.
However, there are also 66.67% students worrying about our engineered bacteria in that they may cause dangerous effect to human. Among them 27% students think our engineered bacteria may have some side effects，32% students worry about the gene mutation of our engineered bacteria，21% students consider that our engineered bacteria may break the balance of the gut flora，and 20% students believe that our engineered bacteria may lose control in some unkown conditions.

To confirm PDC/ADH insertion into pSB1C3, 0.5ug of PDC/ADH/pSB1C3 was digested with EcoRI and PstI.  Digestions were run on a 1% agarose gel, and bands obtained confirmed PDC/ADH (3054bp) and pSB1C3 (2070bp).
PDC/ADH/pSB1C3 was sent to Nevada Genomics Center for sequencing on 6/23/11.
Bay Laurel Thioesterase
MT: 3-2 and 3-3 were the only cell lines that did not grow on the cross selection amp plates.  3-2 and 3-3 were cultured in LBCm34. The cultures were minipreped, nanodroped, and digested with EcoRI and PstI. The digestion was checked with a 0.7% agarose gel. The gel showed that there was full digestion of 3-2 with a band at 2000 (pSBiC3) and 1200 (BTE) which was to be expected, and partial digestion of 3-3.  Sample 3-2 was chosen to be sent to the Nevada Genomic Center for sequencing, because it was fully digested with EcoRI and PstI. Sequencing from the Nevada Genomic center proved the successful ligation of Bay Laurel Thioesterase with RBS and Terminator into pSB1C3, and is ready for submission to iGEM.

The BioBrick BBa K1351041 , encoding SpaBTC, is mainly responsible for the modification and the export of the subtilin propeptide. After the removal of 6 BioBrick restriction sites within the three genes, it is now in the RFC10 BioBrick standard. This BioBrick was accomplished just before WikiFreeze, so that no further evaluation was possible so far.
Antimicrobial peptide
BBa K1351012 and BBa K1351013 are coding for SpaS, the subtilin pro-peptide. Their main difference are their overhangs, one being in RFC25, which allows the tagging or translational fusion of BBa K1351012 , whereas the other can be used according to the RFC10 BioBrick standard. Unfortunately non of them could be evaluated so far, as the development of the immunity BioBrick as well as of the modification and export BioBrick were required beforehand.
Immunity
The immunity against subtilin ( BBa K1351014 ), was - just like the spaS BioBricks - submitted to the iGEM parts registry. Self-protection is mediated by SpaIFEG, a membrane-anchored lipoprotein and an ABC-transporter.
Fig. 6. Supernatant-in-lawn assay shows smaller halo diameters for B. subtilis with BioBRick-acquired immunity.
The part was evaluated with a variation of an spot-on-lawn assay. In this case, holes were cut out of agar plates on which either B. subtilis W168 wild type or B. subtilis W168 amyE::Pxyl_spaIFEG were plated. The holes were then filled with different amounts of sterile supernatant from overnight cultures of W168 or ATCC6633, respectively. The xylose-containing plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and resulting halo diameters were measured. The supernatant derived from the negative control (W168) did not cause any growth inhibition to neither the wild type, nor to the strain who carries the immunity BioBrick (Figure 6). The subtilin-containing supernatant from B. subtilis ATCC6633 however, was able to inhibit the growth of both bacterial lawns. For the lowest amounts (32 µl), no significant difference between the halo diameters could be determined. The larger the amount of supernatant, and presumably, the higher the amount of subtilin in there, the bigger the zones of inhibition. For the largest volume ("

Therefore, it’s a pity that we failed to detect those two proteins, but we were able to give some opinions to BIT-China about this detection through our experience:
Changing the expression strain specially for overexpressing of NhaA and NhaB according to the literature [1] , the details are in the table 2.

This experience makes us learn much about membrane proteins which we believe would work sooner or later. More importantly, it helps us two teams communicate frequently and therefore develop a tight relationship eventually.

BIT_China for BNU-China:
This year, we collaborated with BNU-China team and held a meeting on 11st. Jul. In this meeting, we exchanged our idea and communicated about our project. Finally, we confirmed our collaboration relationship between our two teams.
Fig.5 Meeting with BNU-CHINA
Because most of BNU-China’s members are fresh, they did not have enough experience about iGEM. After the discussion, we decided that we helped them finish part of their gene circuits. Meanwhile, we suffered some difficulties in characterize two basic parts, NhaA and NhaB. We also meet some problems in modeling, so BNU-China helped us with characterization of our parts and modeling part of our project.
We helped them finish the light regulation system (Pcons+B0034+PcyA+B0034+ho1). In this system, Pcons is a constitutive promoter family member (from J23100 to J23119) which can be used to tune the expression level of express part and what we choose is J23100. B0034 is strong ribosome binding sites (RBS). PcyA and ho1 are two requisite genes which are required for the transformation from heme into PCB. Ho1 will oxidizes the heme group and then generate biliverdin IX alpha, and PcyA converts biliverdin IX alpha into phycocyanobilin (PCB).

Our CFPS still worked well at 29 °C and 25 °C, although still 37 °C yielded the highest fluorescence. As we can synthesize sfGFP at temperatures around room temperature, a performance in the field is quite conceivable.
Relative fluorescence units in positive control setups at different temperatures. Tecan device measurement specifications were identical in every run. Maximum fluorescence signal during measurement is shown. Experiments were performed in triplicates at least.
We further investigated the effects of different heavy metals on our CFPS system, results hereof can be found at the Heavy Metal result page .
Low Cost Energy Solution

Cost Reduction – Considerations
Laboratory reagents are never for free. But you will always try to get the most out of your money. With this in mind, you may be surprised that the reagents for a small scale CFPS reactions cost less than the reagents needed for a PCR ( Pardee et al. 2014 ). We calculated the cost to perform a 15 µL CFPS reaction one has to spend when following our protocols. To keep it simple, we only took into account all the chemicals needed to perform CFPS. Click on the dollar image to open a .pdf of our cost estimation. Based on our calculations, one CFPS reaction is as cheap as 16 ¢!
We analyzed how it would be possible to even further reduce the costs of CFPS reactions. One major cost aspect relies on the energy source which enables ATP regeneration. Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is already cheaper than the often used 3-Phosphoglyerate (3-PGA). However, we tested two easily affordable substances to fuel our reactions: The common polysaccharide maltodextrin and the polyphosphate molecule Hexametaphosphate, which have been shown to work in cell-free protein synthesis ( Caschera and Noireaux, 2015a ).
Testing Low Cost Energy Solution
CFPS with low cost energy solution compared to our fully optimized, PEP-based system.
We showed that the previously mentioned energy sources can substitute PEP when Na-oxalate is removed from the reaction. The observed fluorescence signal was similar in multiple performances. The low cost energy solution is a good alternative for CFPS. A cost estimation revealed: When Hexametaphosphate and maltodextrin"

Learn more about biodegradable plastic
Why use PHB?
An alternative to petroleum based plastic is highly needed due to the current plastic pollution. Plastics are irreplaceable in our way of life and we are obligated to accommodate this need without leaving a permanent imprint on the planet. The petroleum based plastics worldwide mostly ends up polluting our environment. Therefore, the very use of biodegradable plastic such as poly-hydroxyalkanoates (PHA), including poly-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), as a substitution for petroleum based plastic is a huge step in the right direction ROCHMAN, C. M., COOK, A. M. & KOELMANS, A. A. 2016. Plastic debris and policy: Using current scientific understanding to invoke positive change. Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, 35, 1617-1626. .
There is a lot of potential in biodegradable plastics. Once the production of these environmental friendly plastics has been optimized, it is then possible to find applications where conventional plastics can be replaced. Because PHB is very expensive, we would have to first optimize the production. PHB has biocompatible properties, which could be used for creating implants or capsules for internal drug delivery. More examples of how the biocompatibility of PHB can be utilized in medicine can be seen at the perspectives site.
What is PHB’s properties?
PHB is used as a carbon source which are stored as granules in a wide variety of microorganisms. They usually accumulate it as intracellular carbon or energy that they use for a carbon source and stored reduction power. This generally occurs because of growth limiting nutrients such as oxygen, nitrogen, phosphate and sulfate. PHB is part of a large group of plastic polymers known as PHA’s.
PHA’s are microbial polyesters which contain 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-hydroxycaboxylic acids that accumulate as an energy source JAMBUNATHAN, P. & ZHANG, K. C. 2016. Engineered biosynthesis of biodegradable polymers. Journal of Industrial Microbiology & Biotechnology, 43, 1037-1058. .

Methylmercury Poisoning
Context
Gold digging grew severely in the emergent countries at the end of XX century. In the process of extracting the gold, mercury (Hg) is used a lot, most of the time without the proper care, the pure metal is discarded in the nature where it becomes a potential intoxicating agent. The potential is so high that, even through processes such as oxidation and methylation, through biochemicals and metabolic reactions measured mainly by bacteria.
Figure 1 - Man in gold prospection.
In addition to the disposal process itself in nature, another phenomenon is responsible for the ability of mercury poisoning: bioaccumulation. Its main result is the accumulation of mercury, especially in its methylated form in fish, which has a direct effect on the lives of the local population, which has fish in their food base. As shown in Nogueira et al. (1997), Pinheiro et al. (2000) and Boischio et al. (2000), high levels of mercury found in the hair of both riverine populations as the population of the great capitals of the Amazon, Manaus and Belém as indicating that the risk of contamination with heavy metal is real and must be addressed seriously by public health policies directed toward mercury in the Amazon region.
Figure 2 - Just a little humor...
The attention in public health for methylmercury poisoning (MeHg) through the consumption of contaminated foods, such as fish, only if initiated after acute poisoning events happening in the city of Minamata, Japan, in 1953, which gave rise to current name given to the syndrome of intoxication by methylmercury, known as Minamata disease In this locality, chemical companies had MeHg as a major waste and discarded them in Bay City, Bay of Minamata. The high levels of MeHg led to several cases, once enigmatic, neurological deficits in the population of the city, giving rise to the disease in its most acute form. However, after years, the chemical industry in the region was growing and in order to maintain higher productivity, the industry chose the Minamata River, which flowed into the Shiranui Sea, as the discharge point. This led to a whole contamination of fish in the sea and, like fishing in the locality was unrestrained at the time, entire families on this coast were being exposed to contaminated food and slowly were intoxicating themselves,"
SDU-Denmark,2013,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour52_-_-_TEXT.html," as a repressor did not live up to our expectations when comparing it to the constitutively active strains, nor when comparing it to the wildtype. Therefore, we built a device of similar design to the LacI:LVA device with natural LacI: LacI(N). To test its qualities compared to LacI:LVA, a FACS was analysed. The experimental setup was similar to the previous. Two triplicates of MG1655 strains carrying either pSB1C3-Pcon-lacI(N)-term-Plac-dxs (B. subtilits)-GFP or pSB1C3-Pcon-lacI:LVA-term-Plac-dxs (B. subtilits)-GFP were used and an additional measurement at time 180 min was performed (Fig. 2).
Both strains repress expression when uninduced. The strain expressing LacI:LVA reaches its maximum percentage of fluorescent cells approximately 150 min after induction, whereas the strain overexpressing natural LacI reaches its maximum after a mere 30 to 60 min. The maximum protein levels in the strain overexpressing natural LacI reaches a level approximately 3 times higher than the strain expressing LacI:LVA. Clearly, the function of the natural LacI is superior to that of LacI:LVA.
Figure 2.
To test its qualities compared to LacI:LVA further, another FACS was performed. The experimental setup was similar to the previous. Dublicates of MG1655 strains carrying either pSB1C3-Pcon-lacI(N)-term-Plac-dxs (B. subtilis)-GFP or pSB1C3-Pcon-lacI:LVA-term-Plac-dxs (B. subtilis)-GFP were induced with IPTG concentrations rangingfrom 0.05-0.5mM (Fig. 3). After 180 min upon induction, the strains expressing LacI:LVA with the IPTG concentrations ranging from 0.05-0.5mM reached approximately 25-30 % cells above the fluorescent threshold. Comparing this observation to the strains overexpressing the natural LacI, even the least induced (0.05mM) reached a higher percentage of cells above the fluorescent threshold after 180 min. All of the cells in the culture overexpressing natural LacI induced with 0.125-0.5mM IPTG are above the fluorescent threshold within 180 min. In general, the response time is faster for higher concentrations of IPTG.
