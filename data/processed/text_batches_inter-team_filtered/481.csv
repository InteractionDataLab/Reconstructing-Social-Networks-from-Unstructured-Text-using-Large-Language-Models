Introduction of the meetings which SCUT-Champion-Park participated for IGEM
SCUT-NJU-SYSU three-university forum
This is the third time that our university participates in IGEM competition. Through the experience, teachers and administrators find that IGEM can help students improve the interest of the synthetic biology. So they support three teams this year. Most of our team member are the first time to participate in IGEM competition and have no experience. So at the beginning, we hope to communicate with some experienced teams.
In early April 2015, the students form Nanjing University came to Guangzhou. We took the opportunity to organize the first meeting. We hoped to exchange the experience and share ideas. Three teams from our school, Team from Nanjing University and Sun Yat-sen University participated in the meeting. In the meeting we introduced the design and progress of our project. Besides, we also talked about the human practice and web design. The meeting went to the highlight when we shared the experience of overcoming difficulties in the project. Guangzhou’s food is very famous in China, after the meeting, we invited the students from Nanjing University and Sun Yat-sen University to taste the local food. Through the meeting we made friends with each other. We also found that there are many young people making efforts for the IGEM across China. When we accomplish the project and get the prize, I think we would be moved by ourselves.
SCUT Champion Park goes to communicate with IGEM teams in Shanghai
Our team members go to Shanghai to communicate with the IGEM teams from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, New York University Shanghai, Tongji University. We shared the projects and appreciated the beauty of these universities.
In summary, through these meetings we shared the experience of IGEM including project design, wiki, human practice and so on. At the same time we gained friendship. The IGEM is a competition. We don’t regard each other as competitor, and we are friends. Thanks for the supports of our university,"

This is the third year that our school (South China University of Technology) teams participate in the IGEM. Compared to the previous two years, this year there will be three teams to participate IGEM in the name of South China University of Technology. Now, IGEM are very influential in our school, and also trained many students'​​interest and ability. Through the first two years' experience, we have learned that this game is not only need to invest a lot of energy, but also a lot of money. This year because of the number of teams is increasing, the supports from College for each team has a certain reduction in funding. In the early preparation, funding becomes the team's biggest problem. In order to ensure adequate funding, we have made various efforts, and got the support from many parties. Finally, we can come to Boston to attend the 2015 Giant Jamboree, and to communicate with the teachers and students from all over the world.
At last, we would like to sincerely thank SCUT, graduate school of SCUT, our college, the organizations and individuals who helped us in the process.

To try this concept, we decided that our team would design a membrane-bound affibody that BGU Israel would then attempt to express on the surface of mammalian cells using their AAV vectors.
Our design utilized a system of Glycosylphosphatidylinisotol (GPI)-anchoring that is common in membrane proteins of mammalian cells. We based our design on a human protein Decay accelerating factor (DAF), encoded by the CD55 gene. A 34-amino-acid-long signal peptide at the N-terminus precedes the actual protein, which is then followed by a second 28-amino-acid-long signal peptide at the C-terminus. The N-terminus signal directs the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the C-terminus signal is removed in the ER and then replaced with a GPI anchor. In addition, a DAF-derived signal has been shown to lead to GPI anchoring of fusion proteins.
Subsequently, we have also added a short linker sequence and a FLAG-tag on the N-terminus of the affibody. On the C-terminus, we have also added a linker that ended with serine, which is the site of cleavage for the signal peptide. This gene was then synthesized as a gBlock by IDT. The construct was expressed by the BGU Israel team. While expression of the Affibody was confirmed, it did not appear to be localized to the membrane. More results are available on the BGU Israel 2015 wiki .
CGU Taiwan
The CGU Taiwan team was referred to us by the Delft University of Technology team. They needed help with the modeling part of their project. They had to knock out a gene in the G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) pathway, which in normal circumstances would be active. We introduced them to Matlab and SimBiology as well and helped them model the GPCR pathway with the eliminated gene. They were also interested in projecting the boundary condition for liquid-liquid interphase diffusion, using partial differential equations. We offered to research their reactions and to try to find kinetic parameters of the processes present in the CGU’s current project. We suggested utilization of Newmann no-flux partial differential equation useful as a boundary condition for this type of diffusion, previously used also by ETH Zürich iGEM team 2012.

Our Goals
Goal A: Characterization of R0011, a strong lactose promoter
We used R0011, which is one of the most commonly used parts in iGEM, to characterize our genes because the strength of promoter activity is very high. However, in previous iGEM, no teams characterized R0011 with RPU. We tried to determine how the activity of R0011 [10] changes.
Goal B: Quantitative characterization of λ lysis cassette
We found a new fact that cell lysis caused by λ lysis cassette become an apparent equilibrium state, and the value of OD550 depends on the strength of induction of IPTG. We defiend it as LAV (Lytic Activity Value） as a quantitative parameter of lytic activity, and we established a standard method for lytic activity of λ lysis cassette. We characterized the lytic activity of λ lysis cassette quantitatively as our established method, and linked the result to the strength of induction（RPU）.
We characterized the lytic ativity of λ lysis cassette with time.
Goal C: Characterization of the anti-killer gene, SΔTMD1
To check function of the anti-killer gene, first, we made construct and measured A550 of E.coli transformed with the device in medium with IPTG and without IPTG, and we compared this result with that of E.coli transformed with killer gene, lysis cassette. Then, we were able to make sure that Transmembrane domein1 (TMD1) is essential for , lysis cassette.

Achievement
We measured RPU of R0011 in eight kinds of concentration of IPTG, and made continuous curve representing the relation between concentration of IPTG and RPU of R0011 by simulation fitting.
We characterized the lytic activity of λ lysis cassette quantitatively as our established method,and linked the result to the strength of induction (RPU).
We found that a new fact that cell lysis caused by λ lysis cassette become an apparent equilibrium state, and the value of OD550 depends on the strength of induction of IPTG. We defined it as LAV（Lytic Activity Value）as a quantitative parameter of lytic activity, and we established a standard method for lytic activity of λ lysis cassette.
We checked the activity of SΔTMD1, which can't form pore of holin and cells don't die although endolysin expresses.

Introduction
Mycotoxin aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is one of the most potent rodent and human liver carcinogens, according to World Health Organization (WHO) and International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). If humans accidentally consume peanuts, corn, or crops containing aflatoxin, the chances of getting liver cancer would tremendously increase. Therefore it is essential to avoid eating anything that could contain aflatoxin, especially expired food or food stored in extremely humid or hot environments.
In Taiwan, liver-related diseases are prevalent. Also, aflatoxin is one of the most potent human liver carcinogens. During Integrated Human Practice, we also found out that aflatoxin causes great damage in animal husbandry. The animal feed often contains aflatoxin due to the humid and warm environment, contaminated commodities are often fed to animals. If humans eat animals that consumed animal feed containing aflatoxin, animal tests show that it would increase the likelihood of humans getting liver cancer. Currently there isn’t a complete nor easy way to prevent animal feed from being contaminated with aflatoxin. This is a major food safety problem.
We set out to develop an antidote that could degrade aflatoxin in the gastrointestinal tract and help our bodies get rid of it, preventing aflatoxin from entering our blood flow system. Using the antidote as a food additives could help the animal husbandry business solve the animal feed safety problem they are facing.
In order to develop an antidote that degrades aflatoxin in the gastrointestinal tract, iGEM CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan found an enzyme called MSMEG5998 (a F420-dependent reductase group A (FDR-A)) and the gene sequencing, which could"

Improvement
TlpA is a thermal sensitive transcriptional regulator, original TlpA was provided by ETH Zurich 2017, and a different version with lower activation temperature, TlpA36, was provided by NUS Singapore 2017, is the one we are improving, BBa_K2447012.
We provided TlpA39, which is with activation temperature higher than TlpA36 but lower than the original TlpA. All these three proteins can bind to pTlpA promoter, TlpA protein, according to the proposed mechanism, it will dimerize at the operator region of pTlpA, repress it and prevent the RNAP from attach to the promoter. It will de-dimerize when temperature reaches its activation temperature. Leakage was observed, transcription of pTlpA was initiated below the expected temperature. ETH Zurich improved this by simply increase the expression of TlpA protein.
Why did we improve this?
While we are designing our drug delivery bacteria project, we found out that TlpA has too high activation energy and TlpA36 is too low comparing to human body temperature. So, we found this TlpA39 on Shapiro’s lab, and utilized it into our project.
We also constructed a TlpA39-LVA to see if the LVA tag will accelerate the derepression process, but we found that there is no repression to TlpA39 since it has been rapidly degraded.
We characterized them by culturing them under different temperature, and read them on a petri dish or plate reader.
We can see that at 35 degree Celsius, TlpA36-K2447012 starts to derepress. At 37 degree Celsius, TlpA39-K2572000 starts to derepress. At 39.5 degree Celsius, Tcl42-K2572001 starts to express.
So they do initiate at different temperature.
Also, we can see there are differences of expression for same regulators are different under different temperature."
Imperial_College,2016,Team:Imperial College#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," responses from everyone.
In the future, we would like to increase the amount of guidance the game provides its players.  For example we would like to improve the instructions for how to mix microbes to make novel applications on our mixing platform in the game.  We would also like to include a short tutorial video at the beginning of the game.  Furthermore, we would like to expand the number of microbes and products available in the game.
Go Culture Game
Most people have a negative view of bacteria and microbes in general. We wanted to show that many different microbes exist and that most of them are very useful to humans. Since our project focuses on co-cultures and microbial consortiums we also showed that these are very common and explain some processes in which they are employed. We created a video game in order to present and inform the public on the points above in a fun and interactive way.
The aim of the game is to collect different types of microbes and co-culture them to obtain all the products available in the game. The microbes are found at the end of platform levels in specific environments such as the Gut or the Ocean. The lab environment is where the player can, using a mixing platform, mix the microbes together and create products such as yogurt and glow-in-the-dark cellulose.
Microorganisms to collect in Go Culture Game
Most of the microorganisms in our Go Culture game have been used in iGEM and synthetic biology. Others have yet to be engineered but they are known to have interesting properties which one day could be used.

Policy & Practice
As a product of London Biohackspace, the JuicyPrint project takes much inspiration from the hacker/maker movement in the way the project is organised and in the aims of the final product.
Ensuring easy distribution of JuicyPrint
The success of open source 3D printer projects such as RepRap is not only due to their open source nature, but also in the additional effort made to design a unit capable of being easily reproduced by whoever wishes to do so, anywhere in the world. RepRap achieves this by using a construction comprised of standard components which can be easily obtained from hardware outlets across the world and, where not possible, parts which can be produced by a pre-existing unit.
As an open source 3D printer, JuicyPrint hopes to use this model of distribution, especially because it lends itself well to the hacker/maker ideals of the team responsible for this project. The design of the physical structure of the printer and the growth medium which it uses are therefore informed by what is available from ordinary retail outlets. This creates the possibility for individuals, community biology labs, or professional researchers anywhere in the world to construct a JuicyPrint unit. The final component for a functional JuicyPrint unit is the engineered light sensitive strain of extracellular cellulose producing bacteria, which of course cannot be bought from a regular retailer. However, the biological nature of this component allows easy production from existing JuicyPrint units -one must simply take a sample of a pre-existing culture of 'JuicyBacter' which can then be used in the new JuicyPrint unit.
The Benefits of Community Labs
Our team and the lab it is based in is not associated with any academic or commercial research institutions. Instead, we are entirely community run and the funding we have managed to obtain is extremely limited in comparison to more traditional institutions.
Despite the smaller budget, the freedom which a community lab offers creates an exhilarating atmosphere and offers numerous advantages. Community labs are open to all, which makes it easy for biologists to collaborate with engineers, programmers or artists and helps to introduce biology to a broad range of people that otherwise would not have the opportunity. This in turn allows a brilliant environment for the cross pollination of ideas between individuals with backgrounds in different disciplines and often leading to innovative ideas. We hope that the diverse composition of our iGEM team"

Pretoria South Africa iGEM Team
On the 30th of September, Team Macquarie participated in a Skype call with Bernard and Stephan from the South African iGem team. Their team included two engineers, who offered their assistance with the MatLab program, to aid us in producing an interactive graph for our ALA to chlorophyll a model. What we wanted to achieve was an interactive display that we can add onto our wiki that allows us to have a slide bar or an alternative that can change our day view, which is on the X axis. We want to be able to see how the concentrations of the intermediates (Y axis) change over time.
Surveys
Team Macquarie’s international collaborations weren’t just limited to modeling. To fulfill our cooperation preconditions, our team also held an international, information collaboration with the iGEM teams from Munich United and Paris Saclay. The Macquarie team completed a number of surveys from the other teams, encompassing scientific, ethical and legal concepts. The data we provided served to enhance the overall analytical potential of iGEM teams from the other universities.
Team Macquarie completed numerous surveys for other teams, providing them with valuable information regarding patenting regulations and ethical and societal related issues. Looking at a long term aspect including legal and integration ideas.
Australian iGEM Annual Meet-up
Team Macquarie team also attended the annual meet up of the Australian iGEM teams, hosted at Sydney University. This meet-up provided a chance for all of the Australian teams to meet and discuss their projects. It also gave all teams an opportunity to practice a preliminary version of their jamboree presentation and receive vital feedback from other teams and their advisors."

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html,". From an initial cell density of 0.08, the wild type cells reach a maximum cell density of 0.34. Additionally, the gradient of the graph represents the rate at which cells express lycopene. The plot indicates that the mNARK-Lycopene device expresses lycopene at a higher rate than the wild type cells. It is clear that, for both the mNARK-Lycopene device and wild type E. coli cells, lycopene expression increases with cell density, as more lycopene is being produced as a result of there being a larger number of lycopene producing cells. Therefore, it can be concluded that the mNARK-Lycopene mops up the oxidative stress, which prevents the cells from dying. Therefore allowing cells to grow to a greater optical density, and, as mentioned above, greater cell density corresponds with greater lycopene production.
The second graph is derived from experiments using LB with two different concentrations of sodium nitroprusside (SNP): 50 μM and 100 μM. During the experiment with 2 mM copper (II) sulphate; the wild type E. coli cells continue to grow, since it did not produce an environment where there was substantial oxidative stress. Sodium nitroprusside can create an environment with greater oxidative stress. Due to the greater oxidative stress, the wild type cells are unable to grow in these conditions and show a very low optical density at 485 nm, which indicates a lack of lycopene production. The gradient of the two wild type cell graphs are similar, which is expected, as neither have an oxidative stress promoter. Wild type cells grew better under less oxidative stress (50 μM SNP), compared to 100 μM SNP. The optical density at 485 nm is lower for higher oxidative stress conditions with the wild type cells, which is due to their respective cell densities. However, the mNARK-Lycopene cells continue to grow and produce lycopene in these conditions. The lycopene cells display greater growth in the harsher 100 μM conditions compared with 50 μM. The gradient of 50 μM mNARK-Lycopene at 0.8435 is less than that of the 100 μM sample, which is 1.0864. This indicates that our mNARK device increases lycopene expression under higher oxidative stress.  In this experiment, the performance of the Lycopene cells is more pronounced, clearly showing that the mNARK-Lycopene devlice mops up the oxidative stress, which prevents the cells"

Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, and/or environmental safety?
The researcher is not being exposed to any sort of biological element that would cause serious harm to him or her in anyway. The strand of E. coli being utilized in our project would not be resilient in the human body, should contamination occur. Thus, there is very little risk of infection from our bacteria. All other researcher activities use standard biological engineering and molecular biology protocols and methods that pose little harm to the researcher when proper safety precautions are observed. Some testing involving radiation is involved, but that testing would be done independently of our research group in a controlled facility.
Our project idea could actually promote public and environmental safety, if successful. Practical use of this project would help to ensure that radiation levels within a certain area is not within dangerous levels able to cause serious harm to a person. This helps to promote public safety such that people can be told to stay away from certain areas that have high levels of radiation easily.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry, how did you manage to handle the safety issue, and how could other teams learn from your experience?
Any new BioBrick parts for our team do not raise any immediate safety concerns, and so none are listed as such in the registry. However, should the idea behind our project become a reality, some concerns as to containment of our genetically engineered strains of E. coli should be addressed. If our bacterial dosimeter is to be used in the field proper safety and handling issues should be dealt with and are being fact"
Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," in wound healing was apparent.
In accordance with many aspects of our project, meticulously monitored clinical trials would be essential in establishing the safety of SMITe… and we are currently very distant from these being realised.
Contributing to patients’ health and safety
The ultimate goal we had for SMITe was contributing to the safety and improved life-quality for chronic wound patients, which would only be possible if SMITe was optimally adapted to the situations most often encountered in the clinics.
A  great source of discussion in the project planning stage of our work was the timing and stage of biofilm development for which SMITe was designed. We anticipated that to enable SMITe to have optimum beneficial effects, the dynamic condition of the biofilm needed to be considered and this matched to some practical issues. One of the many logistical problems of chronic wounds is that by definition they are well established at the point of diagnosis. Since these are defined as having not healed for a prolonged period (usually weeks), [12] we had to anticipate battling an established biofilm; a trickier task altogether.
We considered that if we instead wanted to aim for preventing the development of chronic wounds we would need to also devise a system for risk stratifying acute injuries in order to treat those most at risk in anticipation. This seemed an unrealistic endeavour for our project but does continue to highlight the fact that meticulous screening of elderly individual’s pressure points, acute injuries, strict monitoring of diabetics and those with vascular disease is essential, [12] as well as education about the complexities of managing these injuries.
Overall, it became evident that our project would be unlikely to protect vulnerable patients from suffering high risk injuries predisposing them to chronic wounds and we agreed that our ability to intervene in the early stages of wound development was limited by the patient demographic; these individuals often present to healthcare establishments with an established wound.
It was for these reasons that SMITe was designed to disperse established biofilms which we consider to be the most realistic approach for clinical applications and which could considerably contribute to chronic wound patients’ safety and well-being.
Minimising Antibiotic Resistance
A big motivation for conducting SMITe was also antibiotic resistance and how it impacts both our presence and future. As part of our Human Practices, we collected information regarding the use of antibiotics in research and put together a set of easy-to-follow instructions and guidelines regarding the safe use of antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant organisms in research. The Project, CARD, is based on four simple principles:
Contain your resistant bacteria, plasmids and antibiotics
Avoid using clinically relevant antibiotics
Replace antibiotic-based selection methods

Today was a day focused heavily on developing our human practises. We started constructing a booklet of rules and brainstormed ideas for the scenario cards. The role of scenario cards is to make the players justify their use of Promoter cards and how well it fits the scenario dictates how many points the card scores.
We met with two of our instructors today. Jamie Gilman discussed the benefits of using design of experiments with us. Dr Chloe Milner discussed our current potential ideas with us and ordered a gBlock for us so we could test whether or not PAF could be expressed in E. coli, which is one of the main concerns we have before we commit to a project.

PHB
Previous iGEM teams ( Tokyo Tech 2012 and Imperial College team 2013 ) have retrieved promising results in improving the production of PHB. With our introduction of a secretion system, the PHB production might end up being a financially beneficial solution to the current plastic consumption. Here is some of the ideas for PHB’s future application.
Implants and coating for guided bone regeneration ( Top )
PHB is biocompatible and biodegradable. This makes it well suited for application inside the human body due to the hydrolysis of the polymer that produces a ketone body, commonly found in blood Rodriguez-Contreras, A., et al. (2016). ""Modification of titanium surfaces by adding antibiotic-loaded PHB spheres and PEG for biomedical applications."" J Mater Sci Mater Med, 27, 124. . These properties gives PHB the capability to become an implant that could be broken down slowly under the healing process of the bone. The slowly degradation of the plastic makes it useful to guide the bone regeneration. Using PHB as an implant could allow us to 3D print the structure of a joint, and by that fulfill the medical field’s wish to create treatments adapted to each patient.
This type of plastic is also suitable for load-bearing orthopedic implants, as the moduli of elasticity, tensile strength and strain properties of PHB are similar to bone material Meischel, M., et al. (2016). ""Adhesive strength of bone-implant interfaces and in-vivo degradation of PHB composites for load-bearing applications."" J Mech Behav Biomed Mater, 53, 104-18. . PHB’s strong alkaline ester linkages makes its surface more hydrophilic. This gives human osteoblasts the opportunity to proliferate and inhibit the growth of S. aureus on the surface of the implant Karahaliloglu, Z., et al. (2015). ""Antibacterial Nanostructured Polyhydroxybutyrate Membranes for Guided Bone Regeneration"" J Biomed Nanotechnol, 11, 2253-63. Karahaliloglu, Z., et al. (2015). ""Antibacterial Nanostructured Polyhydroxybutyrate Membranes for Guided Bone Regeneration"" Hua Xi Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi, 18, 215-8. .

When the music is input, after a specified time, the sound waves will be read and the amplitude and frequency of the music will be extracted. The diameter and the color of the dots vary with the amplitude and frequency of the music, and the pictures thus they are painted with beautiful colors. (see SOUND TO LIGHT ).
THE COMBINATION OF ART & SCIENCE!
As Wilde conveyed in his story, the barrier and combination of art and science still remain worth discussing, so we explored in depth the relationship of art and science in the Human Practices section. One prime barrier of outstanding art and science is the stereotype of defining art as being too selfish and far from the public and science as only about reality with no emotion. We surveyed university students from science and art backgrounds, and to our surprise we found the unconventional idea that the integration of art and science has been well-accepted among the younger generation.
Encouraged by our survey , we interviewed many university professors who are experienced in popularization of both art and science, and also communicated with artists in the AS Research Center. During this investigative interview process we gradually got motivated and had a clearer idea of our story to explore the junction of art and science.(see HUMAN PRACTICES ).
More than a hundred years ago, in Wilde’s story, the rose was thrown into the gutter. But today, we UCAS-China iGEMers have picked the rose back up from the gutter, to offer everyone the chance to create their own rose. Inspired by idealism and stirred by imagination, facilitated by scientific gene circuits we develop a practical kit expecting that our work will inaugurate a new era of art and science further inspiring young scientists for future generations.

Savage) in which they took the original operon pHnCB and added a tenth gene, csoS1D, located just outside the core operon and show to be necessary for the correct assembly of the carboxysome. It has also been incorporated a red fluorescent protein (RFP) ( BBa_E1010 ) fused with an ALA-ALA-ALA linker  to one of the shell proteins (csoS1A) and a tag sequence that expressed the biotin ligase recognition peptide (BLRP)  (BBa_), which can be biotinylated in the presence of the biotin ligase BirA enzyme native from Escherichia coli. This process allows later on a strong interaction between the biotin and streptavidin that can be used for purification purposes, specifically as an extraction method for recombinant or protein complexes.
The operon was obtained from the pHnCBS1D plasmid (plasmid provided by David Savage, Departments of Molecular & Cell Biology and Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley). The BLRP sequence was an adaptation from the plasmid provided by the INTACT method (“The INTACT method for cell type–specific gene expression and chromatin profiling in Arabidopsis thaliana”.

Description: Includes the lacZ gene ( BBa_I732005 ), which encodes for the β-galactosidase attached with a linker ( BBa_K105012 ) to the large subunit of the RuBisCO ( BBa_K1113701 ), under the regulation of the pBad/araC promoter ( BBa_I0500 ), and includes a RBS ( BBa_B0034 ). The construct was made to prove the delivery of the β-galactosidase to the inside of the BMC and to test reactions in vitro within the carboxysome.
The large subunit of the RuBisCO was obtained from the pHnCBS1D plasmid (plasmid provided by David Savage, Departments of Molecular & Cell Biology and Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley).
This part was constructed with a mutation on the prefix (from “cggccgc” to “atacctg”), which erases the NotI restriction site. This modification allows the correct design of primers for Gibson Assembly. This part was constructed on the pSB1C3 standard vector.

The gel fluorescence traces show what appears to be PCR product in large amounts for the Common and EA37 reactions, and smaller amounts for the YF36 and YF42 reactions. The remaining three show almost no activity.
The PCR products were subsequently separated using gel electrophoresis then cut out. They will be purified tomorrow.

First result from the fusion PCR: tetR mutant EA37 appears in ""detectable"" amounts
Douglas purified the gels containing yesterday's mutation-PCR products, following the gel purification protocol . Isopropanol was added to the ""Common PCR"" product, as its expected length is inferior to 500bp. The final DNA concentrations, measured by photospectrometry, are listed in the following table. Even the very low concentration of YF36 should be sufficient for a PCR template, and the weird ""260/280"" ratio apparently results from agarose gel residues.

These sequences were then used for a fusion PCR, to stitch mutants YF36, EA37, and YF42 to the common sequence, according to the overlap extension PCR protocol . Only the EA37 mutant, which was also the brightest on the PCR gels, yielded a significant amount of product. The next step is to check the product is the desired mutant, in order to confirm the success of this method. We also have to refine the PCR to get the other mutants to work; it seems the problem comes from the primers' melting temperature.

TAKING CARE OF
Integration of the risks was also necessary. We identified 3 major risks. The contamination risk implies to use safe biological materials. The reliability deals with false positive and false negative. It is a technical issue that is related to our technology. The goal is to reduce them as much as possible. The use decay risk introduced by the user.
The risk principle results in the concept of responsibility. Support is good way to reduce those risks, being supervised by the medical staff can be very reassuring during the test execution. The announcement of the results also questions the presence of medical staff according to the serious consequences of some STIs. The easy access and the simplicity of use are necessary to guarantee an equal right to get diagnosed. Nowadays, the responsibility is not restricted to the user, it must also respect the environment. That’s what motivated our technical choices for the device.
The matrix was also intended to be
a decision helper tool
. It was very useful when taking important decision (e.g. changing the revelation system). Matching technical solutions to ethical values (accessibility, respect of the user, biosafety) can be really complex but stimulating!
Decisions taken thanks to the matrix
Sample choices: blood for a non invasive test and easily standardized sample.
Materials choices: paper, biosourced plastic…for an eco friendly cycle of life.
Early-detection: RT instead of the p24 to detect the early stage infection of HIV.
Reliability: a system that minimizes the false negative risk by using two epitopes instead of one.
Usability: redaction of a usernote to improve the user experience.
Biosafety: latex beads instead of RT proteins or HbSAg as bio-safe migration controls.
This work can serve as an inspiring example to other 2016 iGEM teams: Stanford-Brown and Michigan. We could organize an ethical debate about our technology. Our work on an ethical matrix is documented but there are still a lot of questions (writen in red in the matrix). With others, we can build upon to answer to doubt. We were able to come up with a device that combines the expertise of physicians specializing in STIs, potential patients’ expectations, curiosity and foresight of young engineering students. So this device can be usable and useful.

Professor Xue gave us useful advice on the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. He recommended that we should research the other sources of NO, such as endothelial cells, and to ensure that this is considered when modelling the system.
Safety
Patient interviews, surveys and consultations with specialists highlighted the need to incorporate a biosafety mechanism into our device. We responded to this feedback by designing, synthesising and characterising a single component kill switch. More can be read about this on improvement of a part and our safety pages. On top of this in order to encourage the use of GM probiotic treatments for a greater range of conditions.
Safety Policy Proposal
Regulation
Dr Michael Morrison - Centre for Health, Law and Emerging Technologies (HELEX)
Over the summer we met with Dr Morrison on multiple occasions to discuss the law and regulations that would be relevant to the development of our product. He gave us guidance on the various regulations that would govern how our product could be used clinically, and gave us an understanding of the processes required during clinical trials. The work with Dr Morrison was incredibly important in the creation of our proposal on the safety of GM probiotics, a long-term public education plan, and theoretical plans for completing clinical trials and the manufacture of our probiotic. Dr Morrison was also able to guide us towards information on a range of gene therapy case studies as mentioned on product design. He also put us in contact with Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult.
Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult
Catapult is a centre to help and encourage growth of cell and gene therapies by aiding with regulation, product testing, logistics, manufacture and business advice.
We met with Daniel Rabbie, the Regulatory Affairs Manager, and Ryan McCoy, the Senior Process Development Scientist to discuss how our product fits in with current government regulations and how we can take it from the lab to the patients. We discussed the differences in regulation in different therapies, the organisations available to speed up the process of getting the treatment from the lab to the patient, current therapies, and considerations involving logistics and manufacture.
Regulation Flowchart
Regulatory Bodies
In order to understand how to navigate the laws and regulations in different countries, we created a document to investigate the various regulatory bodies
Pediatric Trials
If we are to start providing this therapeutic to children, we would need to carry out pediatric trials, which carry a host of new regulations (in note format)
ATMP Classification
The classification of treatment is important in determining the right regulatory bodies you must go through. Our treatment would likely count as an Advanced Therapy"

People in their recreational time don’t want to hear about the ways they’re going to die from all theses diseases so how are people going to enjoy learning about it if we always make it about death and disease. So on the note of sketchy science and bad news articles that overhype and blatantly lie or spin it to draw false conclusions. Do you have any tips on how to determine if an article is exaggerating the conclusions from the scientific article? Especially for people in the general public, people who have never taken a science course. That’s really tough. See it’s tough to put the burden on the reader to go look it up. Where would they even look? Exactly…one I can think of is inflammatory or dramatic language. In that realm, any absolutes or anything that sounds too certain is probably fake. Real science is always about probabilities. “This is likely true” or whatever. The other thing is you should see…er no. If it’s something so big it should be..no, I dunno. It should be from a really reputable journal. You should see it in many of the top news outlets. If you’re only seeing it in random news articles probably its bad, but that’s hard to gauge. I don’t have any good tips. My best tip is to ask a scientist because that’s a lot easier. But I don’t have a good tip for…it’s a good question, I need more time. It would be great to have a system, or an endorsement system but you could see how that could go wrong too. I find a lot of scientists in academia are often against popular science because it talks too much in absolutes and that can be hard too. It would be nice to have- I guess you should look if it has quotations from the researchers. The simplest thing you can do, if the article you're reading mentions a study but doesn’t link to the study, I would say it’s garbage. That’s a pretty standard thing in journalism. You should always mention the study, if its not mentioned in a way you could google it and find it…probably not legit. If you did google it and find it, you would want to make sure that one of the authors on the paper was quoted on the article. If Ed Yong was writing an article, he can get that scientist on the phone…and I trust Ed Yong. So science communicators have to bridge a fine line between giving too much info and making it jargon-y versus trying to make conclusions more relevant than they are. Where"

Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus"

For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

Jilin_China,2016,Team:Jilin China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," just introduced the basic ideas and the important progresses of our project. We also illustrated some of our results from experiments, human practice and wiki.
The talk was a big success, since the audience showed great interests in synthetic biology and the treatment of solid tumors. It also promoted the public awareness of iGEM among universities in Northeast region of China.
5.HUST-Cheering Meeting
5.HUST-Cheering Meeting
We always wanted to have a chance to communicate with iGEMers from other teams. During July 7th. – July 9th. , we attended a HUST-Cheering meeting in Wuhan. We were glad to have an opportunity to change our thinking about iGEM with other brilliant iGEMers in China.
The HUST-China team gave an excellent presentation. Their project focused on a new type of biological filter. They designed two ingenious plasmids that can work in prokaryote and eukaryon. This excellent team is also the sponsor of the meeting. They also held many other meetings to introduce the ideas of iGEM.
NCTU-iGEM team talked about a new protein they produced. They named it Pantide and it could be used as an alternative option as an insecticide by decreasing the efficacy of ion channels in lepidopterous larvae. Their presentation was really flawless, and they also talked about two biobricks they made.
NJU-iGEM team mainly introduced a plasmid that could produce hydrogen in prokaryote. The team members were very experienced researchers and we consulted a lot from them.
We also presented our project and many iGEMers gave us advices. They think our project is really interesting, and our modeling is really good. They gave us some advices on improving our experiment, and we are very grateful about that.
6.Survey
With the aim of helping people understand solid tumors and synthetic biology, we did a survey with related questions in August 2016.Among 179 people completing the questionnaire, about 79% of them were between 18~30 years old, and most of them have bachelor’s degrees. However, most of them knew almost nothing about solid tumors.
6.Survey
Besides, more than half of them knew nothing about the therapies to treat solid tumors and only 10% of them know something about novel therapies, such as immunotherapy or therapies with the assistance of modified microbes. To the potential application of synthetic biology in the treatment of solid tumors, people’s opinions were uncertain.

Production of PHB from waste confirmed. Imperial iGEM data.
Extras ▼
Growth assays with different experimental media
In additional to standard LB and minimal media, several novel experimental media were developed in order to characterise Biobricks within a mixed waste/landfill setting. These media were characterised through an examination of pH and through an array of growth assays with the project chassis, E.coli MG1655 strain.
Media characterisation. E.coli strain MG1655 were transformed with a control plasmid and grown in different experimental media over a period of 5 hours. LB media, minimal media (M9M), supplemented minimal media (M9S), as described here or waste conditioned media (WCM), which is made from sterile filtrated mixed waste, see here . OD600 measured, error bars are S.E.M., n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
pH of experimental media. pH measurements of experimental media were made both before and after several experiments. The time periods refer to the duration MG1655 transformed E.coliwere cultured in the media before a pH measurement was made. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
Conclusion: E.coli strain are viable and grow in all of our experimental medias. We have established a novel media that is optimised for characterisation of biobricks within a mixed waste/landfill context.
Protocols ▼
Waste Conditioned Media (WCM)
We added 1g [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refuse-derived_fuel SRF] (Solid Recovered Fuel) /50 mL LB and then autoclaved the mixture. Once autoclaved, large waste chunks were removed through filter sterilisation (0.2 µm filters) before being used in growth assays as waste conditioned media (WCM).  SRF refers to the refuse from recycling facilities that has no value currently and is incinerated to produce power at a cost to the recycling facility, it is composed of 30% plastics while the rest is cellulosic waste
See here how we make up waste conditioned media and purify plastic from it.
Waste Growth Assay
Overnight (O/N) cultures of MG1655 transformed with (BBa_K639003) were diluted to OD 0.05 in either fresh LB or waste conditioned media and plated into 96 well plates (200 µl/well)."

We are using HEK cells with constitutive EYFP. Typically, they need to be passaged 2-3 days, today we passaged at 1:6 ratio.
April 11th, 2012
Split at a 1:6 ratio. They will need splitting again by Friday. Also, iGEM now has P1000 tips and culture dishes in the bottom drawer. All of our goods are labeled ""iGEM."" The P1000 tips are to be used with the aspirator when aspirating liquids in the hood. Be sure to EtOH before and after use. Last night (4/11/12) Kenneth metafected cells at 11 pm.  Movies are here: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL07C09A5037691E54
April 13th, 2012
Split at 1:12 ratio, so they will be able to last 3 days (till Monday). Made 10 Aliquots of Typsin (10 mL). They are on the bottom shelf of the freezer, labeled with iGEM on them. When you need to passage cells, take an aliquot and thaw in the hot water bath. For now, we won't be needing all 10 mL in the aliquot so I need to check if we should freeze it or put in the fridge.
April 16th, 2012.
Made media according to the formula above. Katie split cells today at 1:6. They need splitting on Wednesday. Also, materials for making media (except DMEM, and essential AA's), will be stored in aliquots in the freezer, labeled.  Essential AA's will be aliquotted and stored in the +4. To make media, you will simply need remove the 50 mL of DMEM, and place that into a labeled conical tube. Then add thawed frozen components and essential AAs. Frozen components are on the bottom door shelf of the freezer. Essential Amino Acids are in the fridge on the door as well. DMEM can be found in the cold room, some is stocked in the metal min-fridge in the back too.

NAWI_Graz,2018,Team:NAWI Graz#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," any requests by our partners, so we focus on other projects, but economically and ecologically it’s an important part of discussion.
Which oil properties are of interest for your partners?
I think this is not a question with a general answer, because we have a wide range of partner corporations. By now, there are 36 partners out of national and international agrifood industry, the repertoire ranges from herb production, bread, feed and agricultural machinery. The only connection seems to be the economical compound.
We are working on an alternative produced in E. coli or yeast cells. What do you think about the application in Austria?
Genetic engineering is a very big topic, particularly regarding sustainability and naturalness. We think that the topic of food has become a life style topic by the consumers by now. I think genetic engineering is one of the topics, where open communication and education is priority number one.
Do you think our alternative might be more popular, if it were cheaper or more environmentally friendly?
I would say that it’s depended on the final product. If the final product is a pure life style product, then the economical aspect would be less important. People are more likely to spend money if the quality is high. For industry as ware and for the market it might be interesting, but on the other side, if one can label a product as “organic”, it might be an advantage as well.
You always speak about “lifestyle product”, what do you exactly mean?
Food as lifestyle product, for example “Kaiser Franz Josef Brot”. This is an established brand in Austria. People are willing to spend 8 to 10€. Not only the quality, but also the image is included in the price, ergo this bread is more than just bread. This is the difference between bread as a food and bread as a lifestyle product.
Do you think the local oil market (soy and canola) would be influenced by the introduction of biosynthetic oil?
Logically, of course! However it depends on the market share. The influence might negligible.
What does the future for biosynthetic palm kernel oil look like for the next 20 years?
I don’t know if I’m able to answer this question (laughs). I think it’s strongly dependent on the marketing concept, but I can’t give you a prediction in numbers.
Where do you think might be obstacles in the authorization process?
They might be the same as with Vanillin.
What are your ideas about good quality management by biosynthetic palm kernel oil?
Transparency. I think technical comprehensible processes are way better than bare certificates. I can"

Wild type and ∆crcB were grown directly next to each other at varying levels of fluoride. As described in literature, ∆crcB should not grow when exposed to fluoride levels over 500µM. Unexpectedly, ∆crcB did grow on high levels of fluoride when placed on the same plates as wild type E. coli. Without wild type E. coli, no growth of ∆crcB was seen on 1mM and 2mM fluoride.
In order to figure out the cause of the unexpected growth, we reached out to Dr. Randy Stockbridge at University of Michigan for possible explanations. Dr. Stockbridge informed us of Fluoride’s dependability of pH. A low pH environment is necessary for Fluoride to enter cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that the wild type altered the pH of the agar to a more basic level, facilitating the growth of ∆crcB.
To confirm our hypothesis, we prepared similar set of plates, but with phenol red, a pH indicator, for visual confirmation.
Phenol red appears red at basic pH and turns yellow at acidic pH. In the absence of a buffer, wild type has a visibly basic pH. Therefore, once the entire plate became basic, ∆crcB showed fair amount of growth. On previous days, ∆crcB grew only at red areas (low pH).
To further confirm our results, we prepared the same plates with a MES buffer, which kept the agar at a 6.5 pH, which is slightly acidic.
Upon the addition of the buffer, the alteration of pH was significantly delayed, so F was able to enter the membrane of ∆crcB, allowing the strain to grow.
CHOP (Chloramphenicol Operon) and ∆crcB (E. coli without Fluoride Channel) were added to 50µ chloramphenicol plates and observed over the course of 4 days.
The plates had increasing concentrations of F with CHOP and ∆crcB to determine the level of fluoride that leads to the greatest growth of CHOP.
∆crcB was part of the control and did not grow because it does not have the fluoride channel to pump out the F.
As observed, there is most growth of CHOP on 100μM of F, suggesting maximum growth of CHOP at 100μM of F.

Tsinghua,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A_-_-_TEXT.html," splitting up can bring about unexpected side effects. Gene regulatory circuits are highly dependent on quantitative properties, its complexity and nonlinearity contributing to hard-to-predict behaviors of biological systems. Once an important part in the system is chopped up, who knows what will happen next?
Our program quantitatively studies the behavior of such systems. Splitting up changes the circuit’s output-input function, alleviates leakage phenomenon, improving switch-like property, and increases fold change when induced by circuit inputs. Moreover, we use channel capacity from information theory to describe how well can they transmit signals. We find adding intein sequence tremendously beneficial in that it shifts the channel capacity to a higher level, thus ameliorating uncertainty.
When it comes to designing logic gates, our findings can lead the way. Not only can splitting achieve logic gate effect, but also can it improve sensibility to inputs and defend the system against detrimental interferences of noise when intein is added. Future work shall benefit from this fundamental investigation of basic synthetic biology blocks.
Highlighting the biological significance of dimerization:
Dimerization is only too common in cells. Monomers assembly into dimers for further functions all the time, some interactions strong, some interactions weak. Function-less newborn peptides piece together and get to work, forming so-called tertiary structure; activated kinases reach each other and mutually phosphorylate; transcription factors, when forming homo- or hetero-dimers according to different stoichiometry, leads to varied downstream responses and distinct cellular fates…
Yes, we know which proteins dimerize. We understand how proteins dimerize as well, by interaction of domains like leucine zippers and so forth. But why? What is the point of dimerization?
Previous researches have underlined the important advantages of dimerization, including differential regulation, specificity, facilitated proximity and so on. The influence of dimerization in noise propagation is hardly touched due to the difficulty in controlling experiment variables. Synthetic biology provides powerful tools to carry out experiments otherwise impossible in designed systems. This is exactly what we do.
Traditionally, we evaluate the impacts of noise using variance-related statistics, such as coefficient of variance. These quantities can only describe how concentrated the output is around the mean value, but cannot tell us how well we can infer one of the correlated random variables from the other. Channel capacity makes a better criteria of noise because it more scientifically depicts the information dissemination process.

Hong_Kong-CUHK,2015,Team:Hong Kong-CUHK#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," of magnetite biomineralization is tightly regulated through specific conditions such as: pH and the concentration of iron within the vesicle. It was also shown that such formation only occurs below a threshold value of 10 mbar of atmospheric pressure, and is inhibited at higher oxygen concentrations. In other words, the size of particles is limited by atmospheric pressure and oxygen concentration. It is found that at 0.25 mbar, magnetite biomineralization can produce particles up to 42 nm. As the condition rise to 10 mbar, the particle size dropped to about 20 nm. [9]  As the biomineralization of the magnetosome is reported to be highly affected by oxygen, we propose an educated guess that magnetosome will have a higher probability to be successfully formed in our bacteria Azotobacter rather than E. coli due to its intracellular microaerobic characteristic.

Quantitative Analysis Tool for Fluorescence Microscopy
We have developed a tool to analyze fluorescence individually for each bacterial cell, based on ImageJ and MATLAB. The tool takes a LIF microscopy image as an input and outputs the 2D data analysis (Biological, Individual) or 3D data analysis (Technical, Biological, Individual).

Software repository
Our software is available on the iGEM GitHub software repository!
The following files are required for this tutorial:
MATLAB post processing script: post_processing.m .
ImageJ macro: Interlab.ijm .
Sample TIFF file: NTNU_Trondheim_Tutorial_Sample.tiff .
Preparing the data set files
The microscope software (LAS AF, Leica) provides the data set in a LIF format. This file has about 1 GB size. While ImageJ can read LIF format, it does not manage the memory very well, and cannot upload the images simultaneously. One method to circumvent this issue is to convert the LIF file into many TIFF files. Each TIFF file contains one fluorescence image and one bright field image. Download the bfconvert utility to convert the Leica LIF files into a set of TIFF files. The utility is available from http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.1.3/ .

We only use the Bacteria Escherichia coli DH5a NEB Turbo and K12 which are common laboratory strains [1] , also considered as Level 1 Biosafety Containment agent.
However, there is a number of standard lab reagents that we require for our project, that are harmful on contact. These include:
Ethidium Bromide:
Acute: Hazardous when ingested or inhaled, and is an irritant of the skin and eye. Chronic: In the long term exposure can have carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic effects, and can cause developmental toxicity.
Polyethyleneimine:
May be harmful if inhaled. Causes respiratory tract irritation. May be harmful if absorbed through skin. Causes skin irritation. Causes eye irritation. May be harmful if swallowed.
Glutaraldehyde:
Eye: Causes eye irritation and burns. May cause permanent visual impairment. May cause chemical conjunctivitis and corneal damage. Skin: May cause skin sensit"

Overview
During the course of project we had the opportunity to attend two iGEm meetups in London. On July 31st, Birkbeck hosted the first London iGEM Meetup, in collaboration with UCL, London Biohackers and University of Westminster. All teams got a chance to present their project - it was a great afternoon and very useful practice for the Giant Jamboree.  More recently, University of Westminster hosted the second meetup, which was a two day event 4-5 September, where a lot more teams from around the country could present their work and bounce back ideas that woukd aid the final presentations. We found these meetups to be of great importance not only because they acted as ""dress rehearsals"", but also it was a chance to get people to complete our questionnaires and give us vital feedback that improved aspects of our project. With this, we would like to thank Birkbeck and Westminster for the invites and the opportunity.

Language project
The Chinese team OUC-China created a comic book where it describes microbiology aspects to the non-scientific community. They wanted to translate it into several kinds of languages in order to popularize synthetic biology and they proposed us to translate the book into our native language (French).
So we jumped on board this interesting educational project, where the team sent us the English script of the comic book and we translated it into French . Translating this comic book was very rewarding: see how the members of the Chinese team explains notions of biology judiciously with an electric circuit or even having to discover notions that we didn't know before.
We would have liked to go much further in this collaboration. For example we could have used these comic books in interventions with the public, but we couldn't for lack of time. But if we could, we would have done it without hesitation.
In addition, on the Chinese team, the French comic strip was printed, and some brochures were distributed in local schools and they explained the importance of this collaboration through the diversity of languages. We were more than happy to take part in one of the largest educational collaborations."

OVERVIEW
EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES - FROM PROJECT TO PRODUCT
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Overview
Oscillate is completely different from any project we have undertaken. This year, we have engineered a new way for cells to interact with external stimuli. With this groundbreaking creation and new biotechnology, we wanted to explore the legal and ethical consequences of emerging biological technologies. To achieve this, we tasked ourselves with deeply analyzing the ethics of sharing knowledge about emerging technologies, different business development paths, and intellectual property. Through research articles, interviews with researchers, consultation with legal experts, and thoughtful discussion, we developed a full view of our project. We were able to gain perspective from innovation to implementation.
Emerging Technologies - From Project to Product
From Project
Because of its novelty and inherent foundational value, the Oscillate platform presents our team with a unique set of considerations when thinking of its implications in biotechnology and beyond. Therefore, we decided to contact the rapidly growing, intensely innovative synthetic biology company Ginkgo Bioworks, which as been pushing at the vanguard of what synthetic biology can accomplish. Based in Boston, Massachusetts, Ginkgo Bioworks specializes in organismal engineering, especially with yeast. We had the pleasure of speaking with Grace Chuang, who works on the creative and outreach team in the company, on how Ginkgo approaches the synthetic biology, and the challenges and considerations that come with innovating at the cutting edge. Ginkgo’s workflow is divided into three fundamental stages - designing, building, and testing newly engineered organism - with the ultimate goal of making biology faster and efficient to engineer. This process is based in their ‘foundry’, which is unique, high throughput, horizontally integrated platform for organismal engineering that takes projects from clients in diverse areas of applications. This has interesting implications for Oscillate, and has compelled us to potentially frame our advancements as a mini-platform, a basis for many applications.
With Ginkgo’s pioneering work"

It has to be activated in a small volume of water to treat in order to activate the consortium. If the water is contaminated by V. cholerae, the device will release AMPs. Once the active agent is released, the water volume could be increased. The simplicity of the system usage allows easy scale up of the device to meet any volume to treat.
Fig 9: our 3D printed protection cylinder.
How we defined the end-line customers
There was two antagonist visions when we started the project: the device could be set up for tourist use, with a sport water flask adapted for trekking situation, or the device could be designed to meet a contaminated village requirements. We opted for the second, because our integrated human practice ( see here ) efforts allowed us to define how to provide the solution on the field through NGOs, and because our solution is cheap and easy enough to be used by people with low money or education levels. Moreover, the imported cholera cases into developed countries are rare. 11 We can assess that the methods deployed to protect the tourists in endemic areas are enough efficient in comparison with the number of local people contaminated by the cholera.
How to think and produce the device? Working with industrials.
Fig. 10: meeting with the Deputy Director of CRITT Bio-Industries (Regional Center for Innovation and Technological Transfert in the field of Bio-Industries).
We were very attentive from the beginning to the entrepreneurship aspects of the project (see here ). We felt it would be frustrating to gather and validate science without wondering about the feasibility on the field of our technology. We therefore discussed with industrials, especially from startup ( Testimonies here ). They sensibilized us to think at a larger scale for the cycle of life of the product, its sustainability, or the environment in which the product may be used. They also helped us to have a pragmatic approach and explore the market opportunity ( see here ).
We have already tested some technical aspect of the project, such has validating the membrane material ( see Results ), testing the capacity of V. harveyi and P. pastoris to be lyophilized and then co-cultured together, or building a first prototype for the device ( Device section ). Thanks to modeling, we have also demonstrated the feasibility of our strategy under plausible device dimension and microbial concentrations. Our model estimates we have to wait one hour before drinking a non-contaminated water ( see Model ).

BIT,2013,Team:BIT-China#humanpractice.html_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM competition platform and made remarkable achievements. This year is the first time we BIT - China in Beijing institute of technology take part in iGEM competition, and this meeting provided us an opportunity to communicate with them to make us more deeply understand the form of iGEM competition, content and some matters needing attention and bring us more convenience. Synthetic biology in our university also belongs to the early stage. In this exchange activity, we knew more about the development of synthetic biology and mature application of synthetic biology. How to better use the method of synthetic biology and make more people know about synthetic biology becomes our common goals.
In September we had a chance to share our idea with the Peking team. They introduced their project and we showed our presentation to them. Their teacher point out our shortcoming and gave us some advices. Because it is our first time to take part in iGEM, so they gave us many suggestions about the program of competition. In a word, we learn a lot from them and set up a friendship with peking team.
In May 2013, BIT - China came to Tsinghua university made communication activities with iGEM teams named Tsinghua led by Chen Guoqiang on synthetic biology. Tsinghua university is one of the most famous universities, the high-level personnel training and the important bases of scientific and technological research in China. We really admired the long history of Tsinghua university mixed with young vitality of new power of synthetic biology. From the first race in 2009 to today, Tsinghua has been in the high level of entries to inspire us make more progress as the models. Although iGEM's only a game, it has set up a platform to share, propaganda and explore the synthetic biology. We rejoice for the vigorous development of new technology, and are proud that we can do our best to enter the science hall.Although iGEM's only a game, it has set up a platform to share, propagate and explore the synthetic biology.
A model iGEM was hosted on 7 September by peking team, seven teams came for it. These universities include Tianjin University, Fudan University, Ocean University of China and so on. The activity was made by two parts: presentation and poster. In presentation, every team showed a different style, and their projects are creative and wonderful. We learnt from each other and found many advantages to polish our project.

Ethics Workshop with AIF
This morning Fahd, Stefan, Mandy and I attended the Ethics workshop held by AIF.  Team members from the U of L and U of A teams were there and we got a chance to meet them and talk about their projects.  The first part of the workshop was led by Dr. Gregor Wolbring and Dr. Lori Sheremeta, and we discussed the importantce of ethical considerations in Synthetic Biology.  Each team had previously been assigned a team from last year that did well in the Human Practices section of their project and we did research on what they had done.  We shared these findings with the rest of the group, explaining what we felt they did well as well as what we felt they could improve on.  After this, we shared some of our ideas about what ethical considerations would be important for our own projects.  We gave the other teams feedback and talked about some of the issues.
This workshop really got us thinking about ethical issues and where we want to go with our project in particular.  We also got a"

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#stakeholders_-_-_TEXT.html," limitations: poor infrastructure, low level of education of the workers, due to the fact they don’t have great exposure to technology.  Another problem is posed by the heavy machinery. Mr. Brady recalled cases on Angola, where the equipment was not able to arrive at the field.
In addition, the equipment consumes a lot of fuel and with metal detections battery life represents an issue. These are small things, but they tend to become obstacles in the long-run.
NPA has a Humanitarian department. What brings them to a particularly country has to deal with the urgency, ability to raise funds, humanitarian impact.  Priorities are brought from outside. Within the countries there is coordination done trough national authorities and United Nations to make sure there are no redundancies in the process.
Mr. Brady mentioned also about the  Global Landmines survey Initiative.  This was supposed to be an impact survey and get some sense of the impact. Yet, the number of the affected area is not 100% accurate as they were coming back with exaggerated areas. For instance in Yemen were identified  over 900 square kilometers. They were taking into account only the face value, and in the end it turned out being smaller. Demining technical people where involved to bring the numbers down ( and was possible to up to 20%). This urges to work with technical people and then delineate the area. The results of the survey are available online. The database that is used in all mines programmes is the Information  Management System for Mine Action.
Because we wanted to have a cost-benefit analysis of our device, ELECTRACE used in order to detect landmines, we asked about the current typical prices for the detection method. We found out that the target price for screening the area is less than 1 dollar per square meter, including all the costs: logistics, administration costs, etc. However, in some cases can go beyond this value, or could be  more expensive, depending on the locations. For instance, in Cyprus the costs were higher due to the fact is a more developed country.
A notable aspect to mention here is the huge amount of square meters that have to be initially detected. For instance  in the initial survey 100.0000 square meters are identified; this is brought down trough triangulation of data, to 20.000 square meters. There are square meters included by other organizations, that shouldn’t be included and should be discarded from the beginning.
Next,  we asked the opinion about using ELECTRACE as a detection system for landmines and how feasible would be to detect landmines by taking samples from"

Specificity- Gel electrophoresis sorts each protein sample according to size, shape, and charge. The observed bands give an indication as to the size of the protein or polypeptide. Additionally, as the detection is based on antibody binding, the process can locate a specific protein in a sample of over 300,000 different proteins.
ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay)10
Relatively cheap reagents with a long shelf life.
Sensitivity and specificity higher than western blot analysis.
No radiation, as opposed to exposure during binding the antibody to the protein or disposing of chemicals from western blot analysis.
Faster and easier procedure than western blot analysis.
The results are quantitative rather than qualitative (as in western blot analysis).
Applicable for a wide range of proteins.
 
Weaknesses:
In the article Liddelow, 20171 the activation is induced by injecting mouse models with LPS rather than adding LPS to cell culture. Therefore, the strength of the activation may be lower in our experiment. Additionally, we do not measure the concentration of the cytokines produced after the microglia are incubated with LPS overnight. Meaning that the astrocyte activation is induced with an unknown concentration of cytokines, as well as other unknown factors"

UFAM_Brazil,2014,Team:UFAM Brazil#Colombia_-_-_TEXT.html," financial instruments to strengthen the companies based biotechnology, adapt and review related to access to genetic resources and their derivatives and adjust regulatory framework and regulations update on production and marketing of biotech drugs and herbal products (Hurtado 2012). From the capacity needs and infrastructure for research in the area of genetic engineering in the country, the importance for Colombia told with updates satisfactory to develop genomic studies and enable advances in the study of biodiversity was established. To provide this perspective, the National System of Science, Technology and Innovation signed a special cooperation between -Colciencias-, Roche and the University of Antioquia for the functioning of the National Center for Genome Sequencing (CNSG) who provide services independently to universities, research centers and companies that need. However, there is a problem related to scientific research within the legal framework in Colombia. The problem consists of several drawbacks for contracts that grant legal access to genetic resources and biological collections in the country and the long waiting time for obtaining research and collecting permits to investigate the biodiversity itself.
RESEARCH, PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATION
The statistical analysis to measure the status of biotechnology in developing countries is the responsibility of the OAS (Organization of American States). In December 2004, a study was conducted in Bogotá, under the coordination of the OST (Organization for Economic Cooperation Development). From the perspective of scientific and technological capacity, measured in units of research, research projects and modern biotechnology, Colombia has 184 research units and 1,007 researchers linked to 678 projects. On the production of these groups in relation to the number of patent applications Colombia has 12 groups and centers in Colombia 54% work in agricultural biotechnology. Development programs of biotechnology may be conducted by ministries, research centers and bodies promoting science and technology, with its own resources or multilateral funding agencies. (Castanõ 2013).
Starting from a survey made by  Colombia_uniandes team,  where 40 people were interviewed and asked questions on their  knowledge of synthetic biology, and as expected ,according to the data collected by the team  (seen on graph 1 ),most people were not aware of the development in this field. Thus, raising data about the perception of synthetic biology and biotechnology should be done in a way that the population could feel as a part of the development reached in the researches.
Rapid advances in biotechnology have raised a strong political reaction in some countries. A properly informed public is an essential condition for the advance in the area is not undermined because of a political reaction (Camargo 2005).

Goettingen,2013,Team:Goettingen#Project#OurProject_-_-_TEXT.html," The ydaO Riboswitch has two states: ""ON"" and ""OFF"". The switch between the two states depends on the presence of c-di-AMP: basically, when c-di-AMP is there, the Riboswitch is ""OFF"" and when there is no c-di-AMP, the Riboswitch is ""ON"". We cloned a reporter gene cassette CFP downstream of the native promoter + ydaO Riboswitch. This reporter system should act similarly to our first reporter system: when there is c-di-AMP, no signal is expected, but when there is no c-di-AMP, there will be a fluorescence signal.
We modified, improved and created several BioBricks during the construct of our reporter system. To know more, please go to our subteam page and parts page .
Microarray
We focused mainly on the genes, whose expression level is regulated by c-di-AMP. Therefore, we compared the transcriptomic data of wild type with those of a hyperactive strain of Bacillus, which produces more c-di-AMP.
By doing so, we are able to: first, find other compartments which also respond to c-di-AMP and therefore can be used to construct our reporter system, second we can shed light on the signaling web of c-di-AMP.
In the collaboration with iGEM Team Groningen, we accomplished the microarray analysis, which has given us a first glimpse on all genes which could be regulated by c-di-AMP. Among those genes, ydaO caught most our attention. ydaO motif is reported to be a c-di-ATP-sensing Riboswitch in Bacillus substilis (unpublished data). We confirmed the array data with qRT-PCR. And the results consisted with array data. Therefore we believe we identified another genetic element that responds to c-di-AMP and we directly used it to build our second reporter system.
To know more about our work, please visit subteam page and parts page .
Diadenylate cyclase
As the homeostasis of c-di-AMP is very important for Listeria monocytogenes (Witte et al., 2013), a Gram-positive human pathogen, we are convinced that the DAC is a very promising target for the development of highly specific antibiotic substances which exclusively act on Gram-positive bacteria and are not harmful to Gram-negative ones, including the gut bacterium Escherichia coli. Therefore, we aimed to reveal the protein structure of a not yet characterized diadenylate cyclase domain.
First we tried to express the complete CdaA"

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Hydrocarbon_-_-_TEXT.html," finally successfully transform an AmdA/PSB1C3 plasmid into top 10 cells this week. After a miniprep they showed bands of about 1800 base pairs on the confirmation digest gel, so they were also sent for sequencing this week and had mutagenesis started on the illegal SpeI site. Unfortunately, the sequencing sent early in the week came back with ambiguous results. The forward reaction for AntABC was a match, but its reverse reaction matched to CarAa. Both CarAa reactions matched nothing. Since these two genes are over 20 000 base pairs apart on the template plasmid it is virtually impossible that they were actually combined into one plasmid (PCR extension time would not have been long enough and even if it was the product would have run much above the 3000 base pair mark). This is likely a mistake on Eurofins end, so we are not 100% sure if we have 1 good gene, both of them, or neither. Also the sequence for mutagenized CarAd showed only about the first 100 base pairs, which were correct however not long enough meaning it was a poor reaction and inconclusive. Finally, we also re-started our carbazole degradation assay using the GC-MS at biological sciences. This process will take 2 weeks to demonstrate LD2's ability to degrade carbazole. We are forcing it to use carbazole as a carbon and a nitrogen source in one sample and as only a nitrogen source in another sample (this sample has had glucose added to it).
Desulfurization
This week, progress was made in determining the desulfurization activity of our Rhodococcus strain as measured by the sulfate release using a turbidometric assay. WE encountered numerous challenges in our prescribed protocol as the concentrations that we are using to prepare out standard curve may be too dilute, or the composition of out conditioning agent may be flawed. Additionally, steps were taken to determine the decomposition of DBT to 2-HBP through GCMS analysis, but due to a preparation error, the DBT was added to a growth solution of M9 media prematurely and the autoclaving process decomposed the DBT releasing a yellow colouration into the solution. These two approaches in determining the desulfurization capability of the dsz operon will be further investigated.
Since the dszC second mutagenesis had proven to be unsuccessful last week, the dszC(PstI2 mutated)PstI1 mutagenesis was repeated. Also dszA(PstI1,3,4 mutated"

7.14（B）
After all the hard work of reading documents, we searched out the following anaerobic promoters that might be better than Promoter nir B: Nark, fdeF, J6 oxygen promoter, puc promoter, VHb promoter, mNark, phTERT, and pfdhF.  We hope to identify through experiments whether the property of these promoters is better than Promoter nir B when pressing the target gene we need as we expected.
Meanwhile, we found some anaerobic promoters that we think could be capable of our requirements from the iGEM official website: K239005, K239011, K376006, J61043, K283025, K376003(A), K227007, K258005, K239006, K404106, K387009, K387003, K376003(C), and K376004.  We hope we could testify all these promoters after we received the plat from iGEM.
7.15(A)
Recently we failed to knock out the relevant genes of VNP20009
The final of concentration of arabinose we used was from 10mMol to 100mMol and the inducible time was from 1 to 4 hours. However we didn't get the mutants in salmonella.
Recently we read an article Use of the lambda Red recombinase system to produce recombinant prophages carrying antibiotic resistance genes, in this article the writer used several ways to improve efficacy of recombinant,  First we should check the helper plasmid pKD46 in the first step of the method. Secondly LB agar plates containing kn were used as selective media. Initially we used 50g/ml kn. however this paper recommend that we use lower antibiotic concentrations in the selective media. Once plated, 24 hours of incubation were enough to visualize colonies. The colonies were then transferred to new LB agar plates with higher antibiotic concentrations (kn: 50μg/ml).
7.18(B)
After several days of consideration, we began to draw out our experiment plan.
Considering that the plat from iGEM and the bacteria strains and enzymes we need are not in readiness, we decided to start with the basic experiments of PCR, extraction of plasmids and recycle of plasmids."

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," bacterial components of the chronic wound model by killing S. aureus, amongst other pathogens in the biofilm structure.
Defensin proved to be one of our most successful proteins in the lab - we were able to demonstrate expression of defensin as well as a strong biofilm-inhibiting activity. Additionally, we assembled a defensin construct which allowed us to purify and finally conjugate the protein to spider silk - a big step for the development of SMITe.
Sortase A
The Enzyme
When designing the assembly of the essential parts SMITE constitutes of, i.e. the silk and the combat proteins, we were aiming to create an easily-applicable system for attaching proteins to the silk. The main concern was to be able to attach proteins to the silk without altering their main structure, in fear of disturbing the integrity of the protein's structure and its functionality.
Additionally, the spider silk used in our project was produced by Spiber Technologies using a trademarked recombinant protein which meant we were not able to use a classical genetic engineering approach to create fusion proteins due to confidentiality. When looking for options to circumvent this issue, we came across Sortase A, a bacterial transpeptidase commonly expressed by Gram positive bacteria. It has the ability to break and form new peptide bonds through a nucleophilic attack and is used by Staphylococcus aureus to anchor virulence factors to the cell wall [25] .
The key feature of the enzyme is the specific conjugation reaction it carries out, where the enzyme recognizes a specific amino acid sequence, a so called sorting motif (LPXTG motif in the case of S. aureus) [25] [26] .
Figure 8: Sortase A mediated conjugation
In our project, we chose to isolate the enzyme from S. aureus and make it into a standard BioBrick with an added GB1 sequence to improve solubility [26] .
Our Sortase-A-mediated Immobilization Strategy
Key Achievements
Isolation of Sortase A from S. aureus genome
Assembly with solubility tag GB1
Successful conjugation of peptides to spider silk using commercial enzyme
We aimed to use the specific interaction of Sortase with the sorting motif to conjugate the “combat proteins” to the spider silk. A general strategy for all combat proteins was designed, in which a specific linker-tag sequence (LT) including the sorting motif and a His-tag for purification purposes, are fused with the proteins (see Figure 8), resulting in a finalized gene construct. Each protein when expressed will be equipped"
Paris_Bettencourt,2016,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Indigo_-_-_TEXT.html,", the fabric lightens with wear, producing a characteristic fading pattern (Figure 1).
Denim Washes
The popular appeal of faded denim has lead to the development of many industrial processes that simulate or accelerate the fading process. New denim may be chemically treated, sandblasted, rubbed with sandpaper, or tumbled with abrasive stones prior to sale. These ""wash"" processes soften the fabric, fade the indigo, and produce a distinctive pattern and appearance. Especially with the trend toward high fashion and premium jeans, designers are motivated to discover new and innovative wash processes. The global jeans market was predicted to be 56 billion USD in 2014 (Agarwal, 2009).
Enzymatic Biowashing
In last few decades, enzymes have become a popular tool in the denim industry. Enzymes are mostly used in two ways: for bleaching the indigo dye from jeans, and for treating the toxic effluents after the denim wash. Enzymatic methods are used because they require less energy, produce fewer chemical by-products, and cause less damage than chemical or abrasive washes (Couto, 2006). Some of the enzyme treatments use fungal laccases to fade denim (Campos, 2001). Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) are copper-containing oxidases that act on a variety of substrates. Acting on indigo dye, laccases abstract one electron from each aromatic amine, leaving behind an unstable radical that quickly degrades. Whole live cells with laccase activity have been used as bioremediation agents, in particular for indigo-containing wastewater from textile factories (Conceição, 2013). This activity was also the inspiration for the Bielefeld 2012 iGEM team.
Thus, guided by this knowledge, we decided to focus on laccase enzymes to degrade indigo, and to potentially produce beautiful patterns on the jeans when placed in the right micro-organism. More precisely, we are focusing on bpul, a laccase naturally found in the spore coat of Bacillus pumilus. There are several reasons why we have chosen this enzyme:
It already exists in the registry of Standard Biological Parts, and it is one of the most well documented BioBricks.
Apart from the registry, a good biochemical analysis and methods can be found in the paper by Reiss et. al 2011.
The laccasse comes from bacteria (Bacillus pumilus) which makes it potentially easier to express and study in E. coli than fungal"
TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#DeskStudy_-_-_TEXT.html,": Anti-personnel (AP) mines and anti-tank (AT) mines. Anti-personnel mines are specifically designed to reroute or push back foot soldiers. These mines carry enough explosive material to kill or disable their victim. They can be activated by pressure, a tripwire or remote detonation.
Additionaly, There are three main types of AP mines that can be divided as following [3]:
Blast mine: This type of mine is usually buried only a few centimeters beneath the surface and is activated by a pressure plate. It is designed to destroy an object in close proximity and to break it into fragments to cause secondary damage.
Bounding mine: This type of mine is propelled to a height of approximately one meter when triggered, before the main charge is ignited. In this way, it damages the vital parts of the victim instead of the legs.
Fragmentation mine: This type of mine releases sharp fragments in all directions when activated. It is able to cause injury at distances up to 200 meters away and kill at closer distances. The fragments used in the mines are either metal or glass. Fragmentation mines can be bounding or ground-based.
Anti-tank mines function in a similaressentially the same way as AP mines, but the pressure needed to detonate them and the amount of explosive material is several times bigger. AT mines are capable of destroying tanks or armored vehicles and kill the people in or around it [3].
Use of landmines
Land mines as we know them today where first used during the first world warFirst World War as defense against tanks. These mines where very large and easy to detect. Often enemy soldiers would remove the mines for their own use. To prevent this, the first anti-personnel mines were developed[4]. The use of land mines as an important offensive and defensive weapon started in World War II [5]. The use of land mines reached its peak in the Cold War, especially in the conflicts in Vietnam and Afghanistan[6].
The use of land mines provides military strategist with the ability to provide a defensive barrier around vulnerable sites and utilities, channel enemy troops into a unmined area where themselves would be vulnerable to attack, deny the enemy access to utilities they might need, even after those placing the mines have withdrawn, and assist in surprise attacks and ambushes[5]. Originally, land mines were laid in clearly marked fields. However, the use of land mines shifted from use against military targets to use against civilians, in order to terrorize communities and prevent population movement. For this purposecase, mines were placed at random locations without any specific pattern [7].

He Peng
I'm a second year student studying Biochemistry as my major with Statistics and Computer science as my two minors. And I’m also the only student who is so energetic as to make such a choice in my university. I think a good scientist should have the ability to see the nature behind large amounts of data and explain a phenomenon quantitatively and precisely, and that's why I try to get myself armed with the knowledge of Statistics and Computer science. In our HKU iGEM team, I work as one of the seven principal investigators to connect theory to practice. It's really fun to spend time in lab day and night seeking for the secrets of synthetic biology. And it is iGEM competition that lets me enjoy the joys of teamwork and learn to overcome hardships in research.
Salma
Hi, I am going into my second year of undergraduate studies majoring in Biomedical Engineering. I applied to iGEM in an attempt to broaden my knowledge of not only theoretical but also practical Biochemistry, since previously I have only enrolled in one elementary course in the subject. Having had no previous lab experience, I have made my share of mistakes in the lab, but it is all worth the relief and pride you feel when an experiment finally gives you the result you want. I am really happy to have been given the chance to be a private investigator and to work with the most wonderful teammates.
George
I am Leung Man Hong, George, a biochemistry student from HKU. In this year iGEM, I would like explore the world of synthetic biology and use the power of genetic engineering to make some advancement in human living. We are going to design a Bio-safety Net so as to minimize the harmful effect of some human activities to the environment. I hope that we will succeed and try make a step to do something for our home, The Earth, as a scientist.
Trista
I am Trista. I was born in HK. I am a year 3 student studying Biotechnology and Microbiology. I like watching movies and reading leisure books. It is a special experience to participate in the iGEM competition. In my team, I am responsible for the investigation of the project and what I have to do are the practical parts. My team members and I are actually having a great time in the lab. I enjoy the time when we are working together"
UC_Davis,2010,Team:UC Davis#Judging_-_-_TEXT.html," or Device of your own design and construction works as expected
When we originally used the LVA-tagged cI repressor in our construct, it was ligated to an RFP coding region.  We realized that the cI coding region was initiating unwanted transcription because the cells would express RFP, even without a promoter upstream of it.
After removing the barcode in the LVA-tagged cI repressor from phage Lambda, we ligated the part to a construct that had RFP downstream of the coding region of Bba_K327018 (our newly submitted LVA-tagged cI repressor sans barcode region).  This time, the cells did not spontaneously express RFP, thus proving that the modified part works as we expected.  For more information on how we experimentally determined the root of the problem with the original part, see the cI-Lambda section .

Groningen,2014,Team:Groningen#Template#MODULE#project#toolbox_-_-_TEXT.html,", NisE and NisG form an ABC-exporter together.  They provide extra immunity and become present in the cell when nisin is  encountered in the environment.3
 
 
Figure 1: Function of the different genes of the nisin operon.
 
 
Of the nisin operon, NisA , NisC , NisR, NisK and PNisA were sent to iGEM HQ. NisA can be used in L. lactis NZ9800, a NisA deficient strain, to let it produce nisin.4 PNisA is a promoter that is induced by nisin. NisR and NisK can be used to detect nisin and activate nisin inducible promoters.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vector
 
To get BioBricks in L. lactis, a compatible backbone is needed. For this, we used a well known plasmid that is known to work in L. lactis, pIL253 , and made this BioBrick compatible. The plasmid is a shuttle vector that can be used in L. lactis and Bacillus subtilis. It carries erythromycin resistance as a selection marker and has a mRFP coding device between the BioBrick prefix and suffix, so selection on inserts in this vector is possible.
 
 
 
 
Promoters
 
For expressing genes in L. lactis, promoters are needed. Together with the most standard RBS and the standard double terminator they get genes transcribed and translated. The set of promoters that is used for the L. lactis toolbox is the  promoter collection that was BioBricked by the Uppsala iGEM team in 2013. The set consists of the promoters CP1 , CP8 , CP11 , CP29 , CP30 , CP41 and CP44 . The promoters originate from L. lactis and have first been described by Jensen and Hammer in 1998.1 The promoters were placed in front of a fluorescent marker in L. lactis, so their relative strength is known.
 
 
 
 
Fluorescent marker
 
Last but not least, a fluorescent marker that has a high performance in L. lactis was BioBricked and added to the toolbox. This marker is a version of the sfGFP protein, called sfGFP(Bs), that was optimized for Bacillus subtilis. When the optimized sfGFP was tested, it showed high performance in L. lactis.5 The sfGFP(Bs"

Took out all four samples for standard check of OD and mass of copper samples. Solid media was also examined. All samples (liquid and solid) were photographed.
Only sample 2 of copper 2 in liquid media was able to be measured for the other samples were either etched by bacteria or physically torn apart by shaking or by the AMF media.
Solid Media Samples:
Copper 2- Sample 1 (without bacteria) Removal: 9:51, Return: 9:55 Observations: Green copper sample on surface. No clear media visible. (see photo below).
Copper 2- Sample 2 (with bacteria) Removal: 9:51, Return: 9:55 Observations: A light  shade of green on copper. Outer edges of the copper appeared black. Media was a uniformed amber color. No observable size change. (see photo below).
Note: One or both of the solid media samples dried up, therefore requiring another set of experiments.
Liquid Media Samples:
Copper 2- Sample 1 (with bacteria) Removal1: 9:56, Return1: 10:23, Removal2: 10:41, Return2: 10:54* Observations: Visible brown and murky copper color to liquid media. Pellets formed when the media was centrifuged. Copper appeared to turn into little powder, pellet form, and conclude mass is difficult to measure and may alter data. (see photo below).

Stony_Brook,2017,Team:Stony Brook#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," we chose the maximum likelihood method because it is one of the most robust methods, and is favorable for phylogeny reconstruction of sequences where we have limited prior knowledge of their evolutionarily relationships, such as novel bacteriocins [12]. Because our bacteriocins’ divergence times were relatively unknown to us, we also ruled out maximum parsimony and minimum evolution methods, because these methods tend to be unreliable given deeper divergence times.
Phylogenetic reconstruction using the maximum likelihood method was carried out using MEGA. The Jones Taylor Thronton (JTT) substitution model was used because MEGA’s jModelTest determined this model to be the best fit for our pool of sequences. The divergence times for each taxon, relative to the outgroup, was then computed using the RelTime method in MEGA [13].
