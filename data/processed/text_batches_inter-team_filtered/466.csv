RECRUITMENT EVENT, KTH, KI and KONSTFACK
To keep iGEM alive in Stockholm, an organisation called Stockholm Genetically Engineered Machines (SGEM) was created 2015 of the former iGEM Stockholm team. SGEM consists alumnis from previous iGEM Stockholm teams. Together with SGEM, we held 4 recruitment events at the different schools, to explain about our journey, how amazing iGEM is, and how we want more students to be a part of this! We also had the help of TU Darmstadt during this event. For more information on our collaboration with Darmstadt, please click here .
We also hosted an event at Konstfack, University College of Arts, Crafts and Design to inspire art students, as iGEM is not all about science, and science is not only for scientists!
COFFEE HOURS
As a Swedish team, we understand the importance of a good fika break, or a chance to take some coffee and food and go back to work. These coffee hours are normally a break for students, where they recharge energy and have the chance to mingle and meet students from other programs. Being such a multidisciplinary team, we understand the value of having these relaxed talks with other students, in order to get inspired, share ideas and solve problems. Because of this, we thought it would be a good idea to host different coffee hours at the schools we study at.
During the coffee hours we hosted, we were able to discuss with students from our schools different parts of our project, the prospects of our project, the future of iGEM Stockholm and the relevance of organizations like ours in the student life of an innovative city like Stockholm.
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
With reaching out to High School Students we wanted to not only encourage young students to participate in iGEM but also to raise interest in going a scientific pathway.  We think that iGEM is a unique opportunity for high school students who are at a critical point with respect to their educational and career choices. With hands-on experience in a great variety of multidisciplinary facets not only in synthetic biology, instead also in mathematics, computer science or even very different disciplines like communication, finance or social engagement to find a future role in their individual career.
We went to one of our old high schools, the roots where we learned all about biology to give something back to our privileged educational pathway. Our teacher was very grateful about our presentation and saw iGEM as a great chance to understand DNA"

4. Add 700μl Buffer WB to the Spin Column then centrifuge it at 12000rpm, under room temperature for 30 seconds and throw away the filtrate. (Make sure that specified volume of 100% ethanol has been added to the Buffer WB.)
5. Repeat Step (4) once.
6. Place the Spin Column on the Collection Tube, then centrifuge it at 12000rpm, under room temperature for 1 minutes.
7. Place the Spin Column on a new 1.5ml centrifuge tube. Add 25-30μl sterile water or Elution Buffer to the center of the membrane of the Spin Column and stand the solution under room temperature for 1 minutes. (If the sterile water or Elution Buffer is heated to 60 degrees Celsius, then the elution efficiency can be improved.)
8. Centrifuge the solution at 12000rpm, under room temperature for 1 minutes to elute DNA.
7. Gel electrophoresis
1) Prepare agarose gel
Experimental supplies: 1×TAE, agarose
1. Weigh agarose according to its working concentration. Usually 0.8% or 1% is suitable for running quantitative gel or testing PCR product.
2. Using 1×TAE to dissolve the agarose by careful warming. (Heat it in microwave oven and boil it two times so that the agarose dissolves completely)
3. When the temperature decreases to 55 degrees Celsius, add Gelstain and shake it up. (1μl Gelstain per 10 ml gel)
4. Pour the prepared gel into the electrophoresis bath, wait for the gel to concrete and reserve it.
2) Add sample
1. For running quantitative gel, add 1μl sample; For testing PCR product, add 3-5μl sample.
2. Mix up the sample and 10×loading buffer, add the mixture into spotting hole. Be careful not to leave any air bubbles, which will change the volume of the sample.
3. Add corresponding volume of Marker according to the manual. (Usually 5μl Marker per 10μl spotting hole)
4. Set up constant voltage 170V, switch on for about 15 minute. When the indicator line reach 1/2-2/3 of the whole gel, switch off.
5. Use Gel imager to show the imaging of the gel.

Meet Kaatje O'Donnell
My name is Kaatje and I am in grade 12. This is my first year in iGEM and it has been an experience completely unlike anything else I've done. In the past, I haven't been extremely interested in the sciences, so iGEM has been a great introduction to bio and chem, although I have been more involved in the human practices and ethics side of things. Outside of iGEM, I enjoy competing gymnastics, playing the drums, and writing. I love being a part of iGEM!

Systems Biology Engineering
I always wanted to be an astronaut. I wanted to travel and uncoil the unknown corridors of space itself. As my envisioned future gradually decayed and steadily got replaced by the grim and earth-bound realities of scholarship, I found myself still gazing towards stellar things. If I could still see them, that is. Eyesight was never a prime attribute due to heavy book-reading. It was at this point in time that I fell in love with the art of pipetting and working long hours in slightly unexplored corners of just about any laboratory, furiously and with great care moving small amounts of liquids from one container to another. As for know this constitutes enough reason for existence, refraining me from killing myself in a freak-space-rocket accident.

I always wanted to save the world. Easy said, difficult to do. After all, what does it really mean? Saving the environment from pollution, or eradicating famine, or maybe obliterating poverty... At some point I became interested in biology and genetic engineering, which seems to be a good starting point. With the cutting edge techniques and applications, modern biology offers immense possibilities for improving the quality of life for humankind. I want to contribute to it."

Stony_Brook,2018,Team:Stony Brook#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," We also used this vector in an attempt to improve the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) BioBrick by codon optimization; unfortunately, we could not collect data on this BioBrick.
This vector is a suicide vector with neutral site II (NSII). In cyanobacteria, there are stretches of DNA in their genomes called neutral sites, which can be replaced with other DN without any detriment to the cell. Our “suicide vector” is composed of DNA that identically matches the neutral sites found in cyanobacteria. Our genes of interest and antibiotic resistance genes are flanked on both sides by the neutral site DNA (>300 bp on both sides). When our plasmid enters cells (it does this because the cells are naturally competent), the identical strands of DNA undergo a double homologous recombination event, and the DNA from the plasmid is integrated into the genome of the cyanobacteria. In the plasmid, there is no origin of replication for cyanobacteria, so this mechanism is the only way in which the exogenous DNA enters the cell. We screen colonies with antibiotics to ensure this event has taken place.
Characterization of Novel Promoters: pAM1414
pAM1414 is a promoterless luxAB reporter plasmid, designed for promoters inserted upstream of luxA to express both luxA and luxB. The luxAB bioreporter generates a light signal in the presence of decanal. The smR gene confers resistance to two antibiotics: streptomycin and spectinomycin. We selected for the vector in cultures using spectinomycin in HB101 competent E. coli and both streptomycin and spectinomycin in our cyanobacteria. We linearized this vector by digestion with BamHI and prevented re-linearization by dephosphorylation with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP). We used this vector to characterize our novel promoters: cpc, cpc-560, idiA, and psbA2.
This vector is a suicide vector with neutral site I (NSI), and works in the same way as pAM2991.
Application of Novel Promoters: pAM1579
pAM1579 is another suicide vector lacking promoters and genes. It does have terminators, but after correspondence with McKenna Hicks, a member from the 2017 UCSC iGEM Team who worked with this vector, we realized that the terminators were oriented in the wrong direction. Therefore, we incorporated these terminators into the constructs for this part of the project. The KanR gene confers resistance to the"

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Indigoidine_-_-_TEXT.html,"-transformations with the engineered indigoidine synthetase indC on a pSB1C3 plasmid pRB19 with a chloramphenicole resistance.
We successfully assembled pRB15-18.
BioBricks for the Registry
As a first set of BioBricks we chose the coding sequences of the four PPTases sfp, svp, entD and delC as well as the indigoidine synthetase indC. Since indC contains two internal RFC[10] cutting sites (EcoRI and SpeI), the DNA sequence had to be mutated for the part submission. Therefore we first assembled pRB21, which is identical to pRB3 but doesn't contain a PPTase.
We successfully assembled pRB21 and amplified the PPTases with the BioBrick RFC[10] prefix and suffix (Primer KH13-20). Next week we cloned the PPTases into the pSB1C3 backbone using restriction cloning and removed the EcoRI and SpeI cutting sites contained in indC using a CPEC mutagenesis strategy.
Week 17
T-Domain Shuffling
We started inserting new T-Domains into indC to check their functionality. In total we first assembled 19 variants of pRB19, which are named pRB19-Txx. The appended three-letter code identifies the respective T-domain or TTE-domain and is listed on our plasmid page in the materials section.
Since PCR screenings of pRB19 were inconsistent, we started with replacing the T-Domain of pRB14, which contains sfp as a PPTase. Screenings and sequencing results showed that assembly and transformation were correct but all colonies except for that on the positive control retained a white phenotype. We tested all the other T-domains on the newly assembled pRB19 with every PPTase pRB15-18 next week.
T-Domain Shuffling – PPTase Plasmids
As the PPTase plasmids pRB15-18 showed red colonies after retransformation of a positively prepped colony, we picked new colonies and prepped them. We will do the co-transformation experiments with the new version of pRB15 but with the old ones of pRB16-18.

Exhibition
We hold a one-month long display about employing synthetic biology to combat antimicrobial resistance and some other applications of synthetic biology as medicine and energy, such as MDC,which is cooperated with the Guangdong Science Center, the largest science center around the Asia, and helped with SCAU (you can have a look at their wiki). We have prepared for the exhibition for half a year and tried to connect with many companies or schools like SCAU. Finally, our exhibition opened to the public at 1st Oct. 2014. At the first day, we can feel the enthusiasm obviously.
The volunteers selected from our freshmen of our school tried their best to explain the knowledge of the synthetic biology and let them know about the antimicrobial resistance better. All the volunteers were trained strictly by us with our whole heart devoted. Meanwhile, the freshmen who did this work also learned a lot about the synthetic biology and iGEM.
Our exhibition is divided into five parts:
1.exhibition board
The main part is the 10 exhibition boards filled with concepts of synthetic biology and antimicrobial resistance which were made by us with many days forgetting sleep and diet. As this picture shows, our team member was trying his best to explain the safety of synthetic biology. These boards contain the introduction, safety and application in antimicrobial resistance. During these days, many people came to look at these boards and learned a lot.
2.microscope area
The second part is the exhibition of some microbes which can arouse many diseases using the microscopes brought from our laboratory. The public were very interested in them and learned about the bacteria which can arouse the antimicrobial resistance. For example, we displayed some common antimicrobials, like Vancomycin resistant S.aureus (VRSA).

We again verified the presence an insert with the correct length through taq PCR on a dilution of the isolated plasmids with primers biobrick-forward and biobrick-reverse. We also send the isolated plasmid to GATC for sequencing. The sequencing revealed that the insert was indeed correct although there was no coverage of a small part of the insert.
mRFP cI protein balance reporter construction
Transformation of the GA for assembly of the mRFP cI protein balance reporter operon plasmid yielded many colonies. We screened for clones with the correct insert through taq colony PCR with primers biobrick-forward and biobrick-reverse. Prior to colony PCR, the colonies were grown in 40µl LB medium inside a 96-wells plate for 30m. 1µl of the medium was used as template for the colony PCR. Almost all colonies displaying red color on the agar plate, were found to contain an insert of the correct size.
Quorum sensing 2 plasmid system construction
1µg of the purified GFP reporter and pSB1C3 PCR products were digested with NEB enzymes  EcoRI-HF and PstI-HF, both from NEB and according to the NEB digestion protocol 20m at 37℃. We purified both digestion products with the Machery-Nagel PCR purification kit and protocol.
We then used the purified digestions in a ligation with NEB T4 according to the NEB T4 ligase protocol. We used 50ng of pSB1C3 and 3 times as much moles of the of the GFP reporter insert. Ligation was done for 10m at room temperature. The ligation mixture was purified with the Machery-Nagel PCR purification kit and protocol.
The purified ligation was used to transform NEB chemically competent cells according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The transformations were plated on LB agar plates with chloramphenicol. These plates yielded moderate amounts of colonies. Taq Colony PCR identified two colonies as containing a plasmid with the correct insert size.
The plasmids of these two colonies were isolated from 10ml LB cultures using the Machery-Nagel plasmid isolation kit and protocol. The isolated plasmids were verified to contain an insert of the correct size with taq PCR with primer combination biobrick-forward and biobrick-reverse.

However it looks like the two subunits of OBP2A may not be interacting. As this was a first attempt, subsequent assays will be performed in order to determine if in fact the two separated parts of OBP2A aren't interacting in vivo - like these results suggests.

It can also be inferred from this graph that the two parts of OBP2A don't seem to be interacting as it has a low millers activity when compared to the controls. Further assays will be performed in order to determine if the two separated parts of OBP2A aren't interacting in vivo like these results suggests.

The graph seems to suggest that the two subunits of OBP2A may not be interacting in vivo. This can be inferred from the fact that the millers activity of the OBP2A sample lies lower than the negative controls from within the experiment. As a result of this information, one more assay will be prepared in which the two subunits will be switched with regards to the bacterial two hybrid vectors to eliminate any possibility of this being a factor effecting the interaction between the two subunits.

Note
In order to be considered for the Best Model award , you must fill out this page.
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

Introduction Bacterial Growth Curves Signal Peptides + GFP
Chlorite Dismutase Perchlorate Reductase Summary
Introduction
The focus of our lab work was to clone the pcr and cld gene sequences into E. coli and express the enzymes in order to reduce the compound perchlorate into chloride and oxygen.
To do this we grew E. coli in perchlorate and chlorite in order to determine if E. coli could survive and at what concentrations, as this showed what our bioreactor bacteria could cope with. This was done with E. coli BL21 (DE3)  that did not contain our two gene sequences.
After this, we cloned the genes separately into the plasmid pSB1C3 using the cloning strain E. coli DH5α. Sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and then the DNA constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). This strain was chosen because we used the inducible T7 promoter to express our enzymes and this strain contains the genes which will allow expression.
The pcr and cld genes from the organisms we chose (Azospira oryzae, Azospira suillum, Dechloromonas aromatica and Nitrospira defluvii, respectively abbreviated to: AO, AS, DA and ND), contained native signal-peptides. In order to determine whether these signal peptides were functional in E. coli we fused these to GFP (sGFP). Again the T7 promoter was used to drive expression.
Our lab work also looked at assaying for perchlorate in tap water by using microscopy to identify crystals produced by the compound. This was part of a key collaboration with Virginia, a university in an area with high perchlorate concentration (see collaborations page).

Growth curves of various bacterial species in perchlorate and chlorite

The relevant legislation governing DRs is EU Directive 2001/18 and domestic legislation as follows: Environmental Protection Act 1990, Section 111 and 112 and the Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations 2002.   In general, the introduction of GMOs into the environment should be carried out according to the “step by step” principle. This means that work with the GMO should begin under containment first (i.e., under laboratory conditions) in order for the researchers to demonstrate that the organism behaves as expected. The containment measures can then be reduced and the scale of release increased gradually, step by step, but only if evaluation of the earlier steps in terms of protection of human health and the environment indicates that the next step can be taken. It is the HSE who regulate the contained use of GMOs.   An application for the deliberate release of a GMO would come to Defra. All documentation submitted should be as a ‘word’ document and should not contain any confidential information as we are required to publish the information on Gov.uk.  You may want to look at previous applications (for plants and non-plants) here: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/genetically-modified-organisms-applications-and-consents   All potential trial sites should be included in the application; it is better to include a site that is not used rather than issue a variation to include a site that was omitted. If citing references, the applicant should provide either a copy of the paper, or a link to it, and be mindful of copyright as it forms part of the application form which is published on the internet. The public are always invited to make representation on any risks of damage being caused to the environment by the release. The independent Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) is an independent panel of experts providing advice to Government. ACRE will consider the application and also any scientific evidence from the representation. Defra is responsible for notifying the European Commission and placing information on a (statutory) UK public register.    An applicant must inform various Authorities of a trial application and is required to place an advertisement in a national newspaper within 10 days of the application being acknowledged. Defra is grateful to know whether there might be any additional pro-active media around a trial application a few weeks before it takes place. There is a fee of £5,000 per application.

Pneumosensor Module Description
Overview
Pneumosensor primarily adopts the quorum sensing pathway components in Streptococcus pneumoniae to detect populations of S. pneumoniae. The main     advantage of this system is its detection specificity- the Gram-positive quorum sensing mechanism is incorporated into the Gram-negative bacteria E. coli to     eliminate possible cross-talk of the autoinducer molecule, competence-stimulating peptide (CSP) with native E. coli molecules.
There are two modules to our Pneumosensor- the Detection Module and the S. pneumoniae σx Promoters Module. The Detection Module comprises of the CSP     receptor ComD, its response regulator ComE and the promoter PcomCDE which is induced by phosphorylated ComE. The σx Promoters Module involves a     highly specific reporting system, whereby σx is associated with RNA polymerase and binds to promoters PcelA and PcomFA which     are specific to σx for activation. These promoters then drive the expression of GFP as a reporting system. Another protein, ComW, is expressed alongside the     σx as its stabilizer against proteolysis.
Detection Module
S. pneumoniae σx promoters Module
Detection Module Description
Figure 1. Detection Module Diagram
CSP released by S. pneumoniae is detected by its receptor ComD, which autophosphorylates at the expenditure of ATP. ComD~P then phosphorylates         ComE. ComE~P then induces the promoter PcomCDE, which drives the expression of GFP.
Transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae, like many other species, depends on specialized state called competence.      Competence is achieved during the exponential growth stage of pneumococcal culture by the secretion of competence-stimulating peptide (CSP"

Tuning Symbiosis Using an Auxotroph System
In nature, we find that symbiosis is often utilized for simplifying complicated processes and facilitating many functions. For this part of project, we’ve decided to replicate and expand upon an experiment we’ve found in the paper A Programmable Escherichia coli Consortium via Tunable Symbiosis as a proof of concept that growth ratios can be controlled.
In the auxotroph experiment, two auxotrophic strains, a tyrosine auxotroph (now referenced to as tyr-) and a tryptophan auxotroph (now referenced as trp-), are used. They are forced to become interdependent through the use of two plasmids: pAK1 and pAK5. Each plasmid allows the export of one metabolite (pAK1 exports tyrosine while pAK5 exports tryptophan), allowing the strains to feed each other. With this set up, one strain cannot survive without the other.
The genes that export the metabolites are placed under inducible promoters to allow us to control the degree to which each metabolite is expressed based on the amount of inducers added. The more metabolites that are exported, the more the strain will grow. Using this method, we can create different ratios between the strains (example: 2 to 1 ratio between the tryptophan auxotroph and the tyrosine auxotroph).
The strains used in our experiments were kindly provided by the Lin Lab at the University of Michigan. Note: Strain Y3 (tyrosine auxotroph) has YFP integrated into its genome. This allows for the two strains to be distinguished during co-culturing.

Maybe there are only two factories in China that manufactures this active pharmaceutical                         ingredient (API) officially; one is in Shenzhen and the other is in Suzhou.
……After biliary drainage, it is very likely that bears will suffer from diseases all over their                         body, which is a torture to them. To resolve this problem, researchers and scientists in our                         country wish to convert CDCA in order to receive UDCA. Currently, their methods are deeply                         restrained by the use of sodium due to its danger and difficulty. If you can convert CDCA to                         UDCA successfully using enzymes, you are making a huge contribution.
Also, there are a lot of problems in the production of UDCA in medical industry. For instance, we                         need to consider the safety and profits of this drug. Thus, there are still a lot of aspects                         need to be considered and experiments need to be done when involved in industrial                         production.

Q4: Could you briefly introduce the issue concerning costs and profits?
A: It is complicated because hydrogen needs to be removed. The chemical composition of UDCA needs                         to refine repeatedly, which is tricky. For example, a concentration of 70% of UDCA? require                         three times of refinement at least in order to reach the standard. Also, the raw materials or                         substances need to be recollected and there will be turnovers and other complex factors during                         the process. So the profits is limited. And now the biggest issue is that the danger of                         production overweights its potential profits.

At the beginning of our experiment, we decided to employ a two enzyme in one                         pot catalyzed reaction(see figure.1). However, after our initial attempt, we found out that the                         reverse reaction was more prevalent than the forward reaction. Thus because of this, the product                         was actually CDCA, the initial reactant, instead of UDCA, our expected product.

Biosensor
Introduction
A biosensor is a system composed of a biological transducing element that produces measurable signal in response to environmental changes. A good example of biosensor, are the bioreporters bacteria that produce visible light in answer to chemicals. Allowing the detection of toxic elements.
The use of genetically modified bacteria was a big step for synthetic biology and became popular for its benefits, including detection in soil and water for heavy metal pollution. In order to have a bioreporter able to be used under different concentrations of mercury, we built a biosensor using Escherichia coli DH5-alpha which express the green fluorescent protein (GFP) only in the presence of this toxic element.
Why Green Fluorescent Protein?
Green fluorescent protein (GFP) cloned from Aequorea victoria, is a popular bioreporter, especially to observe gene expression in eukaryotic and bacteria cell. GFP is a stable protein, and it is autofluorescent, remaining fluorescent even after cell death. It doesn’t require a substrate, however, it needs oxygen and an energy donor to emit fluorescence. The toxic effects of metal concentration on fluorescent protein is less noticeable comparing to others bioreporters which make them better for rapid applications.
Our construction (How it works?)
To develop a biosensor in Escherichia coli DH5-alpha, we designed a biobrick device to express Green Fluorescent Protein in mercury’s occurrence. The Mercury ions’ detector device biobrick (BBa_K1355002) is composed by mer bidirectional promoter (BBa_K1355001) attached to the GFP translational unit (BBa_E0840). It has dual function: A) In reverse: MerR protein regulator transcription; and B) in forward: transcription of MerP - MerT - GFP proteins, as represented below:
In absence of mercury, MerR forms a MerR-promoter-operator complex, preventing RNA polymerase to recognize the promoter, consequently, messengers RNA for MerPT and GFP will not be transcript. In presence of Hg2+, MerR protein binds"

Title: Validation of IKKB knockdown through measurement of cytokine TNFa and IL1a expression in BV2 cells.
Conducted by: Avital Bailen, Daniel Deitch and Mor Sela
Date:  20.9.18-11.10.18
Aim:  Quantify the expression of IL1a and TNFa in BV2 microglia cell-line infected with the shIKK vector using Lentivirus, using qPCR and ELISA.
Importance: We predict that reducing the cytokines, IL1α and TNFα, will prevent the creation of new reactive astrocytes in the brain 1. We predict following the microglia IKKb knockdown will reduce the secretion of the mentioned cytokines and new reactive astrocytes will not be created, preventing further damage to motor neurons.

Thus, the behavior of the flagellar motors reflects the relative proportion of receptor signaling complexes in the kinase-on and kinase-off conformations.  Both chemoeffector binding or release and methylation or demethylation can shift receptor signaling complexes from one state to the other.  For example, attractant ligands drive receptors toward the kinase-off state; subsequent addition of methyl groups shifts receptors toward the kinase-on state, reestablishing the steady-state (adapted) balance between the two states and restoring random walk movements.
TlpB in Helicobacter Pylori:
H. pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that resides in thestomachs of over half the world’s population. Its gastric habitatcontains a marked pH gradient from the highly acidic lumen,which can reach pH 2, to the more neutral environment adjacentto the epithelial lining, which is typically pH 7.  Based on genome sequence analysis, the H. pylori chemotaxismachinery resembles that of the well-studied model, E. coli,with a few notable variations including the absence of themethylation enzymes involved in receptor adaptation (Sweeneyand Guillemin, 2011).
Figure 5: Chematic representation of chemotaxis signaling in E. coli (A) and H. pylori (B). Chemoreceptors are shown in purple and flagellar motors in greenspanning the cell membrane. Cytoplasmic chemotaxis proteins CheA, CheW, CheY, CheZ, CheR, CheB, CheV, and ChePep are labeled. Protein modificationsare shown as pink circles for phosphorylation and purple hexagons for methylation. Activating interactions between signaling pathway components are indicatedby arrows, and speculative interactions are indicated by dotted lines.
When Helicobacter pylori and Escherichia coli bacteria which belong to two separate systems are examined, we recognize the vast similarity between the two. Both systems have chemoreceptors which belong to the MCP family enable the detection of chemical substances which do chemotaxis. Also, both bacteria also share in common the proteins required to send signals to necessary regions.
H. pylori has four chemoreceptors, TlpA,TlpB, TlpC, and TlpD, and several polar flagella that dictatesmooth swimming behavior in the presence of an attractantand increased stopping behavior in the presence of a repellent(Lowenthal et al., 2009; Rader et al., 2011). Only a"

Wiki
We've put a lot of work into our wiki this year. The most important part of course is the content. We used Google Docs to write and work as a team - resolving a total over 600 comments. Adam, our student leader who did the bulk of wiki editing made over 1300 edits - and as a result has gone slightly insane.
Several wikis we looked at were inaccessibly written - often lacking good explanations and having little page structure. This is likely down to the last minute rush before the deadline. We started early and spent a long time perfecting our text, so hopefully you find it all makes sense.
Another problem is that previous wikis are slow to load. They often have large swathes of redudant code and uncompressed images are commonly uploaded at much higher resolutions than needed. We saw some homepages well over 10MB! Our homepage is just 0.7MB, and all our other pages are similarly optimized. We've done this by analysing our site with Google's Pagespeed and Lighthouse auditing tools to find where we could improve. We correctly sized and compressed images, reused files so they can be cached and used SVGs where possible for diagrams.
As SVGs can be embedded more easily into the page, page load times are improved as the browser doesn't have to fetch the images seperately. SVGs also allow for infinite scalability allowing our wiki to take advantage of high resolution screens like Apple's 'Retina Displays'. They're also powerful as they allow text to actually be text rather than pixels - allowing screenreaders to read diagrams, improving the accessibility of our wiki. The worst cases we’ve seen are are wikis that are just huge PNGs - they take forever to load, don’t allow you to select text, are inaccessible to the visually-impaired and lack links and citations embedded in the text.

Overview
Can you imagine an application which could water and fertilize crops accurately under the soil ? Our team’s watering device dose!
Traditional irrigation technology depends on water permeation from soil surface to the plant roots, this process will lose much water and fertilizer, besides lead soil hardening.
And our device, an improvement of micro-irrigation, perfectly solve this problem. It aims at target irrigation, supplying water and fertilizer for plant roots directly and precisely, with the advantages of multifunctional, more energy-saving and higher water transport efficiency.
Weeds and pests are the most important damages to agronomy system, which resulted in agriculture economic losses of more than $20.4 billion in 1972. Merely taking the United States as an example, the damage is $8.4 billion a year, while pests account for 40% and weeds account for 60%. In our country, China, the crop yield loss is almost fifty million kilogram per year.
Note : Micro-irrigation system is the most advanced irrigation system right now, through transporting the pressure water to the fields, it can irrigate the soil near the root of the plant by only a small flow of water permeation. The main superiority of micro-irrigation are energy saving, evenly irrigation and the strong adaptability to soil and topography, which can increase crop production and field salt tolerance.
Principle
Our device can not only provide nutrients and water for crops, but also take the herbicides to weed roots and kill weeds. So we call it“Crops Guardian”.
During the design, we aimed at one of the most widely distributed weeds family, Gramineae , whose roots locate about 10cm under the ground. According to this character, we determined our device parameters available for it.

This observation can be explained by the time that the gold nanoparticles were in solution. During the generation, dextrin solution was added. The incubation time was approximately 8 hours and in this time the gold nanoparticles were capped by dextrin. The dextin makes the gold nanoparticles more stable. However, when the gold nanoparticles stay in the solution for a longer time, the remaining dextrin can adhere to the gold nanoparticles, making them more stable.

d-AuNPs Testing: d-AuNPs stability upon salt
The newly generated dAuNPs are tested for their stability under different salt concentrations. 20 µL of the d-AuNPs solution, 20 µL MilliQ and 20 µL NaCl solutions (range from 0 mM to 1000 mM) were added in one of the 96 wells on the 92 wells plate. The plate was incubated at 21 ºC during 10 minutes. The visible absorption spectrum from 450 nm to 650 nm of the solutions was measure and the ratio 620/520 nm was calculated for analysis. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The plate view, relevant absorption spectra and ratio 620/520 nm is shown.
With the new batch of d-AuNPs, the salt concentration variation was performed again. The range of salt concentration is adapted from 0 to 1000 mM NaCl added concentration. From the plate view it can be seen that the d-AuNPs are aggregating at a lower salt concentration than the previous (older) batch on 14/09/2018, 17/09/2019 and 19/09/2018.

But we can not get the recombine the bacteria all the time until we test the primer sequence. We use the 3A assembly to connect the gene circuits because the result of OE-PCR was always negative. The primer sequence was got from iGEM. But the design of restriction sites was not considered the protection base so that the restriction enzyme can not work efficiently. So we design the new primer with the consideration of the protection base and build our all gene circuit again. Luckily we get a positive gel result and we send the sample for DNA sequencing.

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Beyond Basics_-_-_TEXT.html," come directly to my mind to describe RWTH’s iGEM team Aachen are “international”, ”interdisciplinary” and ” innovative” (triple i work).
Could You please tell us something about the previous work of the iGEM teams in Aachen?
The past two iGEM teams from Aachen were SENSATIONAL. They won several gold medals and awards as best newcomers. I am very proud of our students!
How do You feel to be a part of the iGEM team Aachen 2016?
It is fun to discuss with them and it is my pleasure to support these excellent young scientists with experience/infrastructure and to see them to grow with their challenges and success.
Interview with Our Supervisor Prof. Blank
How do You evaluate the iGEM competition in general and the influence which the former iGEM teams from Aachen had?
The iGEM competition allows self-organized research. The aspect of bringing engineering into biology is fitting very well to the RWTH Aachen University and the Jülich Research Center. The three teams competing as the iGEM teams Aachen paved the way for synthetic biology at RWTH Aachen.
How do You think: Can iGEM support the education of the students?
iGEM can support the education because the students work self-motivated. Moreover the concept of research-based teaching intensifies the teaching experience. That the newest synthetic biology technologies can be applied is lifting the teaching in Aachen on a different level.. After their iGEM time many members have accelerate expertise and working skills. For sure, the softskills were practiced, working in a group of about 15 people. Students have the chance to develop new skills, new management experiences and to work with new devices.
What makes iGEM special in comparison to other student programs and practical courses?
A huge difference is that students have the chance to work on their own. Moreover, they have the chance to develop a project on their own and work on it till the end of the competition. Furthermore the students can get in touch with local companies and learn how to ask for financial supports for their project. Especially in Aachen, the topic is chosen by the students hence the students have the chance to integrate project ideas, in which they are really interested. Students have the chance to learn everything on their own and make special experiences, which they could not get from other student initiatives or other practical courses. These differences make iGEM clearly a unique experience.
How do You evaluate the complexity of the iGEM competition (financial support, organisation, and public relations)?
Again very positive."

iGEM Handbook
The spirit of iGEM competition is “Get, Give and Share”, while undoubtedly we can get the experience, knowledge or even honor from here, we also need to think about what we can give and what we can share. In order to promote this competition and spread it to the most of high schools and universities in China, we initiate an assistance program centered upon the Handbook , which is tailored to help those who are willing to take part in for a better and comprehensive view about iGEM.
The Handbook mainly contains seven parts, iGEM introduction, team setup guidance, what you can get, excellent works’ exhibition, TJU team introduction, special thanks and feedback. At the very beginning, the overall introduction can help readers get access to basic knowledge of this competition such as the prolonged history, requirements for medals and time schedule. As for team setup guidance, this is very important and useful for new participants since we designed several common strategies for the possible problems while you set up a new iGEM team. Notably, the excellent works’ exhibition is available for everyone no matter you have participated in iGEM before or not. In this section, we summarized whole projects and appended our thinking about this project in particular, which may inspire other teams on their own project.
This Handbook, to our surprise, has spread to several high school teams including SKLBC-GDSYZX, SKLBC-China, Shiyan_SY_China, H4Z-Hangzhou and WLSA_Shanghai as well as several universities. We believe there are a lot more to come. Above all, we helped SKLBC-GDSYZX with their first iGEM team and they consulted and thought highly of our Handbook. Similarly, according to the feedbacks from other schools, our Handbook has achieved a great success. In the future, we are striving to promote the existing version of Handbook and deliver it to even more schools all around the world.
New Team Aid
We always conduct our Human Practice with a mission to create a bridge that connects more Chinese colleges to the Synthetic Biology and the iGEM. So when Zhou, the vice-president of College of Biological Engineering, TUST (Tianjin University of Science and Technology) asked if we could share a little bit of our experience and help them to build"
Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," Entrepreneurship track. During the spring we also connected with the Technical Research Centre of Finland, VTT. They promised to invest their expertise and special equipment when needed.
The third step was to find company partnerships. We made a list of Finnish companies related to our field and contacted them by first sending and email and then calling them the next day. Regardless of the great effort we put into contacting the companies, only those we knew personally supported us financially. Summer of Startups was very useful in terms of networking as well. One of the coaches at Summer of Startups helped us to connect with Biotech Start-Up Management, which became one of our partners offering business expertise for our team.
The last phase happened on its own weight. As a result of actively building a positive image on media and being active in social media, different parties in the field heard about us. We have received invitations to seminars and projects to present iGEM, our team and research. We were invited to Biocentrum Helsinki board meeting, Academy of Finland's Centre of Excellence 2014-2019 HYBER workshop, Living Factories project's board meeting and ChemBio Finland conference. And of course we are going to give presentations to students and faculty members at Aalto University and University of Helsinki.
The Extras
Flappy Coli
We also made a silly game (an iGEMified version of Flappy Bird) called Flappy Coli . In the game you are guiding a genetically modified bacterium through an iGEM maze. The flagellum of the bacterium will grow as you get further in the game, and if you get far enough, it might even grow more flagella!
The game was created with the help of a guide by http://www.lessmilk.com/ (""How to make a Flappy Bird in HTML5"").
All of the code is available on the GitHub page of Flappy Coli.
Here's the bacterium navigating through the iGEM maze.
Cellf Improvement
We got so inspired by the iGEM summer project that the bacterial thoughts created another game idea in our heads. Lassi , Laura and Jimi Welling started building a game about being a bacterium in a vast petri dish, exploring a weird world and gaining plasmids to become the biggest, baddest... thing in the gene pool.
In the game, the player controls a ""bacterium"" that is composed of a bunch of cells. The goal of the bacterium is to wander around a vast biological world, collect plasmids, meet different creatures and evolve. The bacterium gains features as it"

Chain A-B-C will not appear in the mixture. Since node B does not appear in mixed chains, tree with nodes B and E will be removed in the trim process. Because part C and F, A and D, are both bound to nodes, the final product should contain A and B both after split processing.
In the example above, there is only one product finally though two product templates are defined in database. In this case, the corresponding reverse reaction would never be found because it fails to match two templates to only one species. This is a drawback of our MoDeL language -- it does not support description of intra-molecular reactions. If A and C could react as different parts of the product, the reverse reactions would not be lost. However, supporting intra-molecular reactions is one of our future plans for refinement of our MoDeL language.

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Collaborations#Kaiser-Karls-Gymnasium_-_-_TEXT.html,"2014 (CDT)
Last lesson students at Kaiser-Karl-Gymnasium took environmental samples using a variety of different contact agar plates. On the weekend, René examined the plates under the microscope and took photos. Today René and Nina presented the results of the experiment. Most of the students have been really astonished about the diverse microbial fauna found on themselves and their classroom. But first, we showed the students an excerpt from the TV show ""Planetopia"" that broaches the issue ""Hygiene in every-day life"".
Staphylo- and micrococci as well as Enterobacteria, Candida yeasts and miscellaneous fungi are found on the majority of plates. But why is there no growth on the plates containing the antibiotic? Actually, what is an antibiotic, how does it work and why are there multi-resistant pathogens? Nina explained the answer to all these questions to the students using descriptive graphics, and concluded the topic ""Microorganisms in our Environment"" with a short summmary.
As a starter for our next topic that is relevant to our project, we distribute a worksheet about quorum sensing among the students. For the remainder of the lesson, the students read the text and begin to answer the attached questions.
Lessons 5 & 6 - Glowing Vanilla Pudding
By Nina 16:16, June 02 2014 (CDT)
The topics of today's double lesson was quorum sensing as well as measurement of fluorescence. At the beginning of class, the students form 6 groups and start an experiment dealing with fluorescence: Each group weighs and dissolves 4g of vanilla pudding powder in 50mL of water. While conducting the experiment, each group is supervised by a member of our iGEM team.
While we give the powder some time to dissolve, René discusses the worksheet about quorum sensing that we gave out to the students last week. In doing so, the students learn what quorum sensing actually is, how it is used in different ways by a variety of bacteria, and how we want to use this function for our project.
Meanwhile the powder had dissolved in the water. Excess powder accumulated at the bottom of the beaker. Using a syringe, the students suck 2mL of supernatant out of the beaker, and press it through a filter into a cuvette. A part of our project involves the development of a fluorescence measurement device named Cellock Holmes. Each group of students at a time places its cuvette in the Cellock Holmes prototype, and notes down the values displayed on the cellphone display. Of course,"
Calgary,2018,Team:Calgary#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," at Western                 Canada High School, we were informed that the IB Organization had already passed their period of public corroboration                 for their upcoming curriculum change. Regardless, we have included our preliminary plans for a curriculum                 component here and we urge any high schools with flexibility in their curriculums to integrate synthetic biology                 concepts into their learning.
High School Lesson Plan
A common theme heard throughout meetings with Father Lacombe High School Teachers and Western Canada High School                 was that teachers would be more willing to integrate single-class lesson plans into their regular curriculum                 rather than an entire curriculum change. Taking this feedback, our team designed a lesson plan for a “Synthetic                 Biology 101” lesson, including a powerpoint on introductory synthetic biology and common laboratory techniques,                 as well as a strawberry DNA extraction activity.
This lesson plan is approximately 1.5 hours long and is intended for high school students in grade 11 or 12 with                 some but not extensive previous knowledge on cell biology. A full work-through of the lesson-plan can be                 found here . Alternatively, a printable version is available through this link .
Notre Dame Collegiate High School iGEM Graphic Design Workshop
After hearing that the Notre Dame Collegiate High School iGEM team enjoyed our graphic design during the aGEM (Alberta) competition, we                 decided to hold a graphic design workshop for their team. Rainer, our team’s graphic designer, walked a few                 members of the Notre Dame team through tips and tricks for creating eye-catching logos, diagrams, and slide-shows.                 We specifically worked with their team to upgrade their logo and provided a list of resources for them to                 refer to for their future graphic design needs.

Telus Spark's Adults Only Night
Our team participated in the “Hack It” event at Telus Spark’s Adults Only Night in September 2018, where we hosted                 a booth to promote our project and spread synthetic biology awareness in the community. We brought a hands-on                 Strawberry DNA Extraction activity, where community members could make drinkable strawberry daiquiris. At                 our booth, we promoted Snip, Equip, Flip and answered any outstanding questions surrounding gene editing                 and integration. Response from the public was positive, and we were glad to have had this opportunity to                 showcase our project to the members of the community.
We have outlined our procedure for strawberry DNA daiquiri activity in our protocols page - we believe that adults, not just children, can learn about and have fun with science.

4.The design of PCR primers
Experimental idea
According to our design, the starting point of all free combination pathways is site 2, the ending point is site 8. In order to obtain a large number of target genes, all of the DNA fragments that start at the site 2 and end at the site 8 need to be amplified. So the special primers are designed according to the sequence of site 2 and site 8, and restriction sites (respectively, Pst I and EcoR I -HF)are added in two primers according to what we want to import plasmid. The sequences of primers are as follows:

Regulations of hokD toxin in E. coli hok/sok TA system
The hok/sok system of the E. coli plasmid R1 was originally discovered in a screen for a locus that mediates efficient plasmid stabilization by killing plasmid-free cells. Sok antitoxin RNA is encoded by plasmids, represses the synthesis of a small, hydrophobic protein (Hok) that kills the host cell by damaging the bacterial cell membrane.
These loci code for three small genes that in hok/sok have been denoted hok (host killing), sok (suppression of killing) and mok (modulation of killing).27 The hok gene encodes a highly toxic transmembrane protein of 52 amino acids that irreversibly damages the cell membrane, and is thus lethal to host cells.
The mok reading frame overlaps extensively with hok, and is required for expression and                                 regulation of hok translation. The sok gene specifies a small cis-acting antisense RNA                                 of 64 nucleotides that is complementary to the hok mRNA leader region. Sok RNA is quite                                 labile (half-life is about 30 sec), but is constitutively expressed from a relatively                                 strong promoter. In contrast, hok mRNA is very stable (half-life is about 20 min)34 and                                 is constitutively expressed from a relatively weak promoter. Genetic analyses showed                                 that Sok RNA inhibits translation of the mok reading frame and that translation of hok                                 is coupled to the translation of mok.31 Consequently, Sok RNA indirectly inhibits                                 translation of hok by preventing mok translation.35 Because Sok RNA is very unstable                                 and is quickly degraded when the R1 plasmid is lost from the cell, the more stable hok mRNA is translated and cells increase plasmid maintenance by killing plasmid-free cells. This plasmid stabilization system is as a result of a phenotype called post-segregational killing (PSK).
In terms of hok/sok gene family. The chromosome of E. coli K-12 contains six hok/sok homologous loci (A, B, C, D, E and X). The hokD gene, formerly known as relF, is encoded by the third gene of the rel"

Safe Project Design
Our project is to design a system to engineer human cell line to produce exosomes that work as cellular hemoglobin based oxygen carriers.
We didn’t use any whole organisms, or any virus. We used Escherichia coli DH5a and HEK 293T cells, both are in white list. No potential risk as the strains are fragile and can only live in lab environment and the secreted material is no harm to the environment or to humans.
Safe Lab Work
We performed all the experiments in Lv’s lab and we had safety training at the first day in the lab.
Prof. Lv is responsible for the safety and security of biology labs in basic medical school, Fudan University. He has discussed with us about our project and supervises the whole project. Dr. Li will also instruct us on experiment design. Dr. He and Dr. Zhang will instruct us in daily experiment, they both have rich experiments in cloning and cell culture. Dr. He instructed our cloning related experiment and Ms. Zhang taught and guided us in mammalian cell culture related experiments.Their research focus is in molecular biology and cellular biology. What experiment we may do in our project is basically their daily experiment and they are very familiar with that.
There is ony one exception: TEM(Transmission Electron Microscope) experiment, which was performed outside of the lab. The samples was stained by uranyl acetate, which should and could only be preformed by radiation permission license holders. So after we prepared the samples, Dr. Wang who has a radiation permission license helped us stain all the samples and Dr. Zhang from Institute of Biomedcial Sciences, Fudan University took the TEM images. She is the manager of TEM equipment and has rich experience in TEM operation. All the samples were kept and processed by guidance.

Check out our results for more information about the outcome. This analysis helped us to evaluate the concentration of expressed protein in the cell-free expression system.
Figure 5: Luciferase reaction. The luciferase catalyzes the reaction of D-luciferin to D-luciferyl using ATP as an energy source. D-luciferyl is instantly converted into oxyluciferin, whereby energy is emitted as light. The intensity of bioluminescence is proportional to the amount of expressed luciferase.
Cell-free Expression of Antigens
An important goal was to express antigens with the required tags in a concentration and folding state that suffices for an iRIf measurement. Here, we focused on a C. tetani epitope flagged by a double His and a Spy-tag. For cloning of this construct we used a newly designed cloning site and a vector that we had optimized for cell-free expression.
Testing Different Conditions
To identify the optimal DNA concentration that yields in a maximum protein expression, we tested different conditions. For this experiment, we used DNA coding for the enzyme luciferase.
Another component that is crucial for optimal cell-free expression is magnesium. To evaluate the effects of different magnesium concentrations, we started multiple cell-free expression mixes using different magnesium starting concentrations. For results of our optimization, go to our Results Page.
Cell-Free Results
Step by Step Validation
Figure 6: Immobilization of DNA. PCR product coding for GFP with a Cy3 and an amino label was spotted onto the activated PDMS slide. Binding of the amino group to the specific surface allows for direct DNA immobilization.
Since we aimed at using cell-free expression in combination with the DiaCHIP, we decided to validate the process in individual steps.
First, the DNA templates had to be immobilized on the PDMS slide (figure 6). In another step we expressed GFP cell-free in a tube and spotted the produced protein on a iRIf slide to examine whether the interaction with the respective antibody can be detected (figure 7). Furthermore, to evaluate the interference of the specific surface with our expression system, we spotted our expression system onto the slide without starting the reaction beforehand (figure 8). Lastly, we performed a cell-free expression from immobilized DNA in the finished setup of glass and PDMS slide (figure 9).

There were colonies on the MinC Intein plate, the ArgE BB plate, and the GFP construct LB plate, but nothing on the GFP construct M9 plate. This may have been because there was no lactose or IPTG to induce the metA gene. Interestingly, there was a green fluorescent patch, but it was rather weak and had no distinct colonies. We plan to pick several colonies from the LB plate and try growing them in M9 culture with and without IPTG overnight. We also plan to do a cPCR on the MinC plate using the intein primers. There were no colonies on the DszA or yddg plate. We have had no luck with electroporating cells with ligation mixtures, although we have had some success with heat shock competent cells. We think there may be something in the ligation mixture that is interfering with the electroporation, and could probably be fixed by purifying the ligation mix.
The data that we collected regarding the growth curves of the auxotrophs and the mixture are very different from what the plate reader previously showed. We think this may be because of a lack of correction for path length by the plate reader, but aren't entirely sure.
We also did a PCR on the TyrA BB product, the previous failed YFP plasmid, and several other previously failed PCRs.

After two days of shaking at 37° in 1 mM IPTG, the supposed IPTG inducible metA constructs in the metA auxotrophs were unable to grow.
The gels of the PCR products that we have been getting lately have not been working properly. We think that there is a problem with the buffer due to how many times it has been reusued, or possibly by the new TBE that was recently made.
- Jacob Toth
August 16
The supposed metA constructs still appears unable to complement a metA knockout. It has been suggested that the concentration of metA may have been too high, and this would have led to a severe detriment to the cell, and it has also been suggested that the IPTG, being a rather old stock, was no longer good. Another step that we are going to take is to see if the expression of the construct can be seen on an sds page under induction.

This week, I learned the basics of the python programming language. I spend most of my time working with the Kegg API to access data via the SOAP protocol. I was able to utilize this new information to create a module that converts the common name to a usable kegg_id and also to convert the kegg_id back to a name. One concern I have is that even these simple functions are somewhat slow. Perhaps we will find ways to speed these processes up in the weeks to come. I looked into the possibility of Google App Engine. The one shortcoming (although it is pretty cool) was that there were some restrictions as to which libraries can be used. I foresee this as a problem and am looking into other options.
Riyad
We got Cobra working so I spent the majority of the week getting used to how Python and Cobra worked.
Palak
I began working with the various functions in COBRA.  I spent a lot of time understanding the output of COBRA and determining what aspects are necessary in creating an optimal pathway. I also looked at the inputs required for various COBRA functions and looked into ways that we can pass information from the KEGG database into COBRA. I figured out how to use the KEGG API. Additionally, I spend some time looking at the COBRA source code to see what we could modify to fit the needs of our program.

Since last week, I had some difficulties with installing python modules, specifically the ones that would allow us to graphically represent our program's outputs.  Tried to get a program called Easy_Install to work, which would make installing modules easy, but it was difficult to figure out how to get Easy_Install to install...  Fortunately, Donny was able to find an easy way to install the modules via MS-DOS prompt on windows. Now I am able to install any module...almost. I ended up installing these modules:
-Networkx
-Pydot
-Matplotlib
As well as these additional programs:
-Graphviz
-Cytoscape
Up to this point we have been using Python 2.6, but unfortunately I was unable to get all of the above modules to install correctly for Python 2.6.  I downgraded to Python 2.5,"

The data along with the fitted values of the model and the confidence interval are pictured below.
Fig.4
Residuals Analysis
We also run a residuals analysis to ensure this linear model is proper to fit the data. First, we                     draw histogram and QQ-plot of standard residuals.
Fig.5
Fig.6
From the histogram, the standard residuals equally drop in the two sides of zero, which means that                     the residuals are possibly independent. Also, the QQ-plot implies the significant normality of                     residuals.
Results and Inspirations
The linear model we constructed validates the linearity between the concentration of H2O2 and the                     fluorescence intensity divided by the OD value, which the H2O2 is in the                     interval from 0 to 2.5mM.                     And we also analyzed the residuals of the model to ensure it works well. With this model, we can                     properly predict the output when the concentration of H2O2 is in certain                     interval.

Analyzing ''E.coli'' Colonies
Minimal growth of E.Coli on LB plates with Kan resistance. There were only 5 colonies found. None of the colonies were glowing. We are not sure what 'glowing' would look like.
Ordered primers that would allow us to clone part BBa_B0040 in front of the luciferase operon. The following is the primers that were ordered.
XhoI-R40-F: GCGCTCGAGTCCCTATCAGTGATAGAG BamHI-R40-R: GCGGGATCCGTGCTCAGTATCTCTATC
These primers would allow us to attach XhoI and BamHI sites onto part BBa_B0040 by PCR and then we are able to clone this part into pCS26 vector with luciferase as the reporter. This should allow us to see the glowing from the luciferase operon in the plasmid.

Insulin: Basic Background
• What is the role of Insulin in the Human body?
      Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that removes glucose from the blood. In healthy individuals, excess glucose is readily removed from the blood stream by a proportional production of insulin. In persons with diabetes mellitus however; the body is either resistant to insulin, or it has a reduced capacity to produce insulin. Those individuals require an external source of insulin.
• Why are we expressing human Insulin?
      The ability to produce recombinant human Insulin cheaply has long been a lucrative goal. There are millions of people worldwide who are dependent on Insulin derived from production methods that make the product expensive -and further yet- potentially dangerous.Our team thinks that the current production methods for human Insulin are inefficient and can be optimized by being expressed in Pichia pastoris.
• What is the current method for Human Insulin production?
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli have historically been the preferred host cells to produce recombinant human insulin; however, each one of these organisms has great disadvantages.  E. coli lack secretory mechanisms, thus the cells must be lysed and processed to isolate the insulin. Another concern with E.coli is the lactose operon acting as an inducible system to control gene expression. S. cerevisiae, on the other hand, have the necessary secretory machinery to secrete insulin, but they produce it at very low yields compared to E. coli.
• Why are we using Pichia pastoris to express Human Insulin?
      P. pastoris is a eukaryotic organism in the yeast family that overcomes both obstacles encountered by the aforementioned organisms.  P. pastoris has been shown to excrete proteins at a rate of approximately five times that of S. cerevisiae with higher qualitative value as well."
Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Project#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," along with that type of research, but I am a firm believer in the earth is where it is for a reason and we are where we are for a reason and life has evolved over millions of years without us having to make it better. We’ve made a lot of mistakes along the way so I don’t know if I trust research and peoples’ judgment. (I explained to her that domesticating animals is a way we’ve done this in the past, to which she responded…) I think all that would’ve naturally fallen into place anyways. Dogs really do love humans and they need to connect with a pack. Horses, if they really didn’t want to be trained, I don’t know if you could train them. Whereas, I believe they feel good when they’re serving a purpose as well. So I think those connections would’ve happened automatically. I don’t know if we can take complete credit for those modifications. I guess what I’m thinking is more that horses were the size of a dog and they evolved into the size they are today. I don’t know. I’m all for research certainly, but there’s also the question how far will it go. Is that going to be to evolve to the perfect human? And whose perception is the perfect human?""”

Microbial Desalination Cells
One of the UN’s top sustainable developmental goals is universal access to clean water and sanitation.  But with a rising world population and freshwater accounting for only 3% of the world’s supply, there are many challenges still left to overcome in order to meet that goal. Barring the discovery of large underground aquifers or other improbable events, the most likely way to meet this goal is through water desalination.
Current Methods
The challenges posed by water desalination are in no way new and until recent years have been met with many methods equally ‘historic’ in nature. More recent methods however (deionization/ion exchange and membrane processes) are capable of desalinating water sources on a much larger scale, but carry with them significant energy requirements…
8-20 MW to desalinate a 62ML (50,000 AF) volume of brackish water (3,000 - 5,000 g/L)
20 - 35 MW to desalinate the same volume of saline water (5,000 - 35,000 g/L)
For comparison 30 MW will power about 20,000 homes (about the size of Boston University’s student population)
As well as environmental, regulatory, and growth factors to consider. Considering the prevalence of coal and gas fired power plants, it is not hard to see how many of these problems go hand-in-hand.
But what if there was another way?
Microbial desalination cells (MDCs) combine the technologies used in microbial fuel cell (MFCs) with those from electrodialysis systems to create low-cost, low-maintenance, and environmentally-friendly alternatives to current industrial desalination procedures. Unlike these current methods, the ‘hands-off’ operation of MDCs with their free energy requirements make them accessible to both developed and developing"

We would like to thank all of the people who have helped make this project possible. For the past four years, undergraduates at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) have participated in iGEM and that would be impossible without significant support. This year, the team is composed of students studying Bioengineering, Bioinformatics, Bioelectronics, Biochemistry, Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental (MCD) Biology, and Chemical Engineering. This wide array of disciplines is crucial for the creative process behind using synthetic biology to advance solutions to problems. Modern engineering demands collaboration between individuals and pushes them to think critically and work efficiently.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," occur in our fluorescent mCerulean polysilicate-covered cells. Despite the effort, we did not observe any lasing in cells. Our models have shown that this is due to the size of our cells, if we would use a bigger organism, e.g. a mammalian cell line, we could be able to measure lasing. Unfortunately, we were not able to measure this in our setup, since we did not have the safety permit to use mammalian cells. However, this would be a very interesting future study.
Engineering biological lenses
Introduction
Previously we have shown that we were successfully able to express the enzyme silicatein fused to the membrane protein OmpA in E. coli. These cells were able to synthesize a layer of polysilicate around the membrane of the cells. These polisilicate-covered cells could improve the capturing of light in microscopy in two ways: they could turn cells into lasers or they can make the cells act as microlenses. The lasing capacity of the cells were researched in our custom-built setup. The ability of our cells to act as a lens was also researched. We have already measured the stiffness of our lenses and imaged the shape, and it turned out that the polysilicate-covered cells were more stiff without disturbing the shape of the cell. However, before we can use the polysilicate-covered cells as a lens, we have to determine a few properties first. From our conversation with Nikon we learned that the polysilicate cells should be as homogeneous as possible. Different cells should have as little variation as possible. Therefore, we researched if we are able to control the cell shape of our Biolenses using the BolA gene. Furthermore, the risk assessment of our human practices part showed that we cannot bring our cells outside the lab, since they have an antibiotic resistance marker. Therefore, we needed to develop a way to sterilize the Biolenses without disturbing their optical properties.
Even then, our microlenses are not ready to apply onto solar cells yet, because among others we are not yet able to make a good array out of the biolenses. However, we could already test the effect of our cells on the absorbance of a real solar cell. We should make shure that our Biolens cells do not absorb any light, because this would affect a solar cell in a negative way. Therefore, to make sure that we could use our cells on solar cells in the future, we tested the absorbance of our Biolenses in a real-world setup, by coating solar cells with Biolenses and testing them in a solar cell simulator.

3.RT-PCR validation on transcriptional level
After failure of detecting target proteins using SDS-PAGE, we used   RT-PCR to examine the expression of the target genes on   transcriptional level. The results were shown in Fig. 5. We used 16S   rRNA gene as an house keeping gene to compare the expression level of   target genes. The results showed that DEBS1 gene was successfully   expressed, albeit the transcription level was relatively low compared   with other target genes (acc, pcc and sfp) whose transcription are   controlled by T7 promoter as well. The low transcription level of   DEBS1 gene is in consistent with our SDS-PAGE results. This result   might due to the large size of DEBS1, which could hamper both the   transcriptional and translational efficiency.
4.Fluorescence detection analyses
To further confirm the expression of DEBS1, we monitored the   fluorescence of RFP under Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope (Fig. 6).   The results showed that after excitation with lazer source, red   fluorescence was monitored in the RFP+DEBS1+TE transformant, while in   the BL21 strain, no fluorescence was detected. These results indicate   that RFP+DEBS1+TE was successfully expressed in the transformant.
Figure6: Results of fluorescence detection
5.UPLC-MS/MS Detection of TKL 1B
To test if RFP+DEBS1+TE was functionally expressed, the transformant   was grown in Luria Broth (LB) liquid medium and induced with IPTG.   After 48h of induction, cells were harvested and the supernatant was   used for the extraction of the product TKL1B. After extraction, the   samples were concentrated by 5 times and subjected into a triple   quadrupole mass spectrometry and monitored under an MRM mode using the   parent ion /product ion=173.1/155.1 channel. The results were shown in   Fig. 7. The retention time of the target product in the UPLC column   was 6.42 min, using water/methanol gradient elution protocol. We   monitored a strong response at m/z = 155.1 ion pair in the RFP  +DEBS1+TE transformant sample. The ion pair"

Product Development Strategy
Our product PORIFI would be the first product in the market to use an antimicrobial peptide for acne treatment. We decided to incorporate the peptide in a hydrogel, which could provide a good environment for it.
Process Development Strategy
Producing an antimicrobial peptide using chemical synthesis on a mass scale is really expensive. A few grams of the chemically synthesized antimicrobial peptide costs around 1000 €.
For comparison, check custom peptide prices from Abm.
4 mg of Dermcidin ~1400 dollars (purified)
1-4 mg ~420 dollars (10 dollars crude)
0,1 mg we bought for 300 e
It is tough to beat the current products in the market this way. Hence, we decided to go for production of our peptide DCD-1L in E. coli as an economical alternative.
Another challenge was to produce an antimicrobial peptide in E. coli without killing the bacteria itself. So we designed a system of production with Smt3 fusion tags for the production.
Consumer Acceptability
Having designed the product and the process, it was important for us to see if the product was accepted by the consumers. The results of product acceptability can be seen below.
It was interesting for us to see that around 78 % people were ready to use a product from genetically modified bacteria. Further, if the product was identical to something naturally found in the body, 82 % people were ready to use it. This was a positive sign for us to proceed ahead in the development of product in terms of formulation and prototype development, packaging and quality testing.
Patent Screening
During the process of defining our project, we had briefly checked the patent to ensure that the idea we would work on has also legal foundation. However, we had been also told not to be discouraged if we find the patents of similar content and to carry on our scientific research if we feel that a problem is not explored enough.
After the meeting with the doctors from the ""Biodesign Finland"" entrepreneurial program and their advice, we decided to screen the patent applications and granted patents again. We used the online patent search tools, such as The Lens , Google Patents and European Patent Register , to find relevant patent information. We searched through abstracts and claims for the following keyphrases: dermcidin, dermicidin, DCD in combination with skin and acne terms. We also got support from the law students of Tec-Chihuahua iGEM team, as part of our collaboration.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html,"FP-GFP fusion protein was thereby confirmed, we also see a very high emission of RFP. This was caused by the broad overlap in the absorption spectrum of GFP and RFP. The RFP and GFP present in the cell will compete for the light. Therefore, excitation of this protein in the sample will lead to a weaker GFP-signal than would be expected, if no RFP would be present.
Figure 7: Relative emission spectrum (excited at 485 nm, gray) of the RFP-GFP system. Cotransformed with the CouAA-RS ( BBa_K2201204 ), cultivated without CouAA. Maximal emission of the GFP at 525 nm (green line) and maximal emission of RFP at 610 nm (red line).
In the cotransformants of the CFP-YFP system and the CouAA-RS we could confirm our desired FRET-system.
First, we excited the sample with light of 475 nm, which corresponds to the emission maximum of CFP and a reasonable absorption for YFP. The measured emission signal of the CFP-YFP system had a maximum at 525 nm (Figure 8). This matches with the expected YFP emission maximum. There was strong evidence that through the cotransformation, a specific amount of the whole CFP-YFP fusion protein was expressed in the cells. We then excited the sample at 430 nm, the absorption maximum of CFP. If there were no FRET system present in the sample we would expect a CFP signal with an emission maximum at 475 nm. The measured emission spectrum still had its maximum near 525 nm. We confirmed the FRET system by measuring the emission of light at the YFP emission maximum when excited at the CFP absorption maximum. This can only be done, if the energy of the excited CFP is transferred to the YFP before the emission process.

B-A-G course
Building Block synthesis
A New Standard
Software Tools
Software Tools
Both the Sc2.0 project and the Build-A-Genome course require a number of specialized software applications and editing environments,; each of these is briefly summarized here.  Part of the philosophy of Build-A-Genome is to use ONLY open source software.
• Moodle is an existing open source course management system. It was modified to function as an online lab notebook for all B-A-G students to keep track of voluminous data and monitor progress of Building Block synthesis. Things like gel images and progress reports on the Building Blocks were stored in the MOODLE, along with various resources like protocols, lectures, and articles.
• CloneQC is a brand new program designed to automate the analysis of thousands of tracefiles of sequenced DNA. The somewhat complex process involved in calling whether or not the generated Building Block is an exact match to the designed Building Block was automated. The program can successfully identify exact and non-exact matches, and in some cases where it isn’t sure, it will ask a human to determine the status.
• BioStudio is a web application developed by B-A-G Team members Sarah Richardson and Pablo Lee layered on top of an existing generic genome browser called GBROWSE. BioStudio allows collaborative creation and editing of genome-sized DNA sequences, using revision control systems and most importantly, a graphical user interface, which facilitates many genome editing tasks. It provides various useful tools to aid the editor in the design, like ways to visualize the sequence at various levels of detail, or to visualize restriction site positions and recombination sites, or the percent content of certain base pairs, and so on.
• GeneDesign is an existing program written by B-A-G Team members Sarah Richardson and Pablo Lee that provides tools for more specific gene or Building Block level design. Features like codon substitutions, silent site removals, restriction site design, and more are available. Most relevant to B-A-G, after the design of a gene or Building Block, tiling oligo order sheets can be automatically generated.
A new database to tie all of these resources together is being put together to provide a  unified database, which will give a solid base for the creation of additional custom software and web applications. It will also allow for the different pieces of software"

We completed a survey for the University of Washington in order to help them create a global iGEM server for easier communication among the teams.
uOttawa survey
We completed a survey for the University of Ottawa. The purpose of their survey was to gather information on how much people know about what genetic engineering is and what their opinions are on the type of research that's going on in their community. Genetic engineering technology has implications for more people than just those affected by diseases; it has the potential to revolutionize our way of life. However, misconceptions on how its used and misinformation spread much quicker than facts. This is largely due to the lack of communication between the scientific and nonscientific community, leaving the media to bridge that gap.

Figure 30.SDS Page Gel of Construct 11 ( pSB1C3 - BBa_J04500 +His+ TALE A +link+βlac).
Because construct 11 has βlac on it, we cultured the cells in ampicillin too as β-lactamase provides resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. The medium density increased suggesting that β-lactamase was functional in our construct.

This week, we did an ampicillin survival assay to verify if the expressed construct 11 ( pSB1C3 + BBa_J04500 +His+ TALE A +Link+βlac) was able to degrade ampicillin, allowing non β-lactamase producing bacteria to survive in LB and ampicillin.

The graph shows that there is an increase in tryptophan quenching as concentration of spermidine increases. -
Conclusion and Future Work
In terms of future work, the interaction between PotD and spermidine would need to be characterized more robustly perhaps using other methods such as ITC or SPR. This would help establish binding parameters which would be critical in informing how much protein we would need to put in our device to allow for reliable detection. Once this is achieved, attachment of the fluorescent microspheres would be performed. It would also be ensured that this modification would not interfere with the PotD/spermidine interaction.

Saliva
Introduction
A major component which is detectable in saliva is the free iron sequestering compound known as lactoferrin, a protein involved in the innate immune system. Neisseria meningitidis is a gram-negative bacterium with an iron-binding outer membrane protein called lactoferrin binding protein A (LbpA). N. meningitidis uses this LbpA to extract iron from the host lactoferrin under pathogenic conditions to allow for the bacterium to perform essential cellular metabolism such as energy generation and DNA replication.
We predict that purified LbpA would be able to bind to the lacteroferrin present in saliva in vitro. Building on this, we hope it attach a fluorescent molecular probe to LbpA to allow for signal output of bound LbpA (with unbound LbpA washed away from saliva). Here, we aim to overexpress LbpA with a HIS6 tag in E. coli and purify by FPLC and SEC. From here we seek to characterise binding of LbpA to lactoferrin by tryptophan fluorescence and ultimately attach carboxylate fluorescent microspheres to LbpA.
Results
In order to do this chromosomal DNA from Neisseria meningitidis MC58 strain was kindly gifted to us by Dr James Moir from The University of York. This was used as a template for the amplification of the lbpA gene into the pSB1C3 plasmid ( BBa_K1590008 ) and"

Background
As we all know,  hydrogen is considered as the most attractive and clean fuel in the world. Because if we use hydrogen as fuel, the product will be water，but not harmful gases like sulfur dioxide or carbon dioxide. That’s why it is very essential for us to find a much better and efficient way to produce hydrogen.
However, there are many defects for today’s hydrogen production techniques. Industrially, people often use fossil fuels manufacturing hydrogen, which is obviously not the renewable way for hydrogen generation.  Electrolysis of water is another industrial way for hydrogen production, but it will have to deal with the problem of huge power consumption. There are some biological methods too.
For example, bacterial fermentation, since it will require a great number of fermentation substrate, it is not a good way too. Cyanobacteria can produce hydrogen, but the hydrogenase’s activity of green algae is 100 times higher than that in Cyanobacteria.According the assessment report from International Energy Agency in 1998, using green algae to produce hydrogen has a more perfect future development and social value.
Progress of the hydrogen production：First, PSII using light energy to split water into hydrogen ions, electron and oxygen. Then, hydrogen ions and electron from the photosynthesis along with other metabolic hydrogen ions will move to hydrogenase’s location, and be reduced to hydrogen.
Problems and development of hydrogen production
In fact, German scientists have already found that green algae can produce hydrogen back in 1939. But this method hasn’t been used industrially until now. Why ? because using green algae to produce hydrogen is now still facing 2 problems.
Hydrogenase is a kind of anaerobiase，only in anaerobic environment the hydrogenase can be activated. However，the green algae is a photoautotrophy plant, and normally green algae split water into hydrogen ions and release oxygen by PSII ,  the oxygen can inhibit the activity of hydrogenase，which is the reason why the green algae can only produce hydrogen for a few seconds in normal situation.
Solution：In 2000, Miles ’ group from national renewable energy laboratory of Unite states, found that green algae will continue to produce hydrogen for more than 70 hours, after sulfur deficiency stress.

UC_San_Diego,2018,Team:UC San Diego#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," as a result, we implemented thorough reading checkpoints and included a new section for all of our topics: a brief summary section that requires students to recall the information and summarize it in a succinct manner , embed outside texts and ask relevant questions about covered concepts , Ask students to design research investigations into specific aspects that intrigued them, Ask them to use math and analytical skills in data analysis for all the topics
In addition, we interviewed students at Torrey Pines High School and the Intro to Biotechnology teacher, Mr. Brian Bodas, to see which topics were most relevant to the students . They expressed interest in stem cells, recent diseases such as Ebola and Zika virus, and thought it would be more helpful if they could get exposure to some of the molecular biology techniques. We incorporated all of these topics in the second version of our topic.
Lastly, we partnered with nonprofits locally and globally. No Stoppin’, located in Northern California, to help guide incorporation into existing school districts , including Fremont Unified School District. This allowed us an effective channel and to gather more feedback so that we can improve the quality of information we are providing. We also partnered with the Yowimadi Foundation, with our contact Michael Okoro, postdoctoral fellow at Cold Harbor, worked in Nigeria to help distribute our textbook to schoolchildren in Nigeria . It was extremely heartening to see such a positive response, and we hope to build on this in the future.
Reflection: It was extremely exciting to see the work from last year’s team help guide a significant cornerstone of this year’s public engagement work. As a team, everyone truly enjoyed the activity for a number of reasons, namely interacting with the kids and getting their feedback on the topics that they wanted to learn about. In addition, it was a very common feeling amongst our team as we were writing the textbook: it was quite fun to write about these topics and really reconnect with the amazing science that is at the core of synthetic biology. In the end, we published over 200 pages of detailed, verified information. To add to the overall utility and enhance implementation in biology curriculum, we researched the NGSS standards and tailored the content discussion around these key concepts.
Please note that we have uploaded one of the preliminary versions for one of the 24 topics for this year's textbook but the full version will be available in hard copy at the Jamboree. We have topics for the central dogma, infectious diseases, gene regulation, genome sequencing, fundamentals of cancer, fundamentals of microfluidics, stem cells, metabolic engineering, antibiotics, antivirals, biosensors, protein engineering, medical data"

UChicago,2015,Team:UChicago#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," the LVA-Stop tagged GFP is directly downstream the circadian kaibc promoter, we expect differences in activation/deactivation of RpaA to directly impact the amount of GFP expressed. As such, we expect different fluorescence readings for each of the phosphomimetics. Furthemore, we hypothesize that pMC003 will yield a greater contrast in fluorescence readings between each phosphomimetic, given that it is a negative regulator of RpaA.
 
 
 
 
Specific Assays:
 
Gibson Assembly
Gibson assembly was conducted using NEBs 2x HiFi Assembly Master Mix. Volume of Gibson was halved in order to save reagent. 50 ng of the longest fragment in each reaction was added, and other fragments were added in ratio relative to the longest fragment. 5uL of the master mix was used, and H2O was added to bring whole volume of reaction to 10 uL. Reaction was incubated at 50C for 1 hour.
 
PCR
Phusion DNAP from Thermo Fisher with HF buffer used for reactions. Each reaction was supplemented with DMSO. Gradient PCRs, miniprep PCRs, and colony PCRs were conducted with 10uL as the final reaction volume. Samples that would be gel extracted were conducted with 50 uL as the final reaction volume. 10 uM primers were added. 30 cycles of PCR were conducted. See Notebook for details on cycle temperatures.
 
Gel Electrophoresis
Gel set up in TAE buffer. 1% agarose gel used for standard electrophoresis. 0.8% gel used for smaller fragments. 0.7 uL of EtBr added for imaging. Gels run for 30 mins at 120V. Invitrogen 1 kB ladder used for standard protocols.
 
Gel Extraction
Machery-Nagel gel extraction kit used. See notebook for complete protocol. Samples eluted in 15 uL of elution buffer.
 
Transformation
Competent cells made by team using RbCl2 and CaCl2 chemically competent protocols.
Efficiencies of competent cells were 4.00 x 10^5 transformants/ng  and  1.15 x 10^6 transformants/ng respectively. Transformation was conducted by incubating on ice for 30 mins and conducting a heat shock at 42 C for 1 min. Colonies plated using glass beads method. Incubation at 37C overnight.

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," by looking at the biofilm under the microscope. Certain dyes specifically interact with the bacterial nanowires created by our bacteria. These are known as a Congo Red or a Crystal Violet assay. In this manner, we can distinguish, whether the nanowires and thus our biofilm has been formed.
The Biolinker
The story of our DIY 3D Printer. From commercial 3D Printers, to modified inkjet printer to K'NEX toys.
Initial 3D Printer ideas
Our project started with the idea to develop structured biofilm formation. The most effective solution would be a retail 3D bioprinter, so we first thought to buy a 3D Printer. However the solution was not viable. For one, a retail 3D printer is expensive. Second, in a normal 3D printer, the printhead is heated, resulting in the death of our bacteria. Third, our proposed bioink has a different viscosity than the one used in 3D printers. Finally, for printing a continuous line, we need to adapt the printing speed which is hard to do with existing 3D printers. In conclusion, our research told us a commercial 3d printer was not optimal, so we started looking for other ideas.
After a thorough search on the internet, we found a lot of manuals to transform an inkjet printer into a 3D printer. Most of the inkjet printers use a piezoelectric Drop-on-Demand method. This method is based on spitting out the ink by using very small electric shocks, which our bacteria could survive. Another advantage of the inkjet printer over a commercial 3d printer is that is it much cheaper! We decided to buy such a printer, but then, problems arose. For example, the printer is impossible to reprogram by connecting it directly to a computer, as its software is embedded into the printer circuitry.
First version of K'NEX printer
A 3D printer is actually nothing else than a machine that can move in three directions and has something that extrudes the ink.
Ultimaker Representative
After a visit to the company Ultimaker (see: Report ) we were inspired by the experts working there. This advice drove us to think about a simpler, more efficient idea. We thought to build our own printer with a toy construction set: The K’NEX. Thus, we started building a 3D printer that fits our needs. By forming a structure from rods and linkers, and connecting them to gears, motors and some transmission chains, we finished our first version."

UNIK_Copenhagen,2016,Team:UNIK Copenhagen#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," single wavelength 293 nm, demonstrated that intensities matter significantly. The intensity of Martian UV spectra is higher than that of single wavelength despite the fact that it is a short wavelength, the higher power has caused the decreased tolerance to duration of exposure. Additionally, this fact of power appears in the graphs and microscopy pictures of pressure exposures. The exposures of low pressures in comparison to higher pressures, with the same duration time has slower growth rate, indicating the influence of strength of the exposing parameter. Visually, the transition of size can be seen on the microscopy pictures in fact for low pressure values the bacteria reshapes morphologically and goes from elongated shapes to circle-alike shapes. Despite the fact that the bacteria changes shapes, size and demonstrates decreased growth rates, they still survive Martian-like conditions.

Did a midi-prep on the inoculated pBR322+GFP and pACYC184+UV using the Qaigen midi prep kit plus using the midi prep kit protocol. Eluted with 100 μL of EB buffer and then nanodropped and found that there was 150.7 ng/μL in the pACYC184+UV and 113.7 ng/μL for the pBR322+GFP.
We purified the PCR'ed pBR322+GFP and pACYC184+UV that was left overnight and then nanodropped. we found that there was 31.7 ng/μL in the pACYC184+UV and 54.8 ng/μL for the pBR322+GFP.
We poured Chlor/Amp plates (made 3 bottles of 250 mL LB media and  250 μL of Amp and 1.5 mL of Chlor)
We made more chlor stock by adding 10 mL of 100% ethanol to 0.34g of chlor powder to get a 34 mg/mL concentration stock.
We made a 5mM stock of our sequencing primers. We took 20μL of the 1 in 10 dilution of the primers and added 20μL of water to this. This was done for all three primers
We prepared the parts to be sent out for sequencing. Using the purified PCR fragments formed by using the sequence primers, we prepared four PCR tubes to be sent out. For GFP, we used 9.5μL water, 0.5μL sample, and 5μL of 5MM sequencing primer. This was done twice, once using the forward primer and once using the reverse primer. For UV, we used 9.0μL water, 1.0μL sample, and 5μL of 5MM sequencing primer. This was done twice, once using the forward primer and once using the reverse primer. The different amounts of sample was because GFP had a higher concentration than UV.
We co-transformed the UV+pACYC184 and GFP+pBR322 following the transformation protocol. 1μL of each plasmid was used. Also, we heat shocked for 50 seconds instead of 40.

Four colonies grew on the co-transformed plate. These four colonies were each restreaked on two plates on Saturday. One plate was used as a control and the other one was UV shocked.

The upper two lines show the site of mutation, here. K stands for guanine or thymine, N for any possible base. Corresponding to the DNA sequence the amino acid sequence is shown with labeled positions of mutated amino acid residues (*) above. G: guanine, C: cytosine, A: adenine, T: thymine.
The introduction of targeted saturation mutations requires mutant primer design ( primer mutagenesis ). We divided our library generation into two rounds, each mutating different residues (Fig. 12A). Amino acids 149, 150 and 154 were mutated in the first (1st), amino acids 69 and 73 in the second round (2nd). Each library generation consists of the following steps: 1. primer design, 2. saturated mutagenesis PCR, 3. DpnI/BsaI restriction, 4. ligation, transformation and plasmid isolation, 5. PCR for 2nd round; the template for 2nd round being the isolated mutated plasmids of the 1st. After 2nd round, the plasmid library is completed. Figure 12B shows gels from the 2nd round of mutagenesis. The gels of step 2 (PCR), step 3 (digest) and step 4 (ligation) show a band of the expected size at 3769 bp, indicating that the intermediate steps were successful. The primers we used for the mutagenesis PCR randomly mutate five amino acids residues at positions 69, 73, 149, 150 and 154, which are known to bind to L-Aspartate (Fig. 12C). The outcome of the mutations is depicted in Figure 12D.

It could be graeat for people to touch Printeria. Take it to Boston and try to do a live performance during the Jamboree. This will influence the judges a lot.
Printeria was built to be as easy as a lego toy, so that anyone can assemble it. This fact will make Printeria perfect to travel to Boston and, of course, to perform public demonstrations there.

Dr. Francisco Juan Martínez Mojica  is a microbiologist, researcher and professor at the University of Alicante. He is the discoverer of the CRISPR-Cas systems whose application would later be researched by Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna among others.
In Spain, he is one of the most reputable researchers and as such, his opinion and advice are worth their price in gold.  Mojica accepted our invitation for a personal interview in which we would present the project and ask him for advice. The interview was carried out by Carolina Ropero, member of the Printeria team. In the following button you will be able to read the whole interview:
Interview: Mojica
Interview conclusions were:
Mojica agrees that with Printeria the automation of Printeria decreases the experimental error. However, he warned us about the importance of being aware of the decisions to make, even if a device such Printeria is able to do all the process by itself.
To avoid the user lack of awareness, we decided to develop a Simulation tool, so the user could simulate the experiments in silico. Thus, this functionality  provides the user with a quantitative, mathematical description to ensure the rational decision making.
He believes that, from the education point of view, the automation is detrimental to the observation. He also pointed out the necessity of training the teaching stuff, as they are not often used to SynBio.
In order to ensure the students understanding of the biology that is behind each step, we decided to develop a Printeria basic user-guide. Moreover, we implemented recipes in our software tool. Recipes are already pre-defined experiments that include an easy ID name such as “pink colour”, so in this way the most basic user can understand what he/she is printing and so the biological reason of the final result.
Biosafety measures are completely necessary to ensure Printeria  introduction in non-scientific environments.
We realized it was necessary"
