DH5α template isolation for pcr purification of nhaA promoter. The left part of DNA MIX MARKER is done by manuel and the right part of marker is isolated by DNA isolation kit supplied by Anatolia Genework. For the next step, we used DNA template isolated by kit because of their concentration view on gel.
Figure 1:  Agarose gel results of DNA isolation from DH5α strain
We have done gradient pcr between 55-62 oC annealing temperatures (first well is 55 and the last well is 62). As a result, we saw only one fragment at fifth (59.2 oC) well. We designed our pcr for 59 oC annealing temperature.
Figure 2: Agarose gel results of amplification nhaA promoter from DH5α strain via gradient PCR
PCR products of nhaA promoter at 59.2 oC annealing temperature. First well is a negative control (without template), second and third well shows us non-purified promoter fragments. Last well shows purified promoter fragment. We agreed that is our promoter of interest because according to sequence of nhaA promoter, it has 194 bp. It can be seen that fragment is close to 200 bp according to marker.

Overview
Kill switch system is required to prevent the release of genetically modified organisms to the environment. Also, our genetically modified bacteria would be colonized in human intestine so we have to prevent the spread of GMO to the other part. To realize this aim, we benefit from glucose and auto-inducer 2 (AI-2) concentrations. MazE and MazF are stress-induced molecules that mediate cell death and their production would be controlled with two different promoters that sense glucose and AI-2. Furthermore, MazE is anti-toxic and MazF is toxic for the cell so they must be found in equilibrium. If the amount of MazF is more than MazE, the cell would die because of its toxic effects. Based on these reasons, our kill switch system consists of two parts.
How does it work?

The transformed colonies of pC13BH had the PgpdA insert amplified via colony PCR and gel screened to check for the correct length. The gel however was blurry, so the cultures were miniprepped for digest screening. Gel screen pA13AW digested with XbaI and PstI. Gel results indicate that the cloning was successful! We then amplified the T7 polymerase gene for more insert DNA. We ran a PCR and digested pC13L to prepare insert for recreating pAK13CS. We recreated ligation of pC13AF. We looked at sequencing results for pC13BQ, pC13BR, pC13CC, and pC13CD - all looked good, other than some minor differences between our copies of the trpC promoter and terminators and the sequences in the online database.
Cloning of pA13AW seems to be successful and will test to see if pC13BH also worked. We ran a PCR and digested pC13L to prepare insert for recreating pAK13CS. We recreated ligation of pC13AF.

Oxford,2014,Team:Oxford#topsecretIPpage_-_-_TEXT.html," of this is the responsibility of the government to prevent the creation of monopoly and to ensure that ideas are shared so as to maximize productive research. Again, there is research indicating that intellectual property is crucial to maintaining this balance, as some studies have expressed concerns that patents on initial discoveries may 'delay, hamper, or deter' innovations building on the patented work. The transaction cost of working with patented material is unattractive to many researchers, particularly individuals and start-ups.3.
Based on our research and our experiences during iGEM and in the field of IP, we believe that one of the most important roles for the government is to lead a new, more imaginative line of thinking about intellectual property protection, and to move away from analyzing these issues within the traditional and deeply engrained innovation v access dichotomy.
Creating legal mechanisms to support this kind of innovative and flexible thinking about IP will be increasingly important to synthetic biology and to iGEM as the field grows increasingly complex and the dynamics between the many different interested parties continue to evolve. In order to successfully balance the demands of the public interest, investors, the environment, researchers, and inventors we will need to be more open minded when considering how to deal with IP in the future. It will not suffice to simply ask whether 'to patent or not to patent' and suppose that this is the extent of the available options.
A further issue which we believe needs addressing by a change in the law is the current incapacity of the law to provide protection for computer code and algorithms. This is an issue which extends far beyond iGEM. Counter-intuitively, the lack of protection for algorithms means that this information can justifiably be kept secret rather than being visible and accessible to the public and/or regulators. The danger of this situation was demonstrated only recently by Facebook's so called 'social experiment' during which the company controlled the newsfeed content of users in an attempt to manipulate their emotions. Jim Sheridan, a member of the Commons Media Select Committee, expressed his 'worries about the ability of Facebook and others to manipulate people's thoughts in politics or other areas', and stressed the need for legislation in this area.
Similarly, some form of protection for computer algorithms might allow models relevant to the iGEM competition (and to synthetic biology more broadly) to be shared in a similar way to BioBricks. Engineer Leroy Lim (Doctor of Divinity), responsible for the modeling aspect of the project commented that it would have been highly useful to have models from previous years available at the beginning of the project. 'People would be far more likely to share their code and collaborate on"

Commit to a customs agent in the city for the release of the products into various points of entry. This agent classifies the package within the different areas of classification that exist in the Tax Administration System (SAT) and the Mexican customs laws. Depending on the physics characteristics, use and function that are present in the product, the package is classified. For example, the value of a pen with an integrated clock will depend on which is the main component, in order to be classified as office or as a decoration item. In this case it must be proportional to the broker's invoice product as well as having a detailed and formal description of it.
Register with FedEx Custom Broker. This method of release of packages consists in a small amount of money included in the total cost of shipping a package sent by FedEx. This corresponds to an amount paid to a broker who is in each inner harbor where the parcel is located. It works like a broker customs, however it is possible that the broker can be busy due to the increase of problematic packages.
Use a trading company. A person who is already expert in the field of importations can lend its name and create a trading company, although there could be problems of packet loss, theft of merchandise, etc.
Re-route the package to the American side border, to let a broker customs release the packages with the patent and charge conferred discharged by the ITESM.
Regarding the visit to the FEMSA Biotechnology Center, Tec-Monterrey team was able to show to the attending teams the FEMSA Biotechnology Center, which is dedicated to generating research, transfer knowledge and design business models in biotechnology and food areas. It has the most innovative infrastructure equipment in laboratories, pilot plants and business incubators in the related areas.

Adán López commissioned the second conference, to deliver the lecture ""Project Management"". This one will serve us greatly in the future because the recommendations Dr. López gave us about creating a Gantt diagram of an array of responsibilities and lifecycle of projects.

DLUT_China,2018,Team:DLUT China B#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," is in                         good agreement. At the same time model (2) if the enzyme is compared to our slide, the substrate                         is analogous to our addition. The resulting enzymatic reaction rate-substrate concentration and                         gray value-addition concentration have a good fit. So we decided to use this model. And in the                         other literature[1] of the model, the results obtained are also consistent. The gray                         value and                         concentration relationship in this model are shown in Fig. 1(a), This applies to both fixed                         antigens, immobilized antibodies and assays. The different added substances are shown in                         Fig. 2(b).

(b) Relationship between different additions and gray values (joined                                 separately)
(c) Fixed antigen grayscale model curve
Fig.1 Gray value and additive concentration relationship
In the step of immobilizing the antigen, we control the amount of antigen added, the fixed time,                         and the brightness and the observation magnification at the time of sampling, and use a large                         amount of experimental data to average and reduce the error. Experimental Results After data                         processing, the Figures 1(c), Equations \(\mathrm{Y_1}\), can be obtained. The resulting image                         was used to                         predict other data and found good agreement. Explain that the gray value-concentration model we                         built is in line with our experiments. Thus, we further established the model on antibody                         immobilization and obtained the results of equations \(\mathrm{Z_1}\). From the model and our                         experimental                         data, it can be stated that the gray value and the additive concentration are positively                         correlated when the concentration is not large. From the model and our experimental data, it can                         be stated that the gray value and the additive concentration are positively correlated when the                         concentration is not very large and more than 0.4 μg/ml.
$$ y = 6.4904 x \quad \mathrm{(Y_1)} $$
$$ y = 9.3506 x \quad \mathrm{(Z_1)} $$
There is a bias when the antigen is not fixed. Therefore, we perform a statistical average of the                         gray values of the unfixed antigen. The \(\mathrm{Y_1}\) equation is the result of correcting                         the zero                         point deviation and the post-processing of the comparison relation \(\mathrm{Ψ_q}\).                         \(\mathrm{Z_1}\) can be obtained                         by treating the modified antibody model in the same manner.

2 Responsibilities when working with GMOs
3 Ideas on the longlist
4 Ideas on the shortlist
5 The final cut - reflectin
The Brainstorming Process
Coming up with an actual 'big idea' was exceptionally difficult - we went through a plethora of different ideas, which we narrowed down (with a great deal of difficulty) to 'Bactiridescence' over the course of three weeks. That was over a quarter of our project time! Here we outline the key considerations we had to bear in mind throughout the process, some highlighted projects that came to mind during this period, and the reasons why we dismissed them. We discuss them here in the hope of inspiring future iGEM teams and other researchers in the field of synthetic biology, as well as hopefully setting an example in terms of biosafety responsibility.
Responsibilities when working with GMOs
In our brainstorming we considered safety from the start. Working with genetically modifies organisms (GMOs) poses potential risks -- not just to ourselves -- in a number of ways. Here are some potential 'dangerous experiments':
Demonstrate how to render a vaccine ineffective
Confer resistance to clinically useful antibiotics or antivirals
Enhance virulence of a pathogen or activate a non-pathogen
Increase transmissability of a pathogen
Alter the host range of a pathogen
Enable the evasion of a diagnostic technique
Develop a biological agent that has potential to be used as a weapon
In our project work we only used strains of E. coli that were multiply disabled and non-pathogenic. However, highly virulent strains of E. coli do exist and so the concerns outlined above are especially relevant, and led us to reject a number of project proposals.

When we can actually pare down the models we have to a bare minimum. There's a whole lot of bugs and gray area still in our models and other work. I think the minimal cell projects are coming from the other end; starting blank and adding systems until it fulfills all definitions of a cell. Our work is very important, as the next step after minimal construction will be to direct modification towards a specific purpose. That will proceed much faster if the networks have already been deconstructed. - Jalvin 16:33, 4 June 2009 (UTC)
Why is DNA synthesis technology so important to the development of synthetic biology? Or is it at all?  - GMcArthurIV 00:12, 4 June 2009 (UTC)
I think improvements in DNA synthesis technology are very important to the development of synthetic biology.  With these improvements comes the ability to generate DNA code faster and at a lower cost.  Since the building blocks of synthetic biology are comprised of this DNA code, improvements in the synthesis technology go hand in hand with the development of synthetic biology. - Albergca 14:20, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

Foundations for engineering biology by Drew Endy
Drew Endy lists standardization as a key foundational element to enable biological systems.  In what ways do you think we can standardize biological research? - GMcArthurIV 00:08, 4 June 2009 (UTC)
Cellular devices developed for a standard strain seem to be advantageous for many reasons.  For instance, if the devices are interchangeable with other strains and potentially other organisms, time and money can be saved by not having to redevelop the devices.  A standardized stripped down device also lends itself to the idea of abstraction and decoupling.  These minimal devices can be built up and combined into more complex devices or systems capable of achieving more complicated goals. - Albergca 14:54, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

RFU of the Reporter at various AHL concentrations (0.1 nM - 1000 nM) is shown in Fig. 4. Detection limit was over 10 nM for both cases. The C8 concentration 0 means adding DMSO (solvent for AHLs is DMSO).

The values of parameters are shown in Table. 1
The parameter “a” represents leakiness of the GFP expression in the Reporter. Even in the absence of AHL, it is known that downstream genes below Plux are transcribed slightly. The parameter “b” is the value of RFU when AHL binds to all receptors and is completely induced. The parameter “n“ is the Hill coefficient, and when this value is 1 or more, it is said that there are multiple binding sites. “Km” is the AHL concentration where half of the receptor molecules are bound to the AHL molecules, and this value represent the detection sensitivity of the Reporter. It was found that both AHLs can be detected with a sensitivity of order 10 nM.

Microcins
Microcin C51 (MccC51)
Microcins are a peculiar class of gene-encoded low-molecular-mass antibacterial peptides secreted by enterobacteria. They contribute to the regulation of microbial competition within the intestinal microbiota. The genetic systems involved in microcin biosynthesis share a conserved organization. Similar to bacteriocins, microcins exert potent antibacterial activity directed against phylogenetically-related bacterial strains, with minimal inhibitory concentrations in the nanomolar range.
Usually, microcins exhibit ""Trojan horse"" mechanisms of antibacterial activity: some microcin structures are a mime of essential elements, permitting recognition by outer membrane receptors used for vital functions in bacteria and further translocation into the periplasmic space, other microcins are secreted as harmless molecules and further processed in susceptible bacteria to form the toxic entity. When inside target bacteria, microcins bind essential enzymes or interact with the inner membrane to form a bacterial killing structure.
Microcin C51 is a nucleopeptide of 1.18 kDa molecular mass and the first described nucleopeptide antibiotic. It contains a heptapeptide with the N-terminal formylmethionine and C-terminal asparagine bound to AMP via an aliphatic chain. Microcine C51 is characterized by a broad spectrum of action. Expression in Escherichia coli is activated upon decelerated growth of cells during their transition to the stationary growth phase. This synthesis is controlled by four genes organized in an operon.
Our microcin strain has come from Severinov Laboratory at Rutgers State University (Severinov et al. Mol Microbiol. 2007)

Lecture
The lecture is mainly targeted at junior students, in which we talked about the details of our projects and shared our ideas about synthetic biology. Our lecture mainly contains three sections: In the first section, we mainly focus on the background information of our IGEM and synthetic biology. In the second section, we introduced our project, discussing how our four designed parts work together to convey our idea about evolution. To make it more convincing, we share some of our important data and conclusions. Inspiringly, we gather a lot of valuable suggestions on our projects through the discussion.  In the third section, we played a short video which helps make our projects more perceptible and comprehensible. We also showed how to play the Synthetic Bio-farm game which was developed by our team to propagandize the concept of IGEM and BioBricks. The lecture was a huge success, which was praised widely by the participants, including several professors in the field.
The lecturer is introducing the main topic of our team--Evolution.

Conference
Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference
From July 30th to Aug 3rd, we joined the Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference hosted by iGEM NCHU Taichung in Chung Hsing University. More than twenty iGEM teams from Taiwan, China, and Japan gathered around and shared the incredible projects. Lively discussion surrounds all the time after team presentations and at posters sessions, where we gained many valuable advices from professors and other iGEMers.
In the evening, teams hung out, had dinner, visited night markets, while sharing funny stories and problems encountered during the preparation of Giant Jamboree. Mouth-watering chicken fillet and freshly made pearl milk tea sure brought us closer together. We had a great time, especially with iGEM Fudan-CHINA, iGEM NAU, and iGEM XMU-China, who kindly approached us looking for the possible cooperation further in the future.
It was a precious experience and practice for us to present our project in front of so many Asia iGEMers before Giant Gamboree. Great thanks to NCHU Taichung iGEM team for hosting such wonderful conference!!
Mini-seminar with Mingdao, NCTU_Formosa and NTHU_Taiwan
On July 23rd, four teams from Taiwan gathered together, presented our projects in turn and exchanged feedback with each others. Fresh, creative ideas made this conference not only inspirational but also unforgettable.
We were glad to be a part of this conference taking place in NCTU. It was thrilling knowing this conference is arranged and hosted by Mingdao High School team, which has been participating and obtaining good results in iGEM.for years. 20 minutes presentation and 10 minutes questions and answer times were yielded to each team.
Mingdao aims to build low-cost, rapid-screening and accurate diagnostic device of HIV, living mosquitos is involving in this portable device!
NCTU_Formosa introduced their system of balancing varieties of bacterial growth in the soil by applying corresponding amount of bacteriocin.
NTHU_Taiwan intends to regulate the population of bacteria Vibrio, which possess great potential of commercializing.

Prepare and pour some LB agar plates according to Dr. Phil Aldridge's method
Freeze down cells for TPA collection
Observations
When the two LB + kan plates containing E. coli plus BBa_C0077 and E. coli plus BBa_C0076 were observed today, no colonies were found on either plate!
This presents us with a very difficult situation; we only have 1ul of DNA left to conduct our final transformations! The team took the decision to carry out one final transformation but thsi time to use the DH5-alpha E. coli cells which have worked well in previous transformations.
Procedure
Preparing and Pouring plates
Jane making up 500ml LB solution
Today, Chris Birchall showed us how to pour some LB + agar plates. From this we have devised a protocol, which can be seen here . A summary of the steps can be seen below:
Made up 500ml of LB + agar solution (amount of LB + agar needed for 1 litre - 35 grams) and also prepared 500ml of distilled water into 2 x 1 litre flasks.
Placed foil and autoclave tape on the necks of both flasks and had them autoclaved for 30 minutes.
The LB solution was allowed to cool by sitting on bench whereas distilled water was allowed to cool in tub of cold water.
Once the LB solution had cooled to a hot but holdable temperature, the two solutions were added to each other; the water was poured into the flask of LB solution and the LB solution was then poured back into the flask (which held the distilled water originally). This was all done under aseptic conditions.
5ml of antibiotic (ampicillin) was added to the flask. The LB + agar solution was then poured into a stack of plates under aseptic conditions. The plates were left on the bench surface to cool and solidify.
This procedure was carried out three times so 3 litres of LB + agar solution was made. 1 litre consisted of LB + agar, 1 litre consisted of LB + amp and 1 litre consisted of LB + kan solution.
Freezing Strains for TPA collection
To carry out the remainder of the freezing cells procedure, Phil Aldridge's freezing cells protocol was used. Here is what happened:
Twelve screw cap tubes were taken and placed in rack as 2 sets of 6 tubes. The two sets will serve as duplicates - one set of the six tubes will be stored in Dr. Aldridge's -80C freezer whereas the second set of six tubes will be stored"

What is iGEM?
The iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machine) competition is the world’s largest competition within synthetic biology, and is hosted by Massachussetts Institute of Technolgy (MIT). The iGEM competition is considered the most prestigious competition for students in the field of biotechnology(1).
The competition started out as a month-long course at MIT, where the students had to design a biological system. This course grew to a summer competition in 2004 with just 5 teams, and since then the competition has expanded dramatically with more than 160 teams from universities all over the world in 2011(1).
The iGEM competition provides a kit with standardized biological parts known as BioBricks, that the teams can use for building the genetic machines. The teams can also submit their own BioBricks. Information about the BioBricks and the toolkit to make and manipulate them is provided by the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . Over the summer, the teams work at their universities, where they use the provided parts plus parts of their own design to build biological systems that can operate in living cells(1).
iGEM is about manipulation of genetic material, where the only limit is ones own imagination. The iGEM competition has demonstrated a new way to arouse students interest in modern biology and to develop their independent learning skills.The project ideas are many and diverse, but overall they show great potential.

In the beginning of the project, I organized a cabin trip for the team to do some team building, and later on, I’ve been working on analyzing the growth of the fungus  including both some image analysis and creating a model that simulates the microscopic hyphal growth. Furthermore, I have been assisting with the design of the wiki in regards to creating some of the graphics and other aspects.
Nicolai Jensen
My early involvement in the project was mainly about administrative work and planning some team building activities. I got involved in mechanical testing which led me to become the team's’ favorite fabricator. I made a budget hydraulic press and supplied the bio-folks with welded inoculator boxes until we decided that silicone ice-cube trays were better(they are). After designing our “brick” design, it was sent on to mechanical simulation. Lately, I’ve been doing compression tests of the fungus and will be designing and conducting tension tests in order to try to get Young's modulus of the fungus.
Lau Halkier Wandall
In the start I focused on ensuring that we chose a project, e.g. plan and book. Together with Mathias, I looked into different types of growth models. After looking at many different types, the coupling between model and reality was not as well-studied as hoped. I started working on modeling structural mechanics for the final structure as a test of realistic conditions. I also grew fungi under different conditions since MycoLab had some periods with very few people.
Tenna Gram Rasmussen
I was involved in a lot of branches throughout the project. I performed the Interlab study together with David, started the elementary school project and was heavily involved in creating the iGEM high school team (CHSS). I was one of the main responsibles who planned and executed the Biobrick Tutorial 2018, kept track of administrative work, worked on designing and writing a big part of the wiki, and I worked in the synthlab.
Joen Haahr Jensen
My efforts in this project have mainly been distributed in a threefold way: Fundraising, accounting and laboratory work. In the spring, I focused my time on applying for grants. Over the summer, I have spent my hours either being in the lab or thinking about being in the lab. Occasionally, in parallel to the rest, I have also brought forth a spreadsheet with expenditures and said “No, we cannot buy that.”

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters"

     The first stage is the input stage, or planning stage, or preparatory stage; besides preparation before a certain synthetic biology project, it also has an extended meaning of the time before the advent of synthetic biology;
     The second stage is the processing stage, or the doing stage; it could be viewed as either the real lab work or the flourish of synthetic biology itself;
     The third stage is its output stage, or its ""after"" stage, or assessment stage; both the assessment of a certain product and the assessment of synthetic biology itself are indicated.
     Any ethical concern, whatever it is, should belong in one of the three stages.
     Questions about worthiness, ones that ask about ""whether it should start"", or ""is it necessary at all"" belong to the first stage. To answer these questions, we should look forward and try to evaluate how its performance in the third stage will fare. How it will pay off, what's its potential cost.
     And when it's a question that's about any kind of assessment concerning ending which is hard to predict, such as ""what will it end up with"", we could look back how this problem has come into being in the 3-D model and try to see the nature of this concern, besides the more direct analysis of the concern itself. Questions of this nature are the most

3. Tracing Back to the Origin
Diversity forms the world of senses, unicity lies at the heart of intuition. ``Tao produced one, one produced two, two produced three, three produced everything'', says the Taoist sage Lao Tzu.
     This verse could be looked at as a simple paradigm of the development of a discipline. Synthetic biology has passed its initial stage and is somewhere on its way to a world of ``everything''. When complexity increases with perhaps some exponential rate with each step forward, simplicity becomes more than a style but a necessity. When going forward, perhaps sometimes we should also track backward, and the farthest we can go with rationality is the state of ``one'', whereas"

Tianjin,2011,Team:Tianjin#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," downstream proteins (Notice: The equilibrium constant
can reflect the resistance of Tor2 to FAP to some degree). Another simplification here is that, before we fully understand the mechanism of how FAP inhibit Tor2, we could just treat the interaction between them as complex formation. When Tor2 is bound to FAP, it no longer fulfills the downstream phosphorylation.
As a result, dephosphorylation of Tor2 leads to increased activity of PP2As. Then PP2As turn to be functional again and dephosphorylate a series of transcription factors (Here we use Rtg1/3 as example in the rest modeling part).
Those dephosphorylated transcription factors move into the nucleus (they use to be excluded out of nucleus when phosphorylated), and then activate specific genes. First, dephosphorylated transcription factor could bind with promoter of specific sequences. Here transcription factor Rtg1/3 can activate gene CIT2 by binding its promoter pCIT2. Once bound with transcription factor Rtg1/3, pCIT2 turns into an activated state - pCIT2*. Only activated promoters pCIT2* are able to initiate the transcription process. After transcription, pCIT2* break down into pCIT2, Rtg1/3 and mRNA. These specific mRNAs would complete translation, during which mTOR2p (short for mutant Tor2 protein) would exist in cytoplasm.
For mutant Tor2 protein, it has the identical functions of original Tor2 protein, which means it can phosphorylate Tip41 and Tap42 with the same reaction rate.
However, our mutations give mTor2 protein improved resistance to FAP, which can be demonstrated from the value of reaction rate:
is much more greater than
i   As [Tap42p] [Tip41p][Tor1/2p] [PP2A1][PP2A2][RTG1/3p][pCIT2] are treated as factors in signaling transduction, we assume that their total amount would remain unchanged. There only exist different states. For example: the total amount of Tap42 in cytoplasm is unchanged, but Tap42 had two different states, phosphorylated and dephosphorylated. Only certain amount of protein will take part into this gene circuit and transduction loop.
ii  Our main mission is about the regulation on transduction of a signal (FAP existing in cytoplasm), thus other complicated mechanism are ignored. Certainly there must be some Tap42 proteins having interactions with other substances, but the small"
BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"2016). Thus, the expenditure and facilities needed for protein generation and enrichment in practical research or production can be reduced;
The yeast cell wall offers a solid surface to stabilize foreign proteins, which improves enzyme stability (Pack, 2002) in long-term storage and enable recycling in industrial processes;
Tethering of multiple synergetic enzymes on a single cell significantly shortens the enzyme-to-enzyme distance, preventing long-distance mass transfer of substrates, especially in high-solid fermentation;
Yeast cells can be measured through a flow cytometer, thus it makes high-throughput screenings more feasible and convenient (Shibasaki, 2009).
Regarding the significant advantages of yeast surface display system, it has a wide range of applications in research and industrial fields. For instance, in medicine, yeast surface display is employed to conduct high-throughput antibody screening and manufacturing oral vaccine for precaution (Chao, 2006), diagnostics and therapeutics. Additionally, since yeasts play a critical role in the commercial production of fuel and fermentation (Liu, 2016), this technique is utilized to display amylolytic enzymes, lipase, and cellulolytic enzymes to act as a whole-cell biocatalyst. Moreover, it can also be designed as a heavy metal-absorbent or a non-invasive sensor and monitor.
Our Goal
Despite several extraordinary advantages presented above, we still envision some prospects for this technique. Up to now, only separate components, such as monomer protein subunits, has been displayed. No assembly has been done. If the polymer could be displayed as a whole on yeast cell wall, a lot more could be done. For example, the detection of some small molecules relies on the integrity of the polymer. Displaying polymers on yeast would allow high-throughput screening to be realized. The display of complex enzymatic pathways could also be accomplished using this new system. Currently, the types of co-displayed enzymes are limited. Our solution is to create an extracellular scaffold for enzymes to interact to each other. This would greatly increase the variety and quantity of displayed enzymes.

When asking about this permission make sure we say we have biobrick prefixes and suffixes anyway. Ask for the list of approved vectors.
Copy the genbank files of the plasmids to Dropbox
Send an email for Track selection selecting three of them in order of preference. So the list will be Environment, Information Processing,... (It is due on 18th Sep) (What was the 3rd one? Is Information Processing second or third?)
Write the abstract and send it to instructors before next Tuesday. Do not use more than what is asked(150 words?) State the problem we are tackling and our approach.
Team roster is due on 18th Sep
Remind to Neil and Jen to finalize the team rosters
Finish everything until October 15th, send the biobricks, enter all the information
Learn who can enter the parts on the registry. Does it have to be instructors? (Goksel)

HokkaidoU_Japan,2012,Team:HokkaidoU Japan#Project#Aggregation_-_-_TEXT.html,"pore size: 250 um)
Induction of function of “Aggregation Module” was tested by observing appearance of aggregated E. coli cluster in the presence (right) or absence (left) of L-arabinose in culture medium (See Image12).  Aggregated E. coli clusters were observed only in the culture medium containing L-arabinose. The results suggest that the auto-aggregation of E. coli is mediated by overexpressed Ag43.
Image12  Induction of function of “Aggregation Module”. Appearance of aggregated E. coli in the presence (right) or absence (left) of L-arabinose in culture medium. Plasmid structure is pBAD-RBS-eCFP-RBS-Ag43-dT-pSTV28 (low copy plasmid), and culture condition is at 37C for 24 hrs at 130 rpm.
Besides above experiments, we tried to confirm a relationship between Ag43 expression and aggregation by monitoring signal associated with eCFP (indicator module) fused to “Aggregation Module”. During culture of the cells, we monitored change of OD600 as indicator of cell growth, and measured emission associated with eCFP as indicator of expression of “Aggregation Module” (See protocol page for experimental procedure). Plasmid structure is pBAD-RBS-eCFP-RBS-Ag43-dT-pSB1C3 and we cultivated  at 37C for 12 hrs at 180 rpm.
The result showed there is relation between optical density and aggregation. At the same time cultivating cells, OD600 of each cell culture's suspension are increasing, but increasing ratio of arabinose added culture (Arabinose+) became lower than negative control (Arabinose-) (Image13). On the other hand, we couldn't observe the expression of eCFP.

HKU-HKBU,2009,Team:HKU-HKBU#Human Practice Interview_-_-_TEXT.html," logical thinking . Students cannot learn how to think by just reading textbook but this kind of competition provides an opportunity to sharpen their mind.
DR.W: This kind of competition offer undergraduates a chance to do some research! Many undergraduates do not know what exactly research is and how it is being performed. We hope they will develop some interests in research throughout the competition. Besides pure experiments, activities such as fund-raising and human practices allow our students to get out of their lab and interact with the community. These associated activities can also develop their whole-person education at the same time .
HKU-HKBU: How about the importance of synthetic biology. In your professional opinion, does it have a bright future ahead of it?
DR.H: It is hard to say. Synthetic biology is still at its early stage, like a new-born baby. It is very hard to determine its future impact on the basis of its relatively young history background. In terms of its contribution, synthetic biology is most well-known for the development of a drug to cure malaria, otherwise we are still awaiting for some major breakthroughs in the near future. Nevertheless, the wide applicability of synthetic biology makes it an exciting field to explore , especially in the energy and medicine fields. It will sure stand itself up after sometime.
DR.W: There is still a long path ahead of us, synthetic biology itself is built upon on genetic engineering, molecular biology and others genetically-related field. It requires and relies on accumulation of knowledge in other more fundamental fields. However, synthetic biology itself is more engineering like in terms of the logic behind it. This kind of ""cut and paste"" process allows more creative design and wilder development. Who knows what coming next but surely it is a field that will catch scientist's eyes very soon .
HKU-HKBU: As you all know, there are some people out there who go against genetic engineering, such as GM food. They visualize genetic engineering as a dangerous and unethical practice. Do you share the same view with them?
DR.H: Everything has a risk, fire is dangerous, and so as nuclear power, but we are still need them in our life. The true meaning of dangerous is depends on how you practice and handle the risk. This also applies to genetic engineering! It may be unethical and dangerous only when used irresponsibly, but when they are preformed under regulations and their possible benefit can be enormous, why stop them?
DR.W: In addition to that, there are committees out there closely monitoring and regulating our genetic research activities , making sure our practices have its risk being kept to minimal. We could not just stop"

In our approach, we are going to transform PHL628-△csgA cells with pBbE1a plasmids with CsgA-SpyTag to express curli as the base. Curli from different strains will connect adjacent bacteria to form biofilm. Since there’re three orthogonal systems — SpyTag/SpyCatcher, SnoopTag/SnoopCatcher and SdyTag/SdyCatcher , we will synthesize a string of three enzymes rather than one single SpyCatcher-Enzyme. The method is illustrated in Picture 2.
Fig.2
As it was mentioned in the beginning, the curli fiber system serves as a mediator between enzymes and the electrode. We have to pay attention to its efficiency. So another thing we do is to insert two histidine-tags into CsgA (the major subunit of the curli fiber) so that curli fibers can be specifically associated to NiNTA-AuNPs, and then to the electrode. [2] With the help of NiNTA-AuNPs, electrons released by enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactions are delivered to the electrode much more quickly.

At the current stage, our algorithm can only pick metabolites with natural transporters in cell. Therefore, many other intermediate metabolites are ignored. The algorithm has no power to trace the intermediate metabolites back to initial metabolites and take those initial metabolites into account. This model does not take into consideration rate limiting steps of reactions, toxic intermediate accumulation, or any form of regulation of the enzymes (e.g., negative feedback).  The OSCAR Optimizer should act as a starting point to identify any limitation of available endogenous metabolites in E. coli to increase the starting compound levels of your synthetic circuit for optimal production.

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioSensor IRES_-_-_TEXT.html," initial approach was to order a gene block with the constitutive promoter, stabilizing loop, modulator, aaIRES, theophylline aptamer, aIRES, and IRES sequence (in total 310 bp) from IDT, and clone that into baseline iGEM GFP plasmid BBa_E0040. To this, we ordered the following primers that were auto-generated in SnapGene.
We spent weeks trying unsuccessfully to amplify the fragment and the backbone with these primers, before realizing that they were too short. We also realized in the interim that we had failed to include a T7 primer in the initial design and that T7 was required for our in vitro translation system to work. In light of these two observations, we redesigned our primers to include the T7 primer and to be longer. The gel below shows the backbone plasmid and the amplified fragment using the redesigned primers.
Figure 3: This gel confirms the 310 bp piece and the 3 kb backbone were successfully amplified by our primers.
With these we were able to successfully get the both the gene block and the plasmid backbone expressed. Figure 3 is the gel confirmation of that success. From there we used the amplified fragments to Gibson assemble together the plasmid of interest. Once assembled, we sequence confirmed the plasmid, the results of which can be found on the Bio Brick page for this construct.
After we had the whole plasmid, we used it to express the RNA sensor, and then challenged the RNA with various concentrations of theophylline. In our first test we only used theophylline conditions -- we didn't want to waste expensive in vitro translation reagents -- but we saw that the .01 mM, 1 mM, and 10 mM theophylline concentrations all expressed the same baseline level of fluorescence (Figure 4).
Figure 4: Initial IRES sensor trial. The far right is 0.1mM theophylline, the middle is 1mM theophylline, and the far right is 10 mM theophylline.
We next postulated that the observed  inactivity may be due to the fact that our engineered plasmid completely lacked a gap between the translation start site and the AUG start codon of GFP.  Accordingly we linearized the plasmid at the point where the TSS meets GFP, amplified this template with primers that incorporated a 6nt gap region, and performed blunt-end ligation to re circularize the plasmid. Post recircularization, we re"

Notice the few hard-and-fast rules we have: don't use organisms from Risk Group 3 or 4, and don't release our project into the wild
Know our local guidelines: talk to our team instructors and our institution's biosafety officers
Ask for help: email safety (at) igem (dot) org, or join the iGEM team for Virtual Open Office Hours
Safe Organisms
We use two kinds of organisms, Escherichia coli and Caenorhabditis elegans in our experiments. E.coli is categorized as a Risk Group 1 organism [1] while C.elegans is on the whitelist [2] . According to the official iGEM description, “Risk Group 1 organisms do not cause disease in healthy adult humans.” and organisms on the whitelist “do not cause any threat to the environment”. To make sure that everything is safe enough to use, we have always been talking to our lab technician, Mr. Ho xx, about the proper usage, storage and disposal methods.
Safe Project Design
Safety is always our first priority when carrying out the program. Although the only species we use is E.coli and C.elegans, which are only organisms which do not cause harm to human when used properly, we believe that there is still a danger when our bacteria is released into the public environment, especially to children and elderlies. For example, it may cause bacteria to develop antibiotics resistance and make more diseases incurable [3] . Therefore, we make sure that no bacteria or organism carrying our modified genes will be released out of the laboratory. To achieve this, the bacteria will always remain inside the laboratory; we always bring worms into the laboratory but not our bacteria outside the laboratory into the public environment. While doing any experiment with e.coli, we ensure the bacteria do not expose to the environment by setting up a sterile space using a Bunsen burner and working in the heated area. Also to keep the bacteria away from the open environment, we seal every used petri dishes with parafilm before long term"

Cambridge-JIC,2016,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," hard to store and apply safely.
On top of providing an attractive expression platform, chloroplasts are the target of a lot of research, aiming to increase yields of oils for biofuels, elucidate photosynthetic machinery and improve C fixation to combat the international food crisis. However, despite the advantages, chloroplast engineering is currently underexplored. One of the obstacles is the time it takes (2-3 months) to achieve homoplasmy (a state in which all the copies of chloroplast DNA have been transformed are therefore stable), which is required for analysis of colonies to be performed. A further challenge is the experimental cost - for example, chloroplasts can be reliably transformed almost exclusively by biolistic devices, and commercial biolistic devices are very expensive. Finally, the lack of modular chloroplast genetic parts available makes gene cloning significantly more time-consuming and cumbersome.
The goal of our project is to remove some bottlenecks from chloroplast engineering, and provide grounds for future work aimed at removing more. In particular, we want to use Cas9 to promote the spread of genetic modifications across copies of the chloroplast genome and thus homoplasmy. In parallel to this, we are developing a library of standardised chloroplast genetic parts, which would facilitate chloroplast transformation both for the iGEM and wider communities. We wish to further democratise microalgae biotechnology by building affordable open-source hardware: a gene gun and a Chlamydomonas growth facility. Both will be available at a fraction of the cost of commercially available equivalents.
Promoting Homoplasmy
The ultimate goal of the project is to achieve homoplasmy in Chlamydomonas chloroplasts much more quickly than the 2-3 months of repeated antibiotic selection currently taken — ideally, over the span of a single generation.
Our method relies on double transformation of Chlamydomonas chloroplast with a cassette-of-interest (CoI) and the highly customisable “driver” cassette that we are developing. The “driver” could be easily adapted to any cassette-of-interest by changing the 20 nucleotide gRNA space (plus, if needed, homology regions 1 and 2). The organisation of the two cassettes is shown in the figure below:
After transformation, Cas9 would repeatedly cut chloroplast genome copies at the desired site of insertion, thereby promoting homologous recombination (HR). The cutting would continue until the gRNA homology in all of genome copies has been disrupted, which can only result when the cassette-of-interest is used as the template for HR. Non-h"

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2016,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#HP#Activities_-_-_TEXT.html," a hint about looking for mechanically gated channels in human ears. Actually, the normal function of ears is dependent on a system that realize amplification and subsequent transduction from sound wave to shear force. Given those suggestions, we read a paper about channels on plant cell membrane may take responsibility for their ability of sound sensing, which suggests the possible applications of our project. [1] Also, we designed microfluidics and other stimulus to test our system.
When we studied advanced knowledge about sound-sensitive channels, we consulted Dr. Zhiyi Wei majoring in Biochemistry& Structural Biology suggested that if we want to achieve better efficiency, we ought to use directed evolution methods to strengthen the sensitivity on protein level.

Facing a synthetic biology project of concern is like being exposed to some input signals. Thinking about its various implications, origins, solutions, is processing this information. When we get our answer, that's the output. It can be the end of the process if that's what we're looking for, or it can continue to act like an input signal for other processes, in cases where our answer becomes someone else's inspiration.
     Similarly, synthetic biology is about creating things. Creating things is a kind of work, and like any kind of work, it is an interaction between the entire working entity (including the one working and the one being worked on) and its environment, corporeal or spiritual. Interaction involves the processing of information, so it can be divided as different stages. And it can also be divided into the three stages, input, processing, and output. Because these stages exclude each other in one round, such division is able to include the whole process from birth to death.
     The first stage is the input stage, or planning stage, or preparatory stage; besides preparation before a certain synthetic biology project, it also has an extended meaning of the time before the advent of synthetic biology;
     The second stage is the processing stage, or the doing stage; it could be viewed as either the real lab work or the flourish of synthetic biology itself; or its present;
     The third stage is its output stage, or its ""after"" stage, or assessment stage; both the assessment of a certain product and the assessment of synthetic biology itself are indicated; or its future.
     Any ethical concern, whatever it is, should belong in one of the three stages.
     Questions about worthiness, ones that ask about ""whether it should start"", or ""is it necessary at all"" belong to the first stage. To answer these questions, we should look forward and try to evaluate how its performance in the third stage will fare. How it will pay off, what's its potential cost.
     And when it's a question that's about any kind of assessment concerning ending which is hard to predict, such as ""what will it end up with"", we could look back how this problem has come into being in the 3-D model and try to see the nature of this concern, besides the more direct analysis of the concern itself.

Lethbridge_HS,2016,Team:Lethbridge HS_-_-_TEXT.html," outreach we have been conducting. For example, we have gone to schools in Southern Alberta to educate students with respect to our project and iGEM. In addition, we have devised a public survey, went door to door, and created a social media account to try and establish an amicable rapport with those affected by severe bleeding and members of our community.
In the lab, we hope to successfully express our recombinant DNA in E.coli, and produce an effective solution for clotting blood. After that, we hope to develop a fast-acting and effective prototype that will be able to clot pressurized blood being pumped through a simulated wound. If this is accomplished, we’ll attempt to design a tool or delivery system to make sure that we apply the right amount of our system to the wound in order to get the best clot. In addition, we want to test whether or not the clotting factors can move through the body causing an embolism elsewhere. This is something we want to prevent and need to test if our system can remain local in the wound.
Our team hopes that our inexpensive and effective technology will be able to help military personnel, disaster victims, and other people affected with severe bleeding survive their ordeals, and have a better quality of life afterwards. In doing so, we will reduce strain on healthcare systems, simplify treatment of major bleeding for EMTs and doctors, and keep families together.

We had students visit the lab and do an activity where they explored the lab and guessed which equipment they would need for their projects. It was fun to connect with students.
It was particularly exciting to collaborate with the Biology Club, however, because we discovered that this year their organization includes members who are in the STEM Club at Lafayette High School. Because a from this club student was the person who reached out to the Biology Club, this was not a widely-known resource among other students and teachers in the area. Therefore, we invited the heads of the club to present to our teacher focus group to expand the reach of their club to various local high schools.
Conversations with Legislators
Over the course of the past year, we have been lucky to have had the opportunity to show Virginia national and state legislators around our lab and increase their awareness and knowledge of the field of synthetic biology, so they can make more informed decisions on policy. Additionally, since we go to a public university, we felt it was important for our state senators to have a better understanding of our research.
Representative Scott Taylor visited the Bioengineering Lab on April 24, 2017. Representative Taylor is the United States Representative for Virginia's 2nd Congressional District, which encompasses counties near the College of William & Mary. We talked to Representative Taylor about the importance of the research that occurs at William & Mary, both for our area of Virginia and nationally.
Virginia Senator Dick Saslaw serves as a member of the Senate Subcommittee on Higher Education and on the Finance Committee, specifically on the Education Subcommittee. Senator Saslaw visited the Bioengineering Lab on May 31, 2017. Two members of our team talked to him about synthetic biology and our iGEM project.
On May 31, 2017, Virginia Senator Janet Howell visited the William & Mary Bioengineering Lab and talked to members of the iGEM team about science research at William & Mary. Senator Howell also serves on the Education Finance Subcommittee in the Virginia Senate.
On July 10, 2017, Virginia Senator Monty Mason visited the Bioengineering Lab to learn more about the research opportunities at William & Mary. Our team introduced the field of synthetic biology and our iGEM project. Senator Mason's congressional district includes Williamsburg and the College of William & Mary, so the iGEM team was excited to talk to him about the scientific research that occurs here and discuss our education outreach with local public school students. His interest in the resources we could provide to educators and"

The continued presence of the strange digestion patterns leads me to believe that this may be a problem that originates in the sequence of these plasmids. The possibility of two plasmid species is probably ruled out by clean sequencing reads.
If we desire, we may repeat this image using XbaI and PstI to digest.

Therefore bacteria required three selection markers, which almost stopped their growth. Decreasing the amount of antibiotics allowed bacteria to grow faster but we could only demonstrate the production of lycopene, which can be produced by the first three enzymes. The reason is that probably bacteria lost a plasmid for the rest of the biosynthetic pathway. However production of lycopene shows that zinc fingers do not interfere with membrane enzyme activity.
Figure 9: Cell  pellets a culture with  operon for lycopene biosynthesis with enzymes fused to zinc finger  domains (pBAD Jazz::crtE Blues::crtB Zif268::crtI in pSB4K5)
Figure 10: HPLC analysis of extract from cell pellet of a culture with operon for lycopene biosynthesis with enzymes fused to zinc finger domains (pBAD Jazz::crtE Blues::crtB Zif268::crtI in pSB4K5).
Future perspectives
We managed to prepare the constructs according to our cloning strategy. The whole system was on three different plasmids, which caused delayed growth of bacteria in the presence of three antibiotics. In order to obtain the expected results we will have to introduce the complete system for DNA-guided carotenoid biosystem into bacteria either in a single plasmid or vie chromosome integration. Due to the lack of time we did not manage to complete all of our goals, that is to extend the demonstration of the application of DNA-guided assembly of biosynthetic pathway from violacein also to carotenoids. Therefore the improvement of yield and specificity of carotenoid biosynthesis has yet to be determined in the next experiments.

Introduction: Welcome to Synthetic Ethics from the University of Calgary’s iGEM team.
Alex: Hello and welcome to synthetic ethics from the University of Calgary’s iGEM team. My name is Alex Grigg, and this is my iGEM teammate Dev Vyas. Let’s give out listeners a little information on what iGEM is all about.
Dev: Sure Alex, iGEM is an undergraduate synthetic biology competition in which undergraduate students like ourselves work over the summer to design and develop a project. This year 128 teams from all over the globe are participating.
Alex: Yes, and the project is pretty much completely open ended, past project have ranged from detecting arsenic in drinking water, to beer that fights cancer, to bacterial art using fluorescence proteins.
Dev: There’s a number of streams that you can choose to work in, including Food or Energy, Environment, Health or medicine, manufacturing, new application, foundational advance, and information processing.
Alex: So should we let the listeners hear a little about what we were working on in the wet-lab?
Dev: Yeah sure, this year we were constructing a biological toolkit that can detect problems with protein expression within E. Coli. Our vision for our circuit is a kit on two plasmids, which researchers could implant a gene of interest coding for the protein they want to be expressed in E. Coli, and determine where problems are occurring.
Alex: Yep, One circuit we built would confirm that the protein is being translated and transcribed, and the other circuit could tell if a protein is being mislfolded. It detects protein misfolding in the periplasm, and cytoplasm, and will give us a simple visual output of fluorescence proteins.
Dev: At the end of all this work the teams all meet at M.I.T to present their projects, and judges determine which teams deserve medals.
Alex: So what kind of criteria do we need to meet in order to achieve one of these medals?
Dev: Well the criteria are rather extensive, and you don’t need to meet all this criteria in order to achieve a bronze or silver medal. For one, your team needs to describe your project on your team wiki, you can view ours at https://201"

BBa_K2111000
RI7_FLAG_OXTR:           This part is a chimeric receptor with a FLAG tag. It is composed of the ligand binding domain of the human oxytocin receptor,           flanked by the N and C termini of the rat RI7 olfactory receptor. It was designed using the DIY receptor design guide created           by the 2012 TU Delft iGEM team (https://2012.igem.org/Team:TU-Delft/receptordesign). This part is intended to express in the           membrane of a yeast cell and - upon oxytocin ligand binding - activate the mating pathway and the inducible FUS1 promotor.           This allows us to leverage a reporter protein under control of FUS1 to detect the presence of oxytocin.

“… leukemia has already been treated with comparable approaches. After all, you always need to assess potential off-target activities, efficiencies and – most importantly – a drug vector for medical approaches ...” (Prof. Dr. Peter Stäheli, Virology)
So there will be risks, but does that mean that this kind of therapy has to be banned?
“… you always need to carefully balance the arguments for such an approach in gene therapy: stable integration of proteins like Cas9 into a patient’s cell implicates a certain risk of carcinogenic chromosomal aberrations. On the other hand, would you deny the promising chance of such a therapeutic device to someone who is – until then – suffering from a lethal disease?” (Prof. Dr. Peter Stäheli)
To assess which kind of therapy is ethically acceptable, there have to be made up subtypes and considerations about the borders between them:
“… there are four categories of medical treatment, with increasing ethical dubiousness: number one doesn’t affect any genes at all, the second only transiently changes gene expression, number three renders the genome of somatic cells and in the fourth, the germ line itself is affected - which is, without any doubt, a no-go. However, the transient application of this tool in human cells, when introduced by vesicle-coated RNA, would only concern category two.“ (Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Driever)
The question, which of these categories should be allowed, has to be discussed in society. This is where politicians have to be adressed, as they are the people who make the regulations, but:
“... can politicians really assess research projects from their non-scientific backgrounds?“  (Dr. Jochen Holzschuh, Neuronal Development)
Nevertheless, there is a need for researchers to enter into a dialogue with the public, because the consequences of their work will hit everybody and:
“... a scientist can never stay objective in regard to his own project. Moral judgements, thus, always need to be developed with non-involved experts ...“ (Dr. Jochen Holzschuh)
So, before a discussion can take place, all participants must know at least some basi facts. That is one reason why we visited politicians and went to a science fair.
But even when strict regulations are set, a scientist has still the responsibility to think of the potential consequences his results can be used for, because:
“... the perspective of progress and benefits will guide scientists from all over the world to continue, so regulation by the law of one country is not sufficient if scientists in other countries"

Here we assemble BioBrick-compatible shuttle       vectors for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, a naturally competent relative of E. coli that grows as rapidly under identical conditions. We will show that        A. baylyi can be transformed with recombinant DNA simply by adding ligation reactions to mid-log cultures; transformants are selected as usual by        spreading them onto LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, cefotaxime or amikacin).        These experiments will show how BioBricks can be constructed and assembled in modestly funded laboratories in community colleges, high schools and        even private homes. The resulting plasmid constructs retain their pSB1C3 backbones and will thus remain compatible with the BioBrick standard and        capable of replication in the widely used E. coli chassis.

Synthetic Biology is largely restricted to well-funded laboratories at major research universities in high income countries.        One significant barrier to entry is the capital cost of instruments.

HUST-China,2014,Team:HUST-China#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," the experimental session should be fully considered the impact on the environment. Thus this approach can ensure more reliability and safety research.
Second, to take responsibility for their own science and ethics roles, ensuring its own security and operating experiments meticulously and carefully must be at the top of priority list for researchers. Only after ensuring the safety of their lives they can continue to benefit more people with science and technology. Secondly, you need to note the experimental aspects of the design, simulate environment in the experimental stage for a simulated environment as far as possible, and do experiments in a simulated environment to discover the possibility of such impacts on the environment caused by bacteria quickly and efficiently. Finally, in the process of the project out of the actual lab environment, the entire process needs to be carefully monitored, sustained attented, made a detailed observation records, because it is likely that this project bacteria don't influence environmental in a short time, but after a very long time it will have feedback on the environment, which requires laboratory personnel to establish an effective mechanism for long-term observation to maintain the security of the entire project.

Bacterial Transformation
Introduction of exogenous DNA into cells using non-viral methods is called “Transformation”.Transformation is commonly used to introduce recombinant plasmid DNA into bacterial strains which can transform naturally or can be made competitive for transformation by artificial means.
Depending on the expected transformation efficiency, there are two main types of competent cells that can be used for transformation.
1.Chemically competent cells
Chemically induced competent cells are calcium chloride-treated to facilitate attachment of the plasmid DNA to the competent cell membrane. During chemical transformation, the cells are heat-shocked in a water bath; which opens the pores of the cell membrane allowing entry of plasmid DNA from the buffer.
2.Electrocompetent cells
Electrocompetent cells are prepared for transformation using electroporation, a method that uses an electrical pulse to create pores through which genetic material enters the cells. This method usually has high transformation efficiency.
Procedure
1. Take out an appropriate number of tubes that contain competent cells(100μl ) from the -80℃ refrigerator. Immediately place the tubes on ice, so that all but the cap is surrounded by ice. Allow the cells to thaw on ice for 2-5 min.
2.  Visually check the cells to see whether they have thawed and gently flick the cells 1-2 times to evenly resuspend the cells.
3. Add 10μl PCR products(mini-prep purified) to the competent cells DH-5α. Stir gently to mix and return the tube to the ice, making sure that the tube is surrounded by ice except for the cap. Repeat for additional two times for the same samples.
4. Incubate the tubes on ice for 30 min.
5. Place the tubes in a 42°C water bath for exactly 90 sec; do not shake.
6. Place the tubes on ice for 2 min to cool down.
7. Add 800 l of room temperature LB medium to each tube.
8. Shake the tubes vigorously at 37°C for 45-60 min.
9. Centrifuge the tubes at 3K RPM for 1 min. Discard the supernatant liquor and leave 100-200 μl of the mixtures.Mix the contents and spread the whole liquid on LB agar"

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.       There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.
Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe,      exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how' of life.      Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality.       An alternative, humanistic approach poses the question ""What is the meaning of my life?""      The value of the question pertaining to the purpose of life may coincide with the achievement of ultimate reality, or a feeling of oneness,      or even a feeling of sacredness.

First of all, their tryptophan productivity was measured. For we wanted to know their productivity in our evolution conditions, we didn’t applied the previous fermentation condition (30℃ after IPTG induction for 48h). Oppositely, we applied the conditions that would be applied in our evolution protocol as 37℃ after IPTG induction for 24h. The IPTG application concentration was set as 24mg/L. Results was shown as below.
Figure.14 bitter pressure part function: growth rate against concentration of tryptophan (intracellular tryptophan production)
It was clear that transformation of our engineered bitter pressure parts didn’t significantly influence original strains’ tryptophan relative productivity. Hence, we further tested these three parts’ performance by measuring the growth rate of these nine strains in different tetracycline concentration. For protocol, please refer to our note part. The final results were shown as growth dynamics below.
As shown here, strains carrying our bitter pressure part with RBS B0030 and B0032 showed good tryptophan dependent growth property within the first 15h after culture. Further, as the increase of tetracycline, the selection pressure increased and the growth rate of strains decreased. However, with increased selection pressure, especially for B0032, it could be observed that with time window of about 15h, strains with higher tryptophan overproduction showed much higher growth rate with the growth of tryptophan non producer trp000 nearly inhibited by high concentration of tetracycline. However, it was confused to find that strains trp000 carrying bitter pressure part vector tended to grow beyond this time window. That was hypothesized to be due to the inactivity of tetracycline. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment that. Another obvious phenomenon was such tryptophan dependent growth difference was more significant when IPTG induction was conducted. Thus, according to the result of tryptophan dependent growth, we designed the evolution protocol for tryptophan overproduction strains.

Lethbridge,2015,Team:Lethbridge HS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,", and scalpels. Currents methods used to destroy biofilms include antibiotics and biocides. These methods are often expensive, harsh, and ineffective; biofilms are notorious for developing resistance to chemical treatments. Instead of trying to kill the bacteria in the biofilm, we decided to degrade the matrix that protects it. We have created a cocktail of Nuclease and Dextranase to achieve this purpose. Once the matrix is degraded, the bacteria inside can be eliminated without the use of expensive chemicals.  What is nuclease? What is dextranase? As mentioned earlier, one of the two targets for dispersing the biofilm is its extracellular DNA. To do so, we are using E.coli to secrete nuclease. A nuclease is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bonds of nucleic acids. More specifically, the nuclease utilized by our team is a Micrococcal nuclease (Mnase) capable of cleaving single-stranded and double-stranded nucleic acids. The irony of the situation being that the nuclease bio brick (Part: BBa_K729004) being used is derived from Staphylococcus aureus.  S. aureus biofilms are a major problem on medical equipment, and account for many infections. The S. aureus biofilm uses the Mnase for partial dispersal of its outer layer, so its inner colonies can spread outside and grow more biofilms. S aureus. Being a gram positive, ubiquitous bacteria, has one of the toughest biofilms. And hence, the strength of the Mnase is equally supplementary. Although the Mnase is derived from S. aureus, the function and the effect of the enzyme is not limited to that bacteria. Since extracellular DNA is component of almost every biofilm, the effect of the enzyme will not be affected by a change in the species/strain of bacteria. To further enhance the effects of Mnase, it will be applied in a mixture that also includes Dextranase. Dextranase is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of bonds within dextran. Dextran is a component of the exopolysaccharide (EPS) matrix, common to many biofilms. The dextranase used for the construct, is an alpha-dextranase derived from Chaetomium gracile (a dematiaceous mold from the fungi family). Dextranase, by degrading parts of the EPS matrix would allow for Mnase to further seep into"

Hi! Biomedical research has been a fascination for me for a long time, but school science classes covered this material very briefly and I wanted to learn more. Also, I aim to eventually have a career in biology or engineering or both. Being on an iGEM team has been a great opportunity for me to get lab experiences and, especially, wiki designing, which was my role in the team. It was a pleasure to participate in iGEM, which provided me a worldwide platform that widened my perspective on synthetic biology and its power to make huge changes in the world.

Hi! I’m a second-year student planning to major in biology and psychology. My passion for science, especially synthetic biology, led me to join the iGEM competition. Being responsible for managing Human Practices and working in the lab, I had a great opportunity to bring new ideas and share our project with other people in various fields. Actually, I’m a very optimistic person who always tries to find positive in any situation and listen carefully to others. Aside from my many other interests, I love to write poems, be in nature, study Chinese, play flag football and challenge myself to anything new.

Since then, my dream has been becoming a doctor who works for human rights. In an effort to help the underprivileged, I have joined the IGEM team to create a system that makes the medical checkups easier. The BIOMARVEL team I am in charge of several activities called Human Practice. We have conducted campaigns promoting the prevention of heart disease in several places. Through the IGEM activities, I have learned that a small concern or a question can be the driving force behind the world's transformation.

She is an active participant of all team activities, from scientific ones to social ones. Today we interviewed her on her experience with the team.
On being a family How do you like it that you are living with, working with and partying with iGEMers all the time? Grrrrr, it is really funny to say how Henry behaves during work and at home. He is really different. He tries to be as serious as possible at work, but plays crazily loud music and drinks a lot of beers at home. So does Antonio. In fact, they are in the same indie rock band together. Grrrrr, it is almost hard to believe they are synthetic biologists. I laugh whenever I hear them introducing themselves as biologists. It also seems to be the case with other members on the team. For the past two months, I feel like living in an iGEM bubble that is full of smelly compounds, with this project, and also people I like in one way or the other. It’s like a family and then you need to work hard to keep everyone together. You know, it seems I am always the parent of the team.
On international dinner I heard you guys have international dinner every Thursday. How do you like it? Grrrrr, oh man, it is like my favorite part of the week. We have had Mexican night, French night, Indian night and American night so far. Someone cooks every week and it is awesome. This is one of the advantages of having such an international team. I enjoy listening to drunken conversations that are filled with national prides, but also cultural lessons. Learning so much about different countries now.
On iGEM I know you have worked for other labs before. How is iGEM different? Grrrrrr, you know, as I said, iGEM makes me feel like a parent. It is really like being a PI, everyone on the team. You have to know the budget, build the team, interact with people with different specialties and come up with projects by yourself. I feel like a real scientist and inventor, not a panthere. I also like how it is not a super long project, so we get to see some results and hopefully feel good about ourselves.

You can upload your raw DNA sequence using TXT or FASTA format files.
For FASTA format files, if your files have incorrect or missing characters, it has to be fixed beforehand. For multiFASTA files, this aplication only reads the first sequence.
For TXT files, aplication will read every character inside the file, so after it has to erase the information not useful.

Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.

In vivo data show a highly significant, well working sensor, which even reacts to concentrations below the threshold of the water guidelines by the WHO (Figure 3 and 4).
The mercury detection was measured during the cultivation of E. coli KRX at 37 °C (Figure 3 and 4). The strain contained the plasmid with the activator merR under the control of a constitutive promoter and the specific promoter with an operator binding site, which reacts to the activator with bound Hg 2+-ions. The specific promoter is located upstream of the sfGFP CDS. Therefore, the mercury in the medium is detected via formation of sfGFP. In vivothis sensor devise shows a fast answer to occurrence of his heavy metal contrary to the other sensor systems In vivo.
Therefore we tested our sensor in vitro to check if an already functioning highly optimized sensor provides required data for guideline detections
in vitro
For the characterization of the mercury sensor with CFPS we used parts differing from that we used in the in vivo characterization. For the in vitro characterization we used a cell extract out of cells, which contained the plasmid ( BBa_K1758340 )(figure 5). In addition, we added plasmid DNA to the cell extract. This plasmid consisted of the mercury specific promoter pmerT with 5’-UTR-sfGFP. The entire sequence was placed under the control of of T7-promoter ( BBa_K1758344 )(figure 6). The T7-promoter is needed to get a better fluorescence expression.

Improved Parts
The 2018 NKU_CHINA team improved 2 existing parts, the promoter PliaG ( BBa_K823000 ) of Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) and the tetracycline resistance protein TetA(C) ( BBa_J31006 ). Then we created TetA (optimized for LL3) ( BBa_K2705007 ), PliaG&43 ( BBa_K2705008 ), PliaG&43-1 ( BBa_K2705009 ), PliaG&43-2 ( BBa_K2705010 ), PliaG&43-3 ( BBa_K2705011 ).
1. PliaG Improvements
Usage and Biology
PliaG (BBa_K823000) is a weak, constitutive promoter from B. subtilis. It is responsible for the transcription of the last four genes of the liaIHGFSR cluster and therefore for the production of the components of the LiaRS system, which is important for the detection of cell wall antibiotics (Jordan et al., 2006). PliaG was evaluated with the lux operon as well as the LacZ as reporter. For more details, visit the Data page of the LMU-Munich Team 2012 or get an overview of the whole project Beadzillus.
Design
We intended to improve the part PliaG (BBa_K823000). Inspired by the relatively strong constitutive promoter P43(BBa_K143013), we chose to mimic its structure, which can be recognized by both sigma factor 55 (the major sigma factor A) and sigma factor 37 (the lag phase sigma factor B). As the promoter PliaG is a constitutive Bacillus subtilis σA promoter, we replace part of the promoter PliaG sequence with the σB recognition site at the same relative position as the σB recognition site to the σA recognition site of the promoter P43 to create the new promoter PliaG&43. On the basis of this, we made some adjustments to the spacing between -35 region and -10 region, the sequence of -35 region and created PliaG&43-1(BBa_K270500"

BostonU_HW,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," could contribute to the Nona community. We had a total of 3 main meetings, with a couple smaller correspondences in between. The following conclusions were reached regarding our collaboration:
NONA would distribute Neptune, allowing Neptune to have a “home” where is can easily be found (beyond GitHub.)
NONA is dedicated to integrating all open synthetic biology software tools under one umbrella, thus building a community of researchers and developers who who will use and support these tools. Thus, NONA will be a medium through which other developers can contribute to Neptune, and NONA will be a place researchers can go to learn more about how to use Neptune, ask for help, and so forth.
Overall, by having a dedicated community and website where Neptune will always have a place, we are making it very hard for Neptune to be abandoned. Quite the opposite, with NONA will ensure Neptune is sustained for years to come, while also providing the opportunity for a community to flourish around Neptune and similar software tools.

Building With Biology
We will continue to discuss our partnership with Nona under the gold medal requirements for integrated human practices. For now, we will look at a handful of other “beyond the bench” activities that we did. The first of these is the Building With Biology event at the Boston Museum of Science. This Building With Biology event is part of a NSF funded effort to stimulate synthetic biology public engagement and community outreach. Indeed, there is a big gap between the general public’s perception of synthetic biology, and the perception that researchers and engineers have toward synthetic biology; the Building with Biology event is one way we are trying to bridge that gap. During this daylong event, our iGEM team, as well as a number of other iGEM teams including our sister foundational research team and the MIT team, came to join the public in a day of conversation, education and outreach.
Let us paint a picture of what this event was like, what we accomplished, and why this human practices activity is important.
The first portion of this event was centered around having us the “scientific community” host little synthetic biology activities that are geared toward a range of audiences: The activities were simple such that they could be enjoyed by kids under the age of 10 (sometimes as young as 5,) but these activities had embedded in them big synthetic biology ideas, ideas that adults could ponder, and even people with a scientific background could enjoy.

Problem Introduction
The core of our project is the signal transducer system on the cell membrane, which consists of a transcription factor chain (TC chain) and a protease (PR) chain (PC chain). The two chains can be combined with the help of an exogenous ligand, thus producing an transcription factor (TF), which is regarded as the output. This is the main mechanism of our system[1], as is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1. The mechanism of our system.
There are several properties measuring the faculty of the system: background noise, system (saturated) output, dynamic range (DR) and system efﬁciency.     The system output without exogenous ligand, regarded as the background noise, comes from the random collision between the two chains[1]. And the system saturated output, on the contrary, characterizes the maximum response strength of our system. Without question, the system will be superior if we maintain the saturated output as well as reduce background noise, namely the increasing of dynamic range. Moreover, the TC chain without transcription factor may still be combined with a PC chain, which makes the PC chain occupied but does not contribute to system output. This phenomenon reduces the utilization of system resources, which is measured by the indicator called system efﬁciency. The practical signiﬁcance of promoting system efﬁciency lies in achieving the same level of system output with fewer resources (i.e., lower chain generation rates).

Riboregulators have cognate pairs. For certain crRNA, there is a corresponding taRNA that can activate and “unlock” the repression by crRNA. We originally thought that    Lock 3c and Key 3c (Table 1.) were cognate pairs, but they turned out to be that the iGEM 2006_Berkeley simply made variants of Lock 3 and Key 3. They put an    alphabet at the end of the name every time they produced different variants of lock 3 and key 3. The lock 3 and key 3 variants were created independently from each other so    the letters at the end of name does not mean correspondence. Other teams should take note of this when they consider using riboregulator variants from iGEM 2006_Berkeley.
Riboregulator Results
Figure 1. Fluorescence (F)/OD600 measurements of riboregulator pairs after arabinose induction and their corresponding controls.
All samples were inoculated in M9 minimal salt medium overnight in no or various arabinose concentrations (%w/v). The samples were diluted around 10 fold the next day. Measurements were made when the samples reached around the mid-log phase (OD600 = 0.3 to 0.5).        Graphs depict the triplicate mean + standard deviation. (A) Schematic diagram of the genetic context of the experiment. Note that the diagram generalized the CR and TA sequences.

To characterize the different riboregulator pairs, we kept the genetic context identical except for the various cr-repressing sequences, trans-activating sequences and the RBS. The  RBS sequence also had to be different for some of the riboregulator systems because the cr-repressing sequence depends on the RBS sequence. In order to repress translation, the  cis-repressing sequence need to interact with the RBS, and so the"

Our lab work starts off with the arrival of the two plasmids pcD/p65NTraR and pSEAP-(tra box)(1-7) (Neddermann P. et al., 2003), kindly provided by Dr. R. Cortese’s group, and of the commercial vector pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech), in which we are going to subclone all the parts needed to engineer our eukaryotic cells.
Different competent E.coli strains (XL10-Gold and DH5-alpha) have been transformed with the above mentioned plasmids and selected with appropriate culture conditions (p65NTraR and pSEAP grow on ampicillin, pIRES2-EGFP grows on kanamicin).
Subsequently the amplified plasmids have been purified following a regular Miniprep protocol.
Concurrently, we have designed and ordered two oligos needed in order to remove the CMV immediate early promoter (CMVie) from pIRES2-EGFP, and to allow the correct insertion of the secreted mammalian beta-lactamase (sBLA) coding sequence into the vector.

It could be proven that there are no distinct differences in growth betweenE. coli KRX wildtype and E. coli KRX with BBa_1465102 . So statement about fumarate reductase activity in E. coli KRX with BBa_1465102 as measured by succinate production and fumarate consumption is possible.
Figure 12 shows comparison of succinate production and fumarate consumption between E. coli KRX wildtype and E. coli KRX with BBa_1465102 . This illustrates an increasing succinate production by E. coli KRX with BBa_1465102 after induction of T7 promotor. A higher value of succinate could be achieved after 8 days of anaerobic cultivation and also lower fumarate level was shown compared to E. coli KRX wildtype.
Phenotypic characterization with Biolog® system
Biolog® Microbial ID System is a simple and fast method for the characterization of different bacteria, yeast and fungi species. It is based on respiration in the presence of different metabolic relevant substances for example carbon sources, nitrogen sources or toxines. The system uses redox chemistry wherein a tetrazolium dye is reduced when significant respiration occurs. Tetrazolium dye change its colour, because the cells generate reductive conditions in the course of electron transport chain. Tetrazolium cation is reduced to formazan by dehydrogenase from respiratory complex I. This allow a statement if respiration occurs in the presence of different substances.
We tested the influence of fumarate on the Escherichia coli KRX wildtype and E. coli KRX with BBa_1465102 . To show activity of fumarate reductase under controll of the T7 promotor ( BBa_1465102 ), we incubated cells with fumarate in a Biolog® system for 48h.

E. coli KRX wildtype and E. coli KRX with BBa_1465102 show respiratory activity in the presence of fumarate. As unexpected E. coli KRX wildtype shows higher activity on fumarate as compared to BBa_1465102 . Respiration of E. coli KRX with BBa_1465102 seems to be fewer and occurs subsequently in comparison to wildtype.

Similar     problems resulting from ambiguous use of terminology also observed with     regulatory elements. To sum up, we investigated all input elements for     promoters and classify these elements in terms of their function, affect     and required input element for them. So, we suggest that terminology     used for regulation of transcription should be defined clearly on iGEM’s     website and correct use of terminology should be enforced.
The second group of parameters was collected under the title “Output”,     which refers to products of functional genes. In contradiction, the     term “reporter” has also been described within the same list. Reporters     are also genes whose products, can be used for screening as an output.     According to our group, the usage of the term “reporter” for genes is     unnecessary and cause extra complexity for information distribution     and gives rise to discrepancies. Instead of using the term “reporter”,     predefined “gene” description should be used for genes, which can function     as reporters. The special information which is related with the characteristic     of that gene should also be presented on part info web page.
Furthermore, the same terminology “reporter” was used for both atomic     parts and composite bio-bricks. Also the overall image descriptions     for these were defined as “reporters”. We want to point out that using     same nomenclature for both atomic genes and for whole functional constructs     contributes to the complexity and makes specific explorations difficult     through the Parts Registry. So, assigning “reporter” for both atomic     parts and for whole constructs is not a good practice. Instead, we are     suggesting the usage of other available terminology for the parts listed     as reporters, which most of the constructs, now known as reporters,     can be grouped into, such as “protein generators”, “composite parts”     or “inverters”.
Devices are whole constructs which are functional and have specific     and distinct functions. But, as we have observed, unfortunately, the     term “device” is also being used for parts which are not functional     and do not have specific functional at all. Moreover, within the classification     of devices, we argue that some terms are also being used unnecessarily     and ambiguously. Devices are classified into five types which are protein     generators, reporters, inverters, receivers and senders, measurement     devices. For example iGEM defines protein generators as:
Protein generator = promoter + rbs +gene + terminator
Though we accept the definition for protein generators, we observed     that there exist numerous parts"

Asian Jamboree
  
  Oct.5th-Oct.7th, Asian Jamboree was successfully held at HKUST. Two teams from South University of Science and Technology of China, SUSTC-Shenzhen-A and SUSTC-Shenzhen-B have demonstrated their talents and achievements to the whole Asia. As well they enjoyed the competition very much.
  
  
  On the first registration day, our team has received wide attention. Not only because we are a brand new team, but also because we as a software team, truly brought something new. At suppertime, we dived into the crowd of iGEMers from other teams, chatting about the game, the team and each other’s projects. It was such a harmonious atmosphere that we were more convinced that this was much more than a competition.
  
  
  Next, we rehearsed our presentation at the auditoria. Luckily, our brother team USTC-Software watched the whole process and provided us very kind advice. Then we dispersed to distinctive rooms to have a look at other teams. With no doubt, all were elaborately–designed, well prepared and fluently-presented. We felt a sense of pressure that made us even clear that as for a world-class competition, each team was pretty competitive.
  
   
  
  On the second day to HKUST, Jamboree officially started! Time schedule was very compact. Although SUSTC-Shenzhen-A was the first one in the first session, Xiao, Mubing and Xin were confident about their following performance. They were also a little bit nervous since it was the first time in their life to present in front of people from all Asia. After all they put so much endeavor to this presentation and finally their perspiration deserved a reward. With delightful music, all team members came to the"

During ametabolic state, the DNA repairing mechanism is halted and cells are vulnerable to mutagenic radiation. Hence our final goal is to ameliorate our protection system by expressing the protein Dsup, in providing resistance towards radiation for the engineered bacteria, as well as MnSOD, which protect against oxidative stress during desiccation process.

2. Let’s get international: Open Source Presentation Slides for Everyone
We want to make it easier for lecturers to integrate Dual Use and Dual Use Research of Concern issues into their lecture and courses. That is why we prepared a concise set of slides with further explanations and instructions in the presentation notes. These contain clear definitions for the terms Dual Use and Dual Use Research of Concern. The aim is to lower the threshold for integrating these topics into lectures or safety inductions since lecturers themselves do not have to prepare anything. As already mentioned, many researchers at our university already announced to incorporate these slides into their lectures. We prepared different versions for the research areas of biology and chemistry each in English and German. The provided slides are open source and can be effortlessly used by everyone without our explicit permission. We are happy about acknowledgement though.

We've also implemented a software limit on the time of centrifugation to 5 minutes in order to prevent warping or breakage.
The Peltier plate can also pose a burn hazard if left heating uncontrolled. There are two mechanisms implemented to prevent this: there is a software limit of 50 C on the heat inside the incubator. Due to uneven ventillation, the heatsink attached to the Peltier will be hotter, but this will prevent any major burns from occuring. In addition, the H-bridge controlling current to the Peltier plate is by default off, and only turns on when required. The H-bridge shuts off current to the Peltier after the incubation or shaking periods are over, resulting in rapid cooldown of the heatsink.

Background
Over the past few years, the UMaryland iGEM team has taken particular interest in making synthetic biology more accessible to the general public, especially to high school students. This has been demonstrated in our previous efforts in 2015 to develop a DIY thermocycler made from common household appliances like a hair dryer and in 2016 to create a DIY ultra-low freezer. Our hardware project this competition, a lab-in-a-box containing many pieces of equipment necessary to molecular cloning, also works towards this goal of increasing accessibility to synthetic biology.
This year, we wanted to take our efforts one step further than finding low cost solutions to lab equipment availability. We envisioned creating an educational program capable of teaching an audience about iGEM and the basics of synthetic biology in a way that would be both meaningful and memorable. In prior years we have taught lessons at local high schools, but they often seemed lacking in terms of highlighting how useful and exciting synthetic biology can be. Speaking with the students after these lessons showed that they only remembered a small portion of the material presented. This was very disappointing to us as we wanted our audience to gain meaningful knowledge from our lessons, so this year we did things a little bit differently.
Sample of material presented - This image depicts some of the hand drawn pictures created by our team in order to help teach students about synthetic biology. The watercolors are meant to be eye catching and more engaging for students than looking at typical plasmid diagrams generated using sequence design software.
First off, we decided to develop a project solely for the purpose of enriching our outreach to high schools. This project involved demonstrating synthetic"

""Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much."" – Helen Keller.
We were lucky that a road to strong collaborations had already presented itself to us in the early phases. Due to the success of earlier DTU Biobuilders teams, we had the immense pleasure of hosting the annual DTU BioBrick Tutorial for the Nordic teams. We also owe our thanks to Lynn J. Rothschild approaching us with not only a project, but a chance to collaborate with the strong and competent team from Stanford-Brown-RISD across the world. However, we also wanted to see how far our own collaborative skills could take us and thus our combined work with the University of Copenhagen began. As the Lund team from Sweden were the successful winners of the Nordic iGEM Conference in 2017, we had the amazing opportunity of visiting Lund for this event in June together with a lot of familiar and new faces.

University of Copenhagen & Exeter
For the Human Practices part of the project, we decided quite early on to do a collaboration with the University of Copenhagen and their iGEM team. Our universities are already tightly bound together and seeing as we both did space-related projects and were familiar with each other and our respective projects, due to having met at the BioBrick Tutorial and later at the Nordic iGEM Conference, it made perfect sense to have our teams meet with the aim to elevate the ambitions of our respective human practices projects by joining forces.

They have made the following curves to show their results.
Dynamics of surface and liquid matings for the plasmids R1 and Rldrdl9 for different initial densities. Transconjugant production (cells per ml medium at stationary phase) in (a) liquid cultures and (b) surface cultures is shown. The plotted points for the liquid cultures represent means; those for the surface cultures represent means 2 x SE. Squares, Matings with Rldrdl9; Triangles, matings with R1.
Their conclusion on the plasmid transfer rate are:
On SSS, when colony density is high, many colonies meet, resulting in the original donors being responsible for most transconjugant production. At low colony densities, few colonies meet, and transitorily derepressed transconjugants are the primary donors. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that transconjugant yields for Rldrdl9 and R1 were similar at the lowest colony density, suggesting that in both cases the primary donors were derepressed. On liquid batch cultures, transitory derepression does not play a significant role, since during the growth period the derepressed transconjugants are a very small fraction of the randomly distributed donor populations (Levin et al., 1979).

Finally, we built up differential equations about concentrations of reaction products including mRNA of sigma which has no riboregulator. (It makes positive feedback loop.) This model assumed relationship between promoter and the amount of transcriptional product increasing per unit time. The amount is in proportion to the number of promoter if the promoter expressed constitutively and can be approximated by Hill equation if the inducer controlled its promoter. It was also assumed that the degradation of proteins and RNAs followed first order kinetics. Some of used parameters were cited from references.[1]~[9]
We aimed to determine parameters about sigma through experiment and used provisional parameter determined in reference to other promotor.

In our project, IPTG induction was aimed at enough production of anti-sigma to reset the counter and the sensitivity of Plac(lactose promoter) was not our main interest. Therefore, we used simple equation,(15) to describe how lactose promoter behave. Plac depend on the concentration of IPTG but we regarded it as a fixed number in this modeling.
Taking into account that translation coincide with transcription in prokaryotes, the linearity between the concentration of transcriptional product and the change rate of the amount of translational product was assumed. this linearity does not depend on the kind of translational product. We also assumed that anti-sigma combine with sigma and form inert matter irreversibly, and the reaction velocity of that is proportional to product of these.

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

The restriction was performed at 37 °C for 1h followed by 80 °C for 20 min.
Afterwards, the samples were put on a 1 % agarose gel for gel electrophoresis.
pGGA-pBAD-BjalT-OmpT-FLAG-HlyA was cut three times, because the double digest results in two fragments of the same size, of which one is the desired one and the second part of the vector (third enzyme NcoI cuts only in the vector fragment)
a double restriction reaction is necessary, because NcoI is available only from Thermo Fisher
Framed bands were cut out and used for ligation.
Samples 180518BK15, 181001NB02 were empty and were re-produced with a new overnight culture.

Plant Project
Research in the field of abiotic stress for plants has become more and more popular in the last years. Especially drought and increased salt concentrations in soil are a serious problem      for cultivation of crops in many regions of the world, primarily in face of climate change [1]. Therefore a lot of genetically engineered plants with a better salt and drought resistance      have been developed. [2–4]
One of the most important model organisms in plant physiology is Arabidopsis thaliana, so it does not surprise that there are many papers regarding improved salt tolerance in this plant      [5–7]. Responsible for a higher salt tolerance in many cases the overexpression of channels responsible for the accumulation of ions in the      vacuole of the cell. [6,7]
In our project we chose four channels, occurring native in A. thaliana, to work with.  Two of these channels, named AtNHX1 and AVP1, are localized in the vacuole membrane of plants      and play an important role regarding Na+ and K+ influx as well as maintenance of a proton gradient across the vacuolar membrane. We showed that the integration of each AVP1 and AtNHXS1,      a genetically modified mutant of AtNHX1 (see below), in the Sacharomyces cerevisiae strain BY4742 leads to a two times higher accumulation of Na+ in the yeast cell. [See results]
Fig.1: AVP1, together with AtNHXS1 leads to an increased sequestration of sodium in the vacuole. This is the seqeuestration system in Arabidopsis. We used this system to increase the salt tolerance of our model organims and to promote ion sequestration inside the vacuole
The third ion channel, named AtAKT1, is localized in the plasma membrane of plant cells and is responsible for the influx of K+ into the intracellular room [8]. The integration of AtAKT1 in the yeast strain Sacharomyces cerevisiae BY4742 combined with the knockout of the native efflux channels NHA1 and EN"
Cambridge,2009,Team:Cambridge#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," concentrations above those which mark the boundary between ""safe"" and ""dangerous."" A second limitation is the the behavior of the PoPS output from the promoter; for example, output may vary linearly with input.  This type of response is incompatible with a digital ""safe"" or ""dangerous"" output.
Our Solutions
A Sensitivity Tuner: To avoid being limited to the sensitivity of the promoter and in order to be able to detect distinct concentrations of an inducer using just one promoter, we see the need for a set of sensitivity tuners.  These devices allow you to ""tune"" your biosensor, such that it reports meaningful concentrations of the inducer appropriate to the biosensor's application.  The sensitivity tuner also modifies the PoPS output from the promoter's native behavior to a sigmoidal ""on"" or ""off"" response pattern.
Colour Output: What if we could ""see"" the concentration of an inducer in a sample by a change in colour of the biosensor?  Many prey species are brightly coloured, showing off clearly the fact that they are poisonous or otherwise harmful to potential predators, a phenomenon known as aposematism or warning colouration.  Humans use colour as a means of conveying information as well - we can ""see"" if a child has a fever using a thermometer strip and we can ""see"" the pH of a solution using a pH indicator.  Colour can be a meaningful but simple output solution for biosensors, adapting nature's idea of warning colouration.
Project Details
Design
The Product
We envisioned a marketable product that reports the concentration of an inducer by colour.  Imagine a dipstick with wells, each of which contain pigment-expressing bacteria in response to an inducer.  However, each strain is sensitive to a different concentration of the inducer.  The concentration of the inducer in the test solution can be determined by reading the pattern of pigmentation.
The Genetically Engineered Machine
Each bacterial strain is a machine built from a three part system.
Sensor: The sensor system is sensitive to different concentrations of an inducer.
Sensitivity Tuner: This device is responsible for the setting the sensitivity to the inducer, and acts as an ""on"" switch to activate pigment production once the inducer has reached a threshold.
Colour Generator: Responsible for pigment production.
Components
The three part system can be abstracted by the diagram below:
The components of each of the black boxes is as follows:
The sensor, sensitivity tuner, and colour should be viewed as separate parts that are pieced together to build a tunable bios"
