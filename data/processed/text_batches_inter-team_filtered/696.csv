SynbiGreen Survey
Synthetic biology is a new multidisciplinary field. Thus ITB_Indonesia team wanted to share synthetic biology knowledge and also had a vision to help the initiation of synbio group in other universities. One of the implementation was through the introduction of synthetic biology in Pasundan University.
In this activity, questionnaire was propagated to know the opinion of UNPAS students about synthetic biology. The result told us that 100% respondent showed an interest to study it and they thought that synthetic biology could be used to solve Indonesian problems: 17.24% of the respondent wanted to solve health problems through synthetic biology, 13.79% from the respondent wanted to solve environment problems, and 62% respondent thought that energy problems could be solved through synthetic biology.
Another survey also took place in this activity. This survey was about plastic issue that will be brought by ITB_Indonesia team to iGEM 2014 competition in Boston. This survey depicted that 57% respondent used plastic in their daily activity and 48% of the respondent discarded those plastic wastes. The awareness to recycle plastic wastes were very low and may cause accumulation of plastic wastes, especially bottle packaging. Therefore, such an environmentally degradation system was inevitably required.

Bei Wang Home > member
I'm a junior student majoring in life science.  This is my first summer doing researches as an iGEM member.  Although I am new to the bacterial world, I feel that my previous knowledge and experience in molecular biology have been beneficial, which made me feel well involved.  During this process, I've learned many interesting things out of books.  Besides, I've got the chance to know many different people who share the same interest in biology with me.  I hope every one of us can work hard together and make a contribution to the iGEM.

In a rare moment of free time, he is most likely watching a good movie, playing (or writing) music, or visiting family, or watching BYU sports. (Go Cougars!)
Kelton Peck
This biography is written in loving memory of Kelton Peck, whose remains were discovered one dreary morning on the top floor of the Widsoe lab building. Rigor mortis had eternally fixed his clutch around a pipet as he was loading his last gel. While living, Kelton loved playing the violin and ukulele, tearing up the soccer field, exploring the great outdoors, and spending time with a good book. Before his untimely death ended all worldly aspirations, he had hoped to pursue a career in specialized pharmacy and pharmaceutical research.
Lindsey Perry
LJ (which stands for Lindsey Jackson Perry IV) is from Laguna Hills, California. He is a junior and studying Microbiology. LJ wishes that there was more time in the week as it's filled with iGEM lab, 17.5 credit hours worth of classes, all the homework that comes with them, a chemistry lab TA job, and volunteering at the hospital and a local hospice program. He is doing all these things in preparation for applying to Medical School next spring. In his rare free time, LJ likes to play hockey, go hiking, or practice the guitar.
Nathan Robert Sabin
Nathan always likes to have a good time. Before coming to BYU and joining the iGEM team, his only experience with bio-engineering came from learning about Mewtwo in Pokemon: The Movie. Needless to say, he has come a long way. Nathan is a sophomore microbiology student, but more accurately a rough, tough, farmbody from deep in the heart of Texas. Despite growing up on a farm, he never learned how to milk a cow. After three more years at BYU Nathan has plans to do the cool thing and go to medical school.
Michael Schellhous
Not your typical southern California guy, Michael has never been surfing. However, he has seen several movies that involve surfing, so we're pretty sure he'd be an expert if he ever tried. When declaring his major, he couldn't decide between chemistry and biology, so he made the only logical choice and chose biochemistry. This happened to turn out to be his real passion and he has a special interest in proteomics and lipidomics. He loves reading, racquetball, and just about anything outside.

Together, we have worked on the aspect of ‘Ethical Scientific Practices’. Also, on his recent visit to IISER Mohali, he came back with a collaborative offer for iGEM IIT Delhi to mentor IISER Mohali and help in the establishment of iGEM club there. On our return from the Giant Jamboree 2016, our team members gave a presentation scheduled there, initiated their team and thereafter our team mentored the iGEM Mohali team.
Tryst (February-March 2017):
Tryst, IIT-D's technical fest, is one of the largest and most successful technical festivals across India. It seeks to bring together the world’s leading scientific minds and budding enthusiasts and witnesses an annual footfall of over 40,000. iGEM team IIT Delhi set up a stall and conducted the event ‘Biomaniacs’ a brainstorming quiz on biotechnology which was aimed at encouraging and promoting synthetic biology through interesting and creative ways to do this.
Indian iGEM Meetup at IISER Pune (2017, July 15-16):
iGEM Team IIT Delhi sent its representatives to the Indian iGEM meetup which was held at IISER Pune and was attended by 9 iGEM teams from India and iGEM Peshawar (Pakistan, was on Skype conference). The purpose for this was to discuss projects and strategies among the teams and help each other with problems that were being faced. The possibility of collaboration was also discussed among other topics. The event ended with a friendly dinner. Being the most experienced team from India, iGEM IIT Delhi gave a good presentation at the meetup to other teams in terms of experience and well discussed and interacted among upcoming iGEMers.

DTU-Denmark,2017,Team:DTU-Denmark#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," addition of cell lysate to the beads, has the highest enzymatic activity of all the fractions measured, indicating that most of the β-galactosidase is washed out immediately, and not bound to the biotin beads. This is true for both the lacZ device with and without ScAvidin, which suggests that the ScAvidin of the composite lacZ part doesn’t work as intended. The fractions from the secondary and tertiary washing steps showed an enzyme activity close to zero; as did the enzyme activity of the isolated beads.
The fact that the lacZ part with ScAvidin didn’t bind to the biotin beads underlines the fact that a fully working ScAvidin might not be present at in the composite lacZ part.
Comparison of composite part with β-galactosidase
To test if our composite lacZ part (BBa_K2355313) would be cleaved by the snake venom, we used the biotinylated beads from the ScAvidin-binding experiment, and incubated them in snake venom for approx. 70 minutes. Besides having solutions of snake venom in Brij (0.01%), human blood serum was used to make solutions of snake venom that would emulate the blood samples of patients being envenomed by snakes.
As with the ScAvidin binding experiment, the presence of β-galactosidase is determined by measuring the conversion of ONPG in a spectrophotometer.
Figure 28 shows the result of the β-galactosidase activity measurements for the venom solutions with human blood serum.
Figure 28: Cleavage shown by β-galactosidase activity in samples with serum diluted snake venom. Positive control + is diluted cell lysate with the ScAvidin+LacZ composite part (BBa_K2355313). Positive control - is diluted cell lysate with LacZ but without ScAvidin.
As seen in figure 28, no noticeable activity is observed in any of the venom solutions. Ideally, we would have seen more β-galactosidase activity in the solutions with venoms that are able to cleave the empirical linker (i.e. the two Bitis venoms) as the venoms would have cleaved the linker, thus releasing the β-galactosidase into the supernatant that we were collecting in this experiment. The test with Brij-diluted venom had the same profile as figure 28, with no β-galactosidase activity from the venom solutions.

NYMU-Taipei,2015,Team:NYMU-Taipei#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," late blight disease. Therefore, we need to show that our improved potatoes are beneficial to the farmers.
Price
The potatoes produced in Taiwan have over eighty percent of market share, and the output value is about six hundred million NTD, roughly twenty million USD. The average price of potatoes is about one dollar per kilogram. It will increase to its peak in November and then decrease.
Marketing
Potatoes are either sell as fresh or processed potatoes. The latter one accounts for the majority. The planting period is about 90 to 120 days. After harvest, the farmers can either sell it or store them in the fridge under 4 degrees Celsius up to two years. Since farmers are able to predict the production of potatoes, selling potatoes is a programmed marketing.
Phases
We can generalize the stages of processed potatoes marketing into three parts: planting phase, harvest phase, and storage phase.
 Planting phase: This is around August to November. Farmers started to prepare for planting potatoes. The potatoes produced previous years are almost sold out, and the fresh ones aren’t cropped yet. Therefore, potatoes reach its highest price in this phase.
 Harvest period: It is about December to March. In this phase, the potatoes in the first period are successively cropped. Those potatoes will influx in the market, so the price is decreasing.
 Storage phase: It is about April to August. In this phase, in addition to supply the demand of the market, the most parts of potatoes will be stored to be frozen vegetables in order to balance the price of vegetables responding to the insufficient supply of summer vegetables when we meets some typhoon or other disaster. The price in this phase will slightly increase back to the average.
Public Outreach
For education, we put in a lot of effort in promoting iGEM’s central value and how our project will affect our society. We go to school from primary to senior high (and of course university) to tell them how we can use the biobricks to build a new biological system. We even made a picture book to let younger kids understand what we have done. Furthermore, we published  article on magazines to educate the public about related issues and iGEM. We taught children on the basics of synthetic biology and iGEM. Videos 3.
To make the public know more about our iGEM project, we submit a piece of writing to Scientific American. We mainly introduce what iGEM is, how this project really works, and the reason we put our effort in potato late blight. We also have a brief introduction of potato late blight. Furthermore"

Day one: Mexico has a deficit in science, the government only invests 1% of the GDP in this                         sector, but the                         public has a keen interest for new technologies and the improvement of synthetic biology and                         this was an                         excellent opportunity for us to inspire the desire to learn and move towards action.                          On Saturday, July 21st we made a visit to the science museum “Universum” with the interest of                         approaching kids                         and the general public in order to teach them about the basics of synthetic biology with a                         little workshop that                         included fun activities and dynamics where everyone could participate. Most of the kids whose                         interest was                         peaked by our workshop. We welcomed with a brief explanation of molecular biology. The kids                         really showed                         enthusiasm and proceeded to do the activities we prepared for them. While the kids were playing                         and learning                         with the activities, we took a quick survey with the parents or relatives asking some questions                         regarding their                         take on burns, prevention, and treatment. The activities made in our workshop the first day                         consisted of                         teaching the kids about plasmids and bacterias with a brief introduction of how they work                         without making it too                         difficult for them. For the next day the activities that took place consisted in more didactic                         exercises to                         learn about biology and the structure of major skin cells.

What did you work on during the project?
My role was most often moral support and encouragement. There are so many challenges when going into the lab and experiencing repeated failures. This can be very trying on the patience and it is important to keep the spirits up in order to persevere.

none of yesterdays transformations worked. To find out why, a gel was prepared with the DNA fragments that were used. Also, a PCR reaction of the all the colonies from !D transformation was done. For this the primers I-SceI forward and VR were used. Thirdly, *S, *T, *E, *G, *P PCR products were purified. This was done because it was found that adding 10µl of PCR reaction mix directly to the restriction mix will cuase star activity.

Computational Modelling
The modelling in our 2009 iGEM project, BacMan, can be split into a number of sections - the Stochastic Switch , Degradation system , Metal Intake , Sporulation Tuning and Population Simulation . We are particularly proud of our Population Simulation Model as it combines distributed computing, agent based and cellular models.
For computational modelling, we are using a number of technologies, including Java , Matlab , Amazon EC2 , Microbase , SBML and CellML .
Sub-projects
Stochastic Switch
See Stochastic Switch Model
We have modelled our stochastic switch.
We also designed an inducible protein degradation system for our switch.
See Degradation Model
Population Modelling
See Population Simulation
One of the models which we are producing is one concerning the population numbers of our bacteria. It looks at how our additions to the DNA may affect the growth of the bacterial population.
Sporulation Tuning
See KinA Expression Model
The KinA Expression model describes how KinA is expressed.
See Sporulation Tuning Model
Building on the KinA Expression model, the phosphorelay is implented into our model, using the expression of KinA to induce sporulation.
See Sin Operon Model
The Sin Operon model is used to repress sporulation, in view of making our model more realistic.
Metal Intake
See Metal Intake Model
Another of our models looks at metal intake. Specifically this looks at Cadmium transport throughout our bacteria.

Plates with 0.2%, 0.5%, 1% and 2% were incubated with 25 mL 2% w/v sodium citrate to study dissolution properties.
18/08/2015
After 24h none of the samples were completely dissolved. However 0.2% alginate which dried into the agar floated the least and thus remained its initial shape the most of all four samples. The sodium citrate supernatant was removed. The plate was rinsed with 1 mL 5x CAM. Incubation was done at 37 oC overnight. No growth was observed.
The patterns with GFP/RFP increased significantly in colour over a time period of 1 week in the fridge. The samples were placed in the 37 oC stove for further growth  and testing of alginate response to higher temperatures. After 24h, the plates started to dry out; agar becomes dehydrated and shrinks.
24/08/2015
Sterile stocks were made for CaCl2 (0.1M, 200 mL) and sodium citrate (2% w/v). Sterile filtration of 1% w/v sodium alginate using a 45 μm frit does not work at all. Resistance is far too high, not a single drop was obtained from the filter. Addition of antibiotic to the alginate and dissolution in sterile water.
Sodium alginate was pasteurized by boiling for 15s in the microwave and subsequently placed in cold water to cool down again. Antibiotic was added to the cold alginate to further improve and maintain lower contamination levels. Alginate is kept in the fridge. gelatinization seems to be unaffected by the pasteurization.

Freiburg,2011,Team:Freiburg#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"es when the used start concentration is lower.
Picture 3: if the start concentration is not oversaturated pbd-coupled is much more resistant to washing steps than GFP alone.
To investigate this phenomenon  we compared different start concentrations of pbd-GFP concerning the amount of pbd-GFP that could be washed away. polystyrene micro titer plates provide only a limited surface for the pbd to bind, the solution shouldn’t be oversaturated with plastic binding protein. In our case the diluted protein could only reach a surface of  91.5 mm2  per well. With a remaining protein amount of ~220 pg/well after three washing steps we estimate that 2,4 pg pbd-tagged protein can be bound per mm2.
In a range of 1-30ng/µL start concentration there remains about seven times more pbd-GFP after washing than ""normal"" GFP (see picture 3).
Discussion
In the experiments described above we could show that in a certain range of start concentration the plastic binding domain (pbd)-coupled GFP was more resistant to elution steps than GFP alone. This result indicates that the pbd-tagged GFP bound stronger to the plastic surface of the microtiter plate than “normal” GFP. The fact that in case of a rather high start concentration the majority of the pbd-GFP was washed away can be explained by the limitation of available binding surface. It seems like the pbd-GFP binds seven times better to the used polystyrene material than GFP alone. The amount of pbd-GFP that can bind to 1 mm2 is about 2,4 pg. To prove this supposition further measurement and more washing steps should be performed.
Green light receptor
We could successfully amplify the gene sequences for CcaS and CcaR and the promotor region PcpcG via
PCR from the whole Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 genome.
Later two parts ( BBa_K608101 , BBa_K608102 ), were inserted into the iGEM-Vector pSB1C3 and send to the registry.
Twice we tried to clone the promotor region PcpcG into a vector, but had no insert at all.
After a summer full of cloning we ran out of time to assemble
the green light receptor cassette like we planned to.
For this reason we could not test the green light receptor and can not provide more information.

In August we decided to drop the red light receptor system.

UCLA,2016,Team:UCLA#Super Soldier Bacteria_-_-_TEXT.html," its pore-forming capabilities. The CdiBAI cluster is common throughout most CDI+ strains, significantly varying only in CdiA-CT and CdiI sequences.
Our project focuses on the translocation of three different CDI systems from EC93 and Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048 (containing two CDI loci) into one lab strain of E. coli to create a super-soldier organism that is able to selectively inhibit the growth of these strains. A lab strain containing CDIEC93, for instance, would be able to target all bacteria containing the corresponding receptor for CDIEC93, which would in this case be BamAEcoli. In order to target EC93 itself, however, we aim to switch CdiA-CTEC93 with a toxin from ATCC 13048 so that the immunity protein of EC93 does not prevent growth inhibition. It has previously been shown that CdiA-CT regions are modular, and systematically modularizing the toxin region using appropriate restriction sites is another goal of our project. While the CDI system in EC93 targets the BamAE. coli, the relevant receptors in other species of pathogens and even in other strains of E. coli is unknown. An additional facet to our project would be to find the receptors that each CDI system of ATCC 13048 targets by creating a transposon insertion library. Mutants that display a whole or partial CDI immunity phenotype will be sequenced to determine which genes have undergone transposon insertion, providing insight into which receptors may be targeted by ATCC 13048 CDI systems.

Methodology
In order to test the expression of foreign CDI systems in DH5-α and Enterobacter aerogenes, we need to express CDI systems on a plasmid. Our plan begins with two cosmids given to us by the Hayes lab located at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Each cosmid contained either the CDI system from EC93 or EC869 and was expressed in EPI100 or X90 (respectively). As a control, we performed aggregation assays and competition assays on these two bacteria. The next objective was to extract and express the cosmids in DH5-α to see if we could express foreign CDI systems in DH5-α. We would also perform competition and aggregation assays on the transformed DH5-α. Assuming this is successful, we would move on to expressing both CDI systems from Enterobacter aerogenes into DH5-"

Famousse
Famousse (""Mousse"" means foam in french) is a gun that sprays an isolating material to fill walls. The fluid consists of bacteria that produce foam once in contact with oxygen and of yeasts that make CO2 holes in the foam. After a while, the foam solidifies and bacteria and yeasts die by apoptosis: the isolating material is finished.
RIDG pill
The RIDG pill (Régulateur intelligent Des Graisses or Intelligent Fat Regulator, IFR pill) is made out of bacteria that detect, once in the intestine, if the person suffers from obesity or anorexia thanks to hormone receptors. In case of obesity, the bacteria would respond to that input by secreting proteins that block lipid transporters in epithelial cells. In case of anorexia, the bacteria would secrete hormones that would make epithelial cells create more lipid transporters.
PestiBac
Bacteria substituting pesticides. These bacteria live on the leaves of the plants and secrete repelling substances. These bacteria have sensor in order to die if not in contact with the target plant or if they came in contact with animal's saliva. In addition they are modified to have a shorter lifetime, in order to limit population growth.
Luciolight
Luciolight is a Street Lamp made out of bacteria that copy biological circuit of fireflies.
Bacteriolavage
Bacteriolavage is a bacterial washing system to clean clothes with less water waste. Bacteria synthesize enzymes that degrade lipids and sugars in smaller particles that are more water-soluble, so that less water is consumed. Students used the concept of magnetic bacteria developed by the 2014 iGEM Berlin team to efficiently remove bacterias from clothes once the wash was finished.
Killpilus
Killpilus is a permanent hair removal cream. Bacteria contained in the preparation kill hair follicle stem cells. The team searched the internet for receptors specifically expressed in those stem cells to avoid off targets. For safety reasons, bacteria would commit suicide by apoptosis after one hour.
ConchitaColi
ConchitaColi cells digest dust and produce scented molecules. After the washing is finished, bacteria move towards a luminous bin where they die by apoptosis.

Cells were transformed using the Zymo Mix n Go Protocol . Three 50 uL tubes of cells were thawed on ice for 10 minutes, and each tube was added with 1uL of a respective device and mixed gently. Plates containing LB+chloramphenicol were prewarmed to 37 degrees Celsius in the incubator before plating of the transformants.
Cell/DNA mixtures are incubated on ice for 10 minutes before cells are rescued in 200 uL SOC and placed in 37 degrees Celsius shaking at 300 RPM.  The entire outgrowth is then plated on the prewired plates, spread using sterile glass beads, inverted and incubated at 37 degrees Celsius overnight for 16 hours.
Plates were checked the following day for growth of colonies, check out tomorrow for observations regarding the cells.
This was performed in tandem with the transformation efficiency tests on the freshly prepared cells.

In week 7 we started our first experiments with our inducible promotors. Unfortunately we had trouble caused by the leakiness of two of our three promotors. We did further experiments but could not find a solution yet.  Good news is that we received the chromoproteins from Uppsala! So we started working on our new cloning strategy by combining the chromoprotein DNA with our constitutive promotor-RBS construct. We hope to see nice and colorful colonies next week!

As a result, the                         output signal of roGFP2-Orp1 has a more intuitive meaning and higher application value. (click here for more details)
Characterization and Measurement
Measure the response of roGFP2-Orp1 to H2O2
According to literature[1], roGFP2-Orp1 green fluorescent protein shows peak value                         at 405nm (oxidation peak) and 488nm (reduction peak). Fluorescence ratio R (R=I405 / I408) is                         uesed to the redox degree of roGFP2-Orp1. Therefore, we used different H2O2 concentrations (independent variable) to simulate the accumulation of ROS in cells and                         the fluorescence ratio (dependent variable) to characterize the redox degree of                         roGFP2-Orp1, which means that the increase of fluorescence ratio R shows roGFP2-Orp1 is                             oxidized and the decrease shows reduction.
Figure.2 Experimental Group
As Figure.2 shown, the fluorescence ratio R of roGFP2-Orp1 increases with the increase of H2O2 concentration. And the fluorescence ratio is basically unchanged when the concentration of H2O2 exceeds 0.8 mM.
Figure.3 Control Group
As Figure.3 shown, the fluorescence ratio of wide-type was not affected by the change of H2O2 concentration and remained unchanged.
Verify redox reversibility of roGFP2-Orp1
Firstly, we made the cells almost be oxidation state by adding 1mM H2O2 and observed the change of fluorescence ratio R (dependent variable) with time (independent                         variable).
Figure.4 Verify Redox Reversibility of roGFP2-Orp1
As Figure.4 shown, the fluorescence ratio R decreased slightly in the range of 0 to 20 min,                         because cell itself has the mechanism of scavenging ROS and H2O2 will                         decompose spontaneously. At the 23 min, we added DTT (strong reducing agent) with the final                         concentration of 5mM. As a result, the fluorescence ratio R decreased significantly.
Therefore, the redox of our roGFP2-Orp1 is reversible.

Introduction
In order to optimize the lab work, we split up the work so that we could have two lab teams working in parallel to design different parts of the switch. We split up the lab work so we had:
Team 1: The Repressor - Anti-Repressor Team
Team 2: The Terminator - Anti-Terminator Team
The Repressor (Repressor - Anti-Repressor) Team is responsible for assembling the construct illustrated below in Figure 1:
The Anti-Terminator (Terminator - Anti-Terminator) Team is responsible for assembling the construct illustrated in Figure 2:
Repressor Group
The repressor group will be assembling the constructs step-by-step:
Step 1
The construction of a plasmid containing the divergent promoters is the first step, the effect of this will be the uninhibited expression of GFP as illustrated by the green colonies observed in Figure 4.
Figure 3: The initial plasmid constructed is illustrated. The divergent promoters have been inserted into a plasmid and transformed into the electro-competent E.coli cells.
Figure 3: The success of the plasmid construction and transformation is illustrated by the fluorescent green colonies seen on the LB-agar plates.
Step 2
Figure 4: The construction of a plasmid containing the Repressor protein (GogR or GtgR) expressed from the pRM promoter is shown. The continually expressed repressor protein will then inhibit the pR promoter and no GFP will be expressed.
Step 3
Figure 5: The independent plasmid is constructed is shown. This plasmid contains the gene encoding the anti-repressor is found downstream of the promoter induced by arabinose, pBAD.
Results Simulation
Figure 7: The graphs illustrated are a simulation of the expected results from Construct 2 and Construct 3. The expected results from Construct 2 would be a baseline expression of GFP, as the promoter would continually be repressed. With Construct 3, there would be a baseline expression of GFP until the pBAD is induced. At this point, the anti-repressor is expressed and binds to the"

Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus"

Lycopene in the gut
We wanted to show that lycopene would have improved growth under oxidative stress. We have achieved this in the lab however we wanted to go beyond this and did so with a collaboration with Dundee schools who had created a gut device. We wanted to ensure our lycopene probiotic would withstand the gut, and following the results, have proven the robustness of the system by in a simulation. The graph below shows that our bacteria are indeed capable of surviving in the gut!

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#15 May 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," Wolfram’s website (the company that developed Mathematica).  Reading papers about membrane computing was another activity that I have done in this week. These papers can be found at ESD.ucalgary.ca.  I also had two meetings this week, one with iGEM members on Friday and the other one with Lindsay members on Thursday.

Team Work
Purpose: Write and edit text part of the Business Plan that iGEM Calgary will submit to AIF. Today was crunch time with everyone from iGEM Calgary working to complete the Business Plan for AIF in order to get one step closer to securing $20 000 to fund our project. Specifically, I help to edit all sections of the business plan and helped to write bios as well. Although most members were quite stressed throughout the day, it was a great team building exercise.

I contributed a bit to writing a description of campus fair with Mandy as well as helping to write up milestones for each month for the second life team. When I had time to work in Second Life I:
Tried to work on getting objects to respond to each other and not just to the user
We will hopefully have a clear idea of what our virtual environment will consist of and will be easily communicated to the rest of the team through a project proposal. We may also show screenshots of what we have done this week.

Business Plan Write-ups
For our AiF Business plan, the Second Lifers worked on descriptions of Campus Fair for outreach as well as milestones for the team-wide Gantt chart. In Second Life, I made it through a couple more scripting tutorials in rotating objects and changing their texture/colour when touched.

Business Plan Deadline
Today was the deadline for the University of Calgary’s iGEM Business Plan. Due to some sudden changes in plans and unexpected circumstances, we weren’t even close to being done. I sat down with Sonja to discuss this year’s expenses, sponsors, AIF funding, and plans for carry over money . Jamie and I worked on the iGEM budget, rewrote the marketing introduction and edited the fundraising write ups.  We helped other team members complete their parts of the business plans. The business plan was divided into sections and students from each division of iGEM teamed up to write up each section.

EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Our Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"), a transcription factor which down-regulates (represses) the transcription of the adjacent gene. This protein and its mutants are often used by synthetic biologists “as control elements to regulate gene expression”   due to their detailed characterisation, but also because of the limited number of proteins available for use in the repressor-TF class.
We want to enhance the diversity of the repressor-TF class by engineering new transcription factors that can bind unique promoter sequences different from the wild-type DNA binding site normally associated with TetR. Our proposed research plan for this summer is as follows:
1) Introduce mutations in the TetR sequence and its binding site
2) Identify promising TF-binding site pairs (using in vivo and in vitro techniques)
3) Conduct multiple rounds of selection to improve affinity and specificity to optimize new pairs of repressor-TFs.
We are also developing a new negative-selection method: lysing the cells with interesting TF-binding site pairs, in order to recover their DNA. Coupled to a microfluidics device such as a chemostat chamber, our method would allow high-throughput in vivo selection.
Strategy
During the summer, we worked on 3 main sections needed to complete the whole project:
1) TetR mutants: Building mutations of TetR, either random or defined (i.e. already characterized in the litterature). This part also comprised in vitro characterization, using MITOMI setup.
2) Reporter plasmids: Assembling different plasmids allowing an in vivo characterization of TetR binding to its recognition sequence. We used RFP and a lysis cassette as a readout - either for characterization or for recovering DNA
3) T7 promoter variants: Coupling T7 promoters of different strength with our 2 reporter genes, to have a better regulation of our Reporter plasmids system. This part includes both T7 characterization with RFP and a proof-of-concept that we can efficiently lyse cells and recover their DNA.
Section 1 presents the different TetR mutants and characterizes them in vitro; sections 2 and 3 demonstrate in vivo TetR-Ptet interaction as well as recovery of DNA from the successful interactions. Details of each section can be found in the ""Our project"" tab.

La biologia sintetica e´una branca emergente della scienza che unisce la classica tecnologia genetica con un approccio di tipo ingegneristico. Cosi´come per la costruzione di un edificio, la biologia sintetica utilizza dei “mattoncini genetici” per la costruzione di nuovi e complessi sistemi biologici con diverse funzioni. Questi mattoncini genetici sono collezionati dai responsabili di iGEM in una banca dati e possono essere utilizzati da ciascuna squadra che prende parte alla competizione. Finora la collezione vanta piu´di mille mattoncini genetici grazie al continuo sviluppo di nuovi moduli nel corso degli anni. Durante l´estate, le squadre lavorano ad un progetto, che ciascuna ha sviluppato in modo autonomo, che viene poi presentato all´inizio di novembre allo “Jamboree” che si tiene a Boston. In quell´occasione, svariati premi vengono assegnati in diverse categorie.
La squadra di Heidelberg consiste di quindici studenti dell´universita´di Heidelberg e uno studente dell´universita´tecnica di Darmstadt, con bagagli scientifici che vanno dalla biotecnologia molecolare alla matematica. Gli studenti sono seguiti da supervisori appartenenti al gruppo di Victor Sourjik (ZMBH; universita´di Heidelberg) ed al dipartimento di Roland Eils (universita´di Heidelberg e DKFZ).

A Visit to Macquarie_iGEM
Tsinghua and Macquarie iGEM Teams have an impressive relationship both in the cooperation of projects as well as in Human Practice.
On 27/9/2010, GU Xiang, one of the team students in Tsinghua iGEM paid a visit to the Macquarie iGEM. GU Xiang, Yagiz Aksoy, the leader of Macquarie iGEM Team, and Hilal Varinli met together on the beautiful campus of the University of Macquarie, in Sydney. They firstly visited the Life Science Building in Macquarie, ""It is amazing"" said by GU Xiang. Then they three dropped in the Biology Museum in that building. Later GU Xiang together with Yagiz and Hilal did some of their experiments on that day. The research devices and environment in the labs of Macquarie are absolutely at world leading-class level. They started with biosafety and ethics topics related to the iGEM. They both recognized the biosafety to be the first important issue in the Biological Research and Education. Then they exchanged some ideas about how to improve and draw everyone's attention to this issue. The strict biosafety regulations in Macquarie are good examples for many institutes to learn about.
After that, they introduced and talked about each other's projects. Through that they found the project of Macquarie iGEM can be a potential screening method for the project of Tsinghua iGEM. This was the climax of that day when they found this potential cooperation between these two teams and they followed further discussion immediately. As the Macquarie team was to build up a system which can reflect the change by showing different lights. Thus this could be useful in the screening for the antibodies. They finally agreed on this proposition and decided to find more details to see how to make this come true if they both had enough time. They took the first step of their collaboration together by running that day’s experiments with GU Xiang at Macquarie iGEM Labs.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"ires” have been previously used in a number of synthetic biology systems, e.g. Gupta et al. (2013) and Tasmir et al. (2011). In this project, it is proposed that modularity, and therefore the ability to use parts “off-the-shelf” without further genetic engineering, could be improved by splitting components of biosensors into different cells which communicate to coordinate responses. The orthogonal quorum sensing systems Rhl and Las will be used as biological “wires”, linking different biosensor components together. This separation of components will enable the decoupling of non-specific components from specific detection systems. Using this approach, production of biosensor variants will not require subsequent engineering steps: cells containing desired components will simply be mixed together (Figure 2).
Figure 2: SBOL Visual for the modular and multicellular Sensynova framework design.
The splitting of biosensor components into separate cells may have additional advantages besides ease of variant production. Goni-Moreno et al. (2011) have previously suggested that the use of synthetic quorum sensing circuits enables each cell to be considered an independent logic gate, which may rectify the “fuzzy logic” seen in some biosensors, where stochastic cellular processes may produce false positive results. Quorum sensing has also been previously used to synchronise gene expressions, leading to reduced variability within a population (Danino et al., 2010).
Preliminary Experiment
In order to support our theory that genetic assembly is the rate limiting step in biosensor development, we attempted to assemble a simple GFP producing system using three engineering techniques: BioBrick, Gibson and Golden Gate. Further information about this experiment can be found on our interlab page . Gibson was the only successful technique we trailed, however, Gibson assembly is not an ideal method for circuit variant production due the the specificity of the overlapping regions: For example, to assemble ten genetic parts into all possible orders would require the use of 90 different overlapping sequences (Ellis et al., 2011). Therefore, the ability to generate circuit variants without the need for further genetic engineering would be useful.
Design Stage
To modularise biosensor components, it was necessary to first confirm which devices types are commonly found in biosensors. An in depth systematic review was conducted to determine these components. Team seeker, a tool for keyword searches of iGEM team titles and abstracts for the years 2008 to 2016, was used to identify biosensor based projects (Aalto-Helsinki iGEM team, 2014). The search terms used to identify potentially relevant projects were “"

This time I incubated the DH5 alpha from the -20 with 1 mL of LB while shaking in the incubator for an hour before streaking onto its plate.
I' ve PCR'ed the SB1C3 backbone from a newly reconstituted part from iGEM plate 1, well 10D. This well corresponds to BBa_K654058. This should work, because every part in iGEM plates 1 thru 3 are on the SB1C3 backbone. I PCR'ed this with six reaction conditions. 3 with DMSO and 3 without. I messed up the PCR gradient. I meant to have the gradient be 1 degree celsius per gradation (meaning the PCR tubes should have been 3 wells apart). Instead, I set the gradation at 3 degrees, and still put the PCR tubes 3 wells apart. This means that my temperatures were 56, 65, and 74 degrees, which is obviously not what I meant to do.

Apart from the fact that this gel is completely and absolutely useless, it is a good looking gel. Total separation of ladder bands, relatively linear across the gel, and full use of the gel space. But it is a bunch of crap. The primers could be reduced, it appears, and perhaps more of the template could be added (since none was apparent, even as a small band). 6D is the only PCR tube not on this gel.
For the next attempt at pSB1C3, I will start the PCR annealing temperature at the the lower annealing temp (direct to template). I.e. I will set the thermocycler at 58 degrees for all lanes for 10 cycles, then run it at 62, 65, and 68 (gradations around the final annealing temp) for 25 cycles.
I' ve PCR'ed PR from BBa_K572005 at three reaction temperatures with and without DMSO. I also messed this one up. The temperatures were 60 degrees celcius, 69 degrees celcius and 78 degrees celsius, which, again, is not at all what I had intended to do.

ITB_INDONESIA,2015,Team:ITB INDONESIA#humprac#questionnaires_-_-_TEXT.html," involved in two fields: health and environment because these issues can relate easier to the respondent has some urgency. After that, we want to know if people who are interested and even might involved in synthetic biology think the same: which field they are feeling related/concerned to? Every year, ITB holds an event called Open House Unit (OHU) where the students choose and register to the clubs. This year, Synthetic Biology (SynBio) club opened for the first time. Most of them joined the club in order to improve their knowledge and find experience. Surprisingly, all of the students had ever heard about iGEM. There were more than 150 students registered for the club. So, the human practice team was curious and we had 15 students whom registered to fill in our short questionnaire. The charts showed the answers. Most of the respondents choose to tackle the issue of healthcare, followed by food, energy, and environment. It looks like healthcare takes the utmost priority. So, the fields we choose as the topics for surveys that we did fits with what member of Synthetic Biology Club’s general opinion.
Final statement: So, what do public think about synthetic biology?
Describe Synthetic Biology in one or two words
In the end of every survey,we asked our respondents to give one or two words that popped out in their mind that describes synthetic biology . We want to find out how Synthetic Biology is percieved in the public’s mind. As we can see, public associate synthetic biology with engineering and genetics, and the public see synthetic biology as a solution and a good thing. We even have a pretty interesting response such as “playing god” whlile some of the respondents are giving response like “don’t understand” and “complicated”.
Fig.7 Impression about synthetic biology
To conclude, from the surveys done by our human practice team we could say that most of the public do not know yet about synthetic biology. Synthetic biology is still developing and only students/academia know about it. The public need more exposure and education about synthetic biology because once they know that synthetic biology can be solution of the problems in society, the public response positively.
Questionnaires : Synthetic Biology and EOR for High School Students
We collaborated with Oxford team to conduct a survey about synthetic biology and Enhance Oil Recovery (EOR) on high school students. This survey is aimed at finding out whether they have learnt/ known those topics and their comments related to our project. The responses were varied since the synthetic biology and EOR term might be new for the respondents.
Have you ever learnt/ known about synthetic biology?

Week 1
The first week in the wet lab started with the preparation of materials needed in future experiments. We made growth medium and agar plates containing antibiotics, which will be used to culture bacteria. Furthermore competent cells were prepared with the CaCl2 – method. We also resuspended the DNA of the biobricks necessary for our project as described in the iGEM guidelines. We managed to perform the first transformations with the competent cells and the resuspended DNA and thus concluded that the competent cells were functional.
Week 2
This week we wanted to purify the plasmid DNA from the bacteria grown in the first week. To do this we inoculated growth medium with antibiotics and a single colony. These cultures were incubated overnight at 37°C followed by a minipreparation to purify the DNA from the bacteria. Due to the low DNA yield we decided to repeat the minipreparation. This repetition succeeded in producing higher DNA concentrations.
Week 3
The goal this week was to bring different biobricks together in one plasmid (=ligation). We started with restriction of the biobricks that had been miniprepped the previous week. Some biobricks were successfully cut by the restriction enzymes whilst others weren’t. We performed gel purifications on the restricted fragments. However this didn’t result in high enough concentrations to start the ligation of biobricks.
Week 4
This week we mainly focused on performing restriction of the biobricks (according to the standard assembly method this time) and gel purification of those restricted fragments. Most restrictions worked nicely but gel purification almost never resulted in measurable concentrations. We also transformed and miniprepped 2 new promoters we want to use. Furthermore, the primers we ordered from Eurogentec have arrived and we started with the PCR of INP, MelA, Ribolock and the 4 IGEM vectors.
Week 5
This week we mainly tried to get enough DNA for performing restrictions. Since the miniprep kits usually give lower concentrations than the CTAB method, we decided to switch to the CTAB"

♠ We established Nanjing-China  2017 in March this year. Both the team leader and all team members are new  iGEMers, in which case great challenges were ahead of us. We determined that we  work on gas sensors and then read a lot of papers and conceived the outline of  our project.
♥ In April, we started synthesizing primers and genes with the help  of Sangon BiotechÒ and GenscriptÒ. We also made a proposal  within School of Life Science to secure funding and support.
♣ From May to  August, we were busy with lab work and optimizing experiments. At the end of  August, we sent 3 students to attend CCIC in Fuzhou, Fujian and asked iGEMers  from all over China to fill in our questionnaires so that we got to know what  they thought about our project.
♦ In September and October, we visited AddiseoÒ in Nanjing to learn  about biosafety issues, did all the other human practices and formed collaboration with team OUC-China. We also spread no effort in building wiki and modeling before November. We had been making beautiful  original design throughout the whole time. We were so lucky to have talented  and hard-working students to get everything neatly done before the Giant  Jamboree.
DNA purification/Axygen gel extraction
1. Excise  the agarose gel slice containing the DNA fragment of interest with a clean,  sharp scalpel under ultraviolet illumination.
2. Absorb  the liquids left on the surface of the gel slices using paper towels. Weigh gel  slice (tare with empty tube).
3. Add 3  volumes of DE-A buffer per mg of gel (so a 100mg gel gets 300ul of buffer).
4.  Resuspend the gel in Buffer DE-A by vortexing. Heat at 75℃ until the gel is completely dissolved (keep heating for 6-8 minutes). If  low-melt agarose gel is used, you may heat it at 40�"

Macquarie_Australia,2014,Team:Macquarie Australia#Project#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," 2012 iGEM Uppsala team.
Many of the individual parts from last year were not received by the registry in 2013. Following our efforts to confirm all nucleotide sequences of parts, we thoroughly researched these genes and improved their documentation to elucidate the function and interactions between each part in the system. Information regarding each part's function, role in the biosynthesis pathway, protein structure, and enzymatic reactions can be found in the iGEM parts registry.
The ChlD Story: the repair of the registry ChlD
During our screening of all of last year’s individual parts, we discovered that the ChlD part [ BBa_K1080002 ] had a 50 base-pair deletion in the middle of the gene.
We resolved this issue, repairing the deletion. With the complete and correct sequence present, this part could be incorporated into operon 1. We have since verified that the part is functional, guaranteeing it has been properly repaired.
This part has now been successfully sent to the registry in a functional state, and can be seen below in the 'parts improved' table.

Figure 4. Visualization tool we built for Hong_Kong_HKUST.
Bi-directional collaboration
Our software focus on search and design which highly relies on users’ feedbacks. We asked HKUST to use the our software and got a positive feedback. They said they struggled a lot when they brain-stormed at first and found it’s hard to find the synthetic biology work with similar topic straightly and connectively, which is also why they want us to build a visualization tool for them, actually for the whole community. Besides, since the programmer in their team has a strong background in Computer Science, whom win the Gold Medal of International Olympiad in Informatics(IOI), we also discussed a lot on the backend and algorithm of our project, which turned out to be quite helpful for both of us. Besides, we also visit their lab and got some advice on the experiments implementation.
Figure 5. Li Tianqin, our team leader, explained how would our software solve the puzzle for synthetic biologists and guide them to use our software for all the useful functions, including searching, designing and simulating.
Figure 6. We visited their lab in HKUST and discussed about the experiments in Synthetic Biology, especially the Interlab Study and the main projects. Ideas of standardization and other engineering principles have been fully understood and applied by each team in the process of wet lab implementation. However, we also talked about the phenomena on regulation leaking and other unpredictable aspects in biology experiments where we encouraged each other for further research and study.

\[y = f({x_1},{x_2},{x_3})\]
Since the response surface equation \(y = f({x_1},{x_2},{x_3})\) is unknown , a test (sampling) is required, and the experimental data obtained from the finite test is used to estimate \(f\) (by partial estimation of the whole). We chose the Box-Behnken Design (BBD) method to design the experiment [2][3]. The test point arrangement is shown in Fig. 1.
Fig. 1   (a)test points for Box-Behnken design (b)test points projection on z1, z2 plane
The maximum and minimum values of \({x_1}\)，\({x_2}\)， \({x_3}\) are called upper levels and lower levels, and the average of upper levels and lower levels is zero levels. Since the dimensions of \({x_1}\)，\({x_2}\)，\({x_3}\) are different, you need to standardize the variables:
\[{z_i} = \frac{{{x_i} - \overline {{x_i}} }}{\sigma }\]
Where, \({z_i}\) is the normalized variable (encoding),  \(\overline {{x_i}} \) is the average, and \(\sigma \) is the standard deviation. The variation range and normalized value of \({x_1}\)，\({x_2}\)， \({x_3}\) are as follows:

Public Forum
In an effort to communicate about our project with the general public of Lansing, we planned a public forum focused on educating attendees about synthetic biology, our project, and controversy over genetically modified organisms (GMOs). We created a slideshow detailing these topics and then held a question-and-answer session with a panel of five MSU professors specializing in philosophy, plant biology, biochemistry/molecular biology, agriculture, and computational biology. These professors graciously agreed to appear on our panel as unpaid volunteers.
Garden 25th Birthday Bash
The MSU Horticulture Gardens hosted a celebration for its 25th birthday on July 14, 2018 from 10 am - 12 pm, during which visitors went on a tour of the gardens and visited booths set up throughout the gardens. Our team set up a booth at the gardens for this event. At our booth, we had a banner with our team logo on it, a trifold poster explaining synthetic biology and our project, brochures explaining the goals of our project (which were intended for older children and adults), and a simple experiment (which was intended for younger children). The experiment consisted of learning simple pipetting skills and predicting liquid quantities. The event staff predicted that over 200 people visited the gardens that day and we had 100 visitors to our booth, the majority of which were children ages 3 to 9 and their parents. This event was unique in that it allowed us to educate both children and their parents about synthetic biology in a fun and engaging way.
Garden Plot
We planted ten Brachypodium plants in the MSU Horticulture Gardens. They were accompanied by a sign that gave brief explanation of our project goals. We also included our team’s social media (Facebook and Instagram) usernames. The plants and sign were in the gardens from June to October. Our hope was that visitors to the gardens would learn a little bit about synthetic biology and want to learn more.

Gold Medal Criterion #4
Teams that can show their system working under real world conditions are usually good at impressing the judges in iGEM. To achieve gold medal criterion #4, convince the judges that your project works. There are many ways in which your project working could be demonstrated, so there is more than one way to meet this requirement. This gold medal criterion was introduced in 2016, so check our what 2016 teams did to achieve a their gold medals!
Please see the 2017 Medals Page for more information.
What should we do for our demonstration?
Standard teams
If you have built a proof of concept system, you can demonstrate it working under real world conditions. If you have built a biological device that is intended to be a sensor, can you show it detecting whatever it is intended to sense. If it is intended to work in the field, you can show how this might work using a simulated version in the lab, or a simulation of your device in the field. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab.
Special track teams
Special track teams can achieve this medal criterion by bringing their work to the Jamboree and showcasing it in the track event. Art & Design, Measurement, Hardware and Software tracks will all have showcase events at the Giant Jamboree. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab.

Proof of concept
To prove our concept that See our final results here!
(1) We can make the bacteria sense the plasmid numbers.
(2) The in-promoter will respond differently to different signal which can reflect the plasmids losing on different levels. This way, our system can  control the plasmids numbers above a threshold.
We designed two parts. One of them is to prove that plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration. The other one is to prove the inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene by affecting its in-promoter.
Plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration
Because of the difficulty of controlling the number of plasmids, we can only choose some typical copy numbers of plasmids in our system.
The number of the copy numbers are shown in the table below:
We also constructed the gene circuits containing constitutive promoters with different strengths to express the inhibitor. By this we regulate the threshold of plasmids number to meet different needs.
There are four promoters with different strengths and two kinds of RBS we have choose:
Meanwhile, the RFP used to replace the inhibitor protein can directly represent the concentration of the inhibitor in the cell. We separately constructed there circuits on different vectors which have different copy numbers.
At first, we use the modeling to explain the relationship of the concentration of the inhibitor and plasmids number like the curve below under a certain condition
And then after passing a period of time, we will measure the RFP intensity to get the data which can describe the relationship between the inhibitor concentration and the plasmid copy numbers.
This way, we verified that plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration under on the plasmid vector.
The inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene
In order to know the relationship of the inhibitor and in-promoter, we use the arabinose induced promoter PBAD to express the inhibitor. So we can add arabinose with different concentrations to induce the promoter providing an environment with different concentrations of intracellular inhibitor. Kill gene is replaced by RFP to stand the in-promoter’s status.
We built three devices containing different kinds of inhibitors. The gene circuits are shown in Fig.4.
Meanwhile, we designed three corresponding in-promoter circuits in Fig.5.

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

Previous Works on Related Subjects
The following are previous iGEM projects that we have based our own project upon. We have listed links to their websites, and exactly what we have learnt from them. We have also done some “literature review”, where we collected our other ideas from previous papers, but those are listed as references within each page.
1. 2012 Lyon-INSA’s wiki allowed us to learn about the protein sfp, and confirmed our idea on how surfactin can be used. https://2012.igem.org/Team:Lyon-INSA
2. We found a part similar to our ideal device in Newcastle, 2010. While they used swrA, we were planning to use swrC (although we did not submit it to the registry) and lmrA. https://2010.igem.org/Team:Newcastle/Swarming
3. From TU-Delft’s excellent project in alkane degradation, we developed an idea to use their parts in our project. https://2010.igem.org/Team:TU_Delft
4. Thanks to the responsible documentation of Heidelberg 2013, we figured out the relationship between multiple 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferases present in the registry. https://2013.igem.org/Team:Heidelberg

Figure 4. PCR making use of custom primers to extract β-lactamase from the psB1A3 vector. Expected band sizes were seen for all of the extractions at approximately 950-bp. Some unexpected amplification is seen for this PCR. No contamination is observed in the NTCs (no template controls). The gel was 1% agarose and was run at 100 V for an hour
A construction that was attempted this week consisted of placing the β-lactmase gene with a His-tag behind the promoter BBa_J04500 . Also attempted were plasmid switches of the three β-lactamase genes extracted via PCR. Colonies were seen for all of the transformed ligation mixtures for these constructions. Colony PCR of these transformed colonies only produced potentially viable results of J04500 + β-lactamase (with His-tag) construct.
Week 12: July 15 - July 19
The primers for golden gate assembly arrived this week and we conducted the PCRs required for our first attempt at the construct fusing the two ferritin subunits together ( BBa_K1189018 ). The final ligation product was run on a gel and appears promising, showing a 1500bp band, most likely representing our construct. Despite this, transformations have failed and therefore we have to look back at our primers and experimental design.
We now have a more set idea of how we are going to synthesize magnetoferritin. We will most likely be using a flask with a rubber stopper that will allow inflow and outflow of the nitrogen gas, which will be bubbled into the solution with an air stone. Nitrogen is free to exit a small port in the stopper and reagents can easily be added via injection through the rubber stopper. Safe handling of the thioglycollic acid is paramount, therefore equipment has been ordered, (elbow-length gloves, respirator, and aprons) and attempts at synthesis will be conducted as soon as we get the equipment.
The β-lactamase construction attempted last week proved to be unsuccessful, however, another construction from this week did produce a gene that appeared to be the J04500 + β-lactamase with a His-tag part. This construction was sent in for sequencing over the weekend.

SouthBend-Mishawaka-HS-2,2011,Team:SouthBend-Mishawaka-HS-2_-_-_TEXT.html," create a device using synthetic biology to detect arsenic in water and give an instant reading to the presence of arsenic. Arsenic is a harmful to organism that use phosphorus in organic molecules because arsenic can replace phosphorus in organic molecules. This can occur because arsenic has similar characteristics as phosphorus.
Secondary Objective:
Our team's secondary objective is to use our iGEM arsenic biosensor to test different water sources.
Further Considerations
Ideally, our engineered bacteria would be able to indicate the arsenic levels based on light and odor intensity. When the promoter is activated with the presence of arsenic, RNA polymerase is able to travel down the DNA of the GFP gene or the Wintergreen odor gene. The odor will allow one to immediately detect arsenic, while the creation of Green Flourescent Protein will create light that can be measured quantitatively.

The original biobrick and our modified two plasmid system were furthermore compared by western blotting (Fig. 9 and 10). It was found that GFP was produced in the absence of chromate for both systems. This reason for these unexpected results could not be discerned, and further experiments are required to understand those. At this stage of the project the results indicate that ChrB might not be a repressor.

We use the Monod equation to model the substrate limited bacterial growth. \begin{align} \mu_{X} = \mu_{max, X} \frac{S}{K_{S, X} + S} \end{align}
Where $\mu_{X}$ is the bacterial growth rate, $\mu_{max, X}$ is the maximum bacterial growth rate, $S$ is the growth limiting substrate and $K_s$ is the amount of substrate remaining when the growth rate is half of maximum. Due to environmental factors, some bacteria will die; the death rate ($k_d$) is assumed to be directly proportional to the bacteria population. A lag phase is modelled by multiplying a dampening term to the growth rate, namely $(1 - e^{-\alpha t})$, where $\alpha$ is defined as a proportionality constant. The slowing of growth from exponential to stationary is modelled with yet another dampening term to be multiplied to the growth: $exp\big[{-\big(\frac{X}{X_c}\big)^m\big]}$. This dampening term is related to the quorom sensing in bacteria; once the bacteria reach some characteristic concentration ($X_c$) the bacteria begin to slow down growth. Thus the uninfected cell growth is described by: \begin{align} \frac{dX_u}{dt} = \big( \mu_{X, u}e^{-\big(\frac{X}{X_c}\big)^m} - k_{d_{X,u}} \big) X_u\big(1 - e^{-\alpha t}\big)  \end{align} For simplicity, in this model, $m$, $X_c$, and $\alpha$ are all to be empirically determined and assumed constant. In reality, each constant is dependent on many variables, for example: temperature, pressure, [substrate], environmental conditions, bacterial  strain, and more. Similarly for infected cells: \begin{align} \frac{dX_i}{dt} = \big( \mu_{X, i}e^{-\big(\frac{X}{X_c}\big)^m} - k_{d_{X,i}} \big) X_i"
Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," ways to achieve this and opted to reach Bee Culture, an international beekeeping magazine that Eng. Salcido (beekeeper in Delicias, Chihuahua) mentioned to us in a visit we made to his business.
iGEM Tec Chihuahua has proposed a solution to a real beekeeping problem using synthetic biology, but we also know that not everyone can understand how it works without knowing previously what this new science branch involves. Having said that, it is very important for us to let people know about synthetic biology and the benefits that it could bring to Apis mellifera and to life in general.
For our Human Practices, we want to raise awareness for bees and how we can help these remarkable organisms to fight for their lives. For this reason, we looked for this prestigious beekeeping magazine to make diffusion of synthetic biology in more countries.
Bee Culture is a very important magazine, in the United States and other English-speaking countries, that shares useful articles for beekeepers and people interested in bees. It is the American beekeeping magazine which has news and expert tips for beginning, sideline, and commercial beekeepers. The scope of the magazine is given by the monthly subscriptions, which are available to all English-speaking countries and people who are interested in this topic all around the world. The magazine could be found in a printed edition, smartphones, tablets, and web edition.
That’s why we decided to write an article and share it with the ones who are interested in this sector. We want that people know that there also exists a new way to redesign biological systems which could be channeled in favor of any living organism besides the traditional antibiotics and treatments.
We firmly believe that synthetic biology needs to be spread, but not only in our community. We wanted to reach people strictly related with this field, so we wrote to the Bee Culture Magazine an article proposal, which they liked and will be published in November’s magazine edition.
The article’s title is “Synthetic Biology: An Advantageous Approach to Combat Bee Diseases” where we talked about what is synthetic biology and how it has been used in the beekeeping sector in the last few years. We also wrote about the colony collapse disorder, which is the phenomenon that is affecting many beekeepers nowadays. This disorder is making beehives susceptible to many diseases, such as American and European Foulbrood. As well, we mentioned that synthetic biology is creating technology to help solve this diseases without altering the natural genomic of the bee or the resulting honey. As well, we finished the article saying that we wanted to create knowledge and well-informed citizens who can create their own"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do"

Tyr A- E. coli (not transformed), and BL21 E. coli are studied as negative controls. For each cell line, 10 mL of preculture were incubated for 12h at 37°C, in liquid LB medium. Cells are then centrifuged down (10min, 3000g). The pellets are washed 3 times with 5 mL of liquid M9 (protocol available on our website) to remove any tyrosine previously found in the preculture medium. Cells are then concentrated to an OD (optical density) value of 6 with the appropriate volume of M9 medium.
In a 12-wells plate, final volume of 3mL in each well:
D-Tyr is added to the concentration of 0.05 mg/mL
ONB-Tyr is added to the concentration of 0.084 mg/mL
L-arabinose is added to the concentration of 0.1% (w/v)
Liquid M9 is added to the volume of 3 mL.
Add antibiotics as required
Four plates are filled as follows: tyr or ONB-Tyr, in the  presence or not of arabinose are filled for the 3 types of cell (BL21, TyrA-, TyrA- + BBa_K577882). The four plates were placed under a 400WLEO / S 400-94-CR light during 0, 12, 60 and 300 minutes. Besides those plates, an ONB-Tyr toxicity control has been run, with 50/50% of Tyr/ONB-Tyr concentration with TyrA- + BBa_K577882.
After exposure, 50 µL of concentrated 6 OD cell culture is added to the well. Next, plates are placed under agitation at 37°C. Fluorescence (λexcitation = 533 nm, λemission = 588 nm) and OD are measured every 2h between 15h and 21h of incubation. The fluorescence measurements are reported to the OD measure, to normalize the results.
The graph below (Figure 4) shows the evolution of RFP fluorescence with the duration of incubation for the different samples (0, 12, 60 and 300 minutes of exposure to polychromatic light).

Furthermore, hyperglycemia can also cause the filtration in the glomerular to accelerate, which leads to its hypertrophy. As the function of kidney is gradually damaged, it can no longer eliminate the deleterious substances from our body. With urea and creatinine surging, a person could eventually end up in renal failure. From above, we can get a conclusion that diabetes is surely a thorny chronic disease that we should be cautious of.
Taiwan has the reputation of “the kingdom of Hem dialysis”. Yes, this is apparently not a thing we should be proud of. A huge sum of money is spent on this problem every year. But, you probably don’t know that a huge ratio of these cases are caused by neither drug abuse nor consuming too much salty food. Instead, diabetes is what may leads to kidney diseases. So, we invited Dr. Wu from the division of nephrology to tell us about the negative effects of diabetes. 
 In the interview, he mentioned that due to hyperglycemia, HHNK and DKA, which may cause headache, nausea, or even drive people into coma, is often found in people with diabetes. Furthermore, hyperglycemia can also cause the filtration in the glomerular to accelerate, which leads to its hypertrophy. As the function of kidney is gradually damaged, it can no longer eliminate the deleterious substances from our body.

After we had a discussion with Dr. Wu, we changed our aim from controlling diabetes to losing weight. Since weight losing is nothing more than controlling the diet and exercising for most people, we soon contacted with a fitness coach and paid a visit to his workshop, so as to learn the relation between them and our project.
While we are conversing with the coach, we had a heart full of doubt: Where’s the dumbbells or treadmills we usually see in a gym? After we consult the coach, he told us that the main point of “fitness” is not focusing on building bulky muscles but living a healthier life. We were confused by the time we heard this statement, "

Making a 4 monomer silk construct
This page describe how we intended to proceed with our project if we had been able to produce a longer silk construct.
Insertion of ICA product into E. coli.
The assembled genes from the ICA method contain the two restriction sites, EcoRI and PstI. The gene can therefore be digested and ligated into a vector, pSB1C3, with corresponding restriction sites. The ligated product can hereafter be inserted into E. coli. The cloning should be checked by restriction digest and agarose gel electrophoresis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. To prove that the protein can be correctly expressed, the size of the proteins should be checked by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis followed by Coomassie blue staining. The proteins should also be detected on Western blots using a monoclonal anti-histidine tag antibody Albertson, A. E., et al. (2014). ""Effects of different post-spin stretching conditions on the mechanical properties of synthetic spider silk fibers"" Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials 29: 225-234. .
Purification of silk from E. coli.
For the extracting of the silk from the bacteria, it has been decided to use a purification method without the use of His-tag. The method is choosen, because earlier literature have demonstrated that recombinant silk produced without a His-tag have better mechanical properties compared to the fibres made from silk proteins with a His-tag Tokareva, O., et al. (2013). ""Recombinant DNA production of spider silk proteins."" Microbial Biotechnology 6(6): 651-663. .
The first step in the purification method is to cultivate the bacteria containing the silk construct in LB broth at 37 celsius degrees until it reaches an OD600 at 0.6-0.8. Here the gene expression will be induced with IPTG for 2-4 hours Teulé, F., et al. (2013). ""A protocol for the production of recombinant spider silk-like proteins for artificial fiber spinning."" Nature Protocols 4(3): 341-355. .  For large scale expression a fermentor can be used. The cells can be grown in minimal medium with 1% yeast extract and 100  μg/ml chloramphenicol. The pH should be kept at 6.8 by addition of ammonia water except for periods when the pH increases above 6.88"

ProtoMetrics
     ProtoCat is meant to enable lab researchers to get feedback on their lab procedures; in order to improve efficiency or gather feedback. But how can they quantify which version of a protocol is better? What if a researcher wants to gather feedback about a specific step, or specific product? Ask for the calibration of the equipment that other people are using? And even if they can get it in the comments, how will they get that information in a readily accessible and usable form? This need gave rise to ProtoMetrics, our way to allow researchers to get quantitative metrics on their protocols.
     ProtoMetrics allows users to specify three types of questions: Text, Numeric, or Polls. Text and Numeric are relatively straightforward; the former asks for a text response (ex: describe the resulting solution), whereas the latter is for strictly numeric responses (ex: How many grams of product were you able to produce?). Polls allow for a respondent to choose from a selection of responses, which can be used for specific equipment calibration. Once the users have submitted the responses, the publisher of the protocol can download the results in a Comma Seperated Value (csv) file for easy import into Excel, MATLAB, or a similar analysis tool.

Introduction to our Human Practices
In our work with Human Practices we have focused on making safety choices based on feedback from experts, integrating experts advice on protein production for space purposes and exploring the reasons for colonizing Mars by making a report. The report is made in collaboration with the other danish iGEM team coming from the Technical University of Denmark and with the iGEM team coming for the University of Exeter. We have also engaged in skill-sharing between iGEM'ers both with a workshop at the European meet-up and with beginner friendly guides about wikipages, which drew alot of attention to our Medium Blog
Integration of experts’ input on protein choice for space health
We reached out to experts within the field of health in space in order to learn more about the main problems of health in space.
Our findings has greatly impacted the purpose with the project, as it has:
Helped us understand which problems we can solve and how
Helped us conclude on a list of proteins that would be ideal for space travel related health issues
You can read more about the experts and our integration of their input here .
Safety choices and expert evaluations
In order to make sure that our system for protein production is safe to use, and in order to carry out our own laboratory work as responsible as possible, we have been in extensive dialogue with safety experts. We have:
Evaluated the dual-use risk of our system with the Danish Centre for Biosecurity and Biopreparedness
Implemented needed extra safety precautions including required lab coats, eye, nose and mouth protection and created a buffer zone
Chosen to work with a non-pathogenic bacterial strain with inducible injectisome
Worked only with plant- or artificial membranes
Integrated safety considerations in our choice of user and design of the chamber

We also prepared a number of agar plates and agar plates with Chloramphenicol. 
Taylor   and Alex carried on working on the wiki, using the idea of a   minimalistic design that we had agreed upon. We also decided that we   like the logo that Rosie has designed, but that it needs some   changes/improvements.  
We   met with our supervisors, and discussed sequences, lab work, the wiki   and future events. We decided that due to the budget we will initially   only order one sequence. We decided as a team that zingiberne synthase   would be the enzyme we would like to use first.   
 
Day 15 (16/07/14): 
We carried out agarose gel electrophoresis on the GFP plasmids we had obtained in the miniprep.   However due to an error in the preparation of the gel this was   unsuccessful. We also left a sample of E.coli cells in freshly prepared   LB at 37°C over night to grow. 
Taylor   carried on working on the Wiki, and Rosie and Alex carried on working   on the logo. We also filled out the iGem safety forms and a proposal for   a workshop we could hold at the YSB conference in September.  
As   a group we discussed whether or not to use the enzyme patchoulol   synthase as we have found out that the current production of patchouli   oil is done is quite a sustainable way. We   decided that using patchoulol synthase probably isn’t the best idea and   to look into alternative enzymes we could use instead.  
 
Day 16 (17/07/14): 
Today   we completed the poster and presentation for the Sheffield meet up. We   also carried on working on the logo design, adding in some of the iGem   colours.  
The   zingiberne synthase sequence was finalised and sent to Wei-Feng to be   ordered, and we design the Biobrick we will make with this sequence,   including the promoter, ribosome binding site and terminator. 
In   the lab Brogan and Rosie prepared some more competent cells, and also   carried out agarose gel electrophoresis of the plasmid we obtained from   the mini-prep, to check the plasmid was present. Unfortunately when   viewed under UV, only the DNA marker was present, showing the plasmid   was"

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#build#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,", the glyoxylate shunt genes are already present, but repressed by a repressor encoded by the iclR gene (Waegeman et al. , 2011). Deleting this gene will make it possible to have an increased flux through the TCA cycle. Using this knockout with minimal mutations, we receive an E. Coli which follows the same metabolic engineering principles as the Synechocystis strain proposed by iGEM team Amsterdam, and is therefore expected to be stable in terms of production (Fig. 2).
This strain is previously made by Song et al. , (2013) and produced 1.45g/L fumaric acid from 15g/L glucose in 24h in flask culture under aerobic conditions. This strain can be further optimized for higher fumaric acid yields; however, this always comes at the risk of impairing other functions.
Figure 2. Central central metabolic pathways in E. coli after engineering E. coli for fumarate production. Thick arrows indicate increased flux by the overexpression of the corresponding gene. The X indicates that the deletion of the corresponding gene. Enzymes encoded by the genes shown are: fumA,  aerobic Class I fumaric acid hydratase; fumB, anaerobic class I fumaric acid hydratase; fumC, fumaric acid hydratase (fumarase C); iclR, isocitrate lyase repressor. (Adapted from Song et al. (2013))
Fumarates effect on the microbiome of cattle
In theory, fumarate has the potential to decrease methane synthesis in cattle, as it can redirect the available hydrogen into propionate rather than into methane (Fig 3). Fumarate has been proven to reduce methane emission in both in vitro and in vivo studies (Mcginn et al. , 2004). However, a recent in vivo study found no effect of adding fumarate to cattle feed on methane emission. This finding contradicts earlier findings. It is possible that a higher level of supplementation than that used in the recent study would be needed to alter methane production in vivo. It is estimated that the level of supplementation in the recent study provided about 15 mM of fumaric acid (assuming a ruminal volume of 40 L; 116.07 g/mol), although these calculations do not account for fluid dilution rate and passage of fumaric acid from the rumen, which are in vivo factors that do not occur in vitro. In vivo, cattle were fed"

Pavia was then ruled by the Austrians until 1796, when it was occupied by the French army under Napoleon. During this Austrian period the University was greatly supported by Maria Theresa of Austria and saw a great renaissence that eventually lead to a second renaissance due to the presence of leading scientists and humanists like Ugo Foscolo, Alessandro Volta, Lazzaro Spallanzani, Camillo Golgi among others.
In 1815, it again passed under Austrian administration until the Second War of Italian Independence (1859) and the unification of Italy one year later.
The main sightseeing spots in Pavia are: the churches (in particular the Duomo, San Michele Maggiore, San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro, Santa Maria del Carmine etc...), the castle (castello visconteo), the monastery (Certosa di Pavia) and the covered bridge.

University
The University of Pavia is one of the oldest universities in Europe. An edict issued by King Lotarius quotes a higher education institution in Pavia as already established 825 A.D. This institution, mainly devoted to ecclesiastical and civil law as well as to divinity studies, was then elected as the prime educational centre for northern Italy. Enlarged and renovated by the Duke of Milan, Gian Galeazzo Visconti, it became the University of the Duchy, having been officially established as a studium generale by Emperor Charles IV in 1361.
During the following centuries, even though passing through periods of both adversity and prosperity, the fame of the University of Pavia grew and not just in Italy. The continuous presence of learned men and scientists who wrote celebrated works and made important discoveries, such as Girolamo Cardano, Alessandro Volta, Camillo Golgi, Ugo Foscolo together with the distinguished educational record of the University, added to the good name of the institution.
Nowadays, the University keeps on offering a wide variety of disciplinary and interdisciplinary teaching. Research is carried out in departments, institutes, clinics, centres and laboratories, in close association with public and private institutions, enterprises, and factories.
These are the 9 faculties in which the university is divided into:
Faculty of Economics
Faculty of Engineering
Faculty of Humanities
Faculty of Law
Faculty of Physical, Natural and Mathematical Sciences
Faculty of Medicine
Faculty of Musicology
Faculty of Pharmacy
Faculty of Politics

Week 22
The lab work has finally started!
Week 23
On Tuesday we ordered the constructs that we designed to let them synthesize. An exciting moment! Last check: are all the illegal restriction sites removed, is the gene in frame, is it codon-optimized, do we have the prefix and the suffix... yes? GO!
Week 24
We transformed the competent cells with pUC19 cells. This led to an equivalent amount of colonies in the positive and negative plate. Competent cells were made again. The top-10 cells with plasmids were grown in liquid LB and with a midiprep the plasmids were purified. We checked the vectors with DpnI and prefix/suffix enzymes, this led to results as expected. This week we investigated the possibility of growing yeasts and bacteria in the same culture using bacteriostatins to regulate bacterial growth (which grows quicker). We inoculated bacteria and yeasts separately in liquid YPD with tetracyclin and observed the growth curve using OD600. This led to a nice correlation of concentration and growth speed for bacteria, where yeast cells weren’t affected.
Week 25
Synthesized banana receptors came in! Competent cells where checked and no growth was detected, we decided to transform cells anyway with the banana receptor vectors (IDT smartAMP backbone). This led to a positive outcome and we picked colonies and grew them and isolated the plasmids. Primers were designed to generate a knock-out cassette for the genes ATF1, FAR1 and GPA1 with the pUG73 and pUG72 vectors. Also primers were designed around the multiple cloning site of pRS to check inserts.
Week 26
Primers arrived. Restriction of the banana receptors"
Hamburg,2018,Team:Hamburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," to be harmful to humans and other mammals we decided to use an alternative insecticide which was known to be exclusively toxic to insects, BjaIT, which we submitted as BBa_K2588019. BjaIT inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels of insects exclusively while not being able to bind to mammalian sodium channels.
We are fully aware of the dual use potential sustained production of a toxin raises. We discussed how to deal with information on toxin-producing and -secreting bacteria with both Dr. Mirko Himmel and Piers Millett, iGEM Director of Safety and Security. Together, we decided to publish all results in wiki and registry, but not to release details on the different toxins, production methods, and experimental and design workflows, increasing the effort people with possible harmful intent would have to take to recreate our experiments with possibly more harmful agents.
With Dr. Mirko Himmel, we discussed the danger of unintentionally releasing the GMOs used in the S.H.I.E.L.D. Two different aspects must be considered:
We had to make sure that the trap is robust in order to prevent breakage or leaks under intended use stresses as well as stronger environmental influences and forces. Therefore, we decided to use a very hard, durable, UV resistant, autoclavable plastic employing strong sealing rings to ensure the S.H.I.E.L.D. is not easily damaged, releasing GMOs in the process.
On the other hand, in the unlikely case that GMOs are released into the environment, they must not be able to spread uncontrollably. While the implemented growth inhibition module BBa_K2588021 ensures that the modified bacteria would not be able to proliferate even under ideal circumstances, we would suggest to introduce a kill switch, such as the Amber substitution kill switch introduced by iGEM Darmstadt 2016 into the organism before using the S.H.I.E.L.D. in the field. A stop codon (Amber codon) is introduced at the beginning of a gene coding for a transcription factor, which under desired conditions inhibits the expression of a lethal gene. A special amino acid that do not naturally occur in E. coli corresponds to the amber codon for the gene to be elongated past the stop signal. In the S.H.I.E.L.D. this amino acid would be provided by the cyanobacteria. In the environment, E. coli would no longer be provided with it, causing the production of the transcription factor to cease. Therefore, the activation of the lethal gene would ensure the death of E. coli cells outside of the trap. Since genetically altered E."

MutS and DinB gave some good results, but the two MutL gels didn’t work (one showed nothing, the other disintegrated). And so the buffer problems began. Miniprepped MutH, ParC, UmuC, DnaE, and MutY. Twice. The first time failed miserably, since it turns out that one of the buffers (P2) was improperly made and had been giving us screwy results for a while. Some members wanted to keep it for some reason, so we just gave it a choke collar label that said “BAD” on it. The second miniprep attempt was successful with a better-behaved buffer. Made glycerol stocks of promoter. Restriction digested and gel purified promoter. Ligated mCherry+paroF and promoter+TyrR and transformed products. Plated independent cultures of MG1655 onto restrictive media and made dilutions (only up to around 10^6, though, nothing like that 1/10^30 homeopathy BS)
Thursday
Sent in a variety of mutators (MH, MY, UC, DE, and PC) for sequencing. Miniprepped DinB and MutS samples. Digested and ligated MutL and MutD with increased insert:vector ratio (now 5:1). Did Colony PCR on IGER3 and IG3 samples then ran on gels (used separate TAE buffer from the main stock, but the gels still failed anyways). Ran Colony PCR and gels for mCherry+paroF and Promoter+TyrR Nevermind! The buffer is DEFINITELY bad, so there go the results for that! Time to do it all over again *eye twitches*. Made more LB, rif, and dilution plates since the results from the previous ones were inconclusive.
Friday
Re-did the gels for mCherry+paroF and Promoter+TyrR. Sent in DinB and MutS for sequencing. Transformed MutL, MutD, and IPTG+GFP into competent cells. It turns out that we didn’t need the IGER3 and IG3 overnight cultures that were made on Thursday, so they were thrown out. Made new LB agar plates. Selective growth plates from the other day showed no growth, but the nonselective test plates showed reasonable amounts of growth.
