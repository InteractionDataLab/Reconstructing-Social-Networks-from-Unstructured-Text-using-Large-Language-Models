Waterloo,2017,Team:Waterloo#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,", this platform is undeniably influential over public’s perception. If used responsibly, social media can be an important tool to move public recognition in synthetic biology forward.
Action
Throughout the course of this season, the Waterloo iGEM 2017 team has actively involve social media in its activities for policy and practice. The main actions taken were:
Update posts on our Twitter account and Instagram account to increase the number of followers
Present the concept of social media’s role in synthetic biology for SHAD Valley
Distribute our IAT survey through social media to see how people react to synthetic biology online.
Result
This section will only discuss the results obtained from our operation of our social media account, as the outcomes of SHAD Valley and IAT is performed separately. Through Twitter, we were able to generate thousands of impressions and gained 77 new followers from June 2017 to October 2017. One noticeable trend was that content originally created by us such as photos and videos tend to gain more engagement more than retweets.
As a result, we brought our attention to our instagram page and achieved phenomenal results. Instagram is the ideal social media website for sharing authentic content, as it does not promote reposting content like Twitter does. Therefore, we use Instagram to share photos of our activities throughout this season. This help us to connect with the community by sharing day-to-day moments we experienced from being in the lab and going outside to interview professors. Over the course of the few months, we achieved over 200 followers, which showed that social media provide a great platform to connect with people.

Paris_Bettencourt,2015,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Continuity_-_-_TEXT.html,"C31 integrase is expressed, this plasmid will be integrated in the locus (B). The CRISPR-Cas9 system from S. pyogenes should work well for selecting the cells who integrated the plasmid(Jiang, Bikard 2013), as the attB contains the protospacer adjacent motif ""NGG"" next to the two central bases (Mojica 2009). It is therefore possible to kill the cells who still have an intact attB site, just by using CRISPR spacers targeting the following sequences:
GCGGGTGCCAGGGCGTGCCCTTGGGCTCCC for killing cells who have not integrated anything in the first attB version,
GCGGGTGCCAGGGCGTGCCCCCGGGCTCCC, for the second attB version.
It has the advantage of leaving no scar, thus reducing the number of recombination sites present in the locus.
After integration, the new cassette becomes a new part of the system (C).
The proposed process for addition of new operons to the chassis. A standard cassette is integrated in the PhiC31 locus. It then becomes a new possible outcome for the random differentiation, thanks to the addition of a new LoxP site.
Division of labour
Now that the different genes have been added to the chassis, it is time to see it in action.
The CRE recombinase will cut the LoxP sites in the middle, remove the region in-between, and join the two remaining halves of LoxP sites together (Nagy 2000). This only occurs if the overlap sequence are exactly identical (Missirlis 2006). This means that, in the picture of the right, only LoxP sites of same colour would recombine. Given the configuration of this system, any LoxP recombination event would result in the loss of several other LoxP site, in a such way that further recombinations are not possible. The pair of LoxP sites that undergo recombination is therefore chosen randomly by each cell.
Depending on which region is excised, one random coding region settles next to the promoter and starts to be expressed. For a chassis containing four different operons, the mother cells differentiates in four different daughter cells, each of them expressing one operon.
Even if the chassis is not completely filled, it still works: the number of different daughter cells is always equal to the number of inserted cassettes, and the probability of each is adjusted accordingly.
Overview of the differentiation process. For a complete organism with four metabolic operons, there are four"

To find the probability of the enzyme being in a certain state, we will use the Boltzmann distribution[as explained in [8] pages 219-237]:
\[{e^{ - \frac{{{\varepsilon _{macrostate}}}}{{KT}}}}\]
The Boltzmann distribution is a probability distribution that gives the probability that a system will be in a certain state as a function of that state’s energy and the temperature of the system.
The probability for the system to be in a certain macrostate is:
\[{P_{macrostat{e_i}}} = \frac{{\overbrace {{e^{ - \frac{{{\varepsilon _{macrostat{e_i}}}}}{{KT}}}}}^{{\rm{The}}\,{\rm{Weight}}\,{\rm{of}}\,{\rm{the}}\,{\rm{macrostate}}}}}{{\underbrace {\sum\limits_{j = 1}^M {{e^{ - \frac{{{\varepsilon _{macrostat{e_j}}}}}{{KT}}}}} }_{{\rm{The}}\,{\rm{sum}}\,{\rm{of}}\,{\rm{all}}\,{\rm{macrostates}}\,{\rm{weights}}}}}\]
Where M is the number of states accessible to the system.
The weight for each macrostate is the sum of the weights of all of its microstates:
\[{e^{ - \frac{{{\varepsilon _{macrostate}}}}{{KT}}}} = \sum\limits_i {{e^{ - \frac{{{\varepsilon _{microstat{e_i}}}}}{{KT}}}}} \]
A microstate of the system is one possible arrangement of \(\left( {{L_A} + {L_B} + {L_C} + {L_D}} \right)\) ligands in \(\Omega \) cells or/and the binding sites of the receptor. Every macrostate of the system has a certain number of these arrangements.
Each ligand can have two stable states of energy:
When the ligand is free in the solution - \({\varepsilon _{sol}}\).
For the sake of simplicity we will assume all four ligands have the same energy when free in the solution.
When the ligand is bound to a site in the receptor - \({\"

Birkbeck,2015,Team:Birkbeck#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," out a “scientific” busk. The Birkeck team and other current students/graduates of Birkbeck College presented on a wide variety of scientific topics.
There were 3 talks:
The importance of cleanliness and application of microbes in industry.
a.   Kids took part in an activity using glitter to illustrate the epidemiology of bacteria being passed in a population through contact. Clapping & shouting was involved in this activity which the kids animatedly took part in.
b.   It was also explained that not all microbes are bad & that in fact some are actually used in the production of food.
Imaging, Geology & Planetary Science.
a.   Kids interacted enthusiastically with an activity involving piecing together an image of a planet.
b.   Real geological samples were on display, with a Birkbeck Geology graduate describing the fossil & rock samples on show.
Genetic Inheritance, DNA Structure & DNA function.
a.   The use of coloured beans (to represent genes) and paper flowers (to represent the phenotype) was used in an activity to show the nature of inheritance.
b.   Kids took part in forming a human DNA double helix.
c.   Kids took the role of detectives in the “Break the Code” DNA game. Paper models of a DNA with a secret code was used to illustrate the different functions of DNA based on the sequence and reinforce the structure of DNA.
Along with teaching the kids a little science (although the level of understanding & knowledge the kids had was grossly under estimated) an important message was conveyed by each group. “What actually interested each individual in science?”, was used to try to inspire the kids into perhaps studying science at degree level. Many people presenting were from all walks of life, ages and reasons for being enthusiastic about their specialized subject area.
Thursday 25th June
Team Birkbeck were inducted into Lab303/307 at the main building at Birkbeck College (Mallet Street). The induction involved training with lab equipment (such as centrifuges, pH meter, plate readers & PCR machines), the disposal of waste materials, procedures to follow in emergencies,  staff members to contact for particular problems & location of consumables (including logging consumable usage). It was agreed that work in the lab would commence Monday 6th July.

Single-Cell Model
The single-cell model of our system consists of three connected but easily separable modules: the sensor, the band detector and the filter. The sensor detects toxic substances from cigarette smoke. The band detector produces green fluorescent protein upon a detection of a certain range (band) of toxic substance concentration. After the toxic substance concentration crosses a certain threshold, the filter turns the system red (red fluorescent protein is expressed). The single-cell model helped us understand in detail whether and how our synthetic circuit works, especially to explore the characteristics of the GFP band and get a feeling of how it is related to concentration of our input substance.

Policy and Practices
We moved on to the topic of proteins to start to relate what we were introducing to YOURS kids with our own project so they would understand the relevance of our research. After discussing the basic properties of proteins, we helped them carry out an experiment that separated proteins from different dairy products. The visual results helped them better understand how chemical reactions can change molecular structures.
We contacted Bath hatchery and set up a meeting time in July so that we could drive there and talk to representatives in person and our project in perspective of current solutions.
Week 6 (July 12 - July 18)
Wetlab
We cultured, ligated, and plated some of the new plasmids (A(LMNJKR) +H). We still had issues getting older plasmids past transformation stage.
Flavo Subteam
We determined that our plates (for the Flavobacterium) were the issue. We re-plated Flavobacterium on new plates(both strains).
Drylab
Dry lab came up with the design of a box that can be used to market our products. We listed materials, dimensions, and designs that would make up our fish tag kit. For each kit, we intended to include 20 tags, one applicator, one gel vial, syringe and needle, along with an information booklet. Using oak tag, we started a physical copy of the box.
Policy and Practices
Finally, we came a full circle and explained to the kids how bacteria can be potentially dangerous and helpful at the same time and how we can engineer their plasmids in ways to benefit other organisms. They learned about the ubiquitous nature of bacteria when they used cotton swabs to gather different bacterial samples from different areas in the building and let the samples grow overnight. Finally, we explained our own project’s goals and how we would be going to a hatchery the next week to see how farmers have to handle bacterial diseases that affect fish.
Week 7 (July 19 - July 25)

ZE construct was sequenced and stored as glycerol stock along ZK, ZO, ZA, and ZB. The glycerol stocks are for later use in ZOI testing.

Kent,2015,Team:Kent#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," As there are eleven of us in the team, it meant that we could collect different postcodes from everyone in order to contact politicians from few different constituencies.
Another problem that we have encountered was two of them replied that they do not possess the authority or knowledge to answer our questions. This is because only a very small percentage of politicians have science-related degrees or qualifications.
One would think this would make them more inclined to converse more with scientists, in an attempt to bridge the knowledge gap. Of course academics and other scientists don’t tend to associate with politicians a great deal either, so the divide is from both sides. In spite of the many “Sorry, I am unable to help” messages we received, we were able to get an interview with a local councilor only two weeks after contacting him. He answered some of our questions and also came to see the team at work in the lab.
How to get in contact with MPs
Our experience taught us to start contacting MPs early on. Many of the MPs have a busy schedule, therefore, the sooner you get in contact with them, the more time you allow them to prepare the answers when replying to you. In our experience, it can take up to three weeks for them to reply.   Moreover, make your letter short and your questions shorter. As mentioned before, MPs lead a busy lifestyle; therefore, they are less inclined to answer if the letter is long. Keep your questions simple and short, if you would like to hear back from an MP.
Use WriteToThem.com if you want to bypass the problem of how to address MP, or to save time on researching who are your local MPs. The website also has the email addresses of the MPs so that you don’t have to go to the MPs’ personal website to scour for their contact details.
Collect postcodes from team members if you are hoping to target a large number of MPs as some politicians are subjected to strict Parliamentary protocol to reply only to their constituents (those living in the postcode of the area they are in charge of).
Last but not least, many MPs will feel that do not have the knowledge or the authorization to answer your questions. During the interview, assure them that it is a two-way relationship. While they might think they need an in-depth knowledge to answer questions related to a science project, remind them that we are learning about the policy makers’ point of view too, and that their opinions matter as they will guide scientists in experiment design or execution in the future.
What we could have done better
One thing we learned from this experience is that we should have aimed to contact the MPs early on"

        In order to prove our device can work in real world, we chose one to test the metal                     iron in the water sample.
Sample Collection
         To verify whether our products can accurately detect the concentration of heavy metal ions in wastewater                     of realistic environment or not, we took the water samples from the factory to conduct an experiment.                     We took water samples in two spots, an electroplating factory and a pool in an industrial district. For                     mainly manufacturing plating products, the electroplating factory has a great deal of effluent which                     contains heavy metal ions.
         Besides, we noticed that there are at least six electroplating factories in                     Jiahewanggang, Guangzhou City , so we visited there and collected water samples. We collected water from                     a pool and a stream there and put certain amount mercury into it to simulate the real environment for                     the engineered bacteria testing whether the materials in the real environment world effect the work of                     them.

VivaTech is the world’s rendez-vous for startups and leaders to celebrate innovation together. It’s a gathering of the world’s brightest minds, talents, and products. On June 17th, we had the opportunity to present our project to several enterprises, get feedback and discuss potential partnerships.
Conclusion
To conclude, during these past 10 months we really tried to communicate with the public and experts around our project, synthetic biology and air pollution. We did our utmost to reach the widest audience in order to see how our project affects society and integrate our conversations with stakeholders in the design of our product. We took advantage of every opportunity to integrate feedback and publicize our project, whether it was through a Particulate matter scavenger hunt, a questionnaire, meetings ... or even by giving a flyer of our project to President of France, Emmanuel Macron, who unfortunately was too busy to answer our questions for the law report.

Homgenization
Since Griffithsin is an intracellular protein, homogenization was chosen as the method taken to lyse the cells.
Homogenization feeds a sample through small aperture where the cell is lysed by shearing
Figure: Homogenization
CONFIRMATION OF GRIFFITHSIN EXPRESSION
We ran an SDS page gel on the lysate to confirm expression of griffithsin. The protocol we used for these is in the experiments tag but it is also diagramed below.
The following gel shows the presence of griffithsin.
Figure 1: 12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE. Lanes: NEB 10-200 kDa Ladder Ladder (L), Empty pSmart Vector (EV), Thermostable Griffithsin Monomer (TSm), Thermostable Griffithsin Dimer (TS)
Hydropathicity Considerations
Previous studies in our lab produced the following SDS-PAGE gel confirming that Wildtype-Griffithsin runs at 12 kDa.
Figure 2: From a previous experiment.
However, our SDS-Page gels produced a band at ~35 kDa. We hypothesize that the higher band results from the increased hydrophobicity from the thermostability modifications.  The hydrophobicity significantly impacts the electrophoresis of proteins because the more hydrophobic the protein is, the more SDS binds to it ( http://www.pnas.org/content/106/6/1760.full ). Since SDS is negatively charged, additional binding would significantly reduce the electromagnetic driving force of GRFT, causing it to run higher.
Figure 3: Thermostable Hydrophobicity scores from Expasy
Figure 4: Wild Type Hydrophobicity scores from Expasy
Using the protein modeling software, ExPASy , we made hydropathicity plots from the amino acids sequence for the wild type and the thermostable version. The area beneath the curves is directly related to the average hydrophobicity of each protein:  the Protein GRAVY (grand average of hydropathy) value to quantify and compare the two versions. Positive values are associated with higher relative hydrophobicity.
Comparing the area of the plots, the thermostable variant of GRFT is much more hydrophobic than the wildtype. The wildtype had a protein GRAVY value of -0.240 while the thermostable variant had a value of -0.149. GRAVY values that are more positive are more hydrophobic. The thermostable variant"

Background
Cancer is a widespread problem affects many people from around the world. Pancreatic cancer in particular tends to be detected very late and doesn't offer patients much time after discovery. The circulating exosomes, or extracellular vesicles, secreted by cells in the human serum express many surface proteins, one of which is called Glypican-1 (GPC-1). This protein is expressed in under 10% of exosomes in healthy people, but jumps to 50% in people prone to pancreatic cancer, and that number only rises with increasing susceptibility to tumor formation. Thankfully, the expression GPC-1 increases months before the tumor forms. We hope to target this protein and use it for our project.
Motivations for our Project
Since pancreatic cancer is a problem due to its elusiveness in diagnoses, many people find out they have pancreatic cancer too late and prognoses tend to be very negative. Our team is hoping to change that by offering an alternative method for early detection. Current methods involving the biomarker CA19-9 take a few days and only have 71% sensitivity, so we hoped to find a new biomarker that predicted susceptibility to tumor formation. The biomarker we found was Glypican-1. We wanted to a design a method that would allow us to immediately tell if high amounts of GPC-1 were present and could be administered cheaply, but maintain accuracy, so we decided to use yeast as our chassis, as it could easily be replicated if we designed a system that would be able to detect Glypican-1.
Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer
One of our projects directly aims to provide a method of detecting pancreatic cancer in humans. We are also using yeast in this project as a chassis for expressing Cripto-1, a membrane protein which binds to Glypican-1 (GPC-1). We are designing a construct including Cripto-1 and a secretion tag to ensure that our protein is secreted to the membrane. We plan to use Cripto-"

All six genes used in this project derived from E.coli DH5a and in normal condition, this operon can not start transcript because of inhibition. Therefore, we clone all six genes into plasmids under control of constitutive promoter J23100. In order to make sure that all the genes in the plasmids are expressed, we utilize quantitative PCR to scrutinize the expression level of all six gene in the operon respectively in both BL21(DE3) and DH5a. Although it’s well known that BL21(DE3) is quite suitable for gene expression, we considered that the genes are derived from DH5a and thus it’s necessary to observe the expression level of genes in BL21(DE3) compared with those in DH5a. What’s more, with the aim to promote microbe to absorb leu in medium further, we attempt to clone tRNA-leu, aminoacyl tRNA synthetase and artificially synthesized polyleucine fragment which contain about 30 tandem leucines into overexpression vectors accordingly. Unfortunately, all those vectors are failed to be constructed, except for polyleucine fragment. Nevertheless, as figure A shows, the secondary structure of this gene’s transcript is too complex and are believed can not transcript properly in vivo. Thus, the polyleucine was discarded later in the project. The results of qPCR show that the expression levels of genes are accelerated when the E.coli was introduced into the plasmids, which means all six genes have been overexpressed in the microbe.

Since the polyleucine fragment is artificially synthesized by company and they do not make it completely, we repaired the fragment by adding promoter and RBS via Gibson assembly. The figure shows different condition to amplify the fragment of polyleucine. As mentioned before, there are numerous short repeats in the fragment which can account for why there are ladder like bands in the figure.
In addition, we noted that the expression level of livJ is increased drastically compared with other gene in the operon, which may indicate that the livJ plays a crucial role in metabolism of E.coli, which is consistent"

UMaryland,2016,Team:UMaryland#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the atmospheric conditions associated with landfills. Typically, landfill gas composition is approximately 50% methane and 50% carbon dioxide with trace amounts of oxygen, nitrogen, and several other gases. Due to safety concerns and gas availability, we decided to simulate this landfill gas composition by using 99% nitrogen gas and 1% air. Since the fructose construct does not utilize methane nor carbon dioxide, this gas composition would effectively simulate the almost anaerobic environment of landfills.
For each test, one liter of LB broth was inoculated with 50 mL of starter culture of BL21-DE3 glycerol stock prepared the day before. Samples from the bioreactor were then taken on a regular basis and absorbance at lambda=600nm was taken and normalized to OD600. At OD600=0.6, the conditions within the reactor were changed to match the methanol content, gas composition, and IPTG induction levels outlined in the table below.

Following the variation in the tests, OD600 was measured on a regular basis. Figure 3 shows the optical density over time of the various reactor tests.
Figure 3. Growth Rate in Bioreactor
This data revealed that the fructose construct with IPTG induction grew at a faster rate in methanol than when uninduced. Meanwhile, the data gathered from the landfill simulation showed that the fructose construct was capable of growth, albeit slow growth, under these stressful conditions. In addition to testing growth rates, we also attempted to measure methanol concentration overtime via the use of a biochemistry analyzer kindly loaned to us by YSI. We experienced several inconsistencies on our second use of the machine, despite the reliability of the first run. We deemed our data for methanol concentration unreliable, but have included it in the supplemental data section. The sources of the measurement inconsistencies are unknown, but we hope to troubleshoot this problem or find another method of measuring methanol concentration for the future plans of this project.

Kyoto,2013,Team:Kyoto#Cooperation_-_-_TEXT.html,". Moreover, in addition to these face to face meetings, we connected with other iGEM teams by e-mail or SNS. Such interactions have helped Kyoto and other team's projects as we have showed above. We’ve made sure that we’ll continue to relate with other teams, and deepen our relationship.
International Video Conference
It is important to cooperate not only with domestic teams but also with teams all over the world, because discussing problems with people with different point of views can improve our project. We participated in the video conference sponsored by Purdue, and exchanged opinions about the new standardization of biobricks. We hope these activities will contribute to iGEM.
We cooperated with other iGEM teams in Japan!!
Assistance
Whenever we carry out a study, we need many processes such as experiments and searching reference. iGEM Kyoto communicates with many other teams, and through this activity, we can cooperate with them and learn many things from each other.
iGEM Kyoto had the help of other teams, as Kyoto helped iGEM Biwako_Nagahama. If iGEM teams increase in number and can cooperate mutually, we’ll be able to perform more outstanding researches.
For example, iGEM must get a result in only one year, but when conducting a molecular biology experiment, it takes a long time until we actually start the experiments. This is because concerning the construction of the parts takes time. Therefore, it is desirable for each team to cooperate in such points.
We have been in partnership with Tokyo-tech and NTU-Taiwan. Team NTU-Taiwan helped constructing our parts. We sent 13 parts to them.
And, we had the parts sent by team Tokyo-tech . This is because we couldn’t make usable plasmid from the iGEM DNA Distribution Kit. Therefore, we asked team Tokyo-Tech for usable plasmid, BBa_K193001 , which was registered by them in 2009.
By these partnerships, we can perform more speedy experiments, and this will lead to improving the whole level of iGEM.
Conclusion
In iGEM activities, it is important to add partners, connect with them, and cooperate by helping each other. In short, iGEM is realized on the basis of mutual communication. We succeeded in increasing the number of iGEMers, and to teach iGEM Biwako_Nagahama how to manage their team.  Moreover, we actually met other iGEM teams in iGEM JAPAN, participated in an International video conference, and cooperated with NTU"

ROSE family
ROSE RNATS were found in numerous alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria. All known ROSE elements control the expression of small heat shock genes. ROSE-type structures are composed of two, three or four individual hairpins. The 5ʹ-most hairpins remain stable under heat shock conditions, but the 3ʹ-most hairpin that pairs with the SD sequence is only stable at low temperatures. Temperature-induced local melting in this hairpin exposes the SD sequence, facilitating ribosome binding. The SD region is occluded at 30 °C, partial melting occurs at 37 °C, whereas an increase to 42 °C facilitates the mRNA–ribosome interaction owing to full liberation of the SD and AUG start codon. This type feeds our needs. It may not initiate translation at a certain temperature completely, but the level of expression increase alone with the temperature increasing.
Four U family
Figure 7:the structre of Four U RNATS
Another family of RNATs is a stretch of four uridines that pairs with AGGA in the SD sequence. FourU elements exist in the 5ʹ UTRs of several heat shock and virulence genes. It has two distinct hairpins. The first hairpin is heat stable, however the second hairpin is temperature sensitive, which hide the SD region through the fourU. The formation of the ternary translation initiation complex occurs at high (45 °C) but not at low (30 °C) temperatures.
Synthetic RNA thermometers
Obvious, RNA thermometers provide us superb genetic tools to induce or repress gene expression. However, most natural RNA thermometers are relatively large. They fold into rather complex secondary structures and have been suggested to undergo gradual conformational changes in response to changes in temperature. Therefore, we want to construct smaller and more convenient synthetic RNA thermometers to achieve the goal of hierarchy Heat-resistant regulation. Under the following principle we construct a series of synthetic RNA thermometers.
Stem stability can be influenced by (i) changes in the size and/or GC content of a perfectly matched stem and (ii) introduction of mismatches at different positions.
Figure 8: The structures of Synthetic RNA thermometers simulated using mFold
Based on literature, we know that it’s a practical and effective way to improve E.coli’s heat resistant ability by importing exogenous HSPs into it. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a group of proteins induced by heat shock, the most prominent members of this group are a class of functionally related proteins named"

The normalised energy of CAHS 94205 and SAHS 33020 over concentration shown in Figure 15, shows a similar trend of a steeper slope and therefore better protection of Cas13a for higher TDP concentrations. Furthermore, we could observe in the development of the system’s energy over time, that the energy of SAHS 33020 simulations generally displayed a steeper slope than that of CAHS 94205 simulations for all concentrations except 0.1 g/L. This implies again, that of all TDPs SAHS 33020 is best suited to preserve Cas13a activity upon drying. It also means that SAHS 33020 will likely show better activity preservation at lower concentrations than CAHS 94205.
Figure 15: a) Normalised energy of the system against the number of iterations per chain for simulations with concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 g/L for a) CAHS 94205 and b) SAHS 33020 at 800 moves per chain and in a volume fraction of 0.1.
While we cannot give recommendations for higher concentrations, it appears that a concentration of at least 1 g/L of either CAHS 94205 or SAHS 33020 is advisable for drying Cas13a. However, SAHS 33020 seems overall best suited for drying Cas13a and may even confer enough desiccation tolerance to Cas13a at lower concentrations. This is important to keep undesired side effects, such as the activation of Cas13a through TDPs as observed in the experiments, at a minimum.

Visit to USTC iGEM 2012 Team
From July 8th, 2012 to July 15th, 2012, our team member Thumbelina attended the Summer Camp of Chemistry in University of Science and Technology of China known as USTC for short, and had a communication with 2012 USTC-iGEM team members. After receiving the message that she had a chance to join the summer school of USTC, Thumbelina began to make preparations for meeting with 2012 USTC-iGEM team. Finally fortunately, she had a contact with the team leader Wuyang Chen via making calls, sending messages and Internet, and they confirmed July 15th, 2012 as the day Thumbelina would be invited to the wet laboratory in USTC.
   
It is well-known that USTC-iGEM team plays a significant role in the world of synthetic biology, so the aim of communicating with them is learning from their strong points to offset our weakness. After contacting through technical skills mentioned above, Thumbelina gained some basic knowledge of the project designed by USTC such as the information of their task, constitution of their team that most of them are sophomores, their process and so on. At last the arranged day came; Thumbelina was guided by Wuyang Chen to pay a visit to the laboratory. 2012 USTC-iGEM team owns a large professional lab and they can take advantage of it well. When Thumbelina entered the lab that morning, there were already many members focusing on the experiment. Thumbelina made a deeply dialogue with the captain of 2012 USTC-iGEM team, and it contained a large amount of topics such as the problems they met and disadvantages of their task and future plans. They spent a meaningful day together and extent their outlooks. Finally Thumbelina took a picture with several members of 2012 USTC-iGEM team and shared a lunch together.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," enzyme kinetics have been built in Mathmeatica for the study of beta-galactosidase, luciferase and horseradish peroxidase. By using the built-in function Manipulate, we can inspect the impact of substrate/enzyme concentration on the time course of the product of interest. In special cases, such as one model for horseradish peroxidase, even temperature can be varied as well.
It was noticed that some models predicts negative concentrations of enzyme intermediate even though the governing equations were correct. We believe this was due to the stiffness of the system, for some reactions occurs 7 magnitudes faster than others. When using a different technique, say stiffness switching, the simulation takes very long time while progresses little, reaching maximum iteration step sets as 10^6. Fortunately the negative concentrations predicted were only of magnitude of 10^(-30) micro molar, such that it doesn't the result much. To fix the issue completely, however, may take more time by simplifying the governing equations.
Currently luciferase was modelled in luminescence output while beta-galactosidase and horseradish peroxidase was modelled in color metric output. To make a proper comparison we wish to model the luminescence of horseradish peroxidase too. Even though the unit of measurement of luminescence and color metric output were in arbitrary units, we wish to obtain good insights in the shape of their response curve to select the one best suited for our needs.
Week 8: June 17 - June 21
While working on a model of chemiluminescence of horseradish peroxidase, mass balance applied to the reaction scheme resulted in a system of differential algebraic equations (DAEs). That is, in addition to differential equations governing the rate of change, because of the chemical equilibrium between species, algebraic equations constraining the relation between them are also included. Mathematica complained about the system being over determined even if no initial condition was given. In fact the form this DAEs has is not solvable by Mathematica.
The workaround for this problem I have found was to reduce everything to the fundamentals. So instead of equilibrium expressed as system of algebraic relations, I broke them into two reactions with rate constants large enough to be fast while at the same time obeys the proportionality required by the equilibrium constant.
Maya 2012 couldn't open the Ferritin file created in Maya 2014. So I switched to Maya 2014 and now everything worked fine.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book [1] . It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text [2] . It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of ""de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.."", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

As was discussed in Promoter characterization part, MerR protein, in the form of homodimer, binds to a dyad sequence between the -10 element and -35 region of element PmerT. The binding, however, is independent of the presence of Hg (II). When the apo-MerR dimer binds to the dyad symmetrical operator DNA between the -35 and – 10 elements of mercury inducible promoter, PmerT, which has an unusually long spacer of 19 bp, the contact of RNA polymerase is sloppy. When Hg (II) is available in the environment, ions bind to the interface of MerR dimer. The Hg-bound MerR dimer can result in a structural distortion of PmerT, allowing the RNA polymerase tight contacts to be made, leading to the expression of down-stream genes (Fig.1).

Our overall project can be broken down into four sub-projects. These are characterized as the following: Mycelium Material & Habitat Development, Mycelium Glue Project, Mycelium Filter Project, and finally the Mission Architecture that ties everything together. Below are the Results corresponding to each subproject.
To view the methods and experiments that correspond to the following results, please see our Experiments page linked here.
Mycelium Material & Habitat Development
Substrate Tests
The results of our substrate tests indicate that the mycelium can grow on any organic material––even Martian regolith mixed with supplemental nutrients. We did find, however that there were factors that impacted the success of mycelium colonization. First the moisture level greatly impacted how quickly the mycelium could grow and whether it entered a dormant state or not(entering it if the material is too dry). Second the particle size also impacted colonization rate; with particles that were too fine or too large being harder to colonize than particles of a medium size.This information was important to formulating our mission architecture;helping us to determine what could be used as a substrate on Mars and how coarse or fine the particles of the substrate would need to be.
Temperature Tests
Based off the results of our temperature test (see the tables 1 and 2 and graphs 1 and 2 below), we concluded that the optimal growth temperature (based on the temperature settings available to us) was 30°C and that the dikaryon variant grew faster than the monokaryon variant. After linearizing the raw data (see graphs 3 and 4) we found that the dikaryon grew at approximately 7.7 cm2 per day at 30°C while it only grew 7 cm2 per day at 24°C. The monokaryon grew at approximately 5.6 cm2 per day at 30°C while it only grew 4.2 cm2 per day at 24°C. Our results also allowed us to conclude that at temperatures close to 4°C and 37°C growth is limited,"

Furthermore, Dr. Wagner emphasized the  Commission wanted to “leave the longest legs possible” and were satisfied with the  timeless nature of the final recommendations. He firmly believes that the  recommendations still hold and provide a good compromise between allowing scientific  advancement and minimizing risk.
In regards to biocontainment, the New Directions report only mentions suitable  containment methods should be used on synthetic biology materials to prevent  unintended consequences to the environment. When asked why the Commission did not  recommend a specific biocontainment method for researchers to use, Dr. Wagner  expressed that a recommendation of that nature was beyond the scope of the  Commission and needed scientific expert decision. It was also premature to select a  biocontainment method when all of the existing methods exhibited rates of failure.  Consequently, the Commission simply recommended a review be conducted to identify  suitable containment methods for synthetic biology materials. However, to the best of his  knowledge, Dr. Wagner does not believe the reviews were conducted after New  Directions was issued.
Our conversation with Dr. Wagner allowed us to gain a more comprehensive  understanding of the broad role of the Presidential Commission as setting the framework  for progress. However, this discussion also exposed the lack of regulatory policy  pertaining to synthetic biology and biocontainment. Additionally, it was also brought to  our attention that much of the information on biocontainment was inaccessible and not  comprehensive. In response to both of these concerns, we utilized existing data from  research papers to create a side-by- side comparison of different characteristics, such as  effectiveness and ease of use, of current biocontainment methods. This conversation, in  conjuction with others, inspired our team to create the policy proposal . Additionally, Dr.  Wagner suggested we rebrand our project as an advancement of potential applications  of synthetic biology rather than the prevention of consequences. Since then, we have  determined many areas where the barrier to implementation of synthetic biology  technology can be overcome with our biocontainment device. Additionally, we have used  this advice to modify the language we used in the discussion of our project on this Wiki  and other materials generated.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Project#Cadmium_-_-_TEXT.html," The significance of the blood-brain barrier and cadmium neurotoxicity are confirmed in rat experiments, where infant rats suffer a larger degree of cadmium toxicity than do adult rats. The adult rats would have had more time for their blood-brain barriers to become established in comparison to newborn rats (Wong and Klaassen., 1982).
It has been reported that cadmium can provoke neuronal cells in the brain to undergo oxidative stress – the mechanism behind this is cadmium’s ability to encourage the production of reactive oxygen species when it interacts with the mitochondria (L´opez et al., 2006).
Cadmium can also affect the action of neurotransmitters. In studies, it has been shown to create an increase in concentration of inhibitory neurotransmitters (in particular GABA and Glycine) and create a decrease in the concentrations of excitatory neurotransmitters (in particular glutamate and aspartate) (Minami et al., 2001).

Transposition of miniTn7BB-Gm in E. coli
In order to demonstrate miniTn7BB-Gm transposition into the E. coli DH5α chromosome, pUC18R6KT-miniTn7BB-Gm was transferred to this host by co-transformation with the helper plasmid pTNS2 of chemically competent cells [pTNS2 is not replicative in DH5α, as it harbors a R6K replication origin, but transiently produces the Tn7 transposition machinery ( Choi et al. (2005) )]. E. coli clones bearing miniTn7BB-Gm insertions were selected on LB plates supplemented with Gm. Viable counts were also performed, and plasmid transformation efficiency was determined using the gentamycin resistant replicative plasmid pBBR1mcs-5. The results are summarized in Table 2.

The results indicate that the gentamycin-resistant marker was acquired by the transformed E. coli DH5α cells, strongly suggesting that the transposon can be tranferred to an enterobacterial host by means of transformation of chemically competent cells. The efficiency with which transposon insertion candidates was obtained was somewhat (6-fold) higher than that obtained with P. putida, despite the fact that competence was clearly (6-fold) lower in the E. coli strain. This suggests that transformation is likely a better suited method for transposon delivery in E. coli than in P. putida.
Site-specificity of the miniTn7-Gm insertions obtained in E. coli DH5α was determined by PCR amplification as described above for P. putida. 11 out of 12 candidates tested in this fashion displayed the expected 164 bp band (data not shown),"

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," ‘normal’ concentration, and an upper limit of 1.5 times their ‘normal’ concentration. Four types of surface response designs were constructed and compared (Figure 6 - see our modelling page for more information). Ultimately the central composite design – orthogonal was chosen. The list of experiments determined by this design are shown in Table 3.
Table 3: Table of reactions performed according to the DoE salt supplement surface response design. CFPS reactions contained concentrations of magnesium glutamate, potassium glutamate, and sodium oxalate, according to the table above. The pattern column shows how much of each supplement was present in a reaction; very low concentration (a), low concentration (−), usual concentration (0), high concentration (+), and very high concentration (A).
Experimental Procedure 2
Cell extracts were prepared and CFPS reactions performed as before, except the magnesium glutamate, potassium glutamate, and sodium oxalate concentrations were according to the surface response experimental design. Ammonium acetate was kept at the default amount. CFPS activity was measured as fluorescence at each time point minus fluorescence at 15 mins (Figure 7). Endpoint data was then used, along with the JMP software, to build a model predicting optimal concentrations for the three salts analysed (predictions visualised in figure 8). These predictions were then tested by preparing a supplement solution premix with amounts of magnesium glutamate, potassium glutamate, and sodium oxalate at concentrations of 6 mM, 195 mM, and 2 mM respectively. This supplement solution premix was used to supplement two batches of cell extract which were prepared identically. The first batch was the same extract used to collect data on which the predictions were made, whereas the second batch was newly prepared. It was found that for the first extract, CFPS activity was enhanced when the premix containing ‘optimised’ concentrations of salts was used compared to the un-altered supplement solution premix (Figure 9a). Additionally, CFPS activity was observed as being within the confidence intervals predicted by the DoE model. When CFPS reactions were performed using the second extract and the new premix, CFPS activity was lower compared to reactions using the second extract and the original premix (Figure 9b). This supports the view that each extract requires separate optimisation of the supplement solution premix to reach optimal CFPS activity, and that a DoE approach is suitable for achieving this.
Figure 7: CFPS activity of CFPS reactions with salt concentrations according to the surface response design (Table 3) was determined as fluorescence intensity at each time point minus"

ITB_Indonesia,2014,Team:ITB Indonesia#Data_-_-_TEXT.html," cell surface may affect folding of protein and also their biological function (Park,2010). These suggest us to look futher detail on folding and displaying state of LC cutinase.
There are several things that should be noted when we designate fusion strategy of passanger protein or protein of interest with the outer membrane of protein. Linking the different passanger proteins to the  same outer membrane protein may result in different translocation. The characteristic of passanger protein affects the translocation. Its characteristic such as formation of disulfide bridge, total residue of hydrophobic aminoacid etc.
So there are four requirements have to be met for constructing well designed surface display. First is, it has to possesses efficient signal peptide. Second, it should have strong anchor to keep the fusion protein from detachment. Third, it should be compatible to the sequence that is inserted or fused. The last is it should resisstant to the attack of the protease from medium or periplasmic membrane.

Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," Aye, a notable researcher in the area of redox targeting for medical application in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell University. Professor Aye was excited about our use of the redox sensitive fluorescent protein. She affirmed the novelty of our idea to couple this fusion protein to graded response against ROS, and acknowledged that it would pave the way to creating more robust biological circuits in cells by being able to control damage caused by oxidative stress.  Professor Aye also commented on potential obstacles that we might encounter, and pushed us to think about the number of parts our plan would require. Her insight and support led us to understand how our ROS-regulating biocircuit could be used as a tool in further synthetic biology advances. Additionally, we identified a need for heightened protection against ROS, which was taken into consideration when designing and assembling the biobricks we decided upon.

Dr. Greg Martin
To transition from the lab to the greenhouse, we talked to Dr. Greg Martin of Plant Pathology and Plant Microbe Biology to better understand ROS in plants. Professor Martin researches the effect of ROS and disease in plants. With respect to oxidative species, Martin stressed the importance of ROS in the first and secondary lines of immune defense in plants. We learned that we needed to carefully control how much native ROS we quench in the plant, as quenching too much could make them more susceptible to disease. This idea was integrated into the biological circuit we developed. Instead of only lowering ROS levels, by having antioxidant product coupled to a light sensitive promoter we could also turn expression off to maintain a minimum level of oxidative stress.

Dr. Maria Harrison
As we learned more about ROS in plants, we also wanted to learn more about how microbes interacted with plants. We reached out to Dr. Maria Harrison, an adjunct professor in the School of Integrative Plant Science, conducting research on the mechanisms underlying symbiosis between plants and fungal symbionts. By understanding how fungi interacted with plants, we were hoping to understand how E. coli might interact with our plants. We learned that there would be a big hurdle to having our E. coli survive with the plants: E. coli were optimized for the gut, while fungi have co-evolved with plants. This fed into the design decision to have our E. coli contained within dialysis tubing and put close proximity to the plants rather than in direct contact with them.

Prof. Eivind Almaas - Systems- and network biology
During the last few years, network approaches have shown great promise as new tools to analyze and understand complex systems. In biology, network formulations of a system naturally appear in situations ranging from food webs in ecology to biochemical interactions in molecular biology. In particular in the cell, the variety of interactions between genes, proteins and metabolites are well captured by a complex network description. My research is focused on developing both general and specific methods to understand the principles behind the design and organization of biological systems.
There is close connection between systems and synthetic biology, and the iGEM competition is a natural arena to explore this tight relationship.

Washington,2016,Team:Washington#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," to it, the inducer changes the conformation of the repressor, making it detach from the DNA. In this way, inducible promoters “turn on” by “taking the plug off” the DNA.
The relationship between inducer concentration and metabolite production depends on inducer binding mechanisms to the repressor. These mechanisms have experimentally proven formulas to determine the binding rate, and thus can determine the relationship between inducer concentration and metabolite concentration. But, mutations in the binding region or the DNA making associated proteins can change the associated energies and kinematics of the binding process, making these theoretical models imprecise. Machine learning can overcome this issue by identifying the patterns that make up this relationship through repetition, which our automated system would be able to do once fully implemented. Since each specific experiment would have different mutations and issues, machine learning can figure out the relationship between inducer input concentration and the resulting metabolite product concentration.
Colorimetry: Determining P ⇔ [RGB]
The second relationship can be determined through applied colorimetry.
The solution has an average RGB value. The camera takes a picture in fast succession with the solution illuminated with one of each RGB color. This will generate three graphs that can determine the intensity and purity of the solution. These graphs would be composited to make a big range of colors, which would be compared with control standard curves mapping each pure color at different concentrations.
Assuming that each color truly only maps to one specific RGB combination, this would give us the percentages of each metabolite color in the solution. Since we know the average amount of yeast we have in our solution, we can generate concentrations of each metabolite.
Culture Management
As explained on the Hardware page, we can control the growth rate of the yeast culture in our culture management setup, effectively keeping the density of cells to a controlled level. Thus, we can dilute our culture to prevent oversaturation of colors in the solution. With this setup, we can input inducers into the culture automatically.
Moreover, with the information obtained through image processing, we can automatically create the product levels we need by inputting inducers as needed.

AmilCP blue chromoprotein has been cloned under IPTG inducible lac promoter and RBS. Induction of E. coli carrying K2320001 with IPTG leads to intracellular production of blue colored amilCP protein. Other teams can clone their gene of interest along with a RBS of their choice downstream of this IPTG inducible reporter. Induction with IPTG will give a real-time crude estimation of expression of their protein of interest. In addition, this construct will give an added advantage to tune the expression of their protein of interest by varying amount of IPTG or glucose.

MOPO Run
Staying in the lab all day long, only talking about the project and sometimes being very exhausted and frustrated brought up the idea of taking part in a sportive public event. We put up a team of five members of the team to take part at the relay race run. The rest of the team came along to cheer for each runner. In total our team finished the 25 km run in 2:09 hours. For us it was a great opportunity to get the whole team together, bond with each other and connect with the public.

By using the Tristable Switch, the chemical which has the highest concentration out of three different target substances can be detected. When used as the tree biosensor, the switch will be used to detect tree wounds as well as two different kinds of fungi which live on the roots of trees. After detecting the presence of a fungus or a wound, the device will release chemicals that can either kill the parasite or heal the tree wounds. We plan to use Liana plants as a potential host for easier delivery of the device to the trees. We hope that this biosensor design would be able to help the Hong Kong Government in reducing accidents caused by falling trees. In the future, the circuit can  also be used to detect pests in plants grown in commercial farms.
The product is in the form of genetically engineered Liana plant. It will be planted near the target tree, enabling it to grow and climb up the tree without much care needed.
Normal Liana leaves are green-colored. However, when a wound is detected, the Liana sap close to it will turn orange.
When there is a presence of brown rot fungi, the sap turns red.
When the tree has white rot, the sap turns blue.
Liana will be removed if it covers most of the surface area of the tree leaves.
Opportunities
POLITICAL
Governmental support is likely as Hong Kong is increasing its investments in the Biotechnology sector.
ECONOMICAL
The parts are reusable, hence reducing the average cost.
Parts are interchangeable. A library can be set for multiple biosensor types.
Protection of public property and human life through prevention of trees located in public areas from falling.
Reduce the cost of maintenance and human resources needed to monitor tree-related accidents.
Reduce fungicide usage. Regular spray is not needed - only sprayed when sensor detects the presence of fungi.
TECHNOLOGICAL
The existence of HK Science Park as an equipment and research hub for biotechnology.
Tailor-made sensors for consumer as the parts can be changed to detect other types of fungi and wounds.
ENVIRONMENTAL
Protect old and valuable trees as heritage.
Reduction of fungicide use:
Promoting biodiversity.
Maintaining natural biological equilibrium.
Prevent contamination of other non-target areas.
Challenges
LEGAL
Environmental safety protocols that regulate the release of biotechnology devices into nature are mostly against constructs made through synthetic biology.
Must seek approval from Convention of Biological Diversity in order to proceed with product development (UNEP, 2012).
Tighter supervision and higher standards will be given by the Innovation and Technology Bureau"

OVERVIEW
Synthetic biology has the potential to have a huge impact on the world, in everything from medicine to food production to energy. With this great power comes great responsibility. We explored the societal implications of our project with industry professionals and the local community. Through conferences, programs, and workshops, we remembered each and every one of the conversations we had - and used it to shape our project.
LEARNING SO WE CAN HELP OTHERS LEARN
We believe that the most effective scientific communication stems from effective and engaging communication. That is why, before starting our community engagement work, we dedicated time to going to workshops and reflecting on our past work to improve our own skillset.
4H and Center for Teaching Excellence Facilitation Training
4H Cooperative Extension is a network of over 100 public universities that provide experiences and activities for youth. The organization hosts a career explorations conference annually for high school and middle students, aiming to introduce them to the wide variety of different STEM fields. Cornell iGEM hosted a class in this program about the intersection of science and business, which is described further before. Through our participation, we were able to actively improve and consider the styles, methods, and techniques we use to communicate science.
In preparation for this event, 4H partnered with the Cornell Center for Teaching Excellence to provide effective training on how to convey and teach topics interactively with a high level of engagement. Our proposed lesson plans were modeled and tested in workshops, and we learned how to develop programs that would not only capture the attention of our participants, but also lead to measurable learning outcomes.
Inspired by the workshop, we decided that we should integrate Bloom’s Taxonomy"

Viability Assay with Azurin
This year’s iGEM team from ETH Zurich is working on a tumor microenvironment based approach to fight cancer as well. Their approach is responding to the lactate secreted by tumor cells and should result in the secretion of azurin by E. coli. Azurin has the ability to induce apoptosis by binding to p53 which results in intracellular accumulation of p53 and BAX. Elevated levels of p53 and BAX lead to the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol which initiates the caspase cascade process resulting in apoptosis (Punj et al., 2004).
In order to show the cytotoxic effect of azurin on tumor cells we, the iGEM team Freiburg, performed a killing curve experiment with azurin and HEK293T cells . A fixed amount of HEK cells were seeded into 12-well plates, with one plate for every counting day. Four different conditions were applied in this experiment, no azurin treatment (negative control), 1 µg/ml azurin, 10 µg/ml and 100 µg/ml azurin. Since azurin is not stable at 37°C, 2 % of glycerol was added to the medium for stabilization. Every second day, the medium was changed without washing the cells.

Heidelberg Collaboration
Figure 1 shows the results of the killing experiment. After 8 days, the untreated cells show constant viability of around 80 %, while azurin treated cells show decreased viability. For 1 µg/ml and 10 µg/ml azurin in medium, the cells show a loss of viability of more than 50 %. The highest azurin concentration (100 µg/ml) has a stronger killing effect on HEK cells. Hereby, viability goes down to 18 %, which indicates a"

Figure 2: SBOL Visual of the Evry Paris-Saclay Psicose Biosensor as the Detector Unit
We did this to show that working biosensors could be integrated into our system, as the only engineering step is the design a new detector each time. We also designed an adapter module to show how we can integrate other substrates into our system. Our chosen substrate was Glyphosate, a herbicide, which has no known binding sequence; we identified the C-P Lyase pathway in E. coli that breaks down Glyphosate to Sarcosine to Formaldehyde, which has a known biosensor.
Figure 3: Biochemical pathway of the degradation of glyphosate to glycine and formaldehyde.
One disruption would be any sensor that detected quorum sensing molecules as our system uses these molecules as biological ‘wires’ and so we couldn’t adapt this system be used to sense them.
Impact of our design solution for the wider world
We hope our approach will lead to the more rapid, cost-effective and efficient development of a new kind of multicellular biosensor that will ultimately impact on human health, the environment and industrial processes to name but few. The lifecycle of the product would further benefit biosensors as it would identify new problems, maybe not addressed by this current version that could be solved in the future. Our lives would undoubtedly benefit from biosensors involved in diagnostics such as and the environment through biosensors such as the arsenic biosensor, which can detect arsenic contamination in water, helping save wildlife as well as human life. The use of this system and the commitment to solving the problems it identified can lead to a new era of biosensors which can be used to aid all."

Why we should be chosen as the Best Education and Public Engagement?
The idea of why their project is important and how it should be executed should be developed and answered by teams’ Human Practices activities.
• When engaging stakeholders the teams should demonstrate a two-way dialogue was established throughout the design, execution, and presentation of their project
• Teams should not “proselytize” or “market” iGEM and synthetic biology by telling the community that iGEM is great and will “save the world”.
• Teams should document their work in a way that others could build upon and reference any prior work that informed their approach.
Diphtheria outbreak was being a tragic extraordinary event in developing country, especially Indonesia. It happened comprehensively to whole places and society levels. This condition desperately needs to be tackled. Through human practice, UI IGEM Team is considering how we can educate, reach, and engage the society not for them to know about our project but more than that, to make the society knows that they have a new hope to conquer this diphtheria problem (Point 2).
We have reached from grass-root to top level of the society. Through some studies and discussions such as: biosafety study, ethic study, and health expert study, we reached the expert and the society top level perspective and attention about this issue. We also reached the public opinion and raising their awareness by some projects like A Day with Diphteria, Community Visit, and also Public Discussion Forum (in collaboration with NTU Singapore IGEM Team). Even, we reached the grass-root level by holding a social work for people of Cikidang Village that located in the top of a mountain. Here in the social work, we are not only educate the society and raise their awareness but we also asking their opinion and point of view about diphtheria and our project . In this event we also involve more people by training them to educate the villagers about health. Considering about the attitude and the culture within the society of Cikidang Village, we held this education and public engagement event by coming door to door. In addition, cooperating with the Engineering Faculty of Universitas Indonesia, we build some sanitation facilities and some other supporting features to make our intervention sustainable. (Point 1)
Although this diphtheria issue only happens lately in Indonesia, but this is such a special issue in developing countries. Thus, our human practice can be implemented or being referred for any others developing countries.  (Point"

Also, there exists the detection of tumor markers for tumor detection. No matter tumor marker is tumor-specific or tumor-associated, the relationship between tumor marker and tumor's appearance is confusing, complex and indirect. Specifically, more than 500 tumor markers has been screened, the degree of correlation between tumor and marker can't be determined and we can only show that there is a possibility of suffering from cancer after detecting the markers. Nevertheless, multiple markers detection can improve the accuracy of tumor detection.
What's more, the female oncologist assessed our project about the possibility and feasibility). She admitted that hydrophobin our project uses is able to better maker detection sensitivity and she ensured that the method can be applied to track the changes about concentration of some known tumor markers as an innovation, aiming at detecting whether patients are experiencing some of relapse warning signs and taking appropriate measures during early relapsing stage timely. Meanwhile, when using a small dose of serum samples to complete detection, it is easy to collect samples and alleviate patients' pain safely (feasibility assessment). In other words, it's demonstrated to a safe detection method for patients and an efficient and sensible means for doctors (risk assessment). It's believed that our idea will be put into practice one day when we heard about the news that a Stanford sophomore named Theranos has developed novel approaches for laboratory diagnostic tests using blood. Her company's blood-testing platform uses a few drops of blood obtained via a finger-stick rather than vials of blood obtained via traditional venipuncture, and utilizes microfluidics technology whose timeliness and high sensitivity is similar to our idea in some degree. Finally, we interviewed a few nurses in division of oncology, and we were impressive about the feeling they described, ""Every day is both horrible and precious"".
The visit to General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University plays a crucial role in our human practice, and we are indebted to them all for their timely help. They shared current information about tumor marker detection with us, whilst advising us on some aspects of our project, especially the design of our final product and its implementation.

Munich,2018,Team:Munich#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," bases leading to an early stop codon.          More sophisticated polishing steps or higher quality Illumina sequencing reads could possibly avoid this.
Using the embl flat file format we visualized the phage genomes in a circular genome diagram plot.
3S
FFP
NES
Here we must note several things. For the 3S genome, we can see that at certain positions we see a high          decrease in the coverage (at 58kbp, 72kbp and 110kbp). At these positions no reads align to the reference genome.          Since this realignment was performed using graphmap , while the inital assembly pipeline uses minimap2 internally,          this could also be an alignment artifact.
For the NES genome we can see a similar behaviour at 330kbp. Additionally we can see two spikes at the ends of          the genome. Finally the FFP genome again has the same problems as the NES genome ends.
Conclusion
Sequ-into has been shown to be able to allow rapid genome assembly from a Nanopore sequencing sample such          as encountered in Phactory manufacturing experiments. We use state-of-the-art 3rd generation sequencing          data analysis tools within our framework to overcome difficulties frequently experienced by scientists in          Nanopore applications. In result, we not only introduce our step by step evolved results of the analysis,          assembly and finally annotation of the bacteriophage genomes but also make clear how to deal with Nanopore          sequencing data already widely used in synthetic biology and rising. Furthermore our custom phage genome of          the bacteriophage 3S allows further analysis and usage in the manufacturing cycle, for example, a fast          contamination detection using sequ-into.

NTU-Singapore,2009,Team:NTU-Singapore#HPA#Interview_-_-_TEXT.html,". If DIY Bio becomes more mainstream, is it not harder to control/contain lab experiments gone wrong? How can we alleviate this situation?
Tito : Community labs -- encouraging DIYbiologists to work in public spaces where they are supported by funding/education/proper facilities.
Q. Do you think the DIYBio community or anyone who wishes to carry out biological experiments outside of the usual venues, should be regulated, or guided/supervised in any way?
Tito : I think the same rules should apply that apply to academic labs.
Q. The DIYBio community is growing, definitely. Should it remain a obscure and cult hobby for real enthusiasts, or more mainstream [which will likely increase the possibility of bio-errors]?
Tito : It should definitely be a community that engages many different groups, focused on increasing public knowledge.
Q. Do you think DIY bio can contribute significantly to biotechnological advancements or will it remain a hobbyist pursuit?
Jason : [I think it will] contribute significantly to biotechnological advancement in the long-term.  Although I do think the hobbyist pursuit has value, particularly from an educational point of view.
Special Thanks
We would like to thank Tito for patiently answering all our questions! It was eye-opening, to see a DIYbiologist's views and motivations. We feel empathetic now, towards pursuing or supporting DIYbio with the same responsible and collected mindset as Tito.
Thanks Tito! We really appreciate your input.
Special thanks also, to Jason Bobe, for taking time out to do our survey. To hear from the founder himself is definitely a serious boost to the credibility of DIYbio in this discussion.

So if we try to do this project it will be just doing another version of something already done.
We could use two cell types, one that produces the signal and another which is responsible for degrading it, but working under induction, which are activated when the motile bacteria reach any of the poles. Something like flageline receptors or any membrane protein of the motile bacteria.
Using an E.coli attractor-> we could use the Rice University biobrick [iGem 2006-seek and destroy e. - coli]. Where B. subtilis produces a pheromone that serves as E.coli attractor, which use a chimeric receptor that recognizes the pheromone and the intramembranal MCP domain inducing the chemotaxis route. When it finds a B. subtilis, it expresses GFP or kills B. subtilis.
By quorum sensing and a signal degrader that is not disseminated.
Using AHL, LuxR and degradation AHL; playing with  thresholds and proteins lifes. Using the Imperial College oscillator model, but in the same cell.
Using efflux pumps. How complex are they?
Few genes (~ 3).
Finding one that expresses something that can be interpreted as a sign.
Tetracycline pumps
We have a  Tetracycline-sensitive promoter in bioparts (R0040)- it is constitutively produced and is suppressed by the presence of tetracycline.
Papers:Ramos et al, 2005: Big Review of tetR .
We use tetR as a repressor of a tetA, which exports tetR into the medium. Playing with thresholds and the lifetime of the repressor of tetA we could manage cell populations to oscillate in order to launch signals from one side to another.
Singing Bacteria Research
Possibilities:
Cl Channels (bop / hop), activated by light. Measured  with electrodes. We need halotolerant bacteria.
Efflux tetracycline Pumps. Same, measured with electrodes. You can use E. coli. We do not know how significative will the fluctuations be.
Notes:
Halobacterium salinarum NRC1 and R1 have the two genes: hop (825bp) and bop (789pb)
Modified it replicates in about an hour, the WT in about 12hrs(NRC1)
Small genes (>3Kb)
We could use Halorodops"

Ionis_Paris,2016,Team:Ionis Paris#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,", and pollutant transformation must be considered. [2]
Our team decided to focus on VOCs for several reasons. VOCs are organic chemicals with a high vapor pressure (0.01kPA) at room temperature (293.15K = 20°C). Their high vapor pressure results from a low boiling point, which causes large numbers of molecules to evaporate from the liquid or sublimate from the solid form of the compound and enter the ambient air, a trait known as volatility. [1] [6] Over the past ten years the average toluene concentration in the periphery of Paris was 6.1 µg/m3 with a maximum of 24 µg/m3 in traffic area. [2]
These primary pollutants originate from fuel evaporation, car traffic, industrial processes, heating systems in residential areas, domestic use of solvents and also from vegetation. They have a role in secondary particle and ozone formation [1] [6].
Although air pollution contains only 2% VOCs (see figure 1) [2], the impact of those pollutants on health and environment is major. These pollutants are persistent in the environment, they bio-accumulate in living tissues and are able spread over long distances. Although their effect on human health are only partially known, scientists have demonstrated their systemic effects (hepatic, hematologic, immunologic), their toxicity on the reproductive systems, their genetic toxicity. VOCs are known to be carcinogenic.
Figure 1: Repartition of atmospheric pollutant in Paris area according to airparif [2]. Most important pollutants are carbone oxide and dioxide (85%). VOC represent 2% of the total atmospheric pollutant. [2]
To protect populations and the environment against harmful pollutants, regulations were defined and air quality is supervised according to European directives [1]. At the European level, the 2008/50/CE directive of May 21st 2008 , specifies air quality standards in Europe. This text was transposed into French law by decree n°2010-1250 of October 21st 2010 on air quality.  Specific directives are applied to VOCs, such as the european directve n° 2015/1480 modified the 28th of August 2015, concerning VOC emission from fuel storage and fuel distribution in gas stations.
Even if pollutant concentrations are getting lower, their final concentrations do not respect the threshold of 5 μg/m3 defined by the law. The objective to reach for the annual mean concentration is 2 μg/m3.

Discussion
After we obtained initial results with IPTG induction, we began inserting the contaminant promoters in place of the T7 promoter and the lac operator. We began testing induction of these promoters in 96 well plates because we could run more strains compared to testing current in bioreactors. Initially, we could not induce GFP expression with just the contaminants. We then tested to see if the strains were could still be induced by IPTG. This would tell us if our confirmed sequencing results for the contaminant promoter in the place of the T7 promoter and lac operator was actually correct. We found that we could induce the new strains with IPTG. Still not satisfied, we induced with IPTG then the contaminant by suggestion of Dr. Michaela TerAvest to test for a possible two stage inducible system (""And-Gate"" system). We obtained GFP induction with this system of induction so we developed a step-wise overview to explain the success of our project. We unfortunately ran out of time and potentiostat space to test contaminant induction with current.
Step-wise Overview of lac operon and reasoning for ""And-Gate"" System
1. PlacIQ promoter is always on (constitutive promoter)
2. This causes transcription of LacI gene
3. This causes translation and therefore the lac repressor to be made
4. The repressor then binds to the lac operator which inhibits the RNA polymerase bound at the T7 promoter from transcribing a gene
5. IPTG binds to the repressor and removes it thus allowing the RNA polymerase to transcribe
6. We cut out the T7 promoter and the known lac operator thus allowing for insertion of our promoter to detect contaminants
7. We accomplished that successfully with sequencing confirming that only the contaminant promoter is currently there
8. Yet, we see inducible current production and GFP expression by IPTG with these new strains
9. Therefore, a cryptic operator must exist on the plasmid that causes regulation of our contaminant promoter
10. We must add IPTG to remove the repressor before adding the contaminant thus displaying a possible two-stage inducible system (""And-Gate"") )(1,2,3)
11. Typically, these systems are designed intentionally but ours appears to be incidental due to the cryptic operator (1,2,3)

Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Extras#Brainstorming_-_-_TEXT.html," nematodes by secreting volatile organic compounds and is then ingested by the worms. When it adapts to the intestine, it secretes proteases to kill the nematode.
This principle could be applied to an engineered bacteria that secretes a compound to attract PPNs (it would have to attract only PPNs, because there are a lot of good nematodes in soil) and once ingested kill the nematodes by RNAi knockout of the parasitic genes or genes involved in reproduction. A problem with this is that PPNs eat plants, not bacteria.
Newly hatched larvae have to migrate through the soil efficiently to locate plants because they have limited nutrient resources. IAA (the main type of auxin) and other indole compound gradients have been shown to attract PPNs, allowing plant infection. As long as the RNAi target is specific to PPNs, attraction of the PPNs does not have to be as specific.
Successful RNAi PPN targets in GM crops are a gene encoding a splicing factor and a gene encoding an integrase to target the root knot nematode M incognita. Most of the genes expressed in the esophageal gland cells (generate molecules secreted into the plant through the stylet) of PPNs encode proteins secreted into the host root (include cell wall modifying enzymes, regulators of host cell cycle & metabolism, suppressors of host defence, and mimics of plant molecules)
Problem: Can we get relatively specific chemo-attraction of PPNs? How do we introduce RNAi into the nematodes? How do we contain the GM bacteria in a field and will PPNs be able to migrate effectively to these contained areas?
Lymphatic filariasis
Second leading cause of longterm disability worldwide (as a result of lymphedema, elephantiasis, hydrocele and periodic fevers), is caused by mosquito-transmitted filarial worms, including Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi, which colonize the lymphatic system. Drug treatments are fairly effective at killing larval stages but don’t provide much benefit to infected hosts
Research is being done to determine important genes in the nematodes via RNAi.
How could we target this nematode to prevent mosquito infection and subsequent human infection?
Termites
Termites are known for their ability to digest nutritionally poor food sources such as lignocellulose. A recent paper has studied the synergistic properties of cellulases from Reticulitermes flavipes. Three enzymes were studied, two"

Finally, we are taking measures to get LearnSynBio incorporated into actual classrooms: We have established a          collaboration with the high school team Broad Run iGEM (see Collaborations page) to incorporate our modules into          their advanced science classes and after-school science clubs. Additionally, we are working with some of our former          high school teachers to introduce LearnSynBio to VAST, the Virginia Association of Science Teachers, for incorporation          in classrooms all around the state. Lastly, it is our hope that the presentation of LearnSynBio at the Jamboree          will encourage the spread of LearnSynBio to schools all around the world!
In addition to LearnSynBio, we also completed several public outreach events. We were awarded a grant from Building          with Biology  to host public outreach events over the course of the iGEM 2016 season. We held a science workshop          targeted at at local children and their parents which allowed them to get some hands-on experience with the exciting          world of modern biology. We had more than 70 people in attendance and together we extracted DNA from strawberries,          learned about synthetic biology and the benefit of standard biological parts, and discussed our questions and concerns          with GMO food.
We also held a forum on the topic of Genome Editing targeted at the general public. At the forum, we briefly discussed          the implications of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool and explored various ways that it could be applied to real          world problems. Among the topics discussed were: stabilizing the Honeybee population by increasing expression of          ‘hygiene’ genes, engineering yeast for efficient biofuel production, and using CRISPR to decrease human susceptibility          to HIV infection. We had over 30 participants for the forum and we received great feedback from our attendees!

3.Changchun International forum of Oncobiology and Translational Medicine
On June.19th, 2016, Jilin_China Team attended Changchun International forum of Oncobiology and Translational Medicine. We interviewed the experts in cancer biology about the current trends and newly developed methods of treating solid tumors. In addition, we also asked their advices on our project.
3.International Forum
Professor Yun Dai from Jilin University gave a lecture about precise targeted therapy and drug-resistance in hematologic malignancies. We consulted him about drug-resistance. He told us there are two kinds of drug-resistance: primary resistance and long-term resistance. He also used one repressor named HDAC as example. It has curative effect to treat neoplastic hematologic disorder, but it has unsatisfactory result to treat solid tumors. Although HDAC is effective in vitro, it still needs more experiments to be verified. He also mentioned that if we want to develop a real drug, we should consider safety tests, pharmacology researches and clinical trials as well.
3.International Forum
Professor Cheshi Chen from Kunming Institute Of Zoology, CAS, gave a lecture about the development of new animal models for breast cancers. He discussed four kinds of common animal models: spontaneous animal model, experimental animal model, implanted tumor model and PDX model. He also mentioned some alternative animal models of breast cancers in addition to these commonly used laboratory mice.
Assistant Professor Boyi Gan from the University of Texas MD discussed energy metabolism and sensing in cancer. We asked him some questions about current cancer therapies. He told us that although radiotherapy and chemotherapy have low targeting, these two therapies are still major treatments in clinic application. Some new methods, such as targeted therapy and immunization therapy, may demonstrate better targeting effects, but they still have many weaknesses. Targeted therapy is designed to treat patients with specific mutations, so the rates of mutation largely determine the efficacy of the treatment. Immunization therapy can educate patient’s own immune system to cure cancer, and it is now widely used in clinic. He suggested that our group should verify whether bifidobacterium could educate human immune system.

Meet Tiffany Dang
Heyos mayos! My name is Tiffany Dang. This fall I will be attending the Schulich School of Engineering at the University of Calgary for a degree in chemical and biomedical engineering.I joined iGEM again because I continue to be intrigued with its novelty. Genetic engineering combines scientific research, engineering principles and imagination to find a new perspective to currently unsolvable problems. iGEM has given me the experience to be a part of this process while making friends along the way. Outside of iGEM, I like being active playing rugby, racquet sports, hiking, and rock climbing.
