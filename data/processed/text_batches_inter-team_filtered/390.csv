Introduction
Bacteria have a choice between using nutrients for growth or for the production of (commercially) valuable proteins. Being able to control the bacterial growth cycle and inducing a premature stationary phase will create the possibility to spend more time producing, using less nutrients for biomass and more for desired production. Stationary phase is nothing more than a stop in an increase of cell numbers by cell death being equal to cell growth. Normally this is induced by the limitation of available nutrients or by means of quorum sensing in response to high cell density. With this knowledge, a culture can be created that can respond by limited cell death in response to an added molecule that mimics the response to high cell density.
See also Chemostat
One of the most important features of chemostats is that micro-organisms can be grown in a physiological steady state. In steady state, all culture parameters remain constant (culture volume, dissolved oxygen concentration, nutrient and product concentrations, pH, cell density, etc.). Because obtaining a steady state requires at least 5 volume changes"

Investigator: Ingmar, Volker
Aim of the experiment: Removal of a NgoMIV restriction site in the backbone of pTUM104.
Operational sequence:
A single clone of E. coli pYes2_RFC25 MCS 1.2 was picked an transferred to 5 ml LB Amp. Incubation overnight at 37°C 180 rpm.
Transformation of 2 Biobricks into E. coli XL1-Blue
Investigator: Jeffery Truong
Aim of the experiment: Transformation of Biobricks into E. coli for plasmid propagation for PCR with new RFC pre- and suffix primer in order to do protein fusions.
2 Biobricks from the distribution kit were used: First, LexA (BBa_K105005, Plate 3 Well 9E) in the pSB1A2 plasmid with ampicillin resistance and second, the heme oxygenase (BBa_I15008, Plate 2 Well 13J) in the pSB2K3 plasmid with kanamycin resistance.
10 µL of autoclaved H2O were added to each well on the distribution kit. The well immediately turned red which means that one does it right.
The now resuspended DNA liquids were transferred into a new ERG on ice.
CaCL2 competent E. coli XL1-Blue cells from the stock were gently defrezed on ice.
For each Biobrick 100 µL cells were used and pooled together with 2 µL of plasmid DNA in a ERG on ice.
Incubation on ice for 30 min.
5 min heat shock at 37 °C.
Each ERG now is transferred in a new ERG prefilled with 1 mL of LB-medium and incubated in a cell-culture shaker at 37 °C for 45 min.
100 µL of these cell suspension were plated on antibiotic selection plates (Ampicillin for LexA and Kanamycin for heme oxygenase).
The rest of the cell suspension is centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 60 s and the supernatant is discarded.
The pellet is resuspended with 100 µL for each ERG and is plated on another antibiotic selection plate
These 4 plates were put at 37 °C overnight

1.  Introduction
We hope to obtain the yield function of butanol using experimental data. The optimal fermentation conditions and maximum yield were obtained for the optimal solution of the function. Then we tried again under the best fermentation conditions. The result shows that the yield has obviously increased.
The molecular dynamics model has been established, and the speed limiting steps and the parameters with high sensitivity have been found. The efficiency of the system can be further improved by optimizing the speed limiting steps of the reaction and the parameters with high sensitivity.
2.  Optimization of butanol fermentation process
Increasing the yield and rate of butanol is a hot and difficult point in current biobutanol research. Butanol synthesis is affected by many environmental conditions such as temperature, inoculum (initial OD), and initial pH. We constructed a kinetic equation for the synthesis of butanol, and optimized the butanol synthesis condictions to increase butanol production [1].
2.1  Experiment design
In the butanol fermentation process, how to control the temperature (\({x_1}\)),initial OD (\({x_2}\)), initial pH (\({x_3}\)), so that is the butanol yield (\(y\)) the highest? To do this, we need to explore the quantitative relationship between y and \({x_1}\), \({x_2}\), \({x_3}\). The quantitative relationship between them can be expressed by the following model:
\[y = f({x_1},{x_2},{x_3})\]

Complete parts list
All the parts used for the pneumatics, with approximate cost in Swiss francs, are listed below. The microscope is an additional cost, but most labs would have one already. The Mac Pro is a lone from EPFL's Biomedical Imaging Group, and the Thinkpad is an oldie that was lying around.
Savings could be made on the pressure regulators, on the valves, and on the EasyDAQ - most setups are better off with manual valves anyway.

FM 707.1 Marketing Update for the Weeks of August 3rd 2009 and August 10th 2009
Hi everyone,
My name is Fahd Mirza and you are reading the FM 707.1 Marketing Update for the week of August 3rd 2009 and August 10th 2009. These past two weeks have been intensely busy and highly productive for our marketing team. Last week, we had organized a massive bake sale having more than 400 baked items to sell. This event managed to raise a net profit of $500.04 Cdn Dollars. All the funds would be directed towards our research project. We had also managed to get sponsorships from Corning Life Sciences (Thanks to Prima Moinul) and VWR Scientific (Courtesy Fahd Mirza) last week. Our July newsletter was also ready to be sent out to potential/current/future sponsors and to media organizations who gave us media coverage. I want to thank Jamie Feng and Prima Moinul for doing a marvelous job on the newsletter.
Nexen Inc. was declared our Sponsor of the Month for the month of August. It is with Nexen Inc.’s generous donation that iGEM Calgary would be able to achieve its goals.

Therefore, we used an overnight culture of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 grown in LB broth . 10 µl of the bacteria solution was inoculated with a pipette tip in swimming agar medium plates (25 ml of Swimming agar medium in petri dishes).
After an incubation overnight, we measured the diameter of the E. coli MG1655 swarms. Surprisingly, we observed two swarm layers: The lower one had a bigger diameter than the upper. The measured diameters are depicted in the table.

Safety regulations and rules are key to ensure that what we do as scientists are safe for ourselves, colleagues and equally important to the environment and human society. Therefore, it is very important to have safety in mind from the beginning of a project. All aspect of the work has to be considered including how to handle chemicals, bacterial strains and other high risk compounds e.g snake venom and blood.
Most of the work has been performed in class 1 GMO approved laboratory according to the Danish legislation governed by the Danish Working Environment Authority [1]. The classification allows for work with GMO that posses no to low risk.
In regards to general laboratory safety rules the following was mandatory;
- Non authorized personnel is allowed in the laboratories
- Wear laboratory coats at all times
- No eating or drinking
- No cell phones
When working with GMO the main focus from a safety perspective is to detain the organisms from entering the non classified areas. Therefore, waste management and decontamination of surfaces is a vital part of safe GMO laboratory work. At the department responsible for our laboratory the waste policy states that all solid waste should be disposed of in designated biohazard waste bins. Also, liquid biowaste should be collected in designated containers and when the container is full then be handled as solid waste. When the biohazard waste bag is full it is closed and thrown in the biohazard waste bin. The biohazard waste bin itself is sealed then decontaminated with 70% ethanol and ready for destruction. All work surfaces in the laboratory is likewise decontaminated with 70% ethanol before and after every session.
Safety Around Snake Venom
The project revolves around detecting snake venom so it was apparent from the beginning that a safe work environment had to be secured, especially whenever snake venom was handled.
First of all, the snake venoms was purchased from a renowned and trusted supplier that also provided safety sheets [2]. They laid the base for the safety protocol established for working with venom in the laboratory. Venom in its solid form posse the highest risk of harming the handler as it is highly concentrated and a puff of wind may introduce the venom to the eyes or respiratory tract. As a result, only two people on the team was allowed to weigh out the lyophilized venom and it took place in a fume hood wearing gloves, dust mask and eye protection at all times. The venom was immediately dissolved in an, for the experiment conducted, appropriate buffer to minimize the above mentioned risks.
Even though venom diluted in a solution is less dangerous we still work at"

INTRODUCTION
Being our first attempt at iGEM, we are eternally grateful to everyone who had been involved with our project since its inception. Their support and guidance was the driving force that kept us moving forward through this journey. Our special thanks to the chairperson of our college, Dr. (Mrs) Thangam Meganathan, Mr. Abhay Shankar, our principal Dr. S.N Murugesan, and the administrative officers Mr. Thiagarajan, Mr. Balaji and Mr. Tamizhselvan for funding our project and supporting us in this endeavor.
DR. JAYASREE & DR. JOHANNA RAJKUMAR
Jayasree Ma'am, the Head of the Department of Biotechnology, and Johanna ma'am, the Dean, have been our strong pillars of support throughout this journey. When we were initially taking our baby steps towards iGEM, they were on our side, constantly motivating us and have always pushed us to do better. They are the backbone of our team.
DEPARTMENT OF BIOTECHNOLOGY
We are sincerely thankful to all the teachers, scholars and lab assistants from our department for imparting us with knowledge, providing us with safety training and helping us in lab at all times of the day (and night).
DR. S. BABUSKIN
As our primary PI, Babuskin sir has been right with us from our initial brainstorming sessions, where he was instrumental in deciding our project, to the final stages. With numerous friends in the scientific community, sir put us in contact with a lot of scientists and research scholars, who helped us mould our idea to what it is today.
DR. V. GAYATHRI
Gayathri ma’am has been more than a PI to us. For anything gone right or wrong, she was the first person that we all would contact and report to. She has basically been with us with every step of the way. Hence it wouldn’t be too much to say that she knew us the best and thus guided us the best.

On the other hand we had to overcome a lot of obstacles, from having troubles with  bureaucracy to not being able to get our vectors into bacteriae. It was then when we  realized only we are the ones responsible for the project and that it is on us to reach out for  help. We learned that in the end you always have to do what you have to do, no matter how  hard it may seem. Perhaps the crucial lesson of this summer was about the importance of  collaboration with others or, to put it another way, to stick together through thick and  thin.

Valencia_UPV,2017,Team:Valencia UPV#Plant_-_-_TEXT.html,"IF6 is terminated, resulting in a shut-off of gene expression.
Furthermore, the Phytochrome B (PhyB) is fused to an activator domain (VP64) and a nuclear location sequence (NLS). Thus, when plant is irradiated with 660nm light, PhyB’s conformation is modified, allowing its interaction with PIF6 and transporting VP64 activator domain to the proximal upstream region of the desired CDS. Therefore, transcription is up-regulated by promoting the polymerase III complex recruitment through VP64 activity. PhyB-PIF6 interaction will end when PhyB’s conformation returns to its inactivated state after absorbing a far-red photon (740nm), thus resulting in a shut-off of gene expression (Fig.1).
However, this approach has some concerns that need to be addressed. First, since white light interferes with circuit signaling in aerial parts of the plant and plant growth and development would be altered under light deprivation conditions, we postulate plant root cells as ideal hosts for our optogenetic circuit.
Thus, the circuit could be regulated by irradiating plant’s roots with red or far-red stimuli. Several root-specific promoters have been reported for genetic applications. In order to delimit the activity of this system only to roots, root-specific promoters must be used for regulating the constitutive expression of both E-PIF6 and PhyB-VP64 fusion proteins genes. One example is NtREL1 whose expression pattern is strictly root-specific. Second, in order to make this optogenetic circuit modular to cover almost any necessity users may have, an autoreplicative vector is implemented as final interchangeable element. This vector, derived from potato virus X (PVX) vector, confers to the optogenetic circuit with the ability of propagating the expression of any desired protein from the roots to the rest of the plant.
Moreover, we do not only intend to give orders to plants but also to acquire relevant information from them. Therefore, we generated a second communication channel through a Color Code System that allows plants to send us information about their current status (e.g. salt stress, pathogen presence, lack of some nutrient …). We resolved to detect these biotic and abiotic stresses using a modular and orthogonal genetic AND gate. Thus, color changes on plants are triggered when two different signals coincide. One of this signals corresponds to the presence of a determined stress, while the other is triggered when user apply an external chemical stimuli (i.e. dexamethasone).

Enzyme Kinetic Data:
The enzyme kinetics data was collected through research in various journals and the online database available on Brenda-enzyme .
Km values in the original organism were available for all enzymes except phosphomevalonate Kinase (ERG8), in this case the protein sequence for ERG8 was blasted (NCBI) and the closest homologous sequence from a different organism human protein ERG8 was used in the model3. Similarly for Kcat values where data was not available fitting approximations from a different source was made.
The mevalonate pathway begins with acetyl-CoA, an abundant cellular metabolite. Studies on recombinant poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) production demonstrated that acetyl-CoA is available in E. coli to produce up to194.1 g/L of PHB from the native source of E.Coli. (Choi et al., 1998; Choi and Lee,1999). Hence, the input substrate acetyl – CoA and other key substrates in the model (ATP, NADPH) were assumed at a constant level,A-CoA4 = 0.96 mM ATP = 0.12 mM NADPH4 = 0.61 mM. These substrates are part of pathways in the cell metabolism. It is essential that the cell keep them at a steady state concentration. Mevalonate is not known to be metabolize inside the cell and same is true for subsequent intermediate substrates in the pathway. Hence, any regulation in the organism has also been excluded in the model. The minor substrates such as CoA is not considered in the rate equation since it is recycled in the pathway and it is an important co-factor maintained in a steady concentration in the cell. The reported Km values of the genes reported in Table 1 were used. The tHMGR is substituted with a more stable enzyme HMG2. The kinetic data of other enzymes is from in-vitro assays reported in other publications.
Model specifications:
The maximum enzyme concentration was limited to 10mM, the limit was guessed using data available on protein concentration in E.Coli cytosol reported in5. The 10mM maximum enzyme concentration value is corroborated with data available on high copy number of oriCs in available plasmids and transcription rates [Dennis and Bremer 1996], so that the cell can achieve the necessary enzymes concentration in the"

Nos moyens de communication reposent donc en lumière; des paquets des photons, ou des quanta énergétiques, vont transporter l'information à communiquer des entités réceptrices aux entités émettrices. Cela nous permet effectivement dépasser diverses barrières isolant nos entités. En conséquence, notre système de communication n'est plus contenu dans un système chimique, mais alors dans un système physique; c'est-à-dire qu'il faut qu'il reste un moyen physique pour que les photons soient transportés. Ce système physique peut donc être quelque chose de si complexe comme un dispositif de relai électronique à microcontrôleurs, comme quelque chose de si simple comme du vide. Or, ce strate physique est remarquablement étanche à la signalisation chimique. Donc, le bruit du fond chimique de notre système ne devra pas perturber significativement le strate des photons. En conséquence, on peut affirmer que l'échange d'information par moyens photoniques sera suffisamment indépendante de l'information endogène codée aux voies chimiques pour que le système marche correctement. Autrement dit, la voie photonique est extrêmement non-envahissante. En plus, nos entités réceptrices sont facilement transformées en entités émettrices. Donc, en utilisant nos cellules comme des châssis processeurs d'information, on arrive à augmenter les possibilités de communication énormément. On peut effectivement rendre nos constructions un système où l'information est:
d'abord, codée et émise par un émetteur,
puis, reçue et décodée par un récepteur,
et finalement, traitée, transformée, et relayé de suite.
Notre ambitieuse implémentation repose sur des composants bien connus, principalement des ensembles bioluminescents de Photinus pyralis et Vibrio fischeri, des récepteurs photoactives comme les cyanobacteriochromes des Cyanobactéries, et des domaines Light-Oxygen-Voltage des certaines protéines chimériques.

Description
From the meeting with some high school students, we found that one issue is the medium of instruction. While Hong Kong is a place where English is the secondary language, students especially from public high school are taught in Chinese. Interesting sources for learning synthetic biology with Chinese as a medium of instruction is also limited.
At the same time, we encountered Mr. Ariel Lindner who introduced us Synthetic Biology 1 page and invited us to collaborate in Chinese translation with Mr. Edwin Wintermute. We would like to thank you Mr. Ariel Lindner, a founder of CRI, and Mr. Edwin Wintermute for this great opportunity.

1. Introduction
Sequencing the entire genome of an athlete is relatively expensive and time-consuming. If we would sequence the genome of each 918 medal winners at the Olympics Games in the Rio de Janeiro of 2016, it would have taken at total of 1836 hours (2 days per athlete) and 35802 flowcells (39 flowcells per athlete) ( Jain, et al. 2018 ). Minimizing sequencing time and costs is already accomplished by implementing our targeted sequencing approach as it only requires one flowcell per athlete. However, this is not the limit that we aim for as speed can always be increased. Prof. Hagan Bayley from Oxford University, one of the founders of Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd., Oxford UK, suggested that multiplexing with additional barcoding would solve both problems: time and costs. Therefore, we implemented the possibility for barcoding in our detection method. In order to do so, we developed an iGEM barcoding tool by improving upon an existing iGEM DNA translation tool developed by iGEM Aberdeen Scotland, 2014 .
2. Multiplexing by Barcoding
Multiplexing is the simultaneous sequencing of multiple samples from different athletes using one sequencing device. In order to be able to assign the output sequences to the corresponding athlete, the output sequence should be labeled with an athlete specific mark. However, the sequence should be marked in such a way that the label does not disturb or interrupt the sequencing. Therefore, we decided to label the DNA sample with an athlete specific sequence: the DNA barcode ( Bayliss et al, 2017 ).
The barcode is a DNA sequence that is placed between the mosaic elements for the transposase and the Oxford Nanopore adapter sequence. This barcoded sequencing adapter is picked up by the Tn5-dxCas9 fusion protein and integrated into"

Integrated Human Practice
Introduction
Antibiotic research and antibiotics provided the foundation for this year's project. Most people are affected by antibiotics and their influence on the environment. This revealed multiple options of human practice, in the context of research, education, and society.                  Our project grants access to an evolving field of research: taking a class of antibiotics and improving its features by modifying compounds biochemically as well as chemically. This concept isn’t new but has yet to be realised. The biggest hurdle has proved to be the lack of funding which keeps companies and research facilities from taking on the task. Therefore, we were eager to show with our project exemplary that the antibiotic class of aminocoumarins can rather easily be modified with the means of synthetic biology. We hope that our research puts a focus on the pressing matter of antibiotic resistances bringing us closer to solutions for the rising amount of resistant pathogens.
Even while arranging our project we considered our concept of human practice by paying particular attention to biosafety and lab safety. To provide an example of these concerns, we encountered problems during the design of an appropriate test system for our newly developed antibiotic. Our antibiotic targets mostly pathogens of the BSL 2 level like Staphylococcus aureus. This contrasted our decision at the beginning of the project to only work in the BSL 1 level, as we considered it a strain on public safety to handle pathogens at a BSL 2 level. To resolve this problem, we maden effort to create a new test organism which fulfills BSL 1 standards, serves as a model for BSL 2 pathogens and carries the necessary targets for our antibiotic. Therefore, we created a safe E.coli-based test system for our antibiotic. Showing both the antimicrobial effect on gram-positive bacteria and the improved parameters of our adapted antibiotic Troiacin. In conclusion, we contributed significant research to a socially relevant field and took care of conducting this research safely and sustainably.
Giving insight
Essential for our project was to integrate the concepts of human practice outside of the lab. To tackle the problem of antibiotic resistance, we pursued the approach of elucidation. Society needs to be provided with information of the right use of antibiotics and needs to grasp that antibiotic resistances are indeed a problem for us, ultimately fighting to reduce the over- and misuse of antibiotics. Fortunately, our project and"

Outreach strategy
The IOD band presents a new approach to diagnostics and diagnostic engineering. So at Team Czech Republic we addressed engineers and medical experts to discuss the application and the novel engineering approach. In addition, Czech Republic teamed up with Chalmers Gothenburg to conduct a multinational survey on the public perception of Synthetic Biology.
Engineering
Since a lot of ideas behind IODs were built on the fundamentals of classical engineering, we wanted to present the concept of our project (from an engineering point-of-view) to young engineers and receive their feedback. We presented our project and synthetic biology in general at a lecture of the Introduction to Cybernetics class led by Prof. Ing. Miloš Schlegel CSc. After giving a 30-minute lecture on synthetic biology, we introduced our project. The response was surprisingly positive. Not only we were asked several to-the-point questions, but some of the students even showed a deeper interest in synthetic biology and individually contacted us after the talk.
Medicine
In order to get a professional opinion on our project and to learn more about cancer and CTCs, we conducted an interview with two cancer specialists, Mgr. Pavel Pitule, Ph.D. and Mgr. Pavel Ostašov, Ph.D. The interview took place at the Biomedical Center of Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen. After introducing our project idea we discussed some particularly interesting points. This interview was not only helpful and enriching but also led to an agreement to collaborate with the Laboratory of Tumor Biology in the near future.

Most engineers are eager to see the immediate reaction of the system. Following the lectures such as the one for young engineers, we designed IODs as a fast diagnostic test. Also, the preliminary process is quick thanks to the clone-free preparation of required IODs.
Questions we received during the lecture from students and teachers concerning current cancer diagnostics, their price, and efficiency were afterwards discussed with cancer specialists in the interview .

Projekt prowadzony jest w nowo powstałym Centrum molekularnej i komórkowej analizy systemów biologicznych – Bioquant.
Zespół pracuje nad biologiczną maszyną zdolną wykryć i zabić patogeny, a docelowo również komórki rakowe. Jako eksperyment zespół zaprojektował i skonstruował dwa szczepy bakterii E.coli, szczep “zabójców” i szczep “ofiar”.
Cały system składa się z dwóch receptorów jednoznacznie rozpoznających molekularny koktail wydzielany przez ofiarę, modułu chemotaktycznego pozwalającego na przemieszczanie się komórki atakującej w kierunku celu, oraz modułu “zabójcy”, którego uruchomienie prowadzi do śmierci komórki docelowej. Receptory i moduł chemotaktyczny to zmodyfikowane elementy E.coli, które w środowisku naturalnym służą lokalizacji substancji odżywczych.  Zespól pracuje nad dwoma strategiami prowadzącymi do śmierci komórki docelowej. Pierwsza strategia koncentruje się na bakteryjnych toksynach, podczas gdy druga wykorzystuje wirusy.
Toksyny produkowane przez niektóre szczepy bakterii, pozwalają im kontrolować otoczenie poprzez zabijanie konkurujących z nimi bakterii, są ponadto wystarczająco silne, aby również doprowadzić do śmierci komórki rakowej.

1-4 Discussion
We learned the appropriate arabinose concentration, 0.02%, to induce MazF. This assay firstly shows that in one cell, MazE resuscitates E. coli after MazF expression inhibits cell growth and translation, then, MazF inhibits cell growth and translation after MazE expression. It is suggested that using mazEF system regulate cell growth and translation. In conclusion, we can indicate, as the function of TA system, not Kill Switch but a regulator of systems. It will be useful for information processing.
2. Improvement of Prhl
2-1. ""Background”for our improvement of Prhl
We simulated our final genetic circuits and found that the circuits did not work, because Prhl activity was too weak compared to Plux. (see the Model page and the AHL Only Assay page). We therefore considered using the improved Prhl ( BBa_K1529300 , BBa_K1529310 ) established by iGEM 2014 Tokyo_Tech, but we noticed that they were inappropriate for two reasons: crosstalk to C12 and type of rhlR (written below). Then, we decided to improve wild type Prhl( BBa_R0071) .
2-2. Summary of the experiment
By introducing a single point mutation into wild type Prhl ( BBa_R0071) by PCR, we obtained 198 Prhl mutants and obtained the Prhl mutants of which promoter activity was stronger than wild type Prhl("

We shares some of the Biotechweek balloons, collaboration postcards and patches in the event and our banner was placed on a visible place outside the auditorium, so we hopefully reached a lot more people than just the listeners. In addition to organizing the event Pauli Kallio was also kind enough to give us an inspiring tour at their laboratory and telling us about their Cyanobacteria research. The Finnish Autumn was for once showing it’s best and all in all, we had an absolutely wonderful day in the beautiful city of Turku!
It is to be mentioned that even if this was our last visit before before the Giant Jamboree, we will make several visits to the different departments and faculties of University of Helsinki and Aalto University as well as visit one high school and at least Thermo Fisher afterwards in order to spread the word about iGEM and synthetic biology even further.
Kampuskarkelot
Kampuskarkelot is an event organized by AYY - Aalto University’s student union. Its target audience is the freshers and new exchange students, and it is therefore organized in the main lobby of the university’s main building. Kampuskarkelot is a chance for student associations such as choirs, theatre clubs and events to market themselves to the new students. It was the first time that our iGEM association (Aalto-Helsinki Synthetic Biology ry) has participated the event. We got a chance to discuss with many interested students, who were eager to apply for next year’s team! Even students from the Aalto Business School expressed interest in the project - a good chance to make our team even more multidisciplinary!
BIOTECH WEEK
Finnish Bioindustries (FIB) organised several events as part of EuropaBio’s European Biotech week 25.9.-1.10.2017. We attended meetings, advertised on social media especially for bio students, shared Biotech week balloons in Heureka and made a video (down below) about synthetic biology with Finnish narration, English subtitles and accompanying assignments. The video was released in our and FIB’s social media and in addition it was put to team Tübingen’s Youtube channel. You may find a version with English subtitles from here . After release both the video and the assignments were also added to Opetin, which is a free Finnish material bank for teachers. You can find it from here. As part of the week a Biotech week magazine will be printed and 10 000 copies mentioning our input will be spread"

The systems (one for E. coli and one for Yeast) described during the project explanation are broken up into their parts below. Each of the parts have a specific function and the two constructs together form a positive feedback loop that allows the two organisms to stay in close proximity.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
FUS1 Promoter
The product of the FUS1 gene, Fus1, plays a critical role in the mating pheromone response pathway of yeast, upregulating the production of genes necessary for cell fusion and mating.  This gene is activated by the phosphorylated form of Ste12, which is activated through previous interactions in the pathway.  Using the Ste12 regulated promoter of FUS1 allows for mating-sensitive gene expression.  If it functions as expected, the genes to be expressed should be produced in response to the haploid yeast cells binding their complementary mating factor.

To meet the requirements of the stakeholders, a predetermined Color Code system was instilled in order to associate color reporter proteins with particular stresses. This particular genetic construction enables ChatterPlant to indicate the presence of any problems related to plant growth activity in an easy and practical way.  A deeper analysis of their current growing problems enabled us to establish the following stress inducible promoters to be used for indications of stress:
A pathogen infection inducible promoter
A water stress inducible promoter
Macro and micronutrients absence inducible promoter
Controlling internal processes within a plant is one of the mainstays of the current agricultural and agronomic area. Interviews with greenhouse supervisors reflected real agronomical requirements that were figured out with a modular optogenetic circuit. This ON/OFF circuit allows the control of a specific phenotype within a plant at a particular moment. What follows is a delineation of plant growth topics to be considered in our final project design:
Flowering time control
Climate conditions protection, against frost and high temperatures
Ornamental plants features, such leaves color
Restaurants interviews revealed the importance of season-less, high-value fruits and vegetables. In general, GMOs are not a barrier for them, provided food quality is fitted to consumers wishes. Also, high-quality restaurant supervisors did not perceive GMOs as a dangerous alternative, despite their legal framework.
ChatterPlant optogenetic circuit offers multiple possibilities to improve and biofortificate crops due to its modularity. Following topics were checked to be interesting to take into account to define ChatterPlant possibilities:
Improved organoleptic characteristics of edible plants, as more colorful fruits.
Higher macro and micronutrients levels food, as iron or calcium.
Biofortificated fruits and vegetables, increasing their nutritional values.
CHATTERBOX EVOLUTION
Public surveys affirm the existence of social interest about self-controlled home cultivation. Nevertheless, the availability of space within certain properties remains one of the leading problems house farming has to face. As an attempt to resolve the issue, a redimensional design was carried out in our hardware tool to afford a small-scale device more appropriate for private use. Moreover, our Hardware design was improved according to restaurants necessities. A dimensional readjustment was performed in ChatterBox to offer a compact device more suitable for restaurants use.
The concept of  self-controlled plant growth would further make the ChatterPlant device sound appealing. Hence, a remote-control mobile application with these this very quality"

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

My name is Alev Baysoy and I am a junior in the CBE department at Princeton. I am from St.Paul, Minnesota and I decided to join iGEM because I wanted more experience in the biological side of engineering (as chemical and biological engineering are clumped together as a major) as well as gain more experience in the application of the engineering work that I do to industry and I feel that iGEM is a great liaison for this. I want to pursue a career relating to bioengineering and biotech, and am really excited to work on a meaningful project in the lab. My hobbies include running, cooking, crossfit, and travelling. A fun fact about me is that I am a dual-citizen with Turkey.

Integrated Human Practices
At the beginning of our project, we participated a seminar called „Synthetic Biotechnology“ supervised by our secondary PI.         In the course of this lecture, we repeated the most used and popular cloning methods. The much more interesting part         was learning some new cloning methods, which are on the cutting edge of gene technology. Subsequent to the seminar,         we started to work out our project idea, finding a way to connect bacteria with a robot. At first, planning everything         was really difficult, because we did not know how and where to begin. Nevertheless, we benefited from the long lasting         experience of our secondary PI and got useful hints for designing of our constructs and how to start them to work         in E. coli. Our secondary PI also suggested to work with the novel gene editing method CRISPR/Cas9. To get familiar         with this system, we got offered an internship in the working group of CRISPR/Cas9.
Skype conference organized by University of Uppsala
Due to our project we took part in a skype conference about safety organized by the University of Uppsala. The discussion         was about general safety in the lab, as well as the risks of the designed constructs and what might happen if they         were released. To evaluate potential risks, we interviewed different experts about the safety aspects of our project         and how to improve our constructs. However, we were able to enhance our designs according to their input and increased         our knowledge in the field of genetic engineering.
Expert Interviews
Horizontal gene transfer, HGT, always represents a certain risk factor. In the course of the interviews, we evaluated,             among other things, the safety assessment of our construct with various professors. The talks focused on the             importance of incorporating deficiencies and discussing different options. Finally, we decided to use the following E. coli strains because of their deficiencies: BL21, XL1-blue, TOP10 and DH5alpha. After much discussion,             we have decided that these strains are the safest variant for our planned experiment.

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#policypractice#experts_-_-_TEXT.html,"
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," had originally decided on the development of a biosensor for herbicides as our iGEM project. However, our research for this project unearthed an interesting fact: despite the large number of synthetic biology biosensors that have been developed over the years, there is a distinct lack of synthetic biology based biosensors in everyday use. Despite their advantages over methods like immunoassays and mass spectroscopy (which are expensive and often rely on additional equipment), these traditional methods are much more widely used by researchers. Also, day-to-day usage by non-scientists, who are often the target end-user for a biosensor, has not yet materialised. In fact, not one synthetic biology based biosensor has been approved for use outside of a laboratory setting by the EU. This led to the question which shaped not only our human practices work, but our project as a whole: what are the barriers facing synthetic biology biosensors, and what can we do to help?
The Issues
Issue #1: Parts Reusability
“Each generation of scientists keeps reinventing the wheel” - Dr Martin Peacock
The Issue
When talking to experts about biosensor development, a common theme that came up was the rediscovery and work done on commonly used biosensor parts which lengthened the development process, as well as limited resources for novel findings. We talked to Dr Martin Peacock, a hardware biosensor developer, about this and he mentioned how this limits his hardware development and that having common part reusability would combat this problem.
Our Solution
Our solution to this problem was the creation of the modularity aspect of the Sensynova biosensor development platform. As part of the platform, developers can switch in and out different components of each device (adaptor, detector, processor and reporter) isolated in different cells, and co-culture these together so there is an easy switch in-switch out system. Variants of the devices could then be distributed in agar slabs, as a biosensor development kit.
Issue #2: Range of Analytes and Outputs
“Main bulk of the work in developing a biosensor is the deduction of the mechanistic process of substrate-circuit interaction” - Dr Oliver Purcell
The Issue
The majority of work done in the research and development around biosensor development is the deduction of native interactions between a target molecule and binding site. There are also many substrates which don’t have a known binding site. Upon discussion with biosensor developer Dr Oliver Purcell, he told us that this took up a large chunk of time during development.
Our Solution
To combat this issue, we have created a"
DLUT_China,2018,Team:DLUT China B#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"athy are needed for                         optimal clinical management.""[3] Studies have shown that the urine of diabetic nephropathy patients                         with beta2 microglobulin was abnormal 5 years earlier than that of urinary microalbumin.[4]
Our social practice survey found that people are much more receptive to urine tests than blood tests.                         So our project was launched to provide diabetes patients with a home, visual, portable test box for                         early and early kidney disease using beta2 microglobulin as a marker.
Principle brief introduction
In this project, we combined the highly specific nanobody with the highly sensitive liquid                         crystal detection to develop a detection method that meets the above conditions, and we hope to                         achieve the semi-quantitative visual analysis of ß2m in urine of 150-400ng/ml. The normal                         concentration of ß2m in human urine is about 150ng/ml, and other obvious symptoms appear when                         the concentration of buxi2m in urine is about 450ng/ml. Firstly, nanobody was selected to                         specifically bind the ß2m in urine, and long chain modification was carried out for improving                         detection sensitivity. We performed the sentinel modification of the nanobacteria using a method                         catalyzed by enterobacterium, and then linked other molecules with active and specialized                         aldehyde groups. Compared with traditional antibodies, nanobody has smaller molecular weight, is                         not easily denatured, and still has complete antigen-binding property. Moreover, the nanobody                         can be expressed by escherichia coli as the host, and the preparation cost is greatly                         reduced.
Fig.1 A schematic of catalysis in E. coli
More subtly, we took advantage of crystals' fluidity and anisotropy. First, the substrate of the                         liquid crystal pool was modified with an antigen, and then a certain concentration of nanobody                         and the mixture of the solution to be tested were added. After a period of reaction, some                         antibodies preferentially bound with the scaffold ß2M in the solution, and the other with the                         substrate ß2M. After the glass slides were rinsed, the microenvironment of the liquid crystal                         base changed due to the combination of ß2m and Nb, resulting in obvious color or light and shade                         differences of the liquid crystal, thus realizing the visualization of detection. Finally, we                         expressed the brightness of the liquid crystal with the gray value of the image, and established                         the relationship between the fixed antigen concentration of the liquid crystal substrate and the                         gray value of the image.

TPXⓇ, or PolyMethyl Penten (PMP), has already been used in iGEM as a biological system confinement material (Groningen 20121, Toulouse 20152). TPXⓇ consists in thin, transparent, heat-sealable sheets. The volume of the desired sachet is therefore adjustable according to the treatment capacity of the device. It has pores with a diameter of 20 nm. The Toulouse 2015 iGEM team carried out tests to confirm that E. coli BW 25113 grows under TPXⓇ membranes as well as in a culture tube and to attest that bacteria remain inside the sachet after 27 h. V. harveyi has approximately the same size as E. coli (about 2 μm) and P. pastoris cells are about 5 μm in diameter. The following table and figure compare the sizes of the elements.

Comparison between the element size: TPXⓇ pores, CAI-1, AMPs and microorganisms
The TPXⓇ pore size is much smaller than microorganisms and larger than CAI-1 and the Leucrocine I AMP. However, they are approximately the same size as the D-NY15 and cOT2 AMPs. This may slow down or avoid their diffusion.
According to the diffusion experiment conducted with TPXⓇ membranes, neither the water nor the Bengale pink dye mimicking the AMPs diffuse through them. Therefore, even if TPXⓇ ensures the containment of our GMMs, we concluded that this material is not suitable for our project.
Another solution came from our meeting with Christophe Campéri-Ginestet, CEO of Sunwaterlife. He suggested to use the membranes that constitute their water filters. These membranes have a cutoff threshold of 0.1 μm which prevents microorganisms from passing through but allows CAI-1, AMPs molecules diffusion (see the following figure).

In the beginning of the project I did a lot of fundraising and budgeting to make sure that the economical side of the project was taken care of. That followed by many hours spent on coding the CollabSeeker. I have also taken care of the visual part of our project, designing our wiki, posters etc. And finally, thanks to the InterLab study I did not have to spend the whole summer staring at my laptop!

Currently in his 2nd semester of the master's degree 'molecular biotechnology'
The outstanding event in my last years of researching and studying was my bachelor thesis about repeated-batch fermentations with Bacillus strains. Beside I worked as a tutor for lab courses in which the students had to ferment Escherichia coli including some downstream processes. For my studies in molecular biotechnology I had some lab courses in cell culture technology (antibody production with and simulation of cell cultures including a lot of analytics and purification of the produced antibody) and fermentation technology (production of penicillin and GFP), too.
When I'm not in the lab (which is quite seldom during iGEM ;) ) I play soccer, the piano, sometimes badminton or I go to the gym. In addition I do stuff specific to students like hang out with friends, go to parties, drink coffe, eat, sleep or just ""waste time"" in a different way. In general I'm quite spontaneous and always swift to do things that promise to be fun.

Tsinghua-A,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A#test_-_-_TEXT.html," from the figure below.
Formally, the mutual information of two discrete random variables X and Y can be defined as:\[I\left( {X;Y} \right) = \sum\limits_{y \in Y} {\sum\limits_{x \in X} {p\left( {x,y} \right)\log \left( {\frac{{p\left( {x,y} \right)}}{{p\left( x \right)p\left( y \right)}}} \right)} } \]
And the formula can also be proofed:\[I\left( {X;Y} \right) = H\left( X \right) - H\left( {X\left| Y \right.} \right) = H\left( Y \right) - H\left( {Y\left| X \right.} \right)\]
From the formula you can easily think that mutual information is the reduction of uncertainty in $X$ when you know $Y$.
And when you understand the mutual information, you can easily understand what the channel capacity is.
In electrical engineering, computer science and information theory, channel capacity is the tight upper bound on the rate at which information can be reliably transmitted over a communications channel. And by the noisy-channel coding theorem, the channel capacity of a given channel is the limiting information rate (in units of information per unit time) that can be achieved with arbitrarily small error probability. And you can also see the figure below.
The channel capacity is defined as:\[C = \mathop {\sup }\limits_{{p_X}\left( x \right)} I\left( {X;Y} \right)\]
where the supremum is taken over all possible choices of ${p_X}\left( x \right)$.
After you know about all the concept above, now we are glad to tell you that you can easily follow us and find out many interesting and inspiring things in our project. Congratulations!
miRNA as Potential Biomarkers
Studies have confirmed that miRNA expression is highly concordant cross individuals. And aberrant expression of miRNA may relate to diseases. Some studies have reported that specific miRNAs in tissue and plasma can be discriminatory bio-makers for detecting cancers. However, getting access to tissue of plasma means physical harm to the human body. So we turn to the easily accessible saliva. Since saliva is considered to be a terminal product of blood circulation, components like proteins and RNAs which are present in plasma are also present in saliva. In fact, both coding RNAs and"

The scaling of model, to better reflect how we’ve simulated a portion of the total number of particles in the cell free system
Production of wiki content ahead of the freeze this included construction of graphics and diagrams for the modelling pages.
This brings us to this very moment, as I (Amy) am sat in my dorm at 10pm in America proof reading and tidying up parts of the wiki for my very tired team mates in England! This has been a really stressful week but we’ve managed to get a (somewhat) working model, although there were definitely a few things we would have loved to have added given more time (you can find these on the previous page). Below you'll find how our model helped the lab team as well as a few extra points!
Other points
We’ve asked a lot of the experiment team and they’ve since found these out or looked it up. This has helped them focus their experiments as they have had to design them with what we need in mind.
We asked about rate limiting steps after talking with Peter Winlove - this was then simplified after talking with the experimentalists.
Rate of ribosome movement contains the rate of RNA, amino acid production, etc.
Ribosome stays bound until it makes GFP.
It also lead us to investigate the rate limiting steps. Anything to do with the cell free kit was assumed to be in excess. The main limiting step was determined to be the RNA binding event.
During the meeting about experimental design, our inputs and considerations for the model were used to question the decisions of the lab team. These included:

Image Processing
After running the metering portion of your chip, pictures need to be taken before and after the oil has dispensed all the liquid from the metering section. An image processing software, such as ImageJ is then used to analyze how much liquid was metered and how much was actually pushed.
To analyze the amount of metered liquid, first set the scale for ImageJ in units of microns. Then, using the Rectangle selection tool, draw a rectangle encapsulating the first metered liquid section. This can be seen below:
Using the rectangle select tool in ImageJ to trace the amount of black liquid metered. The area of this rectangle will then be measured using the ""Measure"" tool. Using the area of this rectangle and the depth of the corresponding section, volume of metered liquid can be calculated.
Then, using the measurement tool calculate the area in microns of the metered section. To find the volume of this metered section, use the following formula:
\[Volume Metered (\mu L)=Area(\mu m^{2}) \times Depth(\mu m) \times (\frac{1.00 \mu L}{ 10^{9} \mu m^{3}})\]
Repeat this process for each individual metering sections, summing them together as follows to find the total metered volume:
\[Total Volume Metered (\mu L)=\sum_{i}^{n}Area_{i}(\mu m^{2}) \times Depth_{i} (\mu m) \times (\frac{1.00 \mu L}{10^{9} \mu m^{3} } )\]
To analyze the amount volume of liquid dispensed, perform the same analysis as before on the image taken after all of the liquid has been displaced by the mineral oil.
\[Volume Dispensed (\mu L)=Area(\mu m^{2}) \times Depth(\mu m) \times (\frac{1.00 \mu L}{ 10^{9} \mu m^{3}})\]
Accuracy Calculation
The metering accuracy can be calculated using the following formula:
\[Percent Accuracy = \frac{Volume Metered(\mu L)}{Volume Dispensed(\mu L)} \times 100\]
The metering error can be calculated using the following formula:
\[Error (\mu L)= Volume Metered(\mu L) - Volume Dispensed(\mu L)\]
If there is a significant error in metering, this suggests that there was either a milling inaccuracy or a leak at a channel and/or valve during the pushing process.

These 3 tod genes were made into biobricks which were ligated to the iGEM supplied backbone (pSB1C3).  A restriction digest was performed on the fusion PCR products (biobricks) and pSB1C3. Each of the biobricks were subsequently ligated to pSB1C3 and transformed into highly competent cells (DH5α).  Some of the resulting colonies were then incubated in overnight broth. The isolation and sequencing of their plasmids confirmed that the genes were successfully cloned into the backbone containing the restrictions sites as stipulated by iGEM. In addition, double digestions were carried out to confirm the absence of mutations on the restrictions sites.
The gel picture shows the result of the double digestions. Well 2 is the digestion with EcoRI and PstI, well 3 is the double digestion with XbaI and SpeI. This shows that the restrictions sites are present in our biobricks.
We successfully made biobricks of todF BBa_K1095000 , todX BBa_K1095001 and todB BBa_K1095002 . Future Leicester iGEM team can continue to build biobricks of the other genes of the tod operon, especially todC1C2 genes that encodes the catalytic site of the TDO (toluene dioxygenase) enzyme, and proceed to characterise the biobricks created by this team.
Re-using
The second stream was centered on re-using polystyrene in consumer 3D printers. The 3D printer technology requires a support structure which is made prior to printing the image. This support material then needs to be disposed of which can be challenging. Previous studies have shown that limonene can be used to dissolve polystyrene and from the iGEM registry we know that a limonene biobrick exists. Therefore the team decided to use the biobrick to try to produce limonene-expressing bacteria which would be a cheaper method of synthesizing the solvent.
Limonene is a colourless hydrocarbon present in the rinds of most citrus fruits. The natural sources (lemons, oranges, etc.) produce the R-limonene, (+)-limonene, which gives citrus fruits their unique smell. It is widely"

Project
Envenomation by snakebite is one of the most neglected diseases with an estimated 5 million bites. These result in about 100,000 deaths and 400,000 disabilities annually [1]. The only effective treatment is animal derived antivenoms, which frequently causes adverse reactions [2]. As a result they are often only administered as a last resort.
One of the major problems related to treatment of snake bites concerns the lack of identification of the snake. When bitten, it is difficult for most people to remember details about the snake, which makes it almost impossible to confidently administer the correct specific antivenom. Currently, if the snake cannot be identified, multispecies antivenom is used in a consequently higher dose leading to more severe side effects. By solving the venom identification problem it could potentially increase the survival rate of snake bite victims. This is due to decreased diagnosis time and less amount of antivenom necessary for treatment, thereby causing fewer adverse reactions in the patient [3].
We aim to create a novel diagnostic platform by using synthetic biology derived protease activity assay to identify specific venom enzymes that, by developing suitable substrates, can investigate the relative composition of specific venom components in a blood sample. Our goal is to create a diagnostic tool that would make it possible for a clinician to quickly determine which antivenom is necessary, or if it is necessary at all.
Your browser does not support the video.
Current detection methods
The identification of the snake that has bitten the patient is often a very hard task. Numerous molecular biology techniques such as immunofluorescence, radioimmunoassay and enzyme immunoassay have been described as suitable methods for detecting the snake responsible [4]. However, the drawbacks following these techniques (expensive, need of trained personnel and/or sophisticated equipment, long assay time) usually outweigh the advantages. For these reasons, medical staff and clinicians rely on the symptoms exhibited by the patient, in order to decide which antivenom to administer. This obviously is not optimal, as the time spent for the diagnosis could prove crucial for the survival of the patient.
Results
Our experiments showed that distinguishing between snakes of different or the same genus, using an enzymatic assay detection method, is possible. We identified numerous peptide substrates, cleavable by proteases present in the venom, that can be used to separate snake species, by incubating them with the venom. These peptides can be used as standalone, if they are uniquely cleaved by one of the venoms, or as part of a decision tree using multiple peptides for"

We have opportunities to meet around 25 iGEM teams from Taiwan, China, Japan, and the US. After this four-day event, we learn a lot from these Asia iGEM teams and knew that we still have much room for improvement in our presentation skills and poster design.
Domestic team collaborations, we collaborate with Taiwan university teams. We mentor Chung Cheng University through teaching Fusion PCR. Besides, they conduct experiment to ensure our suicide mechanism. Inviting Chang Gung University during Asia Pacific Conference, we host education in Wego senior high school together.
Chung Cheng University
Last year, NYMU team helped students from National Chung Cheng University form their own iGEM team. Excitedly, they will participate iGEM competition this year as team name “CCU_Taiwan” and share their project with all iGEMers on stage in the Giant Jamboree.During the 2017 iGEM Taiwan Conference and the 5th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference, we have a wonderful time discussing on each teams’ project and give each both team suggestions for further improvement. We just build strong bond with them and look forward to their results this year at Giant Jamboree!
Mentor about the fusion PCR
After the team meet-up, we showed them how the Photo-Bioreactor functions, taught them how to run Fusion PCR through webcam, and inform them of team operations and matters.The following links were videos of the process of NYMU team taught CCU team how to work on Fusion PCR. It was quite interesting and educational.
Assit our characterization of suicide system
On the other hand, CCU team help us characterize Holin- Endolysin- NrtA system ( BBa_K2350021 ), the so-called “suicide system”, and measure the growth curve of Escherichia coli DH5α, by adding lactose to induce kill-switch mechanism, in order to determine whether the system works and ensure the biosafety of our project. With their assistance, we can verify that E.coli significantly decrease in several hours, after kill-switch functioned in different lactose concentrations.

Good for the world!
""Safe, responsible and good for the world""
Human practice is aimed at provoking careful thoughts about whether ‘the work is safe, responsible and good for the world’. Bearing that thought in mind, we have taken our project back to the city we live, and came up with new ideas to improve our project.
A visit to the city sewage plant
Our project focuses on the construction of a new kind of cellular memory machine which is capable of recording the changes of a signal in an extended time period. This aspect of our memory machine can be extremely useful in monitoring the chemical changes in the environment. So we contacted one of the biggest sewage plants in Shanghai—Xinchu sewage plant and paid a visit there.
During the visit, we talked with the workers in the plant, who told us the limitation of the current monitoring and expressed his expection of our memory devices.
We also learnt a lot about the basic process of sewage processing. We are surprised to find out that biological fermentation plays an important role in sewage processing. Actually, the decrease of COD value of the sewage is mainly caused by the consumption of the microbes in it. And the sewage plant has specially designed an Ultraviolet disinfection tank to get rid of most of the microbes just before the sewage is ready to be discharged into Huangpu River.
At the end of our visit, we took some samples from the biochemical reaction pool. Back to the laboratory, we used the samples to find out more possibilities of our engineered bacteria.
With both the advices and the experiment we conducted back at our laboratory, we came up with a lot of ideas that can be integrated into our project. We will talk about it in detail at the ‘hp-integrated’ page.
E-mailing the experts in biological synthesis
We have also laid eyes on the field of biological synthesis, one of the most dynamic fields among all the application of genetically engineered microbes.
We e-mailed two researchers from Shanghai institute of organic chemistry (SIOC) to learn about the current development of biological synthesis
From the conversation, we have also gained a lot.
Currently, the type of substances that can be monitored in a working fermentation tank is limited to simple molecules like oxygen"

Departing the bus near South Tottenham Station, North London, Cassie and I were walking into an industrial area consisting mainly of piles of tires, half torn down warehouses and the odd metalworker and mechanic. We weren’t expecting this on our trip to a designer-studio, but we weren’t about to meet an ordinary artist.  Malene Oddershede Bach is a rather exotic fashion designer.  Her distinct prints are described as articulate and intellectual. Apart from features in Vogue, ELLE, Marie Claire and Grazia the award winning artist (‘Ones to watch’) has acquired a loyal industry fan-base on her professional journey.

Made from images taken from various sources, she creates repeatable patterns on the computer which are printed onto the fabrics for her designs. Her designs remind me of autumn-leaves and fireworks, not dried tomatoes and cancer cells. After we sat down and discussed the design of the team t-shirt for the iGEM competition (which she is going produce), we explained that our work is aimed at stem-cell research and therapy, she got very interested: “Looking at the potential treatments stem cell therapy offers, it could be a very useful tool in future.” Stem cells have the ability to develop into any cell required. “I like this ‘bottom-up design’ approach”; starting from an image (for example a fluorescent image of mKeima ☺) she works the whole process from designing to marketing.

We had a few teams that gave detailed answers to this question, showing that they indeed anticipated this potential issue in the design of their project. However on the whole, we had the feeling that in many cases, biosafety was either not considered or taken into account only after the design and maybe the execution of the project. This led us to undertake the writing of a guide for the use of future iGEM teams that will help them to take into account potential biosafety issues at the beginning of the design of their project.
Environment Contamination Evaluation
The main goal of our project is to prevent accidental dissemination in the environment of GEO, and more specifically, of Escherichia coli, the most widely used chassis in iGEM. But before elaborating sophisticated physical and biological containment systems to prevent dissemination, we thought it would be interesting to study the E. coli survival in different natural environments.
Protocols
Environments
Our experiment aims at simulating the accidental contamination of various environments with an E. coli culture grown in LB medium. For this purpose, we chose to test different environments:
Soil, collected around the lab (GPS coordinates: 48.703073, 2.172946)
Freshwater, collected on the University campus (GPS coordinates: 48.702986, 2.168050)
Sea water, which came from the Atlantic Ocean (GPS coordinates: 47.227968, -2.176851)
Filtered sea water, which came from the Atlantic Ocean
Filtred freshwater
Isotonic water
Sterile water
LB
We chose soil, freshwater and seawater to test E. coli survival because we thought that they are most common environments that can be found in nature. As a positive control, we chose to measure the growth of E. coli in LB medium in same experimental conditions.
For the CFU count, we diluted our samples in isotonic water before plating them. To make sure that E. coli cells will not die in this medium because of a potential osmotic shock,  we chose to examine the survival of our strains in isotonic water(MgSO4 10^-2 M). To determinate whether the presence of other microorganisms in the natural water environments could have an influence on the survival of our strains, we"

To validate the results in a quantitative way, we selected Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test of Block Design as a model, in which the sum of Wilcoxon Rank Sum statistics Wj (1≤j≤m) of each block was calculated as
With the data of our experiment substituted, the statistics WBD was calculated as
Therefore MTB and control strain (E.coli) are significantly different in signal. That is, our PC Reporter system is able to distinguish the sequence of MTB genome from that of other non-specific strains.
Methods
Clone construction of split luciferase-dCas9 fusion protein
We cloned our split luciferase-dCas9 fusion protein in the pET-21a by Golden Gate assembly (Figure 14a,b).

Selection of test target sequence
Before taking the sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) genome as target of our PC reporter system, we first performed our experiments within a test target gene, which must not only conform to the substrate requirements of dCas9, but also harmless and safe enough to its bacteria carrier after chemical transformation. After screening over iGEM Registry of Standard Biological Parts, we finally took Part: BBa_K909009 (cDNA of UV-B sensing protein UVR8 from Arabidopsis thaliana (from iGEM12_ETH_Zurich) as the test target(Figure 15).
Figure 15. Schematic of Part: BBa_K909009.
sgRNA generation
To obtain sgRNA, we used SSPD to screen out all guide sequences from the entire genome and Oligo Genrator to generate oligos for Golden Gate Cloning, then inserted all guide sequences into sgRNA Generator backbone (Figure 16). Through PCR amplification and cell-free transcription using HiScirbe T7 Quick High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs), the sgRNA was produced and purified at last.We specially thank ZHAO Xuejin (Research Assistant, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences) for providing us with the sgRNA Generator!

We loaded J33201 into a kanamycin resistant backbone pSB1K3 and exchanged it with K190015 by perfoming an upstream cut of both to leave the RFP in the J61002 backbone.  [ratio of J33201 to K190015 plasmid DNA was 3:1) If the increased expression of ArsR had the effect of increasing the threshold of the arsenic response any resulting colonies of J33201 in J61002 we predicted would appear white.  To our delight this is what we found.
Our observation is consistent with the idea that an increased expression of ArsR within the cell silences the leaky pArs and raises the threshold of the response.  Another possibility is that the RFP gene is expressed at a lower level by virtue of it being in a polycistronic location downstream from the ArsR.
To test this idea we first turned the BBa_J33201 part into an ArsR-generator by adding a doulbe terminar.  Our plan was that this would constitute the gain or tuneable element in a biosensor system. We then built BBa_K935002 to test the effect of the position of the ArsR generator on pArs controlled promoter activity.  We found that the responsiveness and the senstivity of J33201 in J61002 and our BBa_K935002 to be essentially the same.
Not wanting apparent success to get in our way we hypothesized that the addition of a second ArsR generator under pArs control should further selectivley raise the threshold of the device.  We therefore added assembled our ""tuner element"" BBa_K9350001 upstream once and twice to create BBa_K935004 and BBa-K935005, respectively.  We subsequently observed a significant decrease in the sensitivity of pArs as measured by mRFP1 production.
We have subsequently employed our device to assess groundwater arsenate/arsenite presence in local waters and in samples of international waters as well.

Paris_Saclay,2014,Team:Paris Saclay#Ethics#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," we absolutely do not know every consequences it can have behind its use, there is a difference.
Partick Saint-Jean and Dominique Sciamma: First, I think it is obvious that we need to know how to define living-being. Science exposes one kind of rules to answer to this question. With this rules we are able to classify something as living-being or not. Research’s goal is to question these rules, find new rules, adjust old rules. Because nature is changing, our definition of living-being has to change too. But to my mind, a modified bacteria is still alive and thus belongs to living-being.
Thérèse Bichon: It is a difficult question. I do not think I can answer to this question properly. I believe it is more a question about being. Who are these beings. Beings which come from synthetic biology are new being. Who are they?
How does synthetic biology challenge this definition?
Morgan Meyer: I think that yes it does. We already talked about this subject a hundred years ago, so the theme is not new. But if we look at the purpose of the current synthetic biology, which exists for approximately ten years, these questions can be raised. “Have we the right to modify living-being ? », « Is it possible to use living being as a machine or a chassis?”. It is interesting especially for your project because it make sense to talk about a “program” and we may understand the bacteria with the function of it different parts. And it is a metaphor but life is not more than a computer.
How does our project raise this question?
Morgan Meyer: It is an interesting project. It is interesting to use bacteria in order to try to understand what a lemon is, its color, odor, living being? When you say to me « ceci n’est pas un citron”-this is not a lemon- it obviously reminds me Magritte’s work. It is a project that I believe is enough challenging and quite new. Then the main question which is wondering if it is still alive or if it is non-living, I think is a great question to ask. Your project is not only to create a bacteria-lemon, it is also to underline this question and bring clue about the ethical, philosophical, sociological and also cultural answers that this question is challenging. Finally, you create two things in the same time, a questioning and an artificial bacteria with the odor and color of the lemon. It reminds me that when I was in University, these questions interested me a lot: Is it real, artificial, natural?"
Glasgow,2011,Team:Glasgow#Judging Criteria_-_-_TEXT.html," This should be invaluable to any future iGEM team, and we propose that it be sent out along with the starter kits next year.
3. Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
As a new approach to human practices we endeavoured to make our day-to-day activities as visible to the public as possible. Each week, one of us created a video blog , containing a summary of what happened at the lab that week and how we were feeling about it. The videos we posted on Youtube. One team member wrote a blog at Life Sciences of Scotland , providing a more detailed description of her feelings towards the project and its progress. We also wrote an introduction to modelling suitable for the layman, that gives a straightforward, easy to understand introduction to modelling, and specifically to the model we used to test our system.  And last but not least we had a webcam running in the lab every day, that created a time-lapse video of our activities. Our wiki displays a video that condenses a full week of lab-work into about 1 minute. This video is also available to watch by any member of the public, on youtube

BIT,2017,Team:BIT-China#Model#GPCRpathway_-_-_TEXT.html," can simulate the growth of yeast in some certain condition. And we considered activated cell as effective bio-meter in our project.
Combination Model coupling single cell and yeast growth
Based on the above results, we combined these two models together to simulate the performance of whole system in population level. We multiplied the value of Yeastactive and the value of RFPmature directly.
And we altered some parameters to fit the experimental data.
The result of this combined model was shown below (Fig. 18).
Fig. 18 The simulation result of RFP intensity in population level.
Discussion
Combining two models, we discovered that the RFP intensity is almost the same as base line (value is 0) at the beginning. And after 15 hours, the fluorescence intensity were reflected from single cell level to population level.  because the cells entered into stationary phase.
As for the curve after 22 hours, the RFP intensity starts to decrease slowly in all ligand concentration. It may due to the death of cells.
We decided to select the RFP intensity at 22 hours as the final output value of sweetness signal based on our model. In order to avoid the cell growth impacts the RFP intensity, we selected this specific moment as the sampling time.
SWEETENESS MODEL
Purpose
We expected to set a model based on our above model to simulate the RFP intensity of sweetener. Make a comparison between the results of simulation and practical measurement, Our system could not only work like people gustatory sensation system with universality but also is more accurate and less interference than people.
Method
Although we finished the GPCR model, the combination rate between the sweetener and receptor had not reported or measured yet. So we needed to measure this data from wet lab.
But because of the instability of our system, we only got a useful group of data. More discussion was established in Project Page. The result was shown (Table 6). Then we utilized these values to optimize our pheromone model.
Table 6． The result of sweetness measurement using Sugar Hunter at 16 hours
Group Name

Analyzing previous methods of sweetness measurement, we made two assumptions for this sweetness model:
1. Sweetness of all sweeteners could be transformed into the different concentration of standard sucrose (10% dissolving in water) with the same sweetness.
2. The bind between different ligands and GPCR will not impact signal transduction in pheromone pathway.

Ionis_Paris,2016,Team:Ionis Paris#Biobrick Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Clones that do not incorporate the plasmid do not have the antibiotic resistance and thus cannot survive in the selective medium.  In the iGEM competition, a set of 4 linearized plasmid backbones is sent to each team: pSB1A3, pSB1C3, pSB1K3.m1, and pSB1T3. They respectively include these 4 antibiotics: Ampicillin, Chloramphenicol, Kanamycin and Tetracycline.
PRINCIPLE AND FUNCTIONING OF OUR ""BIOSENSOR"" PLASMID
The biosensor cell contains a genetic circuit, located on a plasmid support, allowing the expression of genes involved in the detection of the pollutant.  The Pr promoter is a constitutive promoter driving the transcription of the XylR gene, coding for the XylR protein. The XylR protein, a transcriptional regulatory protein for the Pu promoter, is activated by aromatic hydrocarbons that carry a methyl group (like toluene and xylene). In our biosensor, the Pu promoter allows the transcription of the bioluminescent reporter gene GLuc, coding for the Gaussia luciferase. When this enzyme reacts with its substrate, a substance called the Coelenterazine, it emits luminescence.
Figure 4: The biosensor mechanism
Plasmid map
For the construction of our plasmid, we selected parts that are RFC[10] compatible. In Figure 4 below, the map of our plasmid is represented in a simplified way, and is composed of the pSB1C3 backbone and the biosensor part.
Figure 4: Our plasmid map
Details on the used parts
Chassis
We chose to use Escherichia Coli strain DH5α as chassis for our plasmid. Indeed, this bacterium grows easily and has several mutations that make it an excellent choice for cloning procedures with a high efficiency transformation. All our parts are optimized for E. Coli. Moreover, E. Coli is a model organism, entirely sequenced.
Plasmid Backbone
We selected the pSB1C3 plasmid, a high copy number assembly plasmid, as a backbone of 2070 pb, because it is the most used type of backbone to assemble BioBricks. This plasmid backbone includes a high copy replication origin that allows a high copy number per cell which facilitates DNA purification. All the plasmid backbone used for the competition are provided with a default insert: the ccdb gene."

SCUT-China,2014,Team:SCUT-China#Project#Synthetic TKL_-_-_TEXT.html," after   laborious work of weeks, we had failed to obtain proper PCR products   due to the high G+C content (≥70%) of the interest DNA sequences.   Afterward, to achieve our goal in a more efficient way, we contracted   GENEWIZ, an international genomics service company, to synthesize the   genes. With the coding genes under the control of T7 promoter and   double T7 terminator, we successfully assembled three constructs for   our design.
We were able to assemble all of our constructs and continued our work   with our synthetic DEBS1+TE, DEBS1’+TE (KR of module2 in DEBS1 was   replaced with KR of module1) and RFP+DEBS1+TE (DEBS1 was fused with   red fluorescent protein) by transforming them into the E. coli strain   BAP1. (Fig. 2)
If the right product triketide lactone can be generated, we can   conclude that the standardized domains can work relatively   independently and generate normal product.
Also, we changed the loading domains which selected different   substrates resulting in product of different polyketides.
Furthermore, we can shuffle the domains as units between different   DEBSs.
Induction of PKSs
12-48 hours after induction with IPTG, culture broth samples of the   recombinant strain expressing the chimeric polyketide synthetases were   collected and subjected for further analysis.
Results
1. DNA Electrophoresis
We used restriction enzyme digestion and/or PCR to validate the   constructs (Fig. 3). The constructs carrying DEBS1+TE and DEBS1’+TE   were isolated and digested with EcoRI (Fig. 3, lane 1 and 2) or double   digested with EcoRI+PstI (data not shown). The construct carrying RFP  +DEBS1+TE was validated with PCR (Fig. 3 lane 3) and EcoRI+PstI double   digestion (data not shown). The results showed that all of the three    constructs were successfully created.
2. SDS-PAGE
DEBS1 is a large protein of 370kDa. We performed SDS-PAGE to confirm   the expression of the recombiant DEBS1+TE and DEBS1’+TE. However,   none of DEBS1+TE, DEBS1’+TE (data not shown) and RFP+DEBS1+TE (Fig.   4) could be detected after Co"

1.2 Chromatography-mass Spectrometry
Chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) combines the powerful separation function of chromatography with the accurate identification function of mass spectrometry (MS). It can well analyze trace levels of antibiotic residues and simultaneously determine various antibiotic components. Among them, gas chromatography, liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS) are the most widely used. This method has high detection accuracy. Pretreatment operation is relatively simple, combined with solid phase extraction pretreatment method, not only can make the separation speed and separation degree higher, but also reduce the consumption of liquid, reduce the cost of analysis. However, the detection limit achieved by this method is not             high, and the pretreatment method is tedious, inconvenient and time-consuming. [2]
2. Spectral Method
Spectrometry, as a new nondestructive and rapid detection technology, is also used to detect antibiotic residues in water. Spectral data usually need to be analyzed by chemometrics, including spectral pretreatment and modeling. The multivariate calibration model of sample composition data and spectral data was established by chemometrics. Finally, the model was used to predict unknown samples. Although spectroscopy does not require complex pretreatment, simple operation and less sample loss, and can be used for in situ detection of samples, its detection limit is inferior to chromatographic method. [2]
2.1 Infrared Spectroscopy
Infrared spectrophotometry works in the infrared light. And different chemical bonds or functional groups in the molecule can occur vibration absorption when the infrared spectrum in different positions, so it can qualitatively analyze of substances. Because of the miniaturization of dopants in water and the complexity of water, conventional one-dimensional spectroscopy cannot effectively extract the characteristic information of dopants, thus two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy must be used to analyze the information source. [2]
2.2 Fluorescence Spectrometry
Fluorescence spectroscopy is based on the mechanism of molecular absorption spectrum and fluorescence spectrum energy level transition. Substances with the ability to absorb photons can emit fluorescence longer than the excitation wavelength under a certain wavelength of light. The fluorescence spectra of materials are used for quantitative analysis. The fluorescence properties of different kinds of antibiotics are quite different, and the environmental conditions (such as solvent, temperature, pH value, surfactant, derivative reagent, etc.) also have great influence on the fluorescence characteristics.

Collaboration with SCIE-SIAT
In order to enhance the communication between iGEM teams and improve the project, SIAT-SCIE and our team co-sponsored a meet-up. We invited eight iGEM teams to attend the meet-up in Shenzhen College of International Education. Professor Haoqian Zhang               from Chinese Academy of Science was invited to join this meet-up as well. Each team had a 15-minute presentation. Before the presentation, Professor Zhang explained the evaluation criteria for iGEM competition in detail and offered many               valuable suggestions to each team. After the exhibition of projects, each team had a 10-minute question time. It was beneficial for each team to understand the projects of others. Also, it gave us a chance to help each other.
Collaboration with BGIC-Union
Meet-up On Oct 5, 2017, we communicated with BGIC-Union in a Starbucks coffee shop and exchanged details of the projects on both sides. Both our projects are related to CRISPR/Cas9 technology and have the same off-target problem. It               is therefore possible to collaborate in modeling. We compared several articles on predicting off-target effects in mathematical ways and BGIC-Union iGEMers recommended us a better method named “Cutting Frequency Determination (CFD) scoring               method”. Thus we improved our model. They also supported our modeling group a lot by introducing us biological theory. Besides, we offered them several examples of molecular kenetics model and we still keep in touch after the meet-up.
We also shared the schedule of wiki design and they wanted to offer some help. We found that both of us wanted to make a pop science video about biosafety level (BSL) with similar ideas, so we decided to do it together. In addition, they provided               us with useful information about Safety Form and Part"

        3) The system can't be easily broken by external forces in that there is no distinct boundary between calcium carbonate rock and calcium oxalate film.
        So, this research project has chosen E. coli that has been transcribed with lipase to clean some stone relics that are covered with oil; then, we use E. coli, with transcription, that can secrete oxalate acid upon the stone relics. Therefore, there forms calcium oxalate to be protection film in order to preserve lithic relics.
        If we use chemical methods to generate calcium oxalate, we have to immerse the lithic relics in the chemical liquid; however, it is not suitable for the preservation of large-scale outdoor lithic relics. In fact, the natural existing calcium oxalate comes from the reaction of oxalate acid generated by microorganism and calcium compound on the surface of stone. This research project will utilise genetic engineering methods to ""graft"" the gene that generates calcium oxalate into Escherichia coli (E. coil).
    Then oxalate acid reacts with calcium lithic relics to generate calcium oxalate, which stimulates its natural formation process. Finally, there forms a fine layer to protect the lithic relics.

Bush Signs Energy Policy Act
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 was passed to change US energy regulations, and restructuring tax incentives within the energy industries. Part of this bill included a provision that would exempt natural gas companies that use fracking from disclosing the chemicals involved that would normally be required of energy companies. While many drilling companies would benefit, it caused the started to grow skeptical about their intentions and the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing.
2011
Founding of FracFocus Chemical Disclosure Agency
According to their website, FracFocus Chemical Disclosure is a government run agency that was the first to provide public access to information on fracking and the chemicals used near homes. Naphthalene was reported as the most common, as it was found in more than 30% of all contamination sites. Recent legislation has required companies to register the chemicals they use on FracFocus, and it coordinates with reporting companies to keep updated records of contaminant history across the United States. The foundation of the site and coordinating legislation provided transparency, but few companies have been held accountable for data published through FracFocus.
2012
OptiEnz Sensors Begin Use
Since the government had loose regulations on fracking contamination and people grew more concerned about the now-reported chemicals being used, the private sector’s demand for chemical sensors increased. OptiEnz is a leading biosensor development company that was founded by a professor at Colorado State University. Their product uses extracted enzymes and fiber optics to sense real-time pollution directly in the water source, preventing the need for pretreatment and skilled labor that has been previously required.

Peking iGEM Team Improves Aromatic Transcriptional Regulators
Based on information from their wiki, the 2013 iGEM team from Peking developed many parts to detect aromatic compounds. Among those produced were the NahR transcriptional regulator combined with a salicylate promoter and an sfGFP gene that can respond to naphthalene at concentrations within an order of magnitude of the EPA’s maximum of 20 µg/L. This part was thoroughly characterized and available in the distribution kit, so it quickly became the goal of the CU 2015 team to improve its use to make the system more sensitive, easier to use, and ultimately more practical for industrial application.

Safety
Overview
    This year, team Tsinghua-A utilized synthetic biology’s techniques to build up a system in E. coli which can simulate the complicated relationships within or between populations. We want to simplify the complex systems in nature and draw some interesting conclusions from this concise system. Since any hazardous accidents were unexpected, even if the chassis organism we used were barely E.coli EPI300 and E.coli MG1655, which are classified into Risk Group 1, it was also necessary for our team members who were in charge of the wet-lab experiments to receive indispensable lab safety training. A graduate student, Peng Shuguang, and a PhD student, Wei Lei, in our lab, who are experienced and scrupulous, offered us training on experimental skills and lab safety. Here we want to share our experience on lab safety.
I General Safety Training
    Before we started our experiments, all of our team members responsible for the wet-lab experiments received detailed and rigid training on biosafety and lab safety from Wei and Peng. The training included standard experimental procedures, usage of biosafety cabinets and normative disposal of experimental waste etc. During the first few weeks since we started our experiments, either Wei or Peng stayed with us all the way in the lab to supervise our manipulations. They gave us guidance and enlightened us when necessary. During our time in lab, we kept thorough lab records, including protocols, consideration on error-prone steps and careful discussions etc. None of us conducted experiments on our own until he or she could pass a check on lab safety and experimental operations.

The goal is to produce these peptides until V. cholerae is wiped out and water becomes drinkable or usable without being dangerous.
Constraints
The AMPs have to be correctly synthesized and secreted.
They must be stable enough to keep their activities in muddy water for example.
The AMPs must properly diffuse to target bacteria.
Several factors have to be taken into account: temperature in affected countries (around 40°C (104°F)), the viscosity of water, its pH, etc.
Priority
Purification of water contaminated with V. cholerae is the central part of our project: the priority is high. Without it,  which is the first goal of the project, the contract won’t be fulfilled.
Technical specifications
Safety
Ingestion of the GMMs
The exchanges of molecules between the compartment containing GMMs and water must be feasible but the GMMs must not go into water. Actually, on the one hand, the CAI-1 molecule of the V. cholerae quorum sensing must diffuse to the compartment containing the detecting bacteria, V. harveyi. On the other hand, the AMPs produced by P. pastoris must go from the compartment containing the GMMs to the water contaminated with V. cholerae. However, class I GMMs must be kept out of the purified water.
Spreading of the GMMs
GMMs must not be spread in the environment. The compartment containing them must be impact- and break-resistant. People need to be aware that GMMs should not be disseminated in the environment.
Human toxicity of the AMPs
AMPs will be produced and released in water with the aim of wiping out V. cholerae. The amount of AMP remaining in water should not be toxic to humans. Experimentations must be done to know the quantity of AMPs in the water supposed to be drunk and especially their effects on epithelial cells (esophagus, stomach, intestines, etc.).
Limiting media leaks
The proportion of nutrients should be correctly calculated so that they are all consumed during the lifetime of GMMs. An excess of nutrients in the compartment could then diffuse into the water and cause the emergence of new microorganisms.

No one can make great progress without advice and golden ideas from their excellent partners. During last six month, we participated in some iGEM conferences or even worked as the innovative online meeting organizers. Hopefully these events contributed greatly to all of us.
The CCiC
The 5th CCiC , which full name is the Conference of China iGEMer Community Meetup, was held at ShanhaiTech University on the subject of “Among us, past, present and future meeting” from August 27th to 31th. Dozens of teams from all over the China as well as the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer if the iGEM Foundation, Meagan Lizarazo took part in. During this conference, we fortunately got the chance to have deep communication with many iGEM teams including iGEM_BIT(Beijing Institute of Technology University), iGEM Tianjin (Tianjin Unniversity) and LZU_China (Lanzhou University), and here we really appreciated their advices on our project about the competitive experiments, Kai ABC systems and the OMVs systems. Luckily, we won the best presentation award. What's more, we were greatly benefited from Meagan’s lecture pointing out the importance of “After iGEM"
