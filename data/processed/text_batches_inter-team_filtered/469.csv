TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," on different bacterial targets.E. Coli DH5α and B. Subtilis. The probability of false-positive output for crRNA1-3 on E. Coli DH5α and crRNA 4 on B. Subtilis. (off-target genomes) is significantly lower than for the targeted genome, because there are multiple on-target sites.
We conclude that the design of the crRNAs is reliable as only minute off-target effects in the order of one in a million are observed. In addition, we gain a deeper insight into the effect of having multiple on-targets in the genome: this increases the sensitivity of the detection method but does not affect the reliability. As such, our tool assesses the design of the crRNAs by iGEM LMU-TUM Munich to be clever and to allow reliable detection. We thank iGEM LMU-TUM Munich for the fun collaboration and look forward to meeting them again at the Giant Jamboree.
Hamburg
iGEM Hamburg is another team whose project’s goal is the fight against antimicrobial resistance, on their case, by developing novel antibiotic compounds capable of dealing with multiresistant bacteria.
It all started with a series of preliminary conversations prompted by the common goal of our projects and the presence of a former student from Hamburg in our team. During the poster presentation held at our European Meet-up, both of our teams had the chance to get to know each other better and become more familiar with the science to our projects. Ideas ranging from stabilizing the siderophores in Hamburg’s antibiotic with our TDPs, to detecting a carbapenem-resistant strain with our device and eliminating it with Hamburg’s antibiotic turned into proposals.
Unfortunately, none of the aforementioned could be carried out due to time constraints and the prerequisite of our projects being in a stage as advanced as to enable the collaborations. Many thanks to iGEM Hamburg for traveling all the way from Hamburg to our European Meet-up to share their interesting ideas to make this world a better place!
We thank our sponsors:

Do you think there is a need for a multi-diagnostic test that provides a distinct diagnosis between malaria and diseases that present similar symptoms? In developing countries such as Ethiopia, what level of government involvement is present in the healthcare system? Is there a positive mindset regarding these initiatives of distribution of diagnostics and is there a potential for subsidization?
Throughout the week we also started working on the presentation for Geneva Conference. We started by creating an outline of important points that we want to mention in the presentation. We also started considering the possible format of the presentation and the 2 choices were a power point or a video.
Week 12: July 21st - July 25th
This week we continued working on the presentation for Geneva conference. This week Policies and Practices sub-team also presented their work to the rest of the team. We used the presentation prepared for Geneva conference because it summarized what we have done and it was a chance for us to get feedback on the presentation from the rest of the team.
This week additionally we decided to work on our human practices interviews and set up times with our three experts on Malaria misdiagnosis to ensure that we have a variety of perspectives to help us with informed design.  Having the perspectives of qualified individuals that have worked in this industry all over the world will help us make choices to accurately represent any challenges we may face within our device.  Everyone was very helpful and forwarded details of their research and additional resources that will help us locate the information that will assist with informed design.  This assistance ensures that our project is authentic with real application in the developing world and that we will make the appropriate design considerations.
Week 13: July 28th - August 1st
This week 4 representatives from our team went to Geneva for Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention. More information on our trip can be found here .  Attending the Biological Toxin and Weapon Convention gave the four representatives from our team the opportunity to showcase the iGEM competition on an international stage - and show the individuals responsible for influencing and creating policy the level of synthetic biology research and competition that occurs at the undergraduate level.  This level of publicity for the iGEM foundation was noted by several Non-Governmental Organizations and guests of the meeting and appreciated by country delegations.  Aspects of the convention such as the poster presentation allowed the four individuals to network and communicate ideas with individuals such as the FBI and other university researchers that were familiar with iGEM and others whom had never heard of the organization and were very interested to learn"

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," governs year round Varroa mite mortality when they emerge from a brood cell.
Figure 21: Mean worker bee population over 10 years plotted against year round Varroa mite mortality at emergence from brood cell.
With 10 replicates the variance is relatively low, particularly when the mean worker bee population is high. To analyse the full BeeT module we chose to use 5 replicates. This is a compromize between simulation time Over 110,000 parameter sets were simulated. and reduction of variance.
We first separated the results of the analyses of the full BeeT module based on the three scenarios. The results can be seen in Figure 22. Within this 2D graph the axis are either degradation in the hive or degradation outside the hive, and impact of BeeT on Varroa mite mortality. Additionally, the mean population of worker bees surviving winter is color coded. We can see that the highest mean population is in the bottom right corner with the scaling factor affecting the results strongly. Additionally, degradation inside the hive has a greater impact on mean population than degradation outside the hive. This can be seen by comparing the top right corner of both panels.
Figure 22: 2D graph with either degradation in the hive or degradation outside the hive, and impact of BeeT on Varroa mite mortality on its axes. Results are color coded with mean population of bees after winter. The left panel has degradation outside the hive on its y-axis, degradation inside the hive is averaged out for each point. The right panel has degradation inside the hive on its y-axis, degradation outside the hive is averaged out for each point.
BeeT Beehave - Discussion and Conclusions
Currently it is unclear how effective BeeT will be at combating Varroa mites since, primarily, toxicity is difficult to measure in the lab and deploying BeeT in the field has many regulatory issues. For these reasons, we built a BeeT module for the well known beehave model to assess the minimum effectiveness for certain treatments. We also examined two different periods for administering the BeeT: autumn and during spring. We chose autumn to analyse the effect of BeeT on the Varroa mite population since honey bee populations are at their most fragile during the winter following this period. This way we strengthen the honey bees since winter is coming. Additionally, it is normal for current beekeeper practices to supplement hives with sugar water during autmn and, thus, applying BeeT at this time would provide a minimal amount of disturbance for beekeepers.
The advantage of administering BeeT during spring is that"

Mycelium Material & Habitat Development
Plating and growing cultures of mycelia
Mycelium is able to grow on almost any substrate, so long as the substrate contains sufficient nutrients and is not toxic to the fungus. Though various substrates were tested, a standardized substrate is required to observe the growth of mycelium in different conditions. It has also been found that the growth medium of Potato Dextrose Yeast Agar (PDYA) provides the optimal nutrients for mycelium growth [1, 2], without providing excessive nutrients that will encourage bacterial growth and contamination. The solid PDYA growth medium used in the lab consisted of 2.0% dextrose, 0.10% potato extract, 0.15% yeast extract, 1% agar, and 96.50% water. When growing the mycelium as a liquid culture, the liquid PDY growth medium is composed of 2.0% dextrose, 0.10% potato extract, 0.15% yeast extract, and 97.50% Water [3]. The mycelium can then begin to grow on the PDYA medium by extracting a small piece from the live fungus onto the plate, as shown in the sequence of images below.

PT5lac promotor arrived today
Summary so far
Blue output: B0034-amilCP (BOA) is assembled and sequenced and is ready for the final step. PfixK-λC1.inv is assembled but not yet sequenced. Blue output will soon be ready for the final assembly.
Red output: Final assembly has been done several times with unsuccessful result. The reason for the problem is not clear. There seems to be a problem in the assembly of PompC-tetR.inv + B0034-RFP. Over and over again we can only see the band for tetR.inv on the gel. The sequence comes back with bad result every time. However, sequencing of the two individual components is good. Our screening method is might not be good enough.
We decided to resume the attempt with mcherry and use it as a backup in case we would fail totally.
Green output: Final assembly (pSB1K3-pcpcG2 + B0034-amilGFP) is done and the sequencing data showed perfect assembly. However, we are considering putting the final construct in a low copy plasmid (pSB3C5) because the promotor is slightly leaky.
Chromophore assembly: Last assembly pSB4A5-PlacO-B0034-ho1 (CA2B) + B0034-pcyA-Term (CA2A) has been done but the sequencing result showed double peaks. Needs to be sequenced again. We will also check the previous assembly step CA2B by sending it for sequencing. At this stage we are considering an alternative assembly. We believe that ho1 activity decreases the concentration of Hem. Hence we will put the PLlacO promotor last.
Red sensor: chp8 has been mutagenized two times to remove the illegal PstI site. The first time showed a large insert. Thus the mutagenezis has to be redone and send for sequencing.
Green sensor: the mutation of ccaS has been a tough one. It has to be mutagenized two times and the first sequencing result showed an insert. Assuming that we were un-fortuned to pick a colony with inserts. We went back and choose other colonies. It was the right assumption because the second sequencing was correct. ccaR is already assembled with B0034.
Blue sensor: Since the arrival of all the components the assembly of the blue sensor took of quit well. B0034-fixJ showed good sequencing results but B0034"

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design-N_-_-_TEXT.html," be used in conjunction with a riboswitch expression platform to affect the expression of a reporter gene. Our research uncovered a previous iGEM BioBrick (BBa_K1913011) that used a trans-functioning riboswitch to indirectly affect the expression of an RFP reporter gene directly affecting the expression of a TutR inverter protein as well as another paper describing the in-vitro characterization of several progesterone-specific RNA aptamers. We attempted to mimic the same TutR inverter system as in the previously described BioBrick until we found another paper describing a more fitting option.
PoPPY-switch
The expression platform of the hammerhead ribozyme has been altered to be more accommodating to the attachment of arbitrary RNA aptamers, giving us the modularity and cross-domain function needed to create our sensor. With this new information, our project then became the creation of a novel single gene reporter system.
Win and Smolke (2007) published research on the hammerhead ribozyme, which works across varying domains, where they increased the modularity of the expression platform by adding two small nucleotide sequences labeled as the switching and competing strands as seen in Figure 1.5 (Win and Smolke, 2007). This system allows for the combination of arbitrary aptamers with the hammerhead expression platform. In its active state, the hammerhead ribozyme causes a cleavage event in the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of the transcribed mRNA, resulting in accelerated degradation of the mRNA strand. Depending on the location and sequence of the switching and competing strands, the hammerhead ribozyme can be either constitutively active or inactive, with ligand binding switching it to the opposite state.
The riboswitch will consist of the hammerhead ribozyme expression platform, a progesterone-specific aptamer, and switching/competing strands oriented so that the ribozyme is constitutively active and then inactivated by rising progesterone concentrations. For our purposes, hrGFP will be the transcribed reporter gene. Progesterone bound to the aptamer will halt the degradation of hrGFP mRNA and allow our Y. lipolytica cells to produce GFP product. In this way we can detect the presence of progesterone by the fluorescence of GFP when progesterone is bound, and we can use SELEX to create aptamers that are less sensitive to progesterone and will show visible fluorescence when the culture reaches medically useful levels.

We also held small competitions: jump roping with ropes made of reaction tubes and filling up pipette tip boxes as fast as possible. The kids could win golden Bluecaps filled with sweets and we made sure they won all the time. For the adult visitors we presented posters to understand our project and our approach and for everyone we had planned an experiment for DNA extraction. For our DNA extraction we took an experiment from CommunityBricks and modified it.  We wanted our common day to be multimedial, so we showed a video about Synthetic Biology (taken from TechNyou . Credits to the iGEM Team from Bonn for translating, thank you. Click here to watch the video in german. Kevin also made a short video about plenty of different microorganisms, showing impressive electromicroscopic pictures (pictures were taken from wikipedia and from working groups of our university. Of course we wanted to know what people thought about our common day. Did they understand our goals and how was their opinion? Here you can read more about the evaluation of the feedback.
Conclusion
Our poster to illustrate the development of biology to Synthetic Biology.
The SynBioDay - StreetScience was a great success. Everything from organization to realization worked just fine. We could talk to a lot of people about Synthetic Biology and our project and they gave us a positive feedback. People were interested and fascinated by our project. They not only unterstood our goals, but also found it helpful, innovative and informative. We answered nearly all their questions and also got several applications for internships, which we sadly could not accept. The visitors acknowledged our collaboration with the iGEM team from SDU-Denmark and everyone was impressed how easy it is to extract DNA and that it is possible to “see” DNA. Especially the kids amazed and happy to take home their self-extracted fruit DNA. Looking at microorganisms through the microscope was fascinationg for kids and adults and everyone had a lot of fun. The possibility of Synthetic Biology to add new characteristics to microorganisms did not frighten the people, but led to an unterstanding of this new field of science and its potential applications.
We did a survey to have an evaluation about our booth and about possible errors. Here you can find the results.

Bob: So that’s my point, don’t be afraid to make it personal. Angela: Do you mind telling us about why you got into Quirks and Quarks? Like why did you become a radio host? Bob: My story is not the normal story of a science journalist. Most people who are science journalists now in radio and television, they have a science degree, and they go to journalism school. And I think now in Halifax, you have one in King’s College that teaches journalism. So that you learn about journalism and how to tell stories, about the technology, how to record, how to build a story, how to put together a radio or a program. And you go out into the workplace and find a job. Well I didn’t do any of that. Well, I’ve always enjoyed science since I was a kid, I found science fascinating, the way it looks at the world, the way it finds out things that we didn’t know before and I’ve always liked it. But when I went into school I found out that I wasn’t very good at doing it. You know, I could understand, but I was terrible at math, and terrible at chemistry, I just had trouble with formulas and stuffs. I’m really good when someone tells me a story. I’m really good at listening when someone tells me something. So, I’m actually a university dropout. I didn’t finish getting a degree, and I didn’t know what I was going to do with myself so I worked construction and drove a truck. And the path to where I am now came about because friends and later colleagues and mentors opened doors for me and said, hey, why don’t you try this. And I always said, ok, I’ll try that, even though I had never done it. The first opportunity was to be an instructor at the Ontario Science Centre in Toronto, and they were looking for people who had an interest in science but could also communicate very well. When I was in school, I did a lot of drama. So standing before an audience was fun, I really liked that, so they were looking for people to do shows in science, at the science centre. So I got a job there doing that. So I had to learn the science very quickly, and I found that easy because I was interested in it, so I started to make science fun using props, demos,"

Transcription Activator-Like Effectors (TALEs) are naturally occurring proteins that bind to DNA. These proteins are found in Xanthomonas species, a plant pathogen, and originally serve as a pathogenic factor. Because TALEs have a highly conserved modular region for DNA binding, they are particularly amenable to genetic engineering and customization. To find out more about what TALEs are, how they work and how they have been used for, check our TALEs background page.
For proof of concept, we worked with TALEs from the Parts Registry. To check our characterization on Registry TALEs, click here .
For our detecting system itself, we have engineered TALE proteins that binds to two different regions of the Shiga Toxin II gene, Stx2, found in E. coli and other entero-haemorrhagic bacteria. Learn more about the design considerations of our engineered TALEs by clicking here .

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#modelFeatures_-_-_TEXT.html," are all originated from DNA, and they are considered as “Sequence”. Sequence can be connected to other parts of sequence on a chain. On the contrary, parts of compartment and compound are considered as “Non-sequence”. Parts of non-sequence cannot be connected to any other part on a chain, which means, they can only exist on a One-Part-Chain. Substituent is used as a substitution of any other part, so it can be either sequence or non-sequence.
It is important here to mention that the Sequence/Non-sequence division is only a rule guide the modeling. It is not a constraint to Chain-Node model. Actually, we choose to maximally preserve the flexibility and leave all the freedom of constructing a species to users. Users are allowed to construct ANY species they can using Chain-Node Model. For example, one can create a strange species with compartment, compound, and DNA parts on the same chain, which makes little sense in biology. So, it is really up to the users to decide how to use Chain-Node Model in modeling.
Abstract Concept of Node
Node is used to characterize binding structure in biological complex. Node is an abstract concept of binding site or site that can be bond. Links always exist between a binding site and the sites it binds together, indicating the relationship between them. We use trees to represent the binding structure in complex. The parent node represents the binding site, and the child node represents the bond sites. For example the binding structure of TetR dimer is considered as a TetR2 node with two TetR nodes as its children. There is one exception though, the ROOT node. ROOT node is used as the top node in a tree. It can only have one child and no parent. The function of ROOT is to indicate that its child is the last binding site in this tree, and it binds to nothing any more.
In the reactions of promoter repression and activation, the promoter is repressed or activated after binding with repressor or inducer. So its properties are changed, and it is not the original promoter any more. This is an example where binding changes the properties of node. Since we do not store all the possible property alterations within one part, the solution is to replace the old part with a new part that stores the correct properties.
Available nodes can be both a part on a chain or a node of binding site, which leaves a lot of possibilities in constructing complicated binding structure. Again, there are no restrictions, but parts of compartments are not suggested to appear in a binding structure.

This prompted us to refine the analysis of our strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) ( Hill et al, 1997 ) to distill our core values from our challenges. Subsequently, we integrated all values and feedback into our design requirements and we reflected on future implications and applications of our method based on our SWOT analysis.

Proteins such as Zinc fingers and TALEN’s require extensive amino acid sequence design and optimalisation for each genetic difference in gene doping and thus are no feasible method for the detection of gene doping. Therefore, we decided to use a dxCas9 with flexible guide RNA libraries to find the gene doping sites effectively. In this way we do not only guarantee versatility within gene doping detection, but might also soon improve viral detection, fetal DNA screening and food safety maintenance. These are only a few examples of areas where we have identified interested parties as can be read more about on the Entrepreneurship page .
4.2 Efficient, High throughput, Limiting costs
As became apparent from a visit to the doping authority, initial development costs are not the big problem. It is the costs that are inherent to the up-scaling that matter to them. Therefore, we made sure our method is efficient, low cost, and high throughput. Professor Hagan Bayley from Oxford University, cofounder of Oxford Nanopore Technologies, pointed us at the value of barcoding and subsequent multiplexing to enhance the sequencing efficiency. Also, we decided to add our gold nanoparticle prescreen based on the visit to the Dutch Doping Authority. In this way we reduce the amount of samples that will need sequencing, reducing the costs. Lastly, our fusion protein makes targeted sequencing possible that not only significantly speeds up the analysis, but also greatly reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored.
4.3 Accuracy and Reliability
Limiting the risk for false positives has been one of our most prominent focuses, because false accusations can ruin athlete’s lives. Therefore, we adhere much value to the build-in double verification.  After a prescreen, we use sequence"

To what extends have this experience changed the way you conceive your future job?
The answers here are very different between us. Some confirmed their initial goal but for some other new careers have been considered, even if always in relation with biology. So this project truly helped us to define our career.
What comes to your mind when you are told about biotechnologies?
We are not actually neutral for this question since we all want to work in the biotechnological field in the future. We are all amazed with the possibilities that synthetic biology opens to our world. From within the iGEM project, we realized that a fence exists between the lab and society. In France, there is a paradoxical mix between excitation and fear when it comes to sciences, mainly due to the fact that people do not know enough, especially about synthetic biology. During this year, we have done our best to change this by participating to events and school interventions (and many other activities as described in this human practices section). We all hope that it contributed to change the point of view of people about biotechnologies.
EXTENDED THOUGHT
We hope that our individual thoughts helped you to know a little more about our team and how we perceive biotechnologies. iGEM has actually impacted our life, and the way we feel our position in the society. Do not hesitate to share your own feelings with us on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram!

Amandine Verdier
Why did you take part in iGEM?
The iGEM competition is a real adventure, at both scientific and human levels. I choose to take part to iGEM to have the opportunity to create a scientific project, to choose the subject I like, and  carry it out during 8 months.
What was your responsability during this project?
I was in charge of the entrepreneurship part that consisted in conceiving the start up that could born from Cerberus. I was also present in the lab to do all the experiments needed.
What did you learn from this experience?
I learned to be autonomous in the lab, and to plan experiments. I learned so many things, I could not summarize them. Most importantly, I learnt how communication is important in a group of people who did not work the same way.

UNSW_Australia,2016,Team:UNSW Australia#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," we realised once we got there that we forgot to bring our negative control - a strain with just RFP - and so the strength of our data was weakened.
Week 11: August 8 - August 14
CRISPR Team
We first sequenced our expression strains to check for the genes degS, degP, and tolA. Then, we used arabinose and aTc to activate CRISPR-Cas9 with the sgRNA for degS! We also managed to miniprep the degP- and tolA-sgRNA plasmids, but we saw nothing when we ran them on a gel; we then PCR amplified the sgRNA region of this plasmid, ran that on a gel and saw that it was present, then sent it off for sequencing
Overexpression Team
Despite the orders we made last week, we still retried the phospho-primer PCR of the two alMGS fragments, ligated them, and ran the product on a gel. However, the gel turned out as a smear, meaning no clear band could be excised for purification.
We also transformed our tolR and g3p expression products into the expression strains, ready for further analysis next week!
Week 12: August 15 - August 21
CRISPR Team
We ran into a roadblock where our double transformants (with both Cas9 and any of the sgRNA plasmids) began to grow really slowly, taking days to appear on the relevant double-antibiotic plates. This week was spent trying out different growth conditions, media, antibiotic concentrations, to try to help our cells grow.
Overexpression Team
Lots of work this week! First, we cured both of our expression strains of a thermolabile plasmid - this gave us a plasmid-free version (tested for its antibiotic sensitivity) of the expression strain, to use as a negative control. We then ran our first SDS-PAGE using total protein samples extracted from empty, tolR-expression, and g3p-expressing versions of both expression strains. We stained with GelCode Blue protein stain, looking for extra bands at 9kDA for each of tolR and g3p relative to the negative control. With the help of our advisor we sent in one of these bands to the Mass Spectrometer (which later came back negative).
The following day, we reran the protein samples on the SDS-PAGE, and this time performed a Western Blot, with the primary antibody targeting g3p's and tolR's His-tag. Unfortunately, while the positive"

Paris_Bettencourt,2013,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Detect_-_-_TEXT.html," the sensor system will spread all over a population, to get a clear color output if the target has been detected. Depending on target sequence the system carries, we can identify different antibiotic resistances in a strain. This is a novel approach of detecting genes in bacterial strains. We used E.coli and a M13 phagemid to target the kanamycin resistance gene.
This sensor is a proof of concept for a similar system in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Such a system could potentially be used to test if a patient has TB and what type of resistance genes the specific strain contains to adapt the patient’s drug treatment.
Figure 1: Detection and reporting of an antibiotic resistance gene with a CRISPR/Cas system.
After expression of the Cas9 and gRNA, the gRNA guides the Cas9 to the target sequence, the kanamycin resistance. There, the Cas9 generates a double strand break. This activates the SOS response. The reporter LacZ is under the pRECA promoter, which gets activated during the SOS response and we get a blue cell, if the resistance gene has successfully been detected.
Motivation and existing TB sensors/tests
   Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health problem. While the treatment of this disease in countries with adequate medical care is fairly easy to detect and treat, it remains hard to treat and diagnose in poorer countries.
Up to now, a high quality lab that uses modern diagnostics is a prerequisite for early, rapid and accurate detection of TB. Therefore, diagnosis of TB and drug resistant TB remains a particular challenge for laboratory systems, especially in developing countries.
The lack of cheap, quick and accurate tests make it hard to control the Tuberculosis epidemic, which claims millions of lives every year in developing countries.
Setting up a cheap, fast and culture-based method could therefore decrease diagnostic time and facilitate patient treatment.
The most common method for diagnosing TB nowadays is sputum smear microscopy, in which bacteria are observed in sputum samples of patients under the microscope. However, this cannot be used to identify paucibacillary (containing just a few bacteria) or extrapulmonary (outside of the lungs) TB.
   Diagnosis methods using culture methods require laboratory infrastructure that is not widely available in countries with a high burden of TB and results are only available after a few weeks.  Other conventional methods used to diagnose multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) also rely on the culturing of specimens followed by drug susceptibility testing (DST). Results take weeks to obtain and not all laboratories have the capacity to perform DST of first-line or of second-line drugs"

The principle of electroporation relies on creating small holes in the cell wall of bacteria, by sending a current through them. The plasmids enter the bacteria through the holes before the organism repairs them.
The iGEM Team Freiburg and the iGEM Team Bonn collaborated in order to obtain working transformation protocols for Bacillus subtilis. The resulting manual “How to Bacillus subtilis” can be found on our site:
Collaborations Page
Protocol Part
To acquire electrocompetent Bacillus subtilis, the bacteria had to be cultivated overnight in LB medium. 500 μl of the preculture were added to each of the 3 flasks containing 20ml of competency medium (LB medium containing 0.5M Sorbitol) and the cultures were incubated at 37°C 250 rpm shaking till a OD600nm between 0.5 and 0.7/ml was reached. Glycine was added as a weakening agent, replacing the alanine in the cell wall leading to loosen it, for total concentrations of 1%, 1,25% and 1,5% in the different flasks. This was followed by a 60min incubation. The cells were cooled on ice for 15min and were pelleted by centrifuging at 8500 rpm for 10min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and the cell pellet was washed repeatedly through a circle of resuspending, pelleting and discarding of supernatant. The washing steps were performed with washing buffer (0.5M Sorbitol, 0.5M Mannitol and 10% Glycerol). Finally all pellets were combined and resuspended in washing buffer. Aliquots were made and were frozen in liquid nitrogen before being stored at -80°C.
Figure 1: Electroporation efficiency for Bacillus subtilis dependent on glycine concentration.
Glycine is supposed to act as a weakening agent, by replacing the alanine in the cell wall and thereby loosening it 2.
Electroporation worked best with a higher glycine concentration. However a too high concentration prevents bacterial growth and could also be toxic. The highest colony number was measured by using a mixture of all three glycine concentrations (1%,1.25% and 1.5%) for the preparation of electrocompetent cells.
In order to transform the microorganisms, an electroporator was used with the fitting cuvettes. For the electroporation a mix out of plasm"
LMU-Munich,2014,Team:LMU-Munich#Project#Bakillus_-_-_TEXT.html," in S. pneumoniae is the focus of current research.
Natural Transformation in S. pneumoniae
In S. pneumoniae, biofilm production and competence for natural genetic transformation are triggered by a two component regulatory system, responsive to environmental stimuli. There, a peptide pheromone called competence-stimulating-peptide (CSP) binds to and consequently activates the membrane-embedded sensor kinase ComD by changing the conformation of the polytopic kinase. ComD autophosphorylates and subsequently transphosphorylates the cognate response regulator ComE. ComE acts as transcription activator via binding to the -10 promoter regions of early and late competence genes. These ComE binding sites (CEbs) consist of a 9 bp direct repeat seperated by a stretch of 12 nucleotides.
Fig. 2: Competence regulation in Streptococcus pneumoniae. See text for more details. (Jonsborg et al. 2009)
A positive feedback loop ensures the availability of the two component system by activating the expression of the comCDE operon, where comDE encodes for the two component system ComDE and comC for the precursor peptide pre-CSP. Pre-CSP is cleaved to the mature peptide pheromone and transported to the extraplasmic room by the ABC transporter ComAB, whose expression is also activated by ComE. (8) .  In addition, ComE~P is able to trigger the expression of comX and comW , encoding for the alternative σ-factor X, and its stability factor ComW. This alternative σ-factor is required for the transcription of the so called late competence genes involved in the process of DNA uptake and recombination.
We are working with the genomic DNA of the nonencapsulated apathogenic strain R6 of S. pneumoniae, whose genome is completely sequenced (9) . CSP is a 17 amino acid long linear protein  with the following amino acid sequence: Glu-Met-Arg-Leu-Ser-Lys-Phe-Phe-Arg-Asp-Phe-Ile-Leu-Gln-Arg-Lys-Lys-OH (10) with a charged N-terminal residue and a positively charged C-terminal tail (11) .

Science Day Exhibition
April, at Seoul National Science Museum
For two continuous days, we ran a booth in ‘Family Science Day Exhibition’ hosted by Seoul National Science Museum. Since the museum was mainly for young children, we prepared activities for them and the parents. First of all, we brought many jellies and helped them make ‘sweet DNA' models. During the activity, the kids could learn the structure of DNA molecules and its basic properties. While the children making the sweet DNAs, we explained about synthetic biology and it principles using posters that we made and GFP samples to the parents. Besides, we made some other booth organizers or adults to play the “BioBrick Puzzle” which Team UT Tokyo made in 2012. Since it was also a software project, we could learn which features are needed when constructing a software.

We joined the “iGEM Korean Team Meetup” which took place on 15th of August. Our team not only introduced our project 'Gil', but also support and mentor Korean High School iGEM teams participating the Giant Jamboree this year. By helping Ellan Vital Korea organize the meeting, we shared our experiences about Jamboree and research. It was a great time to share an opinion about each project. As they gave us feedback on our program as well, we were able to improve the ‘Gil’ to be more user-friendly.

Our aim does not stop in just informing people about synthetic biology and ‘Gil’. We tried to give realistic help to people who have a deep interest in Biology. So we gave lectures to undergraduate students of Korea University. Through this, we advertised iGEM and introduced our software program ‘Gil’. By letting them use our program, we made them grow their interest in the field and helped them realize how synthetic biology can be helpful in everyday life.

This year, we created a detecting system for antioxidants. It is unprecedented to solve                             this difficult problem by synthetic biological strategy.
See                                 our results page. Our system gave a similar result to CAA assay in three selected antioxidant tests，which proves our system can detect the antioxidant in living cell successfully!
Special prize
This year, we want to fight for the Best Applied Design Special Prize.
Oxidation damage, aging and relative diseases are global concerns which highly relate to human health and the sole treatment is antioxidant. However, detection approaches to antioxidant are                         quite limited, especially those for the living-cells. Traditional methods focused more on                         direct redox reaction which may have non-proper navigation to living systems. Living cells are                         integrated with multiple natural anti-oxidant systems, including anti-oxidant enzyme system,                         reductive system, post-damage repair system and etc, which makes it sophisticated to evaluate                         real effects from exogenous antioxidant. The distinctions in living cells make some huge cost                         on dining antioxidant senseless. To solve this real-world problem, a corresponding “living                         antioxidant detection device” was built via synthetic biology manners this year. Yeast was set                         as our host cell as it can present a simple but accurate measuring platform for us. Then, we                         constructed multiple functional gene circuits to implement ROS regulating, endogenous redox                         reaction testing, feedback regulation and so on. Our goal is to make it easily, accurately,                         fast and economically to detect antioxidant, and contribute to world real feasible                         antioxidants.

UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html," a small section within the gene and to select for mutants within it we decided to adapt a side project that we had been mulling over. The goal of this project was to utilize Cas9 and an sgRNA with a base pairing region corresponding to a region of interest within a gene in order to select against non-mutants in that particular domain. This Cas9 selected mutagenesis project was originally going to be geared towards screening genomic mutants, but we elected to alter the project design to focus moreso on plasmid mutagenesis so as to increase its fitness for usage alongside our banana project.
The idea behind this project is to use the specific endonuclease activity of Cas9 as a screening tool in order to cleave genes that are unmutated in a region of interest. There are therefore two important aspects of this project that must be considered. First is the production of Cas9 and a compatible sgRNA molecule with a base pairing region corresponding to the region of interest within a gene. Second is the presence of the gene of interest that will have preferably undergone some form of random mutagenesis. These two elements would then be encoded on separate plasmids with compatible origins of replication and differing antibiotic resistance markers. Other than this, another major consideration in terms of utilizing this system would be the proper design of the sgRNA and the assurance that a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) exists near the region of interest.
We believe that the strength of this system lies in its ability to screen for mutations that do not produce an easily observed phenotypic change. However, in order to test the efficacy of the system we opted to use GFP as it is both well characterized gene and capable of producing a variety of different mutations that would allow for easier screening down the line. The known mutations for GFP have also been well studied which made it very easy for us to identify the chromophore region of the gene as the ideal site to target with our Cas9 screening system in order to show a proof of concept.
Cas9 Mutagenesis Projects
Experiments
In order to tweak our system for use alongside GFP, we first identified our region of interest within the GFP gene as the chromophore encoding region and proceeded to scan the nearby DNA for a PAM site. In the case of the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 that we were using, the PAM site was 5'-NGG-3'. Unfortunately, since the base pairing region for an sgRNA is limited in terms of size to about 20-25 base pairs and since there were no PAM sites near our 9 base"
Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Hydrocarbon_-_-_TEXT.html,". The resulting gel verification images were inconclusive as they did not show the required banding pattern around 50bp. Meanwhile, colony PCR was run on colonies transformed with katG-LAA constructed into a PSB1C3 backbone, as well as the hpaC+J13002 construct. katG was shown to have been successfully amplified, verifying its presence in the colonies, so overnight cultures were prepared and subsequently miniprepped. On the other hand, the construct was not successful so a third attempt was carried out. Colony PCR treatments that used either R0011 forward primers or B0034 primers were used and the overall constructs were made either on a chlor-resistant, or amp-resistant vector. Preliminary images of the gel verification appeared to have confirmed the construct, although sequencing verification will be the final indicator of overall success.
Denitrification
The restriction digested Car genes were ligated into vector PSB1C3 and transformed into competent E. coli cells. White colonies grew for CarAa and CarAc suggesting that ligation and transformation were successful, however no colonies grew for CarAd suggesting that the transformation did not work. Colony PCR was performed to confirm the presence of these genes within the vectors, however only CarAc was positive. The colonies containing the CarAc plasmid were then mini prepped and restriction digested to isolate the plasmid and send for sequencing. Further attempts at transforming CarAa and CarAd were not successful. Another goal was to perform colony PCR on the P. putida to isolate the AntABC genes using both the primers for the entire operon and those for the individual genes. No attempt showed any bands, although salt and temperature gradients were used as well as different types of polymerase. LD2 cultures were grown up to be plasmid prepped and genomic prepped in order to have a higher concentration of template DNA in the PCR master mix and more PCR will be attempted on these genes next week. Mutagenesis primers were also designed this week to remove the illegal restriction cut sites in the CarAd and AntB genes (NotI and 2xEcoRI respectively). Only 1 mutagenesis primer was designed for AntB as one of its EcoRI sites was very close to the beginning of the gene and could be removed using a new primer. During this process it was also discovered that the original Ant primers were designed for the wrong genes and therefore do not match the intended sequence. Although the new AntABC primers were designed using the correct gene the PCR may not be working due to the length of the operon so"
Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," stronger adhesive on mycelium, and provides evidence that by adding the chitin binding domain to csgA we were able to successfully make the protein a mycelium-specific glue. CBD4x, while still performing better on cardboard, did not decrease in efficiency as much as Elmer’s glue or fp151 which shows, albeit less dramatically, that chitin binding domains can be functionalized as mycelium specific bioadhesives.
Once we identified csgA-CBD as our best mycelium specific bioadhesive, we collaborated with the DTU-Denmark iGEM Team to test our glue on their mycelium grown from a different fungus. The DTU-Denmark Team’s mycelium was grown from the fungus Aspergillus oryzae while ours was grown from Ganoderma lucidum. When we performed a lap shear test using our csgA-CBD glue on DTU’s mycelium samples that were shipped to us in the mail, the maximum adhesive strength reached was 6.7 kPa. While this was still significant adhesion, it was lower than the 28.2 kPa reached with Ganoderma lucidum. The difference in adhesive strength, however, provided useful information about the variability in surface composition of mycelium grown from different species of fungus.
Conclusion
In total, from the lap shear testing data it can be concluded that the fusion proteins that were designed for this project, CBD4x and csgA-CBD, successfully act as biological adhesives for mycelium materials. By outperforming fp151, which has been reported to be an extremely strong bioadhesive[9], and almost reaching the adhesive strength of Elmer’s glue both csgA-CBD and CBD4x show promise in future use as structural binders of mycotecture in Mars or other extraplanetary colonization efforts. As Elmer’s glue requires raw materials like natural gas and petroleum that are plentiful on Earth but are often rare to non-existent on other planets, the slight adhesive advantage it shows in comparison is greatly outweighed by the mass producibility of our bacterially synthesized bioadhesives[13]. In further research, the characterization of alternate csgA-CBD fusion proteins implementing different spatial conformations and/or multiples of csgA of CBD polypeptides could yield even better mycelium-specific bioadhesives. The inclusion of a third type of polypeptide in the fusion protein could theoretically create multipurpose mycelium-specific glue proteins, able to bind mycelium together while also performing some"

We performed separations of the coding sequence resulted in   standardized domains and assembled these domains in correct order for   generating our target product triketide lactone.[5] Evaluation of   recombinant DEBS+TE expression was performed by RT-PCR analyses,   fluorescence microscopy analyses, SDS-PAGE and final polyketide   product was detected using Mass Spectrometry. Our results demonstrated   that standardized domains could express correctly folded and   posttranslationally modified modular PKSs, we concluded that domains   in PKSs can work relatively independently. Furthermore, RFP may   influence the function of protein, but in our project the product   could be generated via BAP1 harboring plasmids with RFP-DEBS1-TE.   Also, there is one scar (Thr-Arg) every two parts produced in every   ligations because of RFC 23 .We had worried these additional amino   acids may affect the expression of our synthetase. However, the   complete construction with 20 additional amino acids of RFP-DEBS1-TE,   expressed well from the IPTG-inducible promoter present in pSB1C3 in   E. coli strain BAP1. According to these results, we demonstrated the   compatibility as well as interchangeability between different   standardized domains. [6]
Based on investigation of standardized domains coming from semi-  rational separation, the obtained results represented an important   milestone toward the ultimate goal of creating novel PKSs by   assembling standardized domains.Additionally, these results showed   a new approach to generating triketide lactone, which can be an   important source of advanced intermediates of complex polyketides.[7]

The Amp plates made the day before worked.  However, the Kan plates (negative control, EPI300 pIJ790, and DH5a pIJ790) showed unexpected results.  The negative control, which only had untransformed K12 cells plated, had more colonies growing than those from the plates with resistance-transformed EPI300 pIJ790 and DH5a pIJ790.  Even then, there were only a few small colonies on the EPI300 pIJ790 plate and none at all on the DH5a pIJ790 plate.  It looks like the Kan plates may not be working, and it is possible that the EPI300 and DH5a cells with the pIJ790 plasmid are not competent.

75% of participants agree that different, specified      submission interfaces should be designed for contructs, promoter,      RBS, CDS and terminals is needed during Registry of Standard Parts. But, there are very strong and valid arguments against it such as,      losing the flexibility of the registry will not allow future submission      of unclassified parts.
We suggest keeping the parts submission interface as is, until     these concerns are addressed.
75% of participants agree that Out-dated, un-available      and not-characterized parts in the Registry of Standard Parts should      be removed to an archive after the consent of the designer.
“It would be great to see some sort of organization like this! I     agree that unavailable parts should be followed up on and removed if     necessary. I also think that parts which are not sufficiently documented     should be highlighted in some way. Once these parts are identified,     teams can actively characterize them as part of their projects or as     side projects.”
“Think about these things: (i) who decides when a part is out-dated,     and how can that person know that an old part cannot have a novel use     in the future? (ii) likewise, an uncharacterized part may be both characterized     and used in the future”
We suggest building a backup system, such as an archive, to sort     out the rarely used, un-available and un-categorized parts until they     are in line with the enforced standards.
91% of participants have same opinion with us, which      is that standardization of the nomenclatures used for each different      composition of parts is necessary.

Buoyant Bacteria
for metal extraction from old mines or ocean
Gvp genes of B. megaterium can be expressed functionally in Escherichia coli, rendering it buoyant by its gas vesicles
Might be used in mining ( in-situ leach , otherwise known as solution mining, is a technique where acid is pumped into a mine, separating the ore from the soil by dissolving the ore and the ore being pumped to the surface)
Several issues that need to be accounted for:
Anaerobiosis inhibits gas vesicle formation in halophilic archea – gas vesicles that allow buoyancy for bacteria require oxygen to exist. This is a major problem with mines (blackdamp – oxygen replaced by other gases)
Density of target ore – In-situ leach is often used for uranium, and can be used for copper and gold as well, all dense metals, and for buoyancy to occur, the bacteria need to have a sufficient density to allow the ore to float (copper least dense with 8.9 g/cm3, gold most dense with 19.3 g/cm3)
Amount of energy put into bacterial buoyancy – is using bacteria for the buoyancy really more efficient (energy-wise and time-wise) then normal pumping of the ore to the surface?
Biosorption – the 3 strains S. acidiscabies W-12, M. luteus W-20 and Bacillus sp. W-28 were found to be the most tolerating of high acidity levels and heavy metal environment. Those tolerant strains were also found to be able to absorb up to 80% aluminium and copper, and 60% uranium from mining sites

Initial Ideas
When we started thinking about how to turn our project into a product that could be readily used by the beef industry, we wanted a portable and easy to use device. Initial discussions with industry also pointed out that speed was important. If it took 24 hours to get the result then the infected cow would have already been processed and thereby the entire batch contaminated. To get inspiration, we went for a walk around our local pharmacy to see what kind of sensors we could buy and explore. As we were walking through the aisles we saw digital and colour change thermometers, pressure based heart rate monitors, blood glucose meters, and pregnancy tests. While the idea of having a digital output was initially interesting to us, we soon realized that the home pregnancy test was one of the easiest and well known sensors with an output that can be understood by anyone. Another bonus was that the designs have already been optimized to use biological molecules as the recognition elements, just like we were planning to do.
With that in mind we sent two of our male advisors (Robert & Iain) to pick out their favourite pregnancy tests. The fruits of their labour can be seen to the right (they even got two different kinds!).
Making the prototype from the pregnancy test
We disassembled the tests to see the inner workings of the test. The components can be seen below.
There were more components than we had expected, with an applicator, transfer wick, nitrocellulose, dragging wick, and a dessicator stone at the end. Through playing with the components we found that the dragging wick (after the nitrocellulose to pull the liquid sample as far"

We find the optimal combination of parameters is daily doses (high frequency) of 200 nm nanoparticles (small), with a concentration of 76.88 uM of GSR in the nanoparticles (concentration).
The calculator at the end of the page can be altered, so if the LOCS threshold is not 2.5, a new concentration can be calculated.
A Two Stage Eyedrop Approach
As shown in Table 2, we cannot alter the time to reach equilibrium, or reach full prevention. As supported by literature research, the time to reach equilibrium is a property of the lens that we cannot change (Fraunfelder 2008). However, we propose a two-stage eyedrop approach, of two differing nanoparticle concentrations, to decrease the time needed for full prevention. A full explanation is found in the collapsible.
Figure 4.8: Two Stage Eyedrop Approach. Two nanoparticle designs are shown above, with high and low concentration. By applying high conc. eyedrops first until [GSR] reaches Low Eq, then switching to low conc. eyedrops to maintain Low Eq, this approach reaches equilibrium faster.
Generalized Nanoparticles: Customizer
We built a full nanoparticle customizer, which generalizes the model to beyond delivery into the eye, found at the end of the page (Software). We hope that other iGEM teams who are interested in nanoparticle drug delivery can utilize this customizer to help them develop their own prototype.
Conclusion
We find the optimal combination of parameters is daily doses (high frequency) of 200 nm nanoparticles (small), with a concentration of 76.88 uM of GSR in the nanoparticles (concentration).

We consider the public's voice
Public Survey
 
In order to understand our project affects the world and the world affects our project design, we did a series of surveys with School’s students, teachers and staffs, as well as team members’ friends and parents, and also for the public in using online Google forms. The graphs are the results sorted into different genders and ages. In this survey, we wanted to see what people of different ages and of different genders prefer their sugar intake to be, what people will do to burn off the calories after drinking a bottle of Coke, and whether people like the idea of our genetically engineered product eating away the excess sugar. And also, we want to know how much do the public welcome our design and the engineered product.
- Conclusion -
We can see the survey shows that doesn’t intake of carbonated beverages of the female population is twice the male population, and, as people age, their preference of sugar is reduced. In this survey we can see that women take their health more seriously than men, and that men need more energy for their hard labor. Children are usually hyperactive and need a lot of energy, so we can see that children and younger people under the age of 18 have the highest consumption of sugar, but the older the person, the less energy is needed, so their consumption of sugar is lower than children.
In the second part, we asked them what exercise would they do to burn off all the calories from a 500mL Cola. Most of them chose to jog for 30 minutes or ride a bike for an hour. After some research, we found out people would have to walk for two days without sleep to burn all those calories. However, due to the fact that we only have 24 hours in a day, and that we are sleeping ¼ of the 24 hours, we don’t have much extra time to exercise and burn off the calories. We concluded the survey by asking them that if they could have a probiotic that absorbs the sugar taken in, so they wouldn’t have to worry about their health, would they take it? 76 percent of people said that they would take the probiotic. We can see that people would prefer to use our solution than to take the time to exercise.

As a part of our outreach we created a toolbox of resources helping teachers to integrate this topic in their classes. We believe that it is crucial to do so because synthetic biology is -as we all know- a fast growing and influential research area. It can be difficult to keep track of innovations and be able to convey them to the students.
Our first approach included an introduction to the basic methods and goals of synthetic biology. Subsequently the students worked in groups discussing about global problems to develop different approaches for solving them with synthetic biology. Furthermore we wanted to draw attention to ethical aspects and safety requirements . We were excited that the students came up with a lot of well reasoned ideas regarding the discussed topics.
After analyzing the surveys conducted during the first few school lessons it became clear that one aspect in our concept was still missing. The pupils craved to know more about how exactly the design of the labwork within iGEM takes place. They had heard a lot about the principles of synthetic biology and were longing for detailed information. So we decided to design a second lesson covering this specific aspect. How better to explain this than to use our own project and let the pupils themselves refeel the inspiring process of planning it?
Of course, we simplified the process of finding a suitable topic, as it took us several months to fully come up with and plan our topic. We prepared Index cards with all the required information at an understandable level. Each of our subteams processed their most important paper sections and graphs along with vocabulary help. Included is the possibility to learn about the implementation of a new pathway in a compartment, the nootkatone and violacein pathways , optogenetics and other exemplary topics. An essential part is the flashcard about the scientific background information: peroxisomes and their import machinery.
We are convinced that this lesson concept provides the pupils with a deep understanding of project planning routines and all the processes needed for a successful iGEM year. They develop the ability to work together as a group and communicate about complex topics. Furthermore they consolidate their knowledge about synthetic biology from the first lesson.
We had the possibility to skype with Kerstin Göprich, who is the founder of “ring-a-scientist.org”, a platform that brings together students and scientists. Skype is a great medium for connecting those groups. The students can witness experiments which could never be performed in their classrooms and get “first-hand information about studying science at a university” ring-a-scientist.org .  Kerstin Göprich, herself a young scientist, believes that it is very important to inspire"

Of the 100 teams that were approached, a total of 56 teams replied and were interested in participating. These were I eventually send the survey personally.  With an approximated average of 10 students and 4 supervisors per team, the sample size based on the 56 teams that were willing to participate is roughly 780. After closing the survey, a total number of 242 participants completed the survey, which equals 31% of the sample. After selection based on the outcome, a total of 231 responses were usable for an elaborate analysis.
Content
The survey was constructed with help from Steven Flipse, former iGEM participant and currently a PhD student in the department of Biotechnology and Society at the TUDelft. The questions were mainly based on questions raised in scientific papers, although a few were based on general interest and curiousness. The qualitative nature of the survey gave extra weight to the quality of the questions and answers. The questions needed to be clear, informative, but also short and simple, whereas the multiple-choice answers needed the extra property of fulfilling most of the partiticpants potential answers. The questions and answers were also designed to calculate correlation patterns afterwards. The software tool that was used to create the online-survey is googledocs , which automatically saves incoming data in spreadsheet format anonymously. The survey includes multiple-choice questions, scaling questions and one free-to-fill-in open question. The multiple-choice questions all contained the option to choose the other-option, in which the participants can write their own opinion if they feel that the list of given answers is not sufficient. The questionnaire contains 3 optional questions on personal background of the participant, and 20 questions on subjects concerning synthetic biology, ranging from notions of life and the reductionist approach to communication and risk management.
Method for analysis
Because of the large number of participants in the survey, the analysis of the results was done quantitatively as well as qualitatively. The data was processed using Microsoft Excel, a software tool capable of handling large amounts of data and competent for simple quantitative analysis, such as correlation calculations.
1. The first step was to filter the results from non-usable data, based on the relevance of open (other) answers. To keep a consistent sample size, contributions containing non-usable answers were completely removed. The answers of 11 survey participants were completely removed, which equals 0.5% of the initial sample. 2. With the remaining 231 contributions"
Paris_Bettencourt,2016,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Indigo_-_-_TEXT.html," laccasse comes from bacteria (Bacillus pumilus) which makes it potentially easier to express and study in E. coli than fungal lacasses.
To our knowledge, bpul hasn't been shown to degrade indigo. On the other hand Reiss et. Al 2011. have shown that it successfully degrades indigo carmine which is structurally similar to indigo dye (figure 4A).
Due to a large number of substrates laccases can potentially degrade compounds from wine making it a good basis for collaboration with the Enzyme Group.
Results
We cultured microorganisms on denim covered with minimal M9, isolated the strains and identified them. Then, we tested their capacity for degrading indigo. At the end we isolated three indigo-degrading microorganisms: 2 Streptomyces and 1 Pantoea species.
Isolation of Microbes on Denim Media
After approximately one week of incubation, we were able to isolate 16 strains of different colors and shapes on denim-covered media, half of which were bacteria, half fungi. We identified the bacterial and fungal strains through 16S and 18S rRNA sequencing, respectively; however, a few fungi species we isolated are still unknown, as we did not succeed in extracting genomic DNA from these species for PCR. These 16 species are mostly Aspergillus, Streptomyces and Enterobacter species. All isolated strains are shown in table 1 below. These results are coherent with the literature: indeed Enterobacter are commonly used in bioreactors for waste and dye cleaning, and Aspergillus fumigatus and some Streptomyces have been shown to degrade certain dyes, specifically indigo in the case of Streptomyces.

Protocols
We intensely worked on some easy protocols - tried our miniprep for amplifying our desired DNA in bacteria, culturing am bulking up our Chlamydomonas as well as preparing general and antibiotic plates for them. We have set up an experiment testing how well Chlamydomonas grows under different conditions - in the dark on TAP, in the light and in the light with CO2 concentration elevated to 5%. Thanks Dr Moritz Meyer for massive help!

PLASMID DESIGN UPDATE
Working further on our plasmids made of DNA parts. We have so far considered many different designs. Initially we planned to have two plasmids - one with the Cas9 regulated by a regulatable promoter which would be only transiently expressed. The second plasmid with the gRNA under one promoter and a separate one promoter for our markers and the gene of interest. We considered luciferase of fluorescent proteins as our markers. We were struggling to find a sharp promoter and terminator functional in chloroplasts so that our gRNA has the desired length and sequence in the end. We even considered ribozymes which are capable of self-splicing of the gRNA and used in mammals.

Parts for synthesis?
Today we thought our synthesis sequences were done, just needed final checks. Haha, had no idea how many major changes of the whole technique will come before we send them off. But with every change we learn more and more, nothing is a lost time!
We are also in constant contact with the lab of Prof Saul Purton at UCL who is giving us amazing advice from experience with working on this system and even some material his lab produced. He has been amazingly helpful especially when we need to decide on alternative parts - they know what usually works in Chlamydomonas chloroplasts!

Synbio-Day
On a nice Saturday morning, we built up our pavilion in one of Tuebingen's main shopping streets to start our SynBioDay 2015.
The pavilion was decorated with posters about the iGEM competition, our team and projects as well as synthetic biology in general to provide information to people passing by. We also offered food and drinks to people  to encourage further discussions.
People had the opportunity to take part in a quiz in order to test their knowledge about synthetic biology. Exemplary questions were the definition of a gene and a genetically modified organism, and what could happen to if one ate  genetically modified food. Discussions revealed a broad variety of background knowledge and attitudes towards synthetic biology. We had lots of different interested guests from all ages, ranging from children and families to a postdoc in bioinformatics or a professor for chemistry. Discussing controversial topics gave us new insights into people’s reasoning and worries for and against gene technology.
In conclusion, the SynBioDay was a success as we could share our knowledge with the general public. The aim of the day was to draw some interest about our work and to prevent prejudices about synthetic biology and GMOs."

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#AlbertoNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"rophoresis, I considered it to be a positive result. But it is important to see if pBad can indeed be induced with arabinose. So I prepared 3 liquid cultures from the plates containing the pBad-GFP colonies. After overnight incubation, I added 10 mM L(+) arabinose to 2 tubes and leave the other one as control. I planned to observe these tubes under the UV light every 1 hour. But because nothing showed up after 2 hours, I decided to leave them overnight and found out later that the liquid culture with arabinose still did not fluoresce. I figured out that I might have accidentally take false positive colonies from the plate.

Summary:
Different insert to vector ratio and reaction time did not seem to solve our ligation issue
Different DNA concentration for parts used in ligation did not seem to affect the number of colonies in the resulting transformation
The ligation problem was solved with the use of Alpha Select Cells
Four GFP composite parts (each containing GFP under a different promoter) were transformed
Up until last week, we have been having mixed results with the use of pelleted cells to transform ligation reactions. The appearances of bacterial colonies, which signify the success of transformed ligated parts, are not consistent and have an extremely low yield. The usage of positive control does not seem to produce numerous colonies, meaning that there is something wrong along the way. So we tried to look for several possible explanations on this issue; we later read that ligation time or insert to vector ratio can possibly affect the ligation success. Several ligation attempts are then tried at room temperature for either 30 minutes, 1 hour, or overnight. The insert to vector ratio was also varied from 1:1 to 8:1. We expected to find a normal distribution for the number of colonies obtained around the most optimal condition. Because only 2uL of each ligation reaction is used in the transformation, I also transformed 2uL from the leftover of my 3:1 insert to vector, 30 minutes bench top, E0430_R0040 (YFPc_pTet) ligation reaction with the Alpha Select Cells (we received this cell last week but transformation attempt using them had not been successful) and spread 2 plates with it.
Surprisingly, none of the ligation attempt produced any significant result - except for the 2 transformation plates that use the Alpha Select Cells. These plates contained enormous, uncountable, amount of colonies. This was indeed"

Because we envision an iGEM world where work with Bacillus subtilis is as easy as work with Escherichia coli, we offer the last piece of the puzzle. Until now, there has been no possibility of exchanging Bacillus subtilis strains through the Parts Registry. However, for work with B. subtilis, the option to exchange and work with different strains is much more important than it is with E. coli because:
Mostly integrative plasmids were used. Hence, the storage of the plasmids is less important than the strains.
These genetic modifications can be easily transferred to other strains by isolation and transformation of genomic DNA
To facilitate an easy storage and exchange of relevant B. subtilis strains, the Mascher lab offers to maintain an iGEM Bacillus subtilis strain collection for the time being. By clicking on the picture below, you can download an Excel spread sheet summarizing all B. subtilis strains currently available in this collection. So far, this is limited to the strains constructed by the LMU-Munich iGEM team 2012 as part of their Beadzillus project.
If you would like to request a strain or contribute to the Bacillus subtilis collection by providing novel strains, please contact Prof. Thorsten Mascher .

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.

Gibson assembly
Theory
The Gibson assembly, as described by Gibson et al., is a rapid DNA assembly method that assures directional cloning of fragments in one single reaction. To perform the Gibson assembly, three essential enzymes are needed: a mesophylic nuclease, a thermophylic ligase and a high fidelity polymerase. Therefore, the NEBuilderⓇ HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (New England Biolabs) was used. In the first step of this reaction, the exonuclease rapidly cleaves off the 5’ DNA ends. The exonuclease is unstable at 50°C and gets degraded early in the process. In the second step, the designed sequence overlaps anneal and the polymerase starts filling in the gaps. The ligase then covalently joins both ends finalizing the plasmid assembly for transformation. This text was based on the IDT description as seen on 13/09/2015 .

MIT,2011,Team:MIT#Notebook#_-_-_TEXT.html," sequencing data for samples sent out yesterday. One LR reaction failed unexpectedly, but the other failures involving minCMV promoters appear to have occurred due to contamination from a Hef1a variant promoter based on a BLAST of the sequencing results. (READ: The ""minCMV"" promoter DNA is not actually minCMV promoter DNA\- at least this is the case for the tubes without stickers.) All parts currently being used for experiments are verified. On track for \~15-20 new LR reactions for Wednesday afternoon. 12 LR reactions, left at room temperature @ 12:30pm~. Transformed Clara's LR reactions. Need to redo all of the FACS data tomorrow that Jenny did today because the red and blue colors are switched. Mariola's program works so I will use that. Tomorrow I will do transfections of a consistuitive color into wells with different confluencies that I set up today. I added Dox and Dopamine to wells today that we will FACS tomorrow.&nbsp;
August 8
Planned out and did transfections for TRE eBFP2, TRE:mKate and AVPR2 validation experiments. Also threw in a co-culture of Notch/Delta cells, only with UAS:eYFP instead of UAS:citrine from Elowitz. Not expecting anything from that, but just covering all bases. Treated pDisplay-vasopressin-myc cells with anti-myc FITC Ab and prepared slide. Results suggestive. Cells were too confluent at time of fixation, many were washed off and the remaining look bad. Probably from my bootleg formaldehyde solution as well. However, remaining cells were green on the surface as well as red from delta-mcherry, while controls are not green. Seems to suggest it is being displayed...  Because we need a number of promoters propagated and it would be nice to do LRs with the Rheoswitch system (and possibly the new Notch constructs) concurrently, I will probably wait to begin these. Cleaned the lab before the start of the work day, like a boss, or perhaps a janitor. Started propagations of a few promoters and genes that we had < 1 uL of DNA left of (and no cell stock), because if you want something done... Aliquoted and Transfected UAS:EGFP and TRE:eyfp-4xFF4 experiments. Dox ladder of each. Writing 8pg REU paper and presentation.

The protocols are followed and here are a few additional tips that we performed: 1. Resuspend bacteria with buffer containing RNase by pipetting instead of vortex or other sharp methods, which may cause negative effect on enzymes. 2. After applying the solution that contains DNA only to the column and centrifuging, reload the sample to the column and centrifuge for a second time in order to bind all the DNA sample on the column. 3. Use water instead of elution buffer to elute, for that TE buffer can cause negative effect on enzyme reaction. Heat the ddwater to 50~60℃ in water bath to ensure the pH of the ddwater before use. But if the plasmid will be stored for a very long period of time, using elution buffer is better.

Introduction
Motivation Referring to the team abstracts, most of the iGEM Teams are still dealing with what we would call ""classical synthetic biology"", meaning bacterial engineering. Since the last year's project established to some degree ""mammalian synthetic biology"", they paved the way for entering the real medical track focussing on gene therapy. The most important issue in terms of gene therapy is regulation of transgene expression. After last year's team characterized synthetic promoters for tuning of gene expression in vitro, we have taken one step further, introducing synthetic microRNAs and their binding sites as a new level of expression control.
Background Micro RNAs (miRNAs), a class of abundant small noncoding RNAs, are key regulators in all kinds of organisms ranging from viruses to mammals. By binding to target sequences most commonly found in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA, miRNAs inhibit the translation of their target mRNAs and thereby adjust the expression of many proteins related to the miRNA expression in a cell (Brenecke et al. 2005) . The importance of miRNA-mediated gene regulation is impressively reflected by the fact that roughly 1% of the human genome codes for miRNAs which target 20-25% of all protein coding genes (Lewis et al. 2005) . Therefore, a large proportion of the transcriptome may be subjected to miRNA-mediated control (Lau et al. 2001) . The broad regulatory scope of miRN"

Modeling
Models are vital components to any engineering project because they simplify complex systems through a set of specified parameters. Mathematical models are especially useful because they can be used to predict a system’s behavior given certain inputs. For TERRA we have used several models to simulate the droplet formation at the end of an output tube and characterize our XY-translational plane.
Droplet Analysis
XY Translational Stage
Droplet Characterization
Due to the relatively low flow rate that fluid moves at in microfluidic chips, outputs dispensed from microfluidic chips are typically droplets rather than a continuous stream. Therefore, in order to accurately dispense these droplets into wells, we created a model to predict their volume so that users can have greater control of the end sample volume in the well of interest. To develop the model we used a free-body diagram to identify the forces present right before a droplet falls off the nozzle. Using the sum of the forces acting on the droplet we were able to model the its theoretical volume. The derivation of the static model is shown below.
To test the model we ran preliminary experiments to calculate volumes at flow rates of 1 mL/hr, 2.5 mL/hr, 5 mL/hr, 7.5 mL/hr and compared them against the theoretical value. To calculate droplet volumes we followed the following method:
Set up a single syringe pump with a 12 mL syringe filled with red colored water. The tubing is then passed through the nozzle of TERRA to stabilize the tubing. A well plate is then placed under the tubing to catch droplets.
Start the syringe pump at the flow rate of interest.
Place a smartphone on a flat surface that captures the droplet falling off the tubing and hitting the well plate.
Start recording the droplets dispensing, ensuring that it left at a duration long enough to capture at least 35 droplets.
Analyze the video by measuring the time interval between droplets.
Because we can’t directly measuring the volume of the droplet, we used the time interval between droplets and the given flow rate to calculate what the experimental volume is.
After comparing the experimental droplet volume to the theoretical droplet"

Timing Diagram
The Timing Diagram is a graphical representation of the different states. Both logic circuits will be following the timing diagram such that in the final Low Temperature and Low Phosphate stage, the killing mechanism will activate.

Logic Table
Depending on the method (Simple Circuit or Automated Circuit) used to implement the genetic circuit , the logic used may slightly vary. Despite these variations in logic, both circuits will activate the killing mechanism in the same stage.
Figure 3 Logic Table of the kill switch for engineered probiotics. Because of the different circuit designs, the logic table for the Simple Circuit and Automated Circuit slightly varies. However, both circuits obey the timing diagram and logic table and function the same way.
Simple Circuit
Genetic Circuit
The Simple Circuit design can be represented two biosensors cascaded together.This cascade mechanism refers to the Phosphate Sensor, pPhoB, controlling the repressor TlpA36. When the repressor TlpA36 is in a condition below 36 °C, it will repress the pTlpA36 Promoter. When the pTlpA36 promoter is repressed, anti-toxin IM2 production will decrease, and ultimately the probiotic will die. Since the pPhoB downstream expressions are linked with pTlpA downstream expressions, the system is said to be cascaded.
To generate the model of the genetic circuit we need to transfer the genetic circuit to a dynamic modelling software such as AdvanceSyn , a local startup providing design and modelling software for SynBio design. Using AdvanceSyn we can generate a functional model, apply sensitivity analysis and combinatorial analysis as well as implement our timing states into the model. The genetic circuit as displayed in AdvanceSyn is shown in Figure 4.

Project Overview
Motivation
Biosensors have a wide range of applications, but for many of those applications there already exists a machine that can do a better job than our engineered bacteria. One of the biggest liabilities in using a biological system is the time associated with getting the desired information. Cells have to metabolize the desired chemical, alter gene expression, and accumulate enough protein in order to produce a measurable output.
A biosensor used in our mentor lab responding to different concentrations of autoinducer
In the graph to the left, it takes on the order of 2-3 hours before a LuxR based GFP reporter reaches maximum signal. We designed our system based on the prediction that waiting for dimerization is a lot faster than waiting for transcription, translation, and protein accumulation.
An added benefit to designing our system with TraR to fluoresce independent of TraR's ability to regulate genes is that TraR does not activate transcription in E. coli. In a paper published in 2009 by Qin et. al. they show that TraR is unable to recruit E. coli's native RNA polymerase. It has been shown in another paper , however, that TraR does fold properly into monomers and will dimerize in the presence of its autoinducer in E. coli. So this system, as we've designed it, will be the first to use TraR in a fluorescence based biosensor in E. coli since it does not require TraR to active transcription but only to fold correctly and dimerize.
Design Considerations
Plasmids provided by Dr. Regan from Yale
We decided to first make the fusions in the plasmids provided by Dr. Lynne Regan from Yale. By choosing this method, we were able to use the provided controls in testing our part. Here is a paper detailing the plasmids.
The pET11a plasmid is under control of T7 polymerase, so we used Bl21(DE3) E. coli cells which have an IPTG-inducible copy of the polymerase on their chromosome.
The designed fusion into pET11a was compatible with the TraR sequence, but the pMRBAD fusion was not. The pMRBAD fusion was designed to use NcoI and AatII, but TraR had two AatII sites in the coding sequence. We instead cloned TraR in-between the NcoI and Sph1 sites. This added two amino acids to the linker, one of which was a cysteine. It"

Our Project - at a glance
The team were initially interested in the role of nitric oxide (NO) in biological systems and were aiming to produce a BioBrick that can sense NO within an environment, report on the levels, and go on to make relevant and desirable changes.
While researching possible promoters that can be used to detect NO, we decided to hybridise two promoter elements; PyeaR, a bacterial promoter, and the NS2E9 element, found in mammals. Both promoters, when on their own, use NO as an inducer molecule. The team aim to use a chassis of ''Escherichia coli'' in order to characterise the hybridised promoter, before investigating its competency within a mammalian cell chassis (MCF7, Michigan Cancer Foundation cell line variant 7, cells) for future applications within a medical system. We also aim to characterise various promoters produced by previous iGEM teams, especially those involved with sensing physiologically-relevant molecules and reporting with fluorescence or bioluminescence.
The team then turned their attention to developing the comparator circuit, a new system they feel will revolutionise transcriptional regulation via the formation of mRNA duplexes that sequester the translation of any gene after the comparator circuit biobrick. We hope, using ""Escherichia coli"" and a number of standard reporter biobricks, to show the functionality of this protein knock-out system and also introduce it to the registry.
Possible applications we see for both projects include; cancer therapeutics, where NO levels are detected and raised above the level at which it aids angiogenesis and into the levels at which it is toxic to a tumour; and environmental aspects, where the bio-sensor may be attached to bioluminescence in order to report levels of NO in soil for instance.
Human Practices - at a glance
The team have explored a variety of avenues in engaging with the public. The team focused on making their rather complex project assessable to the public by allowing the public to consider what would happen if their general health could be something seen easily and publicly in the form of a changing tattoo (in which their body had mammalian cells containing our hybrid promoter injected into their skin)."

Vilnius-Lithuania,2016,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Human Practices#all_-_-_TEXT.html," into an intensive two-hour discussion. We were thrilled about all the questions and the interest we received. We were happy to answer the questions and broaden participants’ knowledge in many fields concerning life sciences.
Later we moved on to the practical part of the workshop – bacteria staining. We stained Gram+ and Gram- cells, live yeast and observed them through the microscope. The majority of the equipment used during the workshop can be found at home - we made microbiology loops out of clips, used cropped coffee filters instead of filter paper and so on in order to show that science can be accessible to the common public in a symbolic way. However, we did not forget the safety, therefore gloves and protective masks were properly used.
Lastly, we launched a protein exhibition. We exhibited 8 proteins that are more or less important for bacterial survival. This exhibition was intended for showing that certain parts, unobservable by the human eye, have a huge impact on bacteria and our lives as well. The proteins, such as CRISPR-Cas9, Rho transcription termination factor, Phycobiliprotein, Chaperone ClpB, Aquaporin Z, RepE, which have different functions, were chosen. We also included PAL – phenylalanine ammonia lyase, an enzyme we are working with in terms of our project. We displayed 3D protein structures in an unconventional way – on the paper cubes, with a different view of the same protein of each face. To make the exhibits more dynamic we decided to hang them on the ceiling and let them float at the eye height.
This side collaboration made us feel assured of our actions in spreading the knowledge about life sciences as we have met a lot of people from different fields that were keen on expressing interest in the related topics.
Blood donation
Our sponsors and supporters are something our project couldn’t exist without, even the smallest donation or a simple piece of advice towards our project is important and beneficial for us. That is why we decided to become sponsors ourselves and support another project. We did not have money to donate but we all have one thing, which we can donate, and it is our blood. Eight bravest Vilnius iGEM team members participated in the unpaid blood donation campaign in late spring. It was an unpaid blood donation, but each team member was gifted with a chocolate bar and a water bottle to revive the body. Here you can see their happy faces:
High school visits and children's education
To ensure that the younger generation is fairly informed about the science progress and to encourage them to seek the knowledge on the field, our team spent several months on communication with"

Vampiric bacteria
-The aspect of a Vampiric bacteria that is designed to get rid of blood clots produced by trauma induced clotting or during complex medical procedures is intriguing.
-Expression of Hirudin is possible in systems such as E. coli. In 2007 Berkeley produced a chassis for a E. coli that could be introduced into the blood stream after inactivation.
-However, it is difficult to have the non-viable cell lysis occur in the correct location and therefore an anticoagulant could just as well be injected into the patient.
-For this to work, we would require an expression system that is able to express Hirudin (produced usually by leech salivary glands and has been successfully expressed in E. coli [1]), express anti-angiotensin (it is possible to express Fab fragments in E. coli [2]) and targeting the fibrin (can be done by expressing Tissue plasminogen activator).
-The idea would be to have the chassis recognize a blood clot or an area of damage and prevent clotting and/or clear clots. A method for having the system recognize when to secrete hirudin would be by having the bacteria sense trauma related chemokines and have the chassis se"

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html,"'s high frequencies of natural transformation (competency). H. influenzae uses a Type-IV pilus structure to uptake DNA, so the team researched whether or not such a system could be implemented into E. coli. to yield similar transformation rates. Studies conducted by Dr. Rosemary Redfield - an E. coli. expert - showed that all gram-negative bacteria share two common regulator genes for competency; sxy and CRP (Sinha & Redfield, 2012) . A deeper analysis of Dr. Redfield's papers also revealed that E. coli. lacks a pilF2 homologue. Curious, we contacted Dr. Redfield to gain insight into the subject. Dr. Redfield stated that during her experiments, all the proteins involved in DNA uptake were able to be expressed, but the rates of competency in E. coli. were quite low to begin with. It was decided that E. coli. would not be used for our project as there were many unknown variables which dictated the expression of competence gene homologues in E. coli.
Additional studies on E. coli. conducted by Sun et. al. were looked at. The findings of these studies stated that OmpA (an outer membrane protein) plays a role in uptaking DNA from conjugative plasmids and bacteriophages (Sun, Wang, Chen, & Zhan, 2013) . The researchers also hypothesized that OmpA plays a stimulatory role in DNA uptake in liquid Ca2+ cultures, along with an inhibitory role on agar plates (Sun et al., 2013) . OmpA negative strains (JW0940) were found to have a higher transformation frequency than wild-type strains (BW25113) when grown on agar (Sun et al., 2013) . Surprisingly, transformation frequencies did not change with varying agar thickness, so it remains uncertain how agar plays a role in E. coli.'s natural transformation (Sun et al., 2013) . Conversely, the OmpA negative strains showed a lower frequency of transformation than wild-type strains when grown in liquid Ca2+ cultures (Sun et al., 2013) . We concluded that it may be possible to make E. coli. naturally competent on agar by replacing the OmpA gene with a gene that codes for kanamycin resistance.
In additional to E. coli., B. subtilis. was researched as a potential platform for DNA uptake. Current trends and methods in B. subtilis transformation were analyzed, with competency rates ranging from 104 to 107 transformants per micro"

Overview
According to the data from WHO, cardiovascular diseases are the main leading cause of death globally. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is a critical second messenger molecule.It can transduce nitric-oxide (NO) and natriuretic-peptide-coupled signaling and remit the myocardial hypertrophy by relaxing the blood vessels. This summer, we tried to use synthetic biology to modify the cGMP metabolic pathway in a human cell line.We hope that our work would provide the proof of principle for future gene therapy.
Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is an enzyme that synthesize cGMP  from GTP. We up-regulate sGC by overexpressing its α and β subunits in a mammalian cell line. However, elevated levels of cGMP leads to the feed-back expression of PDE5a, a cGMP-specific phosphodiesteras that degrades cGMP. Thus, we further modified the pathway by silencing the PDE5a. To achieve controllable up-regulation of cGMP level in the cell, we designed a hypoxia-inducible operon, HRE, as a switch to up regulate cGMP only in hypoxia situation."

BioBrick BBa_K1088016 - pSB1K3-araC-HRT2-terminator. Device made to express the prenyltransferase, HRT2.
The micro system of modern rubber production
The most important step in the synthesis of natural rubber is the polymerization of isoprene catalyzed by HRT2. Our model showed that the reactions catalysed by Dxs and IspG are the rate limiting steps in the MEP pathway. Therefore it was decided that these would be the sites of our intervention in the pathway with the purpose of increasing the amount of IPP and DMAPP.
Our production system will be composed of two plasmids: one expressing HRT2 and one overexpressing Dxs and IspG.
Device expressing HRT2 - (pSB1K3-araC-Para-HRT2)
The expression of the device responds to arabinose under glucose scarce conditions; arabinose binds to AraC and relieves the transcription inhibition brought forth by this protein.

By utilizing effectively extensive feedback from experts and after numerous iterative circles, our team developed a versatile, innovative solution to detoxify wastewater from active pharmaceutical substances, Biotic Blue. Aquatic pharmaceutical pollution is a looming  problem which accelerates antibiotic resistance and causes adverse ecotoxic effects on marine ecosystems. The main source of pharmaceuticals ending up in the water is human consumption, an inescapable activity of our well being. The key to limit or even prevent pharmaceutical pollution is to detoxify wastewater from pharmaceuticals before released to rivers or the sea. Solutions for treating wastewater from pharmaceuticals exist, but their adoption is either creating unknown threats to the environment or it’s too costly. To come over these barriers, we developed Biotic Blue, an enzyme-based solution for degrading pharmaceuticals. The first version of Biotic Blue focuses on degrading Sulfamethoxazole, an antibiotic, as proof of concept. What makes Biotic Blue unique, is the fact that it can be implemented before the biological treatment stage in WasteWater Treatment Plants (WWTPs). Implementing it at this treatment point prevents the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, inhabiting the activated sludge. Sulfamethoxazole-free water leaves the WWTPs and does not pose ecotoxic threat to the aquatic environment when released. The immobilization of our mutant enzyme on magnetic beads and the smart employment of a magnet, makes Biotic Blue energy efficient and cost effective. However, the greatest potential of Biotic Blue to be broadly adopted by WWTPs lies in its capability to embed a combination of immobilized enzymes, enabling it to purify wastewater from a mixture of pharmaceuticals.
Problem Description
Over the past years, global consumption of pharmaceuticals has been on the rise. This will continue to increase as life span increases, boosting chronic and age-related diseases [1]. The majority of these pharmaceuticals end up in the aquatic environment after their usage, either in their initial biological active form or as metabolites. Indicatively, between 30 and 90% of orally consumed pharmaceuticals are excreted in the urine as active substances and end up in the water reservoirs after they pass through the sewage system [2].
Pharmaceutical usage in veterinary activities, such as factory pharms, aquacultures and pet treatments, contributes to aquatic pharmaceutical pollution. However, this usage is not considered to be the primary source route. Neither is the improper disposal of unused or expired pharmaceuticals, which are flashed down or poured in the drain, or residues leaking"
