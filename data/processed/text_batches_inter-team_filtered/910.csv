May: Trip to Ethiopia
In late May, Kyle travelled to Ethiopia to meet with farmers, NGOs, and universities.. Our initial project idea was to detect certain avirulence factors secreted by Pgt, and based on the response from certain resistance genes, determine if a farmer’s specific line of wheat would be resistant to the races of stem rust that were present or not. However, many of the farmers were unaware of what specific resistance genes their lines of wheat had. Therefore, we altered our project design to include a general detection mechanism for stem rust in addition to the race-specific detection in order to provide the information that would be most helpful to some of the farmers that would be aided by the results of our project.
June: Trip to Uganda
In June, Kyle met with farmers, NGOs, and governmental organizations in Uganda. His work in Uganda showed, once again, the need for a general stem rust detection mechanism. The farmers also provided significant feedback on the hardware of the project, what information they wanted the hardware to display, and what was most feasible and convenient technologically for them. In addition, due to this visit, we recognized the need for an educational component of our project to allow farmers to use the resources available to them, such as the various forms of pesticides, safely and effectively.

Articulate at least one question encountered by your team, and        describe how your team considered the(se) question(s) within your project. Include attributions to all experts and stakeholders        consulted.
Our project uses a plant chassis. Historically, especially in Europe, the media and general public have not accepted the genetic modification of plants. As our plants are designed as 'sentinels' (early-warning canaries!) and not as food plants, we were interested to find out how people would respond. We were also interested in whether people thought scientists have an ethical obligation to work towards food security and if they thought that biotechnology and synthetic biology should be used to meet that need. Please see the Policy and Practices page to read about this work. Contributions from others are documented on out Attributions page.

Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution        in a previous year), enter this information in the Registry.
Our team has improved BBa_J04450 by adding flanking sequences to make a series of four ""GoldenGate Flipper modules""  (Documented as BBa_K1467100 , BBa_K1467200 , BBa_K1467300 and BBa_K1467400 ) that can be used to convert four types of standard part defined in the GoldenGate MoClo Assembly Standard into standard BioBricks. This was done by inserting an inverted pair of BsaI recognition sequences either side of the original RFP reporter part. The flipper reaction is a one-pot, one-step, digestion-ligation GoldenGate cloning reaction. When cloning is successful the colonies become white as the RFP sequence is replaced by the new part.

They argued that biology students may have operation mistakes so that these bacteria could separate into environment and cause danger. We explained that we had a serious trainning to prevent any mistake during experiments. Furthermore, any biomaterial in lab must be treated before entering environment.
GMOs are popular in US, they usually have better properties. However, more and more people concern about the safety of genetically modified food, though some authentic organization such as FDA or WHO announced GM foods are absolutely safe. We wanted to find Chinese people’s views on GM foods, thus we ask them question 5, 6, 7 and 8.
Question 10
Which foods do you think are genetically modified? Please choose one or more.>
你认为哪种/哪些食品是转基因食品？请选择一个或多个选项。
We listed many genetically modified foods, which were obtained from internet. Results were that the majority of people know the soybean was GMO as well as anti-virus pimento. While, less than half of people considered that cherry tomato, which means many people still did not it is genetically modified. Particularly, only a few people thought the potato with smooth surface as GMO, but most of people did not know. In conclusion, we thought Chinese people could distinguish some common GMOs, however some they could not. Therefore, more information about genetically modified foods should be provided to public.
Question 11
Have you bought and eaten genetically modified food?
你曾经购买并食用过转基因食品吗？
We found that about 44% of people had bought and eaten the GM foods while only 4 people clearly knew that they never bought or ate any GM foods. We were surprised found that over a half of people were not sure they ate GM foods. Reasons for that is GM foods were not obviously labeled in China or they usually ignore the label.
Question 12
Why did you chose them? Please choose one or more.
为什么你会选择它们？请选择一个或多个选项。
Most of people thought that GM foods had good looking so they choose them. Many people thought they were delicious and contained additional nutrition. Also, many people were curious about GMOs and never saw them before. However, some people chose GM foods because the foods were cheap and no organic food was available. Additionally, a few people thought GM food could be preserved long time and had other better properties.

5.9 T7+ Liquid Culture Phage Concentration Test #2
I) Purpose
To determine if the volume of phage stock added effects the liquid culture concentration result
II) Expected Outcome
We expect the same results as from 5.3. We also hope to see 1 ul produce a titer to -10.
III) Reagants Used
E. Coli BL21 overnight from 5.8; T7+ from 5.6 10 ul stock; LB from 4.5
IV) Actual Procedure
1. Liquid culture set up (5.9)
Three test tubes were set up. To each, add 4mL of LB and 1mL of E coli BL21 overnight
Add 1uL, 10uL, and 100uL phage to each tube, respectively.
Liquid culture was incubated for approximately 48 hours
2. Spot test to test amplification results
Phage liquid culture was purified using procedures similar to those in 5.3 T7 phage amplification/purification . The resulted purified stock was labeled 5.13 (5.13)
Spot test was performed using procedures similar to those in 5.3 T7 phage amplification/purification (5.15)
Spot test plates were incubated overnight
V) Results
Complete clearage of liquid culture was observed for once
All spot tests showed plaques to -8, but there was also a lot of contamination -> from the LB plates; the plates have been completely disposed of.

Increasing Food Consumption
With the increasing population comes the obvious problem of how to deal with production of food for everyone. Since the 1960's the worldwide population has more than doubled. This has brought with it a natural increase in production of crops. This has traditionally been done through expansion of the arable land 7 .

Much of the population expansion has been centered around the developing countries, where the population has increased by 135% from 1961 to 2005 and the crop production has increased by 255% in the same period 7 .

Presently around 12% of the global land surface is used for crop production. This represents approximately 36% of the land estimated to be to some degree suitable for crop production. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nation, this is estimated to increase by 0.1% yearly until 2050, which gives a total of 5% increase 7 .

""Cooling is one of the main measures to keep food fresh and uncontaminated with harmful microorganisms. If food could be made durable, not by low temperatures but by modified organisms defending it from going bad, we could not only save energy but also reduce diseases caused by contaminated food - especially in areas without proper infrastructure to guarantee unbroken cold chains. ""
Christian Kieschnick
Product Description
The Bacterial Fridge employs synthetic organisms to defend your food from going to waste. Without any necessity for cooling, the Bacterial Fridge will attack any organisms that are responsible for rotting your food. Compared to traditional fridges, this process is far more effective and keeps the content of your fridge fresh for years.
Australian Wine Farmers are already using this technology to conserve some grapes of each vintage to be delivered alongside the wine bottle of the same year.
For each fridge you buy, we send one into developing countries that don’t have the infrastructure to run traditional fridges efficiently.
Technical Description
The reproductive cycle of the included bacteria involves three specific molecules, which control the gene regulation of segmentation. If one of these molecules is missing, an inhibitor will freeze reproduction. Please note: Only open the fridge in dark rooms or at night!

The Smart EDC Farmland Protection System
This is the integrated system of our endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) water protection system.
In order to solve some real environmental challenges, our team has proposed an integrated system which is suitable for farmland water protection and can both detect and degrade endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs).
What is EDCs?
EDCs (Endocrine Disruptor Chemicals), which can interfere with our endocrine systems, causing cancerous tumors, birth defects, and other developmental disorders. These chemicals are mostly man-made and are found in various materials such as pesticides, food containers, and personal care products. Factories sometimes illegally emit the EDCs contaminated water into the river, which can post the threat to nearby farmland. In this project, we primarily focus on two common kinds of EDCs, BPA (Bisphenol A) and NP (Nonyl Phenol), in the agricultural irrigation systems.
How we degrade EDCs in the water?
We constructed the gene of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and transformed it into E. coli.  Horseradish peroxidase uses the iron-contained activate center to convert the phenolic group to free radicals and let them react with each other in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Finally, we can get the less harmful products.
After producing horseradish peroxidase, we use a chemical method to combine the enzyme with activated carbon via covalent bonds. Since activated carbon has outstanding ability to capture organic compounds and it can help to accumulate EDCs in the higher concentration, the enzyme can degrade EDCs in a highly efficient way. Finally, we combine activated carbon/enzyme complex with our designed filter to complete all the degradation system.
How we detect EDCs in the water?
We will flow some freeze-dried E. coli and water samples through the gold chips.  Since there are GFPs in the E. coli, if water samples which have passed our degradation system still containing EDCs. EDC"

“Research on mechanisms by which melanocytes migrate from the lower hair follicle to the epidermis has focused on cytokine release by keratinocytes, i.e. leukotriene C4 (LTC4), endothelin-1 (ET-1), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and stem cell factor (SCF), all of which stimulate melanocyte migration.46 As such, it was found that LTC4 and transforming growth factor a (TGF-a), released from keratinocytes secondarily to UV damage, stimulate melanocyte migration in vitro.47 Attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix and their migration over the matrix are mediated by the binding of domains of the matrix proteins with integrin receptor on the cell surface.48 Cultured melanocytes were shown to have an increased random migration on type IV collagen and to express cell membrane a2b1, a3b1, and a5b1 integrins,49 which were shown to be important in controlling the migration of many cell types; similar roles were attributed to the component proteins of focal contacts such as vinculin, talin, a-actinin, and paxilin, which play a critical role in directed cell migration, adhesion, and normal growth."" - New Insights onTherapy with Vitamin D p 517

Second, it employs an optogenetic circuit to express, with great precision, a panel of enzymes that can regulate oxidative stress through the breakdown of ROS.  Our synthetic biology approach combines the advantages of native ROS-sensing pathways and existing technologies while mitigating their drawbacks; it is a system that is cost-efficient and self-sustaining, while also offering greater sensitivity, versatility, and spatial resolution.
This platform is incomplete without a mechanism that can integrate our real-time reporting signal with the regulatory enzymatic output.  Through extensive collaborations with a startup incubator and with invaluable feedback from hydroponic farmers, we developed a specialized optics-based technology that can accurately interpret oxidative stress reporting and precisely regulate gene transcription on an industrial scale.  This technology shifts power from nature to farmers; we give farmers the tools to monitor each and every crop, as well as the ability to control environmental parameters at leisure and at will.  The farmers benefit from increased crop yields and profits.  The world benefits from economic stimulation and increased food supply.
Climate change, environmental destruction, and resource allocations are imminent threats to a growing population and a deteriorating world, and hydroponics offers a promising path to address those global issues.  At Cornell iGEM, we are committed to engineering innovative, practical solutions to unlock the full potential of hydroponics.  Through hydroponics, we create a future of sustainability that is only possible with synthetic biology.
PROJECT BACKGROUND
OXIDATIVE STRESS
Oxidative stress is defined as a disturbance in the balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and antioxidant defenses [5].  It plays a critical role in many biological processes, the most significant of which (with respect to plants) are pathogen defense [6], programmed cell death [7], and cell to cell signaling [8].  More recent studies have linked ROS to nutrient uptake in a beneficial capacity [2].  In opposition to these benefits, however, too high a level of oxidative stress is lethal to most organisms as it leads to unspecific oxidation of proteins and membrane lipids, as well as DNA injury [10].  Furthermore, tissues exposed to high levels of oxidative stress show an increased production of ethylene [9] which can be detrimental to the plant.
Because of the diversity of roles played by oxidative stress in biological systems, its optimization is a logical choice for anyone interested in increasing yields in agriculture.  Finally, it is not sufficient to simply rely upon plants’ evolutionary response mechanisms to oxidative stress as reproductive efficiency does not necessarily correlate directly to growth or"

Foreword
China’s tobacco industry ranks first in the world, with the production and sales of cigarette in China taking the first place in the world. Meanwhile, China come naturally to have the largest population of smokers, and the topic of cigarette always has a high degree of attention. The unfortunate reality is that even the tobacco industry do not realized the potential value of tobacco waste, for so much chemical substance in  it may be useful for medicine. This year, our project aimes at transform the nicotine  to prodrug ——SP.
We tried to use the pure nicotine at first, but we changed our mind after investigation to the tobacco factory. By using the the waste tobacco, not only we have a large amount of material, but also could help to solve the pollution of burning the tobacco dusts. After that, we made a questionnaire about the social hot issues of tobacco and the knowledge about tobacco waste, which gave us more understanding about tobacco industry so we can revise our project according it. Besides, we make more people know about iGEM and synthesis biology, educate them the harm of smoking by distributing questionnaires, giving a lecture in local high school. We also play a role in the “ Science Open Week” of our university to share the the beauty of science with visitors all over the country. When we communicate with high school students, we put forward to helping them to establish a high school iGEM team. At the same time, we took part in two seminar of iGEM, sharing the experience with other iGEMers.
In the Questionnaire, Education, Community Propagation, Help of building new iGEM high school teams section, we constantly propagate the iGEM and synthetic biology knowledge, and help people understand correctly the tobacco industry through discussions with the public. In the investigation, Questionnaire and communication with iGEMers selection, our HP work help us deepen our understanding of the subject and guide our subject to the right direction, and finally we found that a new field can develop a downstream production line for the tobacco industry to produce drugs.Therefore, we think we are qualified for the Human Practice silver and Gold medal.

Age: 24
Study: B.Sc. biology
After hearing a lot about the last iGEM projects at the TU Darmstadt, I absolutely wanted to join. I like the idea of working in a research group for which iGEM offers the first opportunity.
I am looking forward to gain practical experience, especially since one normally does not get the chance to do so during the regular study.
To meet other people, to exchange ideas and get in contact with economy, thats the spirit of iGEM.
Because of that, I am really excited to participate on this years iGEM competition and I am also really looking forward to see you guys on the Giant Jamboree in Boston!

If there are no phages added to our solution, the bacteria grow normally until they reach the carrying capacity (number of bacteria at which the solution is saturated) of the solution, which is an equilibrium state for our system.
2) No bacteria
Figure8: Growths in no bacteria condition over 24h
If there are no bacteria, the phages slowly degrade.
3) Average behaviour
Figure 9: Growths in average conditions over 24h
This figure shows the result of our simulation for a phages-bacteria interaction that do not present any extreme value for the key parameters.
As we can see after a small time where the phages population is steady it quickly rises. This small time is the result of the time needed by the phage to multiply and kill its host after infection. This time is called the latent time TL.
Once there are enough phages the bacteria population start to decline due to the multiple phages-induced lytic cycles. In this modeling (with no phage-resistant bacteria factor) we can see that there are no more bacteria after 23 hours.
As soon as bacteria are killed their DNA is released into the solution, this DNA will then be degraded over time.
Finally, we can see here that the bacteria population is equal to the carrying capacity (and the number of bacteria in a “no phages” situation) for a certain amount of time, then starts to decline.
This “typing point” is in fact reached when the phages-bacteria ratio is high enough. In this article[1] the authors already highlighted this threshold: “the concentration of susceptible bacteria can only decline if the concentration of free phages exceeds the inundation threshold VI”. In our modelling with our equations this threshold is equal to:
4) Fast growing bacteria
Figure 10: Growths in case of fast growing bacteria over 24h
When we change the growing rate of our bacteria it is interesting to see that the time necessary to eradicate the bacteria is actually smaller than in the average behaviour modelling. This can be explained by the fact that when the growing rate is higher the bacteria population is close to the carrying capacity for a longer time.
As a result there are more phages-bacteria interactions and more phages produced, which in the end eradicate the bacteria more rapidly.
5) High phages multiplication rate
Figure 11: Growths in high phages multiplication rate over 24h
With a higher phages multiplication rate even less time is needed to eradicate the bacteria population.
We can also see here two “bumps” in the number of phages and"

Yes, we know which proteins dimerize. We understand how proteins dimerize as well, by interaction of domains like leucine zippers and so forth. But why? What is the point of dimerization?
Previous researches have underlined the important advantages of dimerization, including differential regulation, specificity, facilitated proximity and so on. [citation needed] The influence of dimerization in noise propagation is hardly touched due to the difficulty in controlling experiment variables. Synthetic biology provides powerful tools to carry out experiments otherwise impossible in designed systems. This is exactly what we do.
Traditionally, we evaluate the impacts of noise using variance-related statistics, such as coefficient of variance. These quantities can only describe how concentrated the output is around the mean value, but cannot tell us how well we can infer one of the correlated random variables from the other. Channel capacity makes a better criteria of noise because it more scientifically depicts the information dissemination process."

Furthermore, our team started to particularly working on the BioBricks. It started with pJET-cloning and -transformation.
Week 9 (05.09 – 09.09)
Restriction & Ligation, pJET & Sequencing of new ccdB
A new transformation of the correct Red_mazF cell line was done to get more and fresh clones. The colour of the newly transformed cells was not as deeply red as expected.
Blue_ccdB of the week before also didn’t show a satisfying colour. ONC was done of the diluting plating from the ligation the week before. The next day the ONC could not be used because of contamination. To be sure, a new LB media was made.
Sequencing of the ccdB-pJET cells showed the correct results for sample 5. Therefore, PCR was made for sample 5 the same way as before. PCR product was cleaned up and restriction digestion of ccdB was performed. Afterwards, the new ccdB fragment was ligated with a blue fragment from the week before and pUC19, of course. The next step was transformation and plating, followed by diluting plating and ONCs of 5 random colonies for miniprep.
Week 10 (12.09 – 16.09)
Miniprep & Protein Expression Control
Minipreps of week 9 were digested with PstI and XbaI but rejected for the following reason: Blue colonies were all of a sudden spotted on the plates of the transformation of week 9 (Fig. 20). For this reason, new diluting plating was done with 8 blue colonies (Fig. 21). ONCs were made by inoculating the same colonies. The next day miniprep was performed. After measuring nanodrop a restriction digestion for controlling the presence of all three inserts was done (Fig. 22). The last three of the 8 bands showed the correct size and were sent to sequencing. Band number 7 was correct (Fig. 23.

Figure 4: Location of RBS within secondary structure predicted by RNA Fold before (a) and after (b) redesign. Note the bases nearly on top of each other within the RBS in the first structure.
Design Concerns
While the original aim was to quickly clone the construct into T7 Express Escherichia coli and focus on optimizing expression, extraction, and functional characterization problems arose rapidly. The design phase was relatively rapid while remaining well-reasoned. Perriman and Ares emphasized the importance of a downstream box structure for optimal translation of circular constructs. Since the ribosome entry site can theoretically be located anywhere along the construct due to the circular nature of the construct, a sequence alignment of a typical downstream box sequence suggested movement of the ribosome binding site from the beginning of the sequence to the second border between exon 24 and exon 21, between a hydrophobic and cross-linking domain. Estimates of RNA secondary structure made by Geneious RNA fold predicted a fairly inaccessible start codon and ribosome binding site (RBS); the insertion of two synonymous T->A mutations in the immediate area without creating any rare codons was able to create a much more accessible RBS based on this level of prediction. Synthesis by IDT of the entire construct was predicted to result in synthesis complexities, but the general convenience of Gibson assembly of 3 fragments made it possible to instead order two shorter sequences with an appropriate overlap (location at the border of two exons made the overlap area unique among possible sequences in the overlap created by the exonuclease). No difficulties were predicted.
Cloning Difficulties
Receipt of the two DNA strands was delayed by a week, the first indication of difficulties due to the repetitive sequence still being a problem. Gibson assembly and transformation yielded a number of colonies, but every colony sequenced had major deletions or insertion. Tuning of Gibson timing and parameters did not result in significant improvement through multiple iterations. PCR amplification of the initial synthesis products became necessary as the intial supply began to run out. An attempt at self-primed PCR rather than Gibson assembly, in case some particular component of the specific procedure was responsible for the difficulties, resulted in a smear potentially indicative of nonspecific binding. Ultimately, brute"

If a laser is used as light source it hardens the resin pointwise in a certain depth until a complete hardened layer is produced before the base plate is moved. This requires laser optics to guide the laser beam towards defined points in space. If a less focused light source is used, the whole layer can be lighted in one step [1] [3] [4] . This is then referred to as Digital Light Processing (DLP) [4] . The hardening process of the resin depends on the light source and the photoinitiator in the resin used to start the polymerization.
Chemical Background
During the printing process a radical polymerization occurs at the illuminated spots which leads to the hardening of the resin. This way the shape of the desired structure can be created layer by layer. This radical polymerization is achieved by adding a photoinitiator to the photocurable prepolymer.
Photoinitiators are fragile molecules which decay into radicals when hit by light of a specific wavelength. These radicals react with the unsaturated carbon-carbon double bonds in the resin kicking off a radical polymerization. In our case the double bonds of itaconic acid in prepolymer are responsible for the crosslinking. The radical forming reaction initiated by electromagnetic radiation can be seen in Figure 1.

Goal
The goal was to construct and build a fully functional and at the same time easy-to-use and low-cost SLA-DLP 3D printer using a RaspberryPi as a control unit and a self-written software to print structures out of commercial resins. Therefore the software should access both Beamer and stepper motor and provide a user interface where the user can load CAD models, slice them and submit the printing job to the printer. Furthermore, the integration in the iGEM project of TU Darmstadt by means of building structures using the self-manufactured resin was striven for.

Dataset 637, was missing 138 classes due to the min. length requirement in the DatasetGenerator class. The requirement was lowered to 175AA. Further the DatasetGenerator class was rewritten, to ensure to contain 5 samples from every class in the validation set.
the eval() function of DeeProtein was rewritten to perform the validaion on the whole validation set at given steps.
Performance on 679 classes with minlength 175:
lr=0.01, e=0.1, batchsize=64
ROC
Precision lr=0.001, e=0.1, batchsize=64
ROC
Precision Reinitialization with pretrained parameters and lower learning rate allowed finetuning of the classifier. Especially as the validation set is uniformally distributed (in contrast to the training set) the classifier can be considered as trained.
ROC/ACC/AUC-metrics
ROC and AUC was added to be calculated on the fly (after validation on the whole validation set.).
Training models on the embedded sequences
We generated batches from the word embeddings (dim=100, kmer-length=3) for the 679(EC) and the 1084 mulilabel network. However training proceeds much more slowly as the parametersize is 5 times the size of the one-hot network.
Multilabel-classification
In order to be able to perform multilabel classification, we rewrite the input pipeline (DatasetGenerator, BatchGenerator, TFrecordsgenerator) and generated two datasets with 339 and 1084 classes respectively. The considered labels were chosen solely based on their polulation. As the GO-term hierarchy follows a directed acyclic graph (DAG) we looked up all parent nodes for each leaf nodes and included the total set of annotations for each sequence. First models were run after extending the network for 2 convolutional and 2 1x1 layers on the 1084 classes dataset. Results were disenchanting.

The laccase BPUL (from Bacillus pumilus) degraded 46.9 % of used estradiol after ten minutes incubation. ECOL  was able to degrade 6.7 % estradiol. BHAL degraded 46.9 % estradiol. With TTHL (laccase from Thermus thermophilus)a degradation 29.5 % were determined.
Immobilization
Figure 32: The percentage of laccases immobilized to CPC-Beads. 99 % of ECOL, 97 % of BPUL and 79 % of BHAL and TTHL laccases were bound to the beads.
Figure 32 shows the percentage of laccases bound after incubation with CPC-beads, relative to the original concentration. The concentration of laccases in the supernatant after incubation was measured using Roti®-Nanoquant. The results showed that only 1% of ECOL laccases was still present in the supernatant. This illustrates that ECOL was successfully immobilized on the CPC-beads.
Figure 33: Enzymatic activity of ECOL supernatant compared to the activity of nontreated laccases, measured using 0.1 mM ABTS at 25°C over a time period of 12hours. The results show a dramatic decrease of ECOL in the Supernatant.
In Figure 33, the enzymatic activity of ECOL in the supernatant is compared to the activity of nontreated ECOL. Although an activity can already be detected in the supernatant, this activity is low compared to the original.
Figure 34: Illustration of ABTS oxidation by ECOL with time compared to the negative control. The increase in ABTS oxidized proves laccase activity.
Figure 34 shows the illustration of ABTS oxidation by ECOL with time compared to the negative control. The increase in ABTS oxidized proves laccase activity even if a direct comparison with the original and not immobilized laccase solution was not possible due to the measuring methods.

Applied Design
aptasense is a biosensor targeting proteins. Based on cell-free synthetic biology, it harnesses the molecular machinery of cells, where parameters can be freely adapted, while avoiding the hassle of utilizing living cells and antibodies.
Our concept couples aptamer based affinity reagents to toehold switches, leading to a quick colorimetric output visible by eye. For a given target protein, aptamers can be found with the SELEX process within one to three months. This is a big improvement compared to producing the traditionally used antibodies from animals – aptamers are a lot cheaper and faster to synthesize, store and employ. The toehold switch triggered by the aptamer then renders the signal visible, making the protein assay possible. Together with the software we provide, functional toehold switches can be created from any given sequence within seconds, the whole process represents a novel approach to protein detection that is highly modular, fast and cost-efficient.
Why diagnostics
The ability to correctly diagnose diseases plays a key role in controlling their spread. However, many developing countries are unable to provide adequate diagnostic services to their populations. For example, according to the World Health Organization, only 64% of new tuberculosis cases are detected each year, hindering efforts to eradicate the disease 1 . The unavailability of diagnostic tests may be due to lack of funds to properly equip and run enough laboratories or lack of trained personnel 1 . Furthermore, point-of-care diagnostic tests have so far been ineffective due to problems in distribution logistics, high-costs, or their need for trained personnel to administer the tests.  Our project set out to address this issue. From the start, we identified several key design requirements that our"

Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Practices2_-_-_TEXT.html,", in this field, researchers can generate or modify the genome of an existing organism, insert a whole artificial genome in an existing organism or create a new artificial organism. We can wonder if these modifications made by humans will not have an impact on the nature of the organism. Can we consider that an organism is living if it has been totally or partially created artificially? Synthetic biology regards the “objects” which are created as living beings because they are built from the cell, the basic unit of life. They have the property of self-organization and identical or similar self-replication to those of natural living beings.  So we can considerate that they are “alive”?
With these ""new"" organisms, a living being may be considered as simple and easy to create. Once decoding the DNA of a organism is understood, synthetic biology is able to do everything with a bacteria, a yeast or animals bigger, thinking that are like ""machines"". But is it ethical to consider life as a tool, which we do in the iGEM competition? What is the limit between an ethical scientific project and an unethical scientific project.
Ethical considerations about our project
All of these ethical considerations made us think about our project Cur'd Vine.
First, it is important to us that our project was related with transparency, so that uninitiated people can apprehend our scientific approach. Our Wiki, in free access on the WEB, allows us to clearly and concisely expose all the thinking steps which governed our Cur’dVine project. It also allows us to share our knowledge and results to as many people as possible. New iGEM teams or other researchers could use our results to continue our project. Furthermore, our implication in annex projects such as Cap Sciences, making street interviews about GMO's or high school presentations about synthetic biology, is a sign that we have constantly tried to democratize synthetic biology to the general public and helped us to consider the profits and risks. Without being paranoiac, we have to think of all potential dangers that our molecule may create.
Will this molecule be able to create new diseases? Can it break the flora equilibrium for example through effects on bees in the region and creating the proliferation of chinese hornets? We can also ask ourselves questions concerning it's effects on humans. Since curdlan is technically a sugar biopolymer, would it increase the sugar level in wine? These are questions which can be asked by the general public and which might cause them to be frightened of our project. This is why we have taken into consideration these questions and tried to answer them in the best way possible which are resumed in"

We constructed a plasmid expressing malQ responding to the concentration of tryptophan. Tryptophan sensor part and malQ were PCR amplified and gel-purified while pTrc99A was linearized between NcoI and PstI. Then the fragments were assembled by Takara infusion cloning kit. The plasmid was named pTrc99A_trp sensor_malQ. We firstly transformed the infusion product into DH5a component cell and 20 single colonies were cultured and confirmed by PCR.

Other areas of concern include a lacklustre description and comparison of the AHL and AI-2 signalling pathways that needs to be improved (ie, why do we want AI-2 beyond my favourite example of enabling a quorum-based logic gate? I need to mention specific cases where the AHL system does not function while AI-2 does, which can be found in the literature); poor formatting of names that need to be italicised or not (genes vs proteins); a more rigorous description of how and why bacteria use quorum sensing in nature; a better introduction to LuxOD47A, where it came from, how it was developed and in what specific experiment it was used in. This list is by no means exhaustive and I’m sure that more will come up once I address the issues that I’ve mentioned.
Materials and methods and results writing
We discussed this in our paper meeting today. I was still somewhat in thesis mode and I wasn’t sure how much detail to include because I thought that we were just writing this for the wiki. As mentioned in the meeting today, I’ll make it less cumbersome, assume some prior knowledge of technologies such as PCR, and use the descriptions that I wrote for the typed edition of my notebook.
I’m still a little uncertain about the results too  – I haven’t focussed on it that much yet because I’ve been caught up in the previous sections. From what I understand, since I don’t have any functional validations (if my cells glowed, I would worry), the sequencing results really are the verification that something happened. I’ll also include my very last gel, which includes the DNA ladder, a negative control, LuxOD47A BBk, LuxOD47A BBk + B0015, and J13002 + Lux… + B0015. This displays everything that we’re contributing to the registry; has a good negative control; and distinct size differences that help validate the results. I’ll have a better sense of whether to include more detail as the section takes form – we had talked about including a gel for every stage of the process, but if I can embody all 3 Registry contributions in one, it would be the least cumbersome to just use that.

The collecting was done in the framework of school. Each of the participants came to the station we set up at the school and filled out an questionnaire and then answered a questionnaire while tasting. The questionnaire included questions tailored to the tastes of the participants: sweet, umami, sour, salty and bitter. Each participant stated his sensitivity to different tastes when tried, the listing the participant’s phenotype. All data was collected into a general survey which summarized the results of the participants.
Shelly has no sensitivity to - PTC
Lior on the other hand cannot stand the taste of PTC
At the same time a saliva sample was taken from each of the participants. The saliva sample will be a source of DNA of all tested in the future. The samples were collected on a unique membrane. Next to each saliva sample a number marked the participant. Respectively the questionnaire of the participant was marked. This was done so that we could compare the results between the genotype of the participant and the phenotype stated.

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on"

ECUST,2018,Team:ECUST#test_-_-_TEXT.html," about us.
Collaborations: This year, we collaborated with many teams and got a deeper understanding of synthetic biology. On one hand, we worked with IIT-Madras to make a short video about DNA&RNA, and designed the cartoon image for our project. On the other hand, we collaborated with two high school teams on the interlab experiments, and instructed them in further study
Consulting Experts: To view our project in a more comprehensive way, we consulted professors not only in the department of Biology, but other departments such as Resource and Environment and gained valuable suggestions and profound insight.
Interviewing Workers: On top of discussing with experts, we also interviewed some employees in related industries to collect the opinions from enterprises. We think that while experimental work plays a vital role, the real situation of the industry should also be valued, which is also quite helpful for improving ourselves.
Engagement: As a team paying attention to the social effect caused by our project, we never forget to take the public opinions into consideration. By distributing questionnaire and making short video on fundamental biology, we tried to make more people know about us, and we also have our own platform (ECUSTLab) to publish related articles and collect public suggestions.
Gold
3+ net: Thought teams under the environment track focus on different issues, we are all faced with the limited application scenarios and public concerns, which pose barriers for the practical use of projects. The concept of “3+ net” (Applications+, Society+ and Biosafety+) and related guidelines will be helpful for all teams to improve projects accordingly.
Economic benefit: One of the most important problems caused by biofilm and rust in cooling water loop was the exceedingly high usage of water, chemical and energy. So we kept improving our project based on the principle of “spend less, get more”, since it is not our ultimate goal to create something, but to make it truly useful for the society, the economy, and the people.
Responsibility: By analyzing the data acquired from the questionnaire carefully and holding meetings regularly, we discussed the public opinions thoroughly and often had self-reflective thoughts on the project and its social impact. Synthetic biology is a powerful weapon, which should always be used properly and with responsibility.

iGEM is more than biology
The iGEM competition not only aims to drive the development of new Biobricks. It also encourages to think about responsibilities, safety and risks in the field of biotechnology. Furthermore, iGEM is about working together and helping other teams in various aspects. Read more how we want to contribute to these goals.
During the the last year your team not only thought about BioBricks and how to connect them. We also wanted to contribute to the iGEM community. To find more, take a look at the following sections. It will be worth it!
Wiki tutorial
You are new to iGEM or are not familiar with creating a your own Wiki? We wrote a tutorial explaining both, how to create a wiki at the first place but also how to use without knowing all this computer stuff. This page make it easier for you to get started!
Safety and thoughts on synthetic biology
The field of biotechnology is often linked to  controversial discussions. But what are the real risks and chances of biotechnology? Here, we discuss different ethical aspects about synthetic biology and our project in particular.
Collaborations
Munich is among a few cities that will have two participating iGEM teams. Of course we had to meet! Our meeting with the LMU Munich team gave us the chance to get to know each other and discuss your projects. Thank you LMU munich for this nice occasion!

Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," at the profit-maximizing price. This price, however, does not necessarily maximize social benefit especially since monopolistic trade results in deadweight loss [1] . In other words, this means that the collective world production of societal benefits - such as medical treatments - potentially decreases in order to maximize profit for Sangamo.
Technology Vacuum
Lack of transparency in the field inhibits outside research while promoting Sangamo’s internal research. Technology that otherwise would have been available for use by many researchers is concealed behind Sangamo's large patent portfolio. Therefore, Sangamo passively impedes outside research by removing the opportunities for advancement and dissemination of protocols.
Risk of Centralization and Failure
Another problem with the monopolistic model arises when the company fails: when it fails to make scientific progress, and the whole field suffers. Recently, Sangamo Biosciences’ lead drug candidate has flunked its biggest test yet in clinical trials, and the company said this morning [October 3 2011] that it’s time to move on to other programs.[Sangamo] said today that SB-509 failed in a study of 170 patients that randomly assigned patients with diabetic neuropathy to a new drug or a placebo."" [8] If concerns of IP violation discouraged other researchers from working on comparable zinc finger-based treatments for that disease, there is now nothing to show for years of work, and the disease remains untreatable from a gene therapy approach.
Two Sides to Every Story: Benefits of IP
Intellectual Property Security
However, others have argued that concentrating intellectual property in a single company has actually promoted innovation and progress in the field [2] . Monetary incentive to conduct research is undoubtedly a key driving force for scientific progress. What scientist or institution would invest in research without at least a chance of returning profit? Lack of protection of intellectual property rights and thus profit would diminish the sense of security and equality that the U.S. patent system currently provides. In fact the U.S. patent system was first instated to encourage openness of knowledge. Sangamo's large patent share gives the impression that intellectual property rights block future research incentive. In fact without intellectual property rights zinc finger research (and Sangamo) may not even exist today.
Centralization Boosts Efficiency
By bringing leaders in the field together, Sangamo might allow zinc finger researchers to be more productive through close collaboration than they otherwise would have been working individually. Furthermore, specialization in zinc finger technology minimizes costs of production that individual researchers would otherwise face. From the perspective of consumers purchasing zinc fingers, valuable time and negotiation costs may be saved by working with one company rather than"

Why we do this
In recent years, cancer has become one of the most serious killers threatening human health.                     Morbidity and mortality raising continuously, cancer is becoming a primary death reason and a                     significant public health problem. As is reported by Chinese Cancer Statistics 2015, there will be                     more than 4 million new cancer cases and nearly 3 million deaths of cancer in 2015. It has become                     one of the most serious problems facing by China, even globe, to treat cancer effectively.
Aiming at different kind of cancers, different medicines and treatments have been developed based on                     different therapy principles. However, the detecting and screening of medicines now is conducted                     based more on chemical methods, which is sometimes complex and time-consuming. Inspired by the                     properties of microtubule-stabilizing agent taxol, we developed a method to screen medicines based                     on the microtubule stabilization. If microtubule-stabilizing molecule exists, our engineered protein                     will polymerize and show light which can be detected through microscope. We expect it to be a more                     sensitive and effective system to screen anticancer agents.
Our Human Practice is based on the project and included interviews, investigations and games we                     designed.
Preparing before begining
Mini-iGEM
We organized the Mini-iGEM competition, which took a month, before our project began. As its name,                     the competition is for small iGEM projects designed by ten groups. They worked as iGEM's pattern and                     designed a project or solved a problem using principles of synthetic biology. Then we invited some                     professors to score these projects and give their advice. Through this competition, we found some                     inspiring ideas and on the other hand deepened students' understand of iGEM.
Here are some of posters of Mini-iGEM.

Brown,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," mixture.  This was done in an attempt to glean some information about the transformation efficiency, as well as to hopefully attain sufficiently isolated colonies.  However, given the calculations, it is likely that there will still be too many cells even on the 1:100 dilution to get the deisred paucity of colonies.  Only used a single negative control consisting of the yeast cells plated onto a dropout plate.  Did not use an empty plate as a control.  Thus, if we find contamination on the control plate, we will not know whether it was due to the transformation mixture or the actual plate.
Is should also be noted that, due to timing issues, the cells were left sitting for considerable amounts of time at various steps during the protocol.  For example, after being centrifuged the final time, they were left sitting in the centrifuge for about 20 minutes before being resuspended in fresh water.  If anything, this should have a significant effect on the transformation effeciency.
Also linearized DNA:
Tried to make reactions that were multiples of 17 uL for use in the transformation protocol.  Put in about 0.5 ug of DNA per 17 uL.  Heat inactivated the PstI, but this would have been ineffective for BstEII.  Thus, cleaned up all reactions using a PCR purification kit.  Eluted in volumes that were identical to the original volumes of each reaction (either 36 uL, 53 uL, or 70 uL, accounting for the loss of 2 uL in the column).  However, concentrations were not measured, so it is possible that the DNA was at different concentrations than we assumed.  Should have taken concentration measurements beforehand, or else there will be no basis for standardization.  At this point, will merely have to observe whether the transformation efficiencies on each plate are comparable to each other.
Placed all plates into incubator around 11:30 pm.
Competent E. coli cells:
Used overnight culture of HB101 to inoculate a large culture of SOB media (500 mL). Monitored growth until the OD was around 0.0741 according to the nanodrop, which we have reason to believe corresponds to 0.741.

To complement our chromate biosensor, we originally aimed to find out how much chromate would be left on an incision in a bone from a stab of a certain force. However this was quickly turned around to measure the wear of bone instead of stainless steel. By calculating the force required to make the incision, this could potentially indicate the size or strength of a possible suspect, while the sliding distance would correspond to the length of the blade. The bone incision experiments allowed us to create a relationship between the applied force, sliding distance and wear volume when a stainless steel knife collides with bone. The results showed that the volume will increase as the length of the blade or the force increases (Fig. 11). However some irregularities were noticed and are likely due to experimental error with the equipment shown in Fig. 12. You can see Hannah demonstrating the method used in our STV appearance .

What next?
Since most of the parameters were assumed in the mathematical models, there is room for error. Practical experiments could be done to produce values for the kinetic parameters or sensitivity analysis to compare varying kinetic parameter values. Probing the concentration range for detecting different chromate salts will be essential to feed back into the modelling which is currently largely based on assumptions. This would ensure that the models are more realistic and therefore give a more valid description of the systems.
Figure 13: Further work would include testing and validation of our methods.
The next step for this project is to find an ideal concentration of ChrB in relation to Pchr-gfp to work in a balance way of expression/repression. This involves finding plasmids with an appropriate copy number and promoters of appropriate strength. The modularity of this system makes this process easier. Once a concentration range has been established, we can test the system by using actual shavings of stainless steel. A problem that might occur is that the chromium contained in the alloy is in the wrong oxidation state. Oxidising chromium to yield Cr(VI) can be done by subjecting it to a strong acid. The solution will have to be neutralised again to be used as an additive for an experiment. The question is then if the concentration is still high enough to induce expression of GFP in our system.

Kyoto,2016,Team:Kyoto#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," surface using INPNC-His surface display system. We directly observed the binding of scFv expressing E. coli and NoVLP using SEM. Also, we observed E. coli's binding to cellulose with fluorescent microscopy, though its binding levels leave rooms for improvements. When both of the two plasmids expressing these handles were transformed into an E. coli strain, we could detect colonies carrying the two plasmids. However, the two plasmids were not stably inherited after single colony isolation, presumably due to the use of the same antibiotic resistance marker in the plasmids.
4-2 Noro-catcher can be significantly improved in the future
A major problem of our Noro-catcher is the instability in retaining two handles, scFv and CBDcex, within an E. coli cell. To solve this problem, it would be necessary to construct a stable dual-expression strain using different antibiotic resistance markers, in addition to introducing compatible plasmid pairs with different replication origins as mentioned above. It would also be an effective measure to combine the two plasmids to make a single plasmid which can express both of the handles (Fig18).
Upon constructing a dual expression system, it should be noted that there is a potential problem in expressing two different passenger proteins by using a single surface display mechanism. It was reported that the dual expression of passengers using Lpp-OmpA was unsuccessful [16]. The same display systems are likely to be expressed using the same machinery of E. coli, and are displayed on the same region of its membrane. In order to avoid the direct competition of the two proteins, it might be needed to express them in different systems. As Lpp-OmpA-CBDcex system were reported to work well [15][16][17], we can introduce this system to our project. Then, we can expect to realize a Noro-catcher which binds effectively to both cellulose and NoVLP. Our future work would be the construction of the plasmid as shown in Fig19.

4-3 Developing therapeutic application for NoV
As we successfully observed the Noro-catcher's binding to NoVLP, we have paved a new path for developing therapeutic medication for NoV infection. As stated in the introduction, NoV binding to Histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) is suggested to be an important part of NoV invasion. Also, NoV binding to antibody 12A2 in its HBGA binding site has been demonstrated previously [18]. The scFv used in our research derives from antibody 12"

Ellen Jorgensen
Our interview :
Team Paris Saclay : You are the co-founder and the president of Genspace (a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting citizen science and access to biotechnology), what are you motivations ?
Ellen : Well, I think everyone who started Genspace had a different motivation. There was an artist who wanted a place, a lab where she could work on art-related biology. There were two students who could not get labspace in their university.They had ideas they wanted to try and they wanted training, and no one was giving them any space, because funding is very tight in the United States and people can’t afford to take on students working on projects not directly related to their grants, [especially] someone who is not trained. A person was a science writer who thought that this was a very interesting trend and he didn’t want to miss what was going on. And I had worked during 25 years in biotechnology and I thought it was great that people who wanted to do [biology] voluntarily, not being told by their schools they had to take this class. People who were really curious about science and wanted to practice it…. If you look to iGEM, the United States very rarely win, the other countries support their teams a lot better. The value of this kind of exercise is important to me, and I wanted to provide a place where people could do synthetic biology biology, genetic engineering or anything like that and not have to convince the university or company to let them have space. And also, I was at a point in my carreer I wanted to do something different. I didn’t want to be just a PhD scientist in a lab working on series of projects, I wanted to make a more global impact.

These colonies are a subset of the ""good"" colonies from our sequencing results from Sunday.  We mixed 120 ul of bacteria in mid-log with 300 ul of 80% glycerol to make the final solution, which was stored at -80 degrees C.
Restriction enzyme test
We tested both XbaI and BsaI on the junction PCR product using colony 79.4 as a template (which was used because it was a ""bad"" sequence overall but had intact BsaI and XbaI cut sites).  The junction PCR product is 1326 bp, and we expected to see bands of 593 and 739 bp with XbaI, and 717 and 578 bp with BsaI.  Our restriction digest recipe consisted of the following per reaction:
1 ul 10X buffer (NE biolabs buffer 4)
7.9 ul H2O
1 ul DNA (~100 ng)
1 ul enzyme (~2 units)
1 ul BSA (100x)
The two gels we ran for this digest showed that XbaI did NOT work, which may be due to XbaI being too old.  However, we did get double bands both times for BsaI.  Our egel was strange because of uneven loading, and so we were unable to determine the true size of both bands, but the agarose gel we ran later showed the two bands in the right positions.  The two gels can be seen below:
E-gel of our first digestion. The gel looks unusual (notice the bubble-like formation), so we performed a second digestion.
1% agarose gel of our second digestion. Although the bands are faint, we can see the appropriately sized bands for Bsa1.
Ultramer Construction of Pos Con 77 and Other F2/F3 positive controls
We redid the ultramer overlap PCR for Pos Con 77, this time with the correct reverse sequence.  We also assembled ultramers for Zif268, OZ052 and OZ123 (these are the plasmids that will have the type II cut sites in them along with F2/F3 only, as opposed to having the entire finger already assembled).  For the Zif268 reaction, an annealing temperature of 65*C was used, and for the rest, the annealing temperature was 58*C.  For all reactions, the extension time was "

National iGEM Collaboration
Meeting with the other Dutch teams to discuss the program of the Discovery Festival
We collaborated with the iGEM teams from Eindhoven, Wageningen and Groningen to make iGEM and SB feature in the program of Discovery Festival. During the summer we had several meetings with representatives from each collaborating iGEM team. During these sessions we discussed, together with the organization of the event, on how to incorporate SB into the program. All teams took their responsibility by providing and preparing part of the program. In addition, we divided all participating teams over the three locations, so that iGEM would be represented on all locations. Because of the excellent teamwork and effort, we were able to realize the following program:
The program
Flyer for the Discovery Festival
1. The SB-experience
As main part of the program, people will experience the process of genetically modifying bacteria by following a 7-step workshop in an improvised laboratorial setting: From ordering DNA online, to implementing the perceivable characteristic into bacteria and showing the resulting bacteria on agar plate. Safety is of course a priority: no actual GMOs or E.coli will be used.
2. The posters
We have made a wall full of posters, on which several fictional and non-fictional iGEM-projects are shown. The goal of this is to give the people an idea of the potential of SB, but also to inspire them and see how they will react on this.
3. What would you do with your own iGEM project?
After the experience, people are asked what they would do if they could start their own iGEM project. All these ideas are recorded on a video guestbook.
4. Tuur van Balen
We invited Tuur van Balen , an artist who got heavily inspired by SB, to the Discovery Festival in Amsterdam. His work will prove to be a stimulus in introducing SB to the public.
Because the event will take place after the wiki-freeze we are unable to show the results. Click here to see a report of the festival!

From the analysis results, we can optimize the detection time in order to achieve the most                         effective time. At the same time, for a fixed antigen-antibody pair, the value is proportional                         to the initial reaction rate; the optimal time is approximately the same. Finally, there is a                         clear relationship between the detection time and the gray value relationship.
LIQUID CRYSTAL MOLECULES PERTURBATIONS MODEL
The field of synthetic biology relies heavily on mathematical models that help simulate and                         predict the process and consequence of biological systems. We developed two models, the radial                         domino model and the blooming model to describe the potential perturbation mechanism and                         interaction modes between protein particles and liquid crystal molecules. The protein density                         threshold can be calculated by this model.
Purpose
An important part of our liquid crystal experiment is to determine an optimal antigen                         concentration, so we creatively proposed two models to calculate the β2-M density                         microscopically. The trouble is that we do not know the range of antigen molecules that can                         perturb liquid crystal molecules. Therefore, we consulted the relevant parameters, proposed two                         models, calculated the range of the single antigen molecule to perturb the liquid crystal, and                         finally determined the threshold of the antigen concentration, which was consistent with our                         experimental results.

Hypothesis
Fig.9 Two possible mechanisms for β2-M to disturb liquid crystal
The process of protein perturbation of liquid crystal molecules is particularly complicated, so                         we can only guess the disturbance mechanism on our own. Inspired by dominoes and the blossoming                         of flowers, we proposed that there might be two mechanisms of disruption. We called them RADIAL                         DOMINO MODEL and BLOOMING MODEL
Fig.10 RADIAL DOMINO MODEL
Simplify the β2-M and 5CB as ball and stick. The distance between each two sticks is equal. Due                         to the interference of the ball, the first stick next to the ball will be inclined at an angle.                         The first stick will affect the next stick"

UNOTT,2017,Team:UNOTT#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," the cells for two weeks at different temperatures has no to little effect on the reporter expression.
Figure 1: Graph of strong promoter 4 and weak promoter 1 transformed cells RFP fluorescence assay after freeze-drying revival two weeks and three weeks after samples were freeze dried.
However, there is a notable decease in fluorescence from 2 to 3 weeks at room temperature, especially pronounced at 4 and 6 hour after revival.. This problem may be mitigated in that the drop offs seem proportional to both WP1 and SP4, so the ratios of expression may remain the same. Having said this, the differences in expression would be within the bounds of the thresholds set to compare the two, as even with the changes they would still be identifiable. One might argue that the need to set so many time and storage dependent thresholds makes the system unnecessary complicated. To minimise the described variables that need to be taken into consideration keys stored at room temperature should be replaced after two weeks. Keys which require long term storage should be stored at -80°C.
Interestingly, as predicted there is a substantial amount of fluorescence detectable 2 hours after revival, suggesting that a bacterial key could possibly be identifiable with little waiting period. However, they are undoubtedly more pronounced at 4 and 6 hours which would likely to be a more accurate time to measure.
Figure 2. This graph represents data kindly given to us by the University of Groningen. It details the revival of the two samples containing strong RBS promoter 4 and weak RBS promoter 1 with a RFP reporter. These were grown for an 6 hour period and fluorescence measurements were taken at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours. One sample each was stored at either room temperature, 4oC, or -80oC.
In figure 2, samples were transported to the University of Groningen through the postal courier service, so the samples at -80oC would not have been at this temperature for the entire duration up until measuremment. With this in mind, it still appears what was discussed before still holds true.
In conclusion, these results are very promising and show that cells remain viable and reliably express the reporter for up to three weeks at convenient storage conditions necessary for our key to work in a practical sense. The two promoters SP4 and WP1 are very distinct and easily discernible. There still remains a significant amount of viable bacteria regardless of storage conditions and their fluorescence intensity is very comparable at all stages of growth. It is worth noting that measurements were taken at 0 and 1 hours in figure "

Since SDS-Page to determine Phasin-HlyA Tag production had failed after incubation with an anti-FLAG resin (in Week 24), Lalit performed an immunoblot (Western Blot) on the protein samples with anti-FLAG Rabbit primary antibodies and goat anti-rabiit igG-HRP secondary antibodies. The HRP (Horse-Radish Peroxidase) changes color to blue if it is bound to the anti-FLAG rabbit antibodies, which thereby indicates that our Phasin-HlyA Tag with a FLAG tag is present. The Western Blot protocol can also be found on our Experiments page.

Process
Week 1: May 1 - May 5
During the first week, we checked the inventory and organized our lab supplies. We familiarized ourselves with the lab equipment and some of the protocols we might be using during the summer such as preparing LB agar plates, chemically competent E. coli cells, plasmid minipreps, and running colony PCRs. We also completed the required lab safety and biosafety training. We started researching Alberta’s wastewater treatment process and conducted a preliminary literature review of volatile fatty acid (VFA) production and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) extraction. We met with Dr. Peter Dunfield, a professor of microbiology at the University of Calgary, to discuss a novel approach of extracting PHB from bacteria to avoid using solvents such as chloroform for PHB extraction in our final process. Consequently, we brainstormed ideas about binding PHB granules to beads after autolysis of engineered E.coli.

Figure 22: The GFP level of different mir155 concentration inducing
Discussion
The results of the model are simulated with MATLAB software, then discussed the results. By setting up a k-value interval, calculated the relationship between KT and GFP level, we concluded GFP level are increasing as value of k increasing, when KT = 1e5, GFP level in steady stage. In figure 3, we can concluded that GFP level reaches its final stable value at about 600 minutes(10h). And this time is not sensitive to KT and km(lac). When changed kt and km(lac), the relationship between GFP level and time in common. GFP level decreases as km(lac) increases, but saturates when km(lac) is too large or too small. But the reference value lies in the unsaturated scope. This indicates that the inhibition of transcription of Lacl activates the expression of GFP. Figure 10 verified that GFP is proportional to P(T(Bxb1)off). Not only can we concluded the FimE has influenced on GFP level as same as Bxb1 from figure, but also
The results of the model are simulated with MATLAB software, then discussed the results. The value of GFP induced by mir155 is regarded as signal and the one without inducing is regarded as noise floor. From the figure 21, we can conclude that the system equipped with Lock and Key part has the higher signal to noise ratio (SNR) than the one without Lock and Key part. And Lock and Key part significantly reduce the background noise of detection. From the figure 22, we can conclude the Lock and Key part will not influence the linearity of detection and the correlation between GFP and concentration of mir155 is correct according to the figure.
In this paper, lots of parameters found in the literature, which is not accurate enough. In order to accurate model to check out experimental data, the relevant parameters can be added and modified, and the differential equation model can be modified and improved. Using differential equation modeling is only one of solutions, we also use colored Petri nets modeling and Bias theory modeling. Petri is a graphical and mathematical modeling tool which can be used in many kinds of systems. It provides a powerful means to describe and study the information processing system with parallel, asynchronous, distributed and stochastic characteristics. The main characteristics of Petri network include parallelism, uncertainty, asynchronous and description ability and analysis ability of the distributed system, so it can be used in many practical systems and fields.

OUR PROJECT
This year, chemotaxis interests us a lot. We intend to reprogram     the strain (CL-1) which lacks the CheZ gene to form mathematical     patterns. CheZ gene belongs to chemotaxis family of E.coli, and     protein CheZ can dephosphorylate CheY-P which allows E.coli to     make smooth swimming. The ΔCheZ bacteria can’t dephosphorylate     CheY-P, therefore the strain isn’t motile until CheZ is involved in.     Based on this, the motility of E.coli can be precisely controlled by     stimulus (such as IPTG). We try to construct logic gene circuits to     make E.coli recognize environmental stimulation, thus by utilizing     the controlled chemotaxis which named pseudotaxis we could     command bacteria to form patterns such as ellipse, hyperbola     and so on. The intrinsic motivation that drive us striving for the above project     is that we want to simulate the process of stem cell differentiation.     In the organs development, stem cells differentiate while aggregate     together to form heart, liver and kidney what have precise shapes.     We think there must be some mathematical"

Apart from this lab, we are also working in other microscopy labs of the Department of Bionanoscience, which have the same setup and safety regulations.
Office
Our office is our home for when we're not working in the lab. Here we work on parts of the project such as the safety tool, the wiki, the modeling, and processing our results. This summer the Bionanoscience department moved to a new building, so it took some time before we had our own office. When we finally got our office, we quickly made it our home. Next to our office, there is a meeting room, where we have a weekly meeting with our TA’s and PI’s to keep everyone up to date and discuss problems we might encounter.
Safety
General Lab Safety
Our lab is classified as Level 1 of biosafety. This is the lowest safety level, meaning that our experiments involve low or no risk. Therefore, we only handle organisms of Risk Group 1, these do not cause any disease in healthy adult humans. The biological materials used for our experiments are handled in an open bench. All the members of the team have received safety training and tests, including:
Introduction to sterile working
ML-1 safety training  + test
Chemical safety training + test
General safety information, regarding contact persons and locations + test
The safety of our experiments was supervised by Susanne Hage (wetlab coordinator of the department of Bionanoscience of the TU Delft) and Marinka Almering (Biosafety officer of the Faculty of Applied Sciences TU Delft). The research has been conducted with respect to the regulations of biosafety for The Netherlands, that can be found here.
Before starting any experiments we have written a research proposal including all our strains, DNA fragments, chemicals and experimental setups that we planned on using, as well as safety precautions, mini-MSDS’s and disposal requirements. This research proposal was approved by the biosafety officer prior to starting the experiments. The full research proposal can be found here .

General Safety
We have covered the safety aspect of our project in many ways. Within synthetic biology there should be three main risks that need to be covered: exposure of the laboratory workers to the bacteria and chemicals, effects of a possible escape of the bacteria and the unintentional disturbance of the ecosystem.
(Max Gibson)
In the past three months, we have added new branches into the pathways of E. coli. Our experiments were performed with non-pathogenic E. coli strains (BL21, DH5α, TOP10 and Rosetta™(DE3)pLysS), which belong to risk group 1 of the pathogenic organisms. Working with genetically modified organisms demands extra safety conditions; physical measures have been taken to separate the organism from the surrounding environment and vice versa.
Our project wants to protect plants and crops against aphid infestations and reduce the use of harmful insecticides. Our genetically modified bacteria (BanAphids) will produce (E)-β-farnesene (EBF) and methyl salicylate (MeS), which are naturally occurring substances. EBF repels aphids and MeS attracts ladybugs, one of the aphid's natural enemies. The low concentrations needed for these substances to be effective is not toxic for humans. No harmful effects are described for EBF at high concentrations either. Contrarily, pure MeS could cause harm when it is ingested due to its similarities with acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and can cause irritation after contact with eyes and skin. Nevertheless, it is typically used in small amounts as a flavouring agent in candy, or as fragrance oils due to its mint flavour and wintergreen fragrance. The two chemicals being produced by our BanAphids could cause allergic reactions (swelling, redness, ...), but serious reactions only occur in high concentrations and are very rare.
The effect of BanAphids on the environment is not trivial and thorough field experiments must definitely be conducted. The maximum production rate of a single bacterium needs to be determined so that this could be scaled up through a model. This way we would be able to estimate the concentration of EBF and MeS in the surroundings if a whole field would be occupied by BanAphids. We can then determine the necessary parameters in order to minimise ecological disruption according to these calculated estimates of surrounding EBF and MeS concentrations. We also thought about the interactions between aphids and ladybugs themselves. Aphids adapt readily when EBF is constantly present, therefore we included an oscillatory model. More information about"

1. Expanding new technology in Containment Strategy
- Regulations & Safety
- Research of GMOs intended to release/test in nature
When researchers aim to expand their experimental application from a laboratory scale to a larger scale such as pilot study (small-scale field) or large-scale study, one concern is the safety of products produced from engineered organisms.
2. Sensor for horizontal gene transfer
GFP is a well-known reporter used by many iGEM teams and researchers. Such visual reporters have limited use in some context such as soils, because it can only work in the presence of oxygen and the color output can hardly be detected under layers of soils.
Recently, Rice University researchers have developed gas biosensors that can track the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer without disturbing the soil matrices. This discovery can further aid the study of soil environment and horizontal gene transfer i.e., how hydration affects horizontal gene transfer.
Using our construct as a proof of concept, we can study how to detect and prevent the release of engineered and constitutively expressed product at the same time.  Moreover, this may also provide additional knowledge about the fitness of genetically modified organism comparative to the wild-type bacterium.
When horizontal gene transfer is detected, recombinase can knockout the gene of interest and later knock out the reporter gene after enough concentration of reporter is established.
This not only allow scientists to study horizontal gene transfer and bacterial interactions in a selected sample environment, but also to investigate the prevention of gene transfer between engineered and wild-type bacteria.
As extracting products from organisms require many purification steps and costly, it may be more favorable to be able to use engineered organisms equipped with safeguard system in the field.

Several fluorescent protein/promoter+RBS combinations were studied in more than one experiment, which is why each plasmid above is classified as a 'unique' combination.
The BioBricks in each pair were ligated together using T4 DNA Ligase, and transformed into TOP10 E. coli. Prepared cultures were streaked onto LB/chloramphenicol (CAM) agar plates, and were placed in a 37°C incubator overnight. After at least 20 hours, the plates were retrieved, and a single colony was grown overnight in 5 mL of LB/CAM media. After sequence confirming the plasmid"

2018 iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting
This year is our honor representing SSTi to participate in the iGEM competition. We are very excited and are eager to meet iGEMers from all around the world. In May this year, we attended the iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting organized by Shenzhen University, which gathered eight teams, over 100 attendees, from South China region to share and discuss each others projects. Although we are still at very early stage of our project, through discussion and brainstorming, we had a better understanding of the synthetic biology and developed great interests. We also came to realize the problems existed in the current project proposition, and were given advice on further improvements, for instance, we could expand our human practice activities to a wider area, hospital, beauty salons, manufacturers, etc. We also had great fun practicing public speech and answering questions at professional levels.
iGEM Euroasian Meetup 2018
At the end of July this year, we participated in Eurasian Meet-up organized by BGIC Global and TU Delft iGEM team. This was the first time for us to present our project in English. When we talked about the preparation of microneedle with hyaluronic acid, we received positive feedback from the audience and professionals, they showed interests to our concept and the proposed products. During the panel discussion, we discussed the content of synthetic biology with other team members and judges on various topics, this whole experience gave us a deeper understanding of the field. The most memorable part was the poster session. Many attendees came to our posters, discussed projects and shared their views with us. We also got to see a lot of well-designed posters, which was a great inspiration for us to modify our posters in the future. human practice activities to a wider area, hospital, beauty salons, manufacturers, etc. We also had great fun practicing public speech and answering questions at professional levels.
The fifth CCiC meeting
At the end of August this year, we attended the Fifth CCiC meeting. Not only once again we got to practice our presentation skills, we also had a chance to give advice to help other iGEM teams, including some of the freshmen."
HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," get some information about their intensity which help us to select the optimum promoter. Thirdly, to test whether our riboregulator works as expected or not, we replaced the coding sequence of Cre protein with the coding sequence of mCherry protein in the input module to detect the efficiency of this riboregulator by fluorescence intensity. As to the work of collaboration wit other teams, definitely, we did help HUST-China to sequencing their promoters and did this test of promoter intensity.
Anyway, the road to success is always laborious, but we still stick to our goal and finally make it by ourselves. To us, we spent a fullest summer holiday in our college lives and even took a big step forward in our life-long career. The following are more details about our experiments.

A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds.

Growing Cultures
Prepped 2 tubes of LB(5mL) with chloremphenicol and picked colonies of Bba-xxxx [1] to generate a starter culture for protein expression. Also prepped 2 tubes of of LB(5mL) with kanamycin and picked colonies of PET24a in order to miniprep and generate more plasmid.
We are growing the starter culture for the silk protein up to an OD of 0.8.
For the starter culture, because we started the incubation at 3pm, and we dont want to overgrow, we will put the cells in the 30 C shaker until tomorrow morning, at which point we will transfer to the 37 degree shaker.
The starter culture was placed in the 37 C incubator for one hour, and then transferred to the 30 C incubator at 4 PM"

METU_Turkey_Software,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software#test_-_-_TEXT.html," for whole functional constructs     contributes to the complexity and makes specific explorations difficult     through the Parts Registry. So, assigning “reporter” for both atomic     parts and for whole constructs is not a good practice. Instead, we are     suggesting the usage of other available terminology for the parts listed     as reporters, which most of the constructs, now known as reporters,     can be grouped into, such as “protein generators”, “composite parts”     or “inverters”.
Devices are whole constructs which are functional and have specific     and distinct functions. But, as we have observed, unfortunately, the     term “device” is also being used for parts which are not functional     and do not have specific functional at all. Moreover, within the classification     of devices, we argue that some terms are also being used unnecessarily     and ambiguously. Devices are classified into five types which are protein     generators, reporters, inverters, receivers and senders, measurement     devices. For example iGEM defines protein generators as:
Protein generator = promoter + rbs +gene + terminator
Though we accept the definition for protein generators, we observed     that there exist numerous parts which are defined as protein generators     but actually most of them do not fit to the definition provided above.     Although some parts are not functional and do not generate proteins     at all, they are classified as protein generators, which makes searching     for the parts difficult in the registry. Furthermore, there are also     numerous parts which are defined as “composite parts” but actually they     fit to the same definition with protein generators. In order to overcome     the problem of misuse of device type we have extracted related image     ID information for the composite parts. Image ID information helped     us to correctly categorize composite parts depending on its individual     atomic parts and identify the ones with more than one function, such     as being both inhibitor and activator. In other words, we used image     and part IDs in order to merge an input for its outputs.
Subtitle working conditions, includes all the detailed information     about the experimental properties of parts, and the details about the     working process of individual parts and complete devices. Additionally,     we marked the subtitle “Working Condition” in our standardization template     as potentially the most important title that helps synthetic biologist     to better understand the parts functions at iGEM’s part registry database.     The main problem we have encounter with the subtitle “working condition”     is within most of the parts the details about working process is not     enough and not provided regularly.
