Notebook – Results – 5. Confirmation of protein expression by SDS-PAGE
The figure here showed data of SDSPAGE. ACFL is sample from E. coli BL21(DE3) supposed to express mRFP and full length Adenylate cyclase. 2AGL is sample from E. coli BL21(DE3) supposed to express mRFP and IIA(Glc). While CTRL is sample from E. coli BL21(DE3) supposed to express mRFP.
Protein band corresponding to mRFP was clearly shown in either total proteins or soluble proteins which mean that mRFP was expressed as soluble protein. Meanwhile protein band corresponding to Adenylate cyclase could not be observed. Protein band corresponding to IIA(Glc) seemed to present.
However, after DNA sequencing result, it was confirmed that neither ACFL nor 2AGL coding genes were not able to be constructed. Thus all E. coli samples here were the same, namely only expressing mRFP – harbouring BBa_J04450.

This page should list all the composite parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."
NPU-China,2018,Team:NPU-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," heat-inducible RNA-based     thermosensors onto the pSB1C3 vector, and installed the Anderson promoter J23104 upstream, superfolder GFP (sfGFP)     downstream. The melting temperature of the thermosensors can be determined by measuring the expression level of     sfGPF at different temperatures. They have measured the fluorescence expression intensity of five heat-inducible     RNA-based therosensors (RT1-4, RT1-33, K2541003, K2541004, K2541010). However, the measurement results may vary     under different laboratory and experimental conditions. To ensure the accuracy of their results, we assisted them     in measuring the changes in fluorescence expression intensity of these 5 thermosensors.
Experiment results:
Figure 4. Fluorescence expression intensity of RT1-4,RT1-33,K2541003, K2541004, K2541010
As is illustrated in the above diagram, K2541003, K2541004 and K2541010 are the three groups of fluorescence     expression intensity that increase as the temperature accrues, indicating that these three thermosensors are in the     'on' state at higher temperatures and proving they are indeed Heat-inducible RNA-based thermosensors. The     fluorescence expression density of RT 1-4 and RT 1-33 does not increase with temperature, manifesting that this     sequence is thermosensor, consistent with the previous measurements of Jilin_China.     Protocol:
1. 100 μL of glycerol bacteria (plasmid containing different thermosensors) was cultured for 4-5 hours and Abs was     measured after dilution, guaranteeing the initial Abs was 0.02 and the volume was made up to 8 mL;
2. 100 μL was added to a black 96-well plate, conducting 3 parallel experiments at different temperatures,     measuring Abs and fluorescence used as the data for 0 h;
3. Incubated at 31 ° C, 35 ° C, 39 ° C respectively;
4. Measured Abs and fluorescence after incubation of 4h, 6h, 8h.

Outside of the lab, Georgette was busy creating our very first vlog which will be shared on the social media pages. Vik is looking at building hardware. Today we also skyped Edinburgh UG team to discuss possible collaborations. We waited for primers to arrive but NEB sent us some enzymes and competent cells so thanks to NEB! We also learnt to electroporate DH5a and TOP10 cells. We transformed them with either a plasmid containing dCas9 or our low copy backbone, pSTLS. We also set up overnight cultures for the InterLab Study. Next came DISASTER! Two of our overnight colonies didn't grow so we had to restart the overnights on Monday. Ah well, we are learning what science is like in reality. We went for a social today - laser quest! Georgette won by far, Ellie lost miserably (-8300 points). Georgette was appointed new team leader due to Ellie's shocking performance... just kidding!
WEEK 4
This week we carried on with the InterLab study and waited for our primers to be delivered. We set up new overnight cultures for the InterLab study today and all our cultures grew so we proceeded with InterLab GFP measurements... they weren't what we were expecting! Jake and Vik skyped Bristol iGEM to see whether we can help them improve the wiki design process. We analysed the data from the InterLab study today and e-mailed some important people for outreach purposes. Jake changed the nav bar and Chris made one of our many games.
We also took team photos, ate fish and chips and OUR PRIMERS ARRIVED! This means we can properly start in the lab on Monday!!
WEEK 5
The primers arrived so we had a long day in the lab doing 46 PCR reactions! We learnt how to set up PCR and load agarose gels, and how interesting waiting around for PCR is. We got lots of interesting results.  Our original PCRs were using 1ng template and touchdown from 70-60oC for 10 cycles followed by 25 at 65oC. These conditions were great for getting most of the components to amplify, however we had to optimise a few. For example the dCas9 and low copy backbone didn't amplify first time around, so we used a new strategy - using various amounts of template with duplicates placed at different annealing temperatures. One was placed in a touchdown setting"
ShanghaiTechChina_B,2016,Team:ShanghaiTechChina B#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," an open discussion session, where we witnessed the curiosity and passion of these high school students towards synthetic biology and IGEM. We shared many details of the IGEM competition. Besides IGEM, we also discussed many frontier life science progress and appreciated their unique views.
We then showed them our lab space and facilities, including cell sonicators, ultra-centrifuges and flow cytometry. We explained the principles using analogies and metaphors. The IDPI ended around 6 pm and we can see through their eyes and faces that these high students were reluctant to leave. As one of the visiting students commented, this tour was 'so impressive and amazing'. We believed that the one day IDPI truly delivered the IGEM core value by arousing their curiosity to explore the secrets of nature. A few days after the visit, the teachers contacted us to consult us for building a biology lab. We really hope that this is the beginning of another amazing adventure!
Poster
During the investigation of intestinal diseases, we realized that IBD is a world-wide threat to human health with a great morbidity and severity. And we found that, unfortunately, public awareness intestinal diseases like IBD is insufficient.
Thus, we decided to introduce IBD and its hazard to the public. The symptoms, diagnosis and related information about IBD were collected.
A poster was designed by our team to show the public that IBD is threating our health, and we need basic knowledge about it. The poster includes the definition, morbidity, diagnosis, symptoms and potential causes about IBD. Our IGEM project Gutrio and the idea to utilize synthetic biology to treat IBD were also introduced.
We have introduced IBD to many communities, and wish more and more people to realize the severity of IBD.

Attribution
We had an ambitious project and very little time; therefore, we adopted a shift based work system in the wet lab. Some team members used to come early in the morning and after dinner their experiments were passed to others, who like working late.
Bacillus subtilis construct
The parts for Bacillus subtilis were designed by Elżbieta Jankowska, Krzysztof Szczepaniak, and Nikodem Latocha. The whole team helped in the lab work, which was mainly supervised by Ania Misiukiewicz, our chief microbiologist, whose skills and patience were crucial in this part of the project.
Mammalian construct
The work was designed and performed mainly by Kaja Sabat. The whole team helped wherever they could.
Shuttle vector
The work was mainly designed by Kaja. The whole team helped wherever they could.
Human practice
Kaja, Krzysztof and Elżbieta went to the conference 'Numbers, Computers, Life', where Ela and Krzysztof gave a presentation, and all three of them presented a poster about last year's iGEM project. There they met Weronika Krzynowek, who joined our team in the summer.
The whole team ran the stand on the Biologists' Night at the Faculty of Biology, University of Warsaw.
Dr. Radosław Stachowiak, our instructor, performed a presentation on the 2nd International Scientific Seminar ""Science-Society-Didactics"" on synthetic biology.
Wiki
The website was coded by Weronika, our codemaster. The graphics and pictures were made by Elżbieta, our homemade artist. Kaja wrote the ""steps"" part. The whole team contributed to our wiki, which was corrected and edited by Magda Ghanim, the grammar nazi.

Communication With BIT-China
By Li Kunjie
Communication With BIT-China
From July to August in the summer of 2015, the iGEM teams from Beijing Institute of Technology, which are BIT team and BIT-China team, carried on several communications about the project, the work, the experimental program and iGEM matters. We have discussed about problems in each other's project and helped each other to solve the practical difficulties encountered by both sides.
The main content of communications between the two teams:
1. Sharing of some experimental apparatus and the experimental reagent.
2. The improvement and optimization of experimental skills and experimental methods.
3. Existing problems of our projects, optimization and suggestion.
4. Team building and interpretation of iGEM rules.
5. Establish the international Human Practice alliance with other schools around the world, and expand the international communication among the iGEM teams.
This year, the communication and cooperation between the two teams are the most comprehensive and in-depth since BIT participated in iGEM, aiming at realizing the goal of working together for better results.
07 September
Symposium with hospital and enterprise
The symposium with China PLA General Hospital
Time: September 07, 2015
Personnel: Zhao Fan, Yang Wei, Wen Zhaosen
Location: China PLA General Hospital, or 301 Hospital
On the afternoon of September 14, as the representatives of BIT team, we have a symposium with Duan Jinyan, the supervisor technician of the Clinical laboratory of 301 hospital and a doctor of biological chemistry. We found many advantages and disadvantages of our project from this symposium, which plays an important role in guiding us to carry out the work. We have learned that the detection methods used in the clinic to detect samples nowadays use optical methods more often, which is efficient in large quantities. After understanding our project, Dr. Duan proposed some valuable suggestions both in the experiment and application.
Current problems:
It is difficult to precisely control the time of bacteria revival and the time of adding sample.
The actual test sample is blood. The condition of blood is more complex, and difficult to control.
Prospect:
Time control and other issues can be explored and verified"

1.2 How does it work?
1.3 Performance
We've focussed on building one key new BioBrick; BBa_K381001; encoding expression of GFP in response to Nitrates or Nitrites. During the project we both made and well characterised this part, details of which can be found in our Experiment section, whilst information on its sequence and how to get hold of it can be found at the BBa_K381001 page on the parts registry website.
To find out more about each of the component parts, including why we chose them and background information, use the navigation bar above.
Part Design
BBa_K381001 is a composite part of two pre-existing BioBricks taken from the parts registry; a Nitrate sensitive promoter and a GFP generator, along with strong RBS and transcription terminators.
The promoter is BBa_K216005, originally submitted by Edinburgh in 2009, whilst the GFP generator, along with strong RBS and transcription terminators is BBa_E0840, provided in well 12O, kit plate 1 of the 2010 distribution.

Public Survey
In order to understand the public’s opinion of our project, we first carried out a marketing research with 1000 pieces of surveys handed out. Overall, there is considerably high expectation over our copper-binding product but relatively low awareness over the synthetic biology. More detailed analysis would be displayed for the following.
The impact of heavy metal pollution on the general public’s life
For the survey, including 1067 recycling questionnaires from16 different regions, we have enough sources to reveal how statistically those heavy metal pollutions jeopardize our environment and economics. According to the results of questionnaires, we found that the impact of heavy metal pollution is impalpable by a large group of people, even people living near industrial districts (Figure 1 and Table 1).

However, when the question focus on “food safety induced by soil pollution”, it is astonishing that with more than half of the informants are “very anxious” towards the issue of food safety"

The target markets for the device include hormone researchers, the livestock agriculture industry, and medical diagnosticians. These parties are handicapped by long and costly sample analysis periods. The time it takes to test a sample for a hormone can range from many hours to days. This also poses the risk of the hormone degrading in the sample, which can lead to inaccurate results. BEAR will allow hormone researchers and diagnosticians to observe hormonal fluctuations in real-time, yielding a more detailed result that will provide a greater understanding of the hormone in question. Those working in the livestock industry will be able to quickly and safely test animals for pregnancy, growth hormones and hormones related to disease. The opportunities this new test will provide will be far-reaching, leading to the development of innovative health care practices that will enhance diagnostics and treatment of disease.
In a 2008 report, the market for both therapeutic and diagnostic monoclonal antibodies was valued at $56 billion for 2012, representing a compound annual growth rate of 13%. 1 The global market for the therapeutic monoclonal antibody industry in 2011 was estimated at $44.6 billion annually. 2 This has nearly doubled from 2006 when the global market was estimated at $19 billion with $7.2 billion for immunoassays, and $3.1 billion in clinical diagnostics. 3 The Canadian medical device market was estimated at $6.4 billion annually in 2008. 4 The biotechnology market is also forecast to have a value of $4.6 billion by 2012, demonstrating an increase of 39.4% since 2011. 5
The business model Synbiologica is pursuing is to license out the patented technology to larger established biotechnology or medical device companies with the resources to build, market and distribute the product.
For added market value, initial prototypes will be further utilized by scientific researchers to gain greater medical diagnostic value. Synbiologica assumes that our product will reveal new behavioural aspects and lifesaving hormone diagnostics in the industry that were not previously known because it will allow researchers to quantify changes in hormone levels as they are occurring. This will add further value to the product and increase its appeal for application in medical diagnostics, resulting in further commercialization beyond the research world. Investors will have an opportunity to be part of a revolutionary, potentially lifesaving biotechnological development.

Finally, we selected pAra ( BBa_I13453 ) because it is a titratable promoter that allows for controlled expression of pili structural genes over a broad range of inducer concentrations. Rhamnose and arabinose were added into broth cultures of E.coli containing both of the plasmids to create synthetic type I pili.
We introduced protein fusions to three discrete sites of within the FimH adhesin protein. These included the N-terminus immediately after the secretory peptide as well as after amino acids 225 and 258 from this site.
These selections were based on previous literature wherein small peptide fusions were introduced successfully at these sites. Sites 225 and 258 showed strong evidence in the literature that small fusions such as his-tags were expressed and functional on assembled pili.Conversely, prior work at the N-terminus has not shown that peptide fusions could be expressed and properly assembled at this site.,  Thus, we added novel peptide fusions to these sites in fimH using site-directed mutagenesis to customize the adhesive properties of type I pili. Additionally, we sought to determine whether these sites could be modified to make fimH generalizable to myriad localization and binding properties in the iGEM community.
Validating Expression
We established that our engineered system could control pili expression by performing an agglutination . Following the protocol, we mixed cultures of our induced and uninduced plasmid-containing fimB knockouts with S. cervisiae yeast along with controls. We found that our plasmids recovered agglutination in the negative control strain and that this agglutination was dependent on the addition of inducer molecules. This shows both that we have control over expression of the biosynthetic machinery and the fimH adhesin, and that the resulting pili were functional as determined by a standard assay for mannose binding. This assay was performed in biological triplicates with the same result. Image below:
Making it Measureable
For our controlled adhesion system to be a useful platform for other iGEM teams and synthetic biologists, we needed to develop a method to reliably measure expression of our recombinant adhesin, fimH. To that end we inserted a His Tag into the 225 fusion site via site-directed mutagenesis and tested whether we could detect induction via an α-His Western Blot. Cultures of our His Tagged-fimH plasmid containing pili knockout bacteria were OD standardized and separated into two sub"

The reaction pool is more than 10 meters deep, but the regular sampling of the sewage can only cover the several centimeters right beneath the surface. We can add a light sensitive part after our memory circuit, in that way, we may guide the engineered E.coli to collect the data at the bottom and swim up the surface to be collected.
After the visit
We cultured E. coli DH10B, the bacteria where we constructed our circuit in with 100%, 50%, 25% and 0% sewage in the culture system. At last they all survived and thrived. Even the group cultured with 100% sewage seemed to grow well.
The result showed that it is possible to put the bacteria directly in the reaction pool and collect the data later on.
In that way, we can make more improvements
A suicide gene may be attached to the end of our circuit, so that we can prevent it from spreading into the environment.
A special sequence served as the identity number of the E.coli may be add to the beginning of the circuit. So that if we put in the E. coli in batches, we can identify the data collected in each batch easily.

What’s more, we constructed  three combinations with two kinds of promoter-gene combinations to character different forms of oscillation. As is shown in the Figure 1, we increased the relative concentration of KaiA protein greatly and decreased the relative concentration of KaiB protein slightly in KaiC-SasA and KaiC-CikA combinations, which shortened the period of the circadian oscillation . In our KaiB-KaiC combination, we increased the relative concentration of KaiA protein greatly.

Our aim is to reconstruct the KaiABC circadian clock system of prokaryotic cyanobacteria in nonciracdian eukaryotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae. First of all, we hope to introduce the core proteins of cyanobacterial circadian clock, KaiA, KaiB and KaiC, into yeast to make them oscillate stably. To prevent KaiC from being trapped in phosphorylation state, we select three auxiliary proteins: SasA, CikA and RpaA. The promoter of prokaryotes can not be directly recognized by yeast, so we abandon the way of using the relevant promoters of the RpaA-mediated downstream reaction which are inherent in cyanobacterial, instead use the yeast two-hybrid system to characterize the KaiABC circadian clock system.

Numerical Simulation
Due to time constraints, we were not able to measure some parameters in experiments. However, since we are primarily interested in the qualitative dynamics of the system, the estimations in the above table can still provide reasonable conditions for our simulation.
We ran a numerical simulation of the differential equations using MATLAB for a time period of 100 hours. The simulation results are as follows.
Figure 1 The simulation result of $c_{m,eq}$, the concentration of heavy metal ions
Figure 2 The simulation result of $c_{p,eq}$, the concentration of proteins
Figure 3 The simulation result of $c_{h,eq}$, the concentration of hydrogen ions
Figure 4 The simulation result of $m$, the population density of PSB
We can see a steady drop of heavy metal ion concentration which drops to more than half of its initial value over less than 5 days, which confirms the plausibility of FAFU’s design.
There are also some other interesting points in the graphs. We can see an almost constant decrease of pH from about 7 to about 5 in 100 hours, which shows the PSB’s ability to improve the soil conditions. Changing the pH also affects the population density of PSB. As pH goes below the optimum value 6, $m$ begins to decrease, making $c_{p,eq}$ decrease along with it.
Conclusion
Our model gave a schematic description of the dynamics of FAFU’s design in real-life application. The results confirmed the feasibility of their work.
Furthermore, the framework provided above can be used in further analysis. With some modifications, the model can also be used to simulate the case where secreted proteins are used instead of displayed ones, and where the original PSB (without the specifically designed proteins) instead of engineered PSB is used. Comparing these results can help guide future efforts in experiment and application.

Comparing Experiments 1 and 2
Experiment 1:  F=10 M=10
In this experiment we did not see the result we are looking for. We are interested in obtaining a high proportion in the third column when sexy plants are working. We see that the graphs counting the number of encounters (purple for the Switch-OFF, green for the Switch-ON) are very similar, so the effect is not achieved satisfactorily.
Experiment 2:  F=10 M=30
In this experiment we do see the result we are looking for. We are interested in obtaining a high proportion in the third column when sexy plants are working. We see that the graphs counting the number of encounters (purple for the Switch-OFF, green for the Switch-ON) differ visibly, so the effect is achieved.
Experiment 3
Females don’t emit pheromones. Thus, males and females move randomly. How much would our results differ from the ones with females emitting?
T_{0} : Start
T_{1700}: End
In almost every cases, the number of encounters is higher when females emit pheromones. It means that in our model, males can follow females being guided by pheromone concentration gradients. Moreover, it is seen in the interface during simulations. Results for “pheromone emission”. Showed below are an average of an amount of experiments.
Also see the contribution of the pheromone supply to the environment depending on the number of females (directly related) and the number of meetings (inversely related) For population 1 to 1 and this time ending given, no more than 2 encounters have been observed. In contrast with the random movement, in which not encounters have been showed in the range of experiments we have checked.
Conclusions
We have used a methodology for the results comparison in which experiments have been repeated several times. The interpretation of the performances has based on the values obtained. Nevertheless an exhaustive replay of the same realizations would give us more accurate values.
The experiments with the same number of males than females give results we haven’t expected. Maybe changing the model parameter values one would obtain a different kind of performance.
Other aspect that we have taken into account is that some of the encounters during the time males are following pheromone traces from females may be also due to random coincidence.
We have used a procedure useful to discard scenarios and contrast different realizations. With this, logic conclusions can be derived. Thus, they are a way of leading a potential user of this application"

Second, magnets are widely spread and electro magnets easily built as you can see in this video: How to build your own DIY super magnet The accessibility and safety of magnetic fields opens up the field for new innovation and ideas using remote controlled bacteria as you can see in this video in which magnetotactic bacteria are used to rearrange building blocks to a pyramid .        Third, magnetic fields do have a high energy density and are way more viable to transfer energy than other energy fields like electrical fields. However, the magnetic moment of an atom is the product of the atoms orbital angular momentum and its electron spins. Atomic magnetism is based on unfilled electron orbits.       Nobel gases and alkyl halogenide are non-magnetic or “diamagnetic”. Other elements like metals may have an increased magnetic moment as long as their electron orbit are unfilled, meaning they are unbound. Mn2+, Fe3+ have a magnetic moment of about 5 µB, Cr2+, Mn3+, Fe2+ and Co3+ have a magnetic moment of 3 µB.
Because of the variety of atomic magnetic properties, magnetism can be divided into different forms by looking at apparent forces and effects.        There is diamagnetism, antiferromagnetism, paramagnetism, ferrimagnetism, superparamagnetism and Ferromagnetism. Ferromagnetic forced are about 1000 times stronger than super paramagnetic forces. However, it turns out that creating ferromagnetic particles or residues is very difficult (see magnetite formation in magnetospirrilium bacteria). Also note that in a lot of biological papers, people tend to mix e.g. super paramagnetism with ferromagnetism [1].
Magnetic properties are depended on the composition, structure and the size of the metallic particles. The magnetic moment is proportional to the alignment of the electron spins within a component. If electron spins are aligned magnetism can be observed. However on a nanoscale real ferromagnetism can only be noted after a critical particle size of 128 nm.[2]       This is due to thermal fluctuations that prevent the alignment of electron spins and therefore prevent the development of sufficient magnetic moments. Because of this phenomena all measurements for magnetism are usually conducted at very low temperatures.
All magnetic effects that are observed for particles between 1 nm to 100 nm"
Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioMembrane Latex_-_-_TEXT.html," and gene order in an operon can influence expression level, we inserted the SRPP gene before the two prenyltransferases to account for the possibility the first protein in the cassette would be expressed the most.  This cassette was the linked to a IPTG inducible T7 Elowitz high copy promoters to allow for regulated expression.  All proteins were also tagged with a FLAG, tetracysteine, and hexahistidine tag to allow for protein purification assays (Figure 3). A double terminator, (BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012) was also used to prevent RNA polymerase leak through.[14]
In order to produce our plasmid, we synthesized SRPP, HRT1, HRT2 on three different fragments.  These fragments were then linked together via Gibson Assembly, which yielded a cassette of genes.  This cassette was then Gibson’d into pSB1C3, which granted the construct chloroamphenicol (Chl) resistance.  The construct (referred henceafter as latex operon) was subsequently transformed into T7 express cells.
Bringing it all together
Although our system is located on two plasmids, all four components (HRT1, HRT2, SRPP, and DXS synthase) could be included on the same construct for ease of transfection.  However, under our present schema, transfection of E. coli with the DXS plasmid would allow for an organism that produces IPP and DMAPP in high volume potentially for alternative applications, such as terpenoid synthesis.  For full realization of high throughput IPP and cis-1,4-polyisoprene production in E. coli, both plasmids need to be transfected into the host to allow for high activity of all pathway processes.  To verify all elements are property transfected, each plasmid had a distinct selection marker such that with each subsequent transfection, un-transfected cells would be screened against.  By transfecting one plasmid at a time into a population of cells with different selection assays, we ensured that the final population of cells at the end of the process contained both plasmid constructs.
An item of concern is the metabolic strain each of these plasmids will place upon E. coli.  Since IPP and DMAPP are byproducts of glycolysis and cellular respiration; enhanced conversion of pyruvate and G3P or acetyl -CoA to IPP will decrease the amount of substrate available to the host for ATP production.  In order to address"

There are two approaches to using phage to eliminate the biofilm in Cholera. We may engineer a phage to do what we need, or we may go looking for a phage that has already evolved to do what we need. Here are a few summaries of articles I read today: The use of phages for the removal of infectious biofilms. Azeredo, J. and Sutherland I.W. (2008) Used two phages isolated from sewage; showed 2-4 log decreases in bacterial population both in vitro and in vivo (murine model). OF INTEREST: In vitro testing involved biofilm and took longer; in vivo testing involved only planktonic cells and was faster. OF INTEREST: Calcofluor biofilm staining. Efficacy of cocktail phage therapy in treating Vibrio cholerae infection in rabbit model Summary: Oral administration of a cocktail of 5 lytic cholera bacteriophages to rabbits yielded strong and statistically significant reductions of cholera. Researchers showed that administration of the cocktail at 6 hour and 12 hour time intervals after bacterial challenge reduced bacteria populations 100 fold and 10 fold, respectively. Administration of the cocktail before bacterial challenge apparently did not significantly decrease cholera OF INTEREST: The emergence of multiple drug resistant strains of V. cholerae is thus a cause for global concern [4,5] and is prompting the exploration for alternative ways of treatment OF INTEREST: To the best of our knowledge it is the first report of combatting V. cholerae infection in an animal model by phages adminis- tered through the oral route. Here are a few more articles that I've downloaded and I'm going to read: Phage-bacterial interactions in the evolution of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae - this article exams the co-evolution of phage and cholera toxin. From what I read of the abstract, it is hypothesized that cholera's toxin was introduced by horizontal gene transfer from the CTXw phage. Written by a researcher from Harvard Medical School O Antigen Is the Receptor of Vibrio cholerae Serogroup O1 El Tor Typing Phage VP4 - phage VP4 infects cholera, but certain mutations to the O-antigen gene provides resistance against VP4 (VP4 has anti-biofilm properties?)

Spent some time grappling with just what functionality a 'promoter' has, and determined that the opposite of a repressable promoter wouldn't actually be an activatable promoter and vice versa... it would be a 'repressable terminator', or 'activatable terminator'. (Since the function of a promoter is to permit RNA polymerase to bind, the opposite of that is to cause RNAP to unbind.)
An 'activatable terminator' very roughly correlates to the idea of an 'operator site', a repressor binding site removed from its promoter. I didn't believe there was any such thing as a 'repressable terminator' (a terminator that is functional by default, but can be disabled by the action of some protein?), until I stumbled across anti-terminators while doing unrelated research much later. The curious are encouraged to look up the proteins N Lambda and Q Lambda.

We have an island!
This week we found our island but unfortunately we cannot build on it yet. I started creating some things for the lab portion of our island such as the pipette and beakers. All of us are working together to plan our island so as to make it fit into iGEM and help people get the most out of it. Also, I worked on finding a person to draw our logo, which is now done except for the color scheme.

Laboratory meeting update
On the modelling side, I prepared and presented a handout that embodied an introduction to basic principles of modelling. This included an overview and an outline of some different types of mathematical modelling.
On the lab end, I analysed a gel of the LuxPQ PCR and restriction digest results from yesterday, which showed that I amplified something that apparently isn't LuxPQ.

Introduction
Three kinds of enzymes are needed to turn cellulose into glucose. Enzymes Exoglucanase and Endoglucanase are placed in bottom layer of bioflim, and β-glucosidase are in layer 2. layer 3 could be used to further degrade glucose to further degraded molecule such as alcohols. Our application is a combination of stratified bioflim and bio-conversion of celluloses which is a part of the project of Team Edinburgh of igem 2011. Therefore their model (with matlab) could be used to describe our system with some adjustment.
 
Basic concepts and assumptions
Based on the results of former sections, the expression of proteins in the bottom layer and middle layer are determined by only factor of time, and they would become a constant after the system reached a steady-state. Thus we could set the concentration of these three enzymes to be two constants E_1 and E_2, where Exoglucanase and Endoglucanase are of same concentration C_1 in bottom layer, and concentration of β-glucosidase is C_2 in layer 2. Team Edinburgh has already built a matlab based model in their igem 2011 project for free floating enzyme approach in simulating conversion of celluloses. Their method could be applied in our model. Assumptions of their models are listed below.
1 Underlying assumption: cellulose, cellobiose, and glucose concentrations change continuously with time.
2 Rate equations assume enzyme adsorption follows the Langmuir isotherm model.
3 Glucose and cellobiose, which are the products of cellulose hydrolysis, are assumed to ""competitively inhibit enzyme hydrolysis"".
4 All reactions are assumed to follow the same temperature dependency Arrhenius relationship (shown below)."

Conclusion: The concentration of BioBrick is to low to justify running a gel. We conclude the transformation failed.
Monday 30.7.12
Aim - Transformation of previously failed BioBricks: BBa_C0040 was transformed in Expt 7.4, but appeared to be contaminated. BBa_R0040, as part of the same experiment, did not form colonies at all after transformation. Therefore both were reattempted.
Method:
Transformation Protocol 1
Step 1 - Addition of BioBrick: To the still frozen competent cells, add 1 - 5 µL of the resuspended DNA to the 2ml tube.
Step 4 - Incubation: Close tube and incubate the cells on ice for 45 minutes.
Step 5 - Heat Shock: Heat shock the cells by immersion in a pre-heated water bath at 37ºC for 10 minutes.
Step 6 - Incubation: Incubate the cells on ice for 2 minutes.
Step 7 - Add media: Add 1.5ml of Lysogeny Broth and transfer to a falcon tube.
Step 8 - Incubation: Incubate the cells at 37ºC for 1 hour at RPM 550. 
Step 9 - Transfer: transfer the solution back into a 1.5ml Eppendorf and centrifuge
RPM: 14000
Time: 2 minutes
Temperature (18-25oC)
Step 10 - Resuspend:Remove supernatant and resuspend in 100ul LB
Step 11 - Plating: Spread the resuspended cell solution onto a selective nutrient agar plate. Place the plates in a 37°C static incubator, leave overnight (alternatively a 30°C static incubator over the weekend)
Step 1 – Thawing Cells: Use W3110 cell line created in Week 2 (Expt 2.1)
Step 3 – Addition of BioBrick: To each 2ml eppendorf, add 1ul of the following BioBricks. Include an extra tube as a control, with no BioBrick added

Our system is based in a phosphorylation cascade that is reversed     in the presence of an Auto inductor (CAI-1). When there is V.     Cholerae in the media CqsS senses it and changes it functions     to phosphase. CqsS takes the phosphate from LuxU, which takes     the phosphate from LuxO and turns off the production of TetR     (Repressor of pTet). This process allows the production of the     signal Amilcp and the activator TetA ,creating a positive feedback.

Project Abstract:
Our aim is to develop a diagnostic technique capable of detecting the presence of fungal pathogens in a sample collected from a patient. Briefly, our approach is as follows. Through a yeast two-hybrid assay we will select a set of peptides that show affinity towards surface proteins from different fungi (Aspergillus nidulans, A. fumigatus, Candida albicans and C. glabrata). After confirming the interaction between the surface proteins and a given peptide, we intend to attach a molecule to the peptide marker. In our project, this molecule will be a fluorescent protein, but in principle can also be an immune system activator which is then recognized by the immune cells or other chemical moiety that adds novel functionalities or increases the peptide stability.
Our achievements
1. Identify a group of peptides able to interact with specific cell wall proteins from different fungi, by means of yeast two-hybrid assays.
2. Perform in vivo experiments to demonstrate and ensure on one hand, that the binding of the peptide is being to the cell wall protein, and on the other hand, that this binding is being to a specific fungi strain.
3. Attach a marker molecule to the peptide in order to simplify its visualization using fluorescent microscopy.
4. Develop new standard Biobrick.
5. Develop our team Wiki which represents all the dimensions of our project, and establish it as one of the main tools to inform people all over the world about our vision and accomplishments.

1st Do It Together Bio, Waag Society
DIY biologists meeting in Aachen
Visiting the domicil of the Waag society in Amsterdam
a/span>
Through several discussions with scientists, iGEM and several other people, we focused on three collaborations with Community Labs:
Connecting Community Labs by integrating them into a network of universities and companies
Inform European Community Labs about iGEM and facilitate cooperations with iGEM teams
Discuss biosafety standards and compare those of Community Labs to those of Universities
To achieve all of this points, we invited the german Community Lab ""Technik Garage"". During their visit we could not only realize all of them, but also found a collaboraion considering our bioreactor.
When we visited the Waag society in Amsterdam, we got to know a community lab at the other end of the spectrum. This highly connected and politically committed lab focused much more on bio art and infusing open discussions about biology.

KK, KP
We saw the results of our second electroporation today. Again, strains TT9901 and TT9907 took up the plasmid by electroporation, but the TT25281 transformation was again unsuccessful. We don't know what's wrong. Last time around I failed to push the cuvette entirely into the probes of the electrophorator. This time however, we know we followed the protocol correctly ...
In reference to strains TT9901 and TT9907, which were successful transformations from the first time, yesterday we swabbed these strains and grew them in overnight test tubes at 37 degress. The medium we used was LB Amp/Arabinose. We were hopeful that the following day (that's today) we would not see any turbidity, because the arabinose would have induced the expression of CRO, inducing Lambda to its lytic cycle. However, today we found disappointing results: our overnights were saturated with bacterial growth. This assay isn't of course the best way to test whether our system is working, but as it was intended to at least give us a ballpark gauge as to the functionality of our clone, we are concerned that something is not right.
5/29/13
KP KK Today we plated TT9907 and TT9901. We plated them on LB arabinose/amp/x-gal plates. We plated different concentrations of TT9907 and TT9901 on each of the plates. We added 50, 100, and 300 microliters onto each plate. We will check the plates tomorrow hopefully to find plagues showing that arabinose triggered lysis of our lambda. We unfortunately didn't get any growth of our TT23821, so we streaked another plate from our original stab sample and we will try to re-electroporate TT23821 on Friday.

Consistency is only a virtue if you're not a screw-up :) Anyway, our gel showed a faint band at the 300 base pair level, but too faint to be considered successful. We considered a list of reasons why our PCR reaction is failing and discussed them with Dr. Grose:

The Uppsala team hosted a webinar series about the ethics of synthetic biology. We took part in the third discussion of this series, ‘Intellectual Property Rights’, along with teams from USP-Brazil, Chalmers-Gothenburg, Peshawar and Toronto.
Represented by our wonderful legal expert Steph, we contributed to this collaboration by sharing our experience with IP laws in our iGEM project, and discussing the role of IP laws in other team’s projects. We gave other teams advice about how to work with IP laws in the context of the iGEM competition.

São Paulo State University
We got in touch with the AQA_Unesp team from São Paulo State University as soon as we learned that they were also working on insulin. Their team is working to create probiotics that secrete insulin in the gut in response to glucose levels, and we thought it would be great for our teams to share our expertise on working with insulin.
We helped the Brazil team by giving them ideas and helping them to resolve issues regarding their lab work and integrated human practices. We also helped the AQA-Unesp team to use the modelling program MatLab. The two teams shared information about insulin prices and accessibility in Australia and Brazil, as well as transformation protocols and ideas for working with Bacillus subtilis.

Gold star worthy mistakes
From forgetting to add antibiotics to cyanobacterial culture (and only remembering after we set up bottles in the incubator), to using the wrong buffer for a protein purification procedure, we have found endlessly creative ways to mess up while working at the lab. We made so many mistakes during our first two weeks we deserved gold stars. And that’s exactly what our advisor gave us. Each new mistake we made earned us another one. Thus, the ""iGem Leaderboard"" was born.
Our advisor got on Amazon and ordered 1,000 gold star stickers (did I mention we make a LOT of mistakes?) and for each error we make, instead of telling us off, he rewards us with another gold star sticker on the iGEM Leaderboard. The system has changed the way we think about our mistakes. We’ve learned to see them as a good thing - as part of a learning process.
Mistakes can make or break us, depending on the way we reflect on our experiences. Treated as prompts for creative solutions, errors can actually improve performance. Finding your once green cyanobacteria culture suddenly turn yellow, or shattering expensive glass bottles, are falls that can teach us to stand. Mistakes are memorable, they are sticky and allow us to make mental notes of what change for the future. In science they’re vital, and may even inspire teams to think of new and creative solutions to age-old problems.
As children we received gold stars for our wins. But that only primes us to be winners. Learning requires losing too. If we are too afraid to make mistakes, we’ll never take the risk to walk the path less travelled. Learning from our mistakes can propel us forward and allow us an opportunity to get better. That is the message of iGEM Leaderboard.
It’s a lesson we’ve learned many times over working at the lab. We are still at the rookie stage, but the mistakes we’ve made so far have not only helped us to get the hang of new laboratory skills but primed"

Characterisation
Qualitative assay. Due to time constraints only a preliminary qualitative assay was carried out. Co-cultures of Arsenic detector, processor unit and 3 different reporter modules carrying two chromoproteins ( BBa_K2205016 , BBa_K2205018 ) and sfGFP ( BBa_K2205015 ) were inoculated and grown overnight in LB+chloramphenicol (12.5ng/ul). The day after the cultures were diluted at OD600 0.1 and mixed together to obtain co-cultures with ratio 1:1:13 (detector:processor:reporter). The samples were supplemented with different concentration of Arsenic (0ppb, 10ppb, 50ppb, 100ppb) to induce the expression of quorum sensing molecules and eventually achieve the chromoproteins visualisation (Figures 6, 7, 8).

Abstract
When information flows through gene-regulatory networks, noise is introduced, and fidelity suffers. A cell unable to correctly infer the environment signals from the noisy inputs may be hard to make right responses. What factors can possibly alter the circuit's ability to sense extrinsic information?
There are many “parallel circuits” in gene-regulatory networks where independently transcribed monomers assemble into functional complexes for downstream regulation. We wonder if those frequent dimerization designs are fundamental in improving the circuit properties. In addition, would higher affinity between monomers boost the quality as well?
Inspired by these thoughts, we construct synthetic biology circuit by using split florescent proteins. And we add inteins to split florescent proteins to the make the binding tighter. Then, we quantitatively measure the capacity of these information channels aided by information theory. Computation and wet lab work are combined to optimize our understanding of such systems, and to interpret potential biological significance of reoccurring parallel designs in nature.
introductory Story
Let us tell a simple but interesting story to help you understand what our project is about and also relax yourselves before you look into our project.I believe all of you know about a term called binaural effect which means you can judge where a thing is with less deviations when you use both of your ears. Similarly, here is the story.
Li lei is an undergraduate from Tsinghua University and Han Meimei is an undergraduate from Peking University. They met and knew each other when they attended the Jamboree of iGEM. After that they always communicated through WeChat and fell in love with each other. So Li lei often called Han Meimei to make sure that how she is going and wanted to make her feel happy. But he had a problem. The telephone line was very noisy and Han Meimei could not hear what he said clearly every time he called her. He knew that and he was very depressed because he worried about that Han Meimei would be angry with him. One day he came up with a good idea and he bought two. Since then he bought two amplifiers and used them both when he called her. Now Han Meimei can hear him clearly and this tells us that when you use two paths other than one to transmit your messages, the noises"

Paris_Bettencourt,2015,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Continuity_-_-_TEXT.html," alone, without any fluorescent proteins as a negative control.
The cells were diluted to an OD600 of 0.01, grown to exponential phase and the fluorescence was measured on a TECAN plate reader when the OD reached 0.3. The excitation wavelength was 585 nm and the detection wavelength was 615 nm.
Expression of the proteins
Expression of the first protein of the cassette in the chromosome.
A ""mother cell"" with our differentiation system integrated in the chromosome was grown to exponential phase and its fluorescence was measured when OD600 reached 0.3. As a negative control, a cell without fluorescent underwent the same treatment. Excitation wavelength: 585 nm. Detection wavelength: 615 nm.
Because this differentiation system requires that only one copy of the sequence is present in the cell, we measured the expression level of mCherry on cells with the chromosomally integrated cassette.
The cells exhibit clear fluorescence (Mann-Whitney test, p-value < 10-6), even though it was not visible to the naked eye. The mCherry fluorescent protein is therefore a suitable reporter for quality control of the strain.
Induction of the differentiation
We then aimed to trigger the differentiation of our newly constructed strain. A strain carrying the plasmid pFHC2938, that allows for expression of the CRE recombinase upon arabinose induction (Nielsen 2006), was aquired.
Unfortunately, all our attempts at transforming our strain with it have been unsuccesful, even when resorting to very efficient techniques such as electroporation. It always lead to either nothing, or a lawn of bacteria that did not seem to carry the antibiotic resistance using for selecting the plasmid. To troubleshoot this transformation, we made three hypothesis:
Is there something in the cell that interferes transformation?
Is the strain not suitable for CRE expression, e.g. there are LoxP sites somewhere that result in deletions in the genome?
Is the plasmid the wrong one?
To figure this out, we transformed our strain with the CRE recombinase plasmid along with a standard pSB1C3-mRFP plasmid.

Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#Notebook#Summary_-_-_TEXT.html," red ones those for the literature values represented in the parts registry. The measurements are illustrated in a logarithmic application. The standard variation was calculated for our measured values (black error bar; raw dataset ).
Additionally, our goal was to see a correlation between the mRNA expression levels and the motility of our engineered E. coli on swimming plates. Therefore, we used quantitative real-time PCR (qrtPCR) as a powerful tool for quantification of gene expression. We used this method to examine the expression rate of the eight different constitutive promoter constructs from the parts registry that were further confirmed by swimming assays. The reported activities of these promoters are given as the relative fluorescence of these plasmids in strain TG1 (parts registry: Part:BBa_J23100 ). The results are depicted in Figure 11. Here, promoter constructs were cloned into the vector pSB1C3 and expressed in E.coli BL21DE3 grown in LB-media (lysogeny broth). The measurements were performed as a triplet for each construct and a house-keeping gene coding for a 16SrRNA (rrsD) as reference. Additionally, we included H2O as negative no template control to predict possible contaminations. For the evaluation of our results, the 2–ΔΔCT (Livak) method was applied. We used the weakest promoter with the lowest expression rate as calibration for the calculations and as reference the housekeeping gene. The data was then compared to the predetermined expression rates from iGEM2006_Berkeley group.
Overall, as shown in Figure 11, each tested promoter construct indicated differences in expression rates in comparison to values from the parts registry. In fact, both data-sets were collected by methods which produce data at different points after gene expression. A common trend was detected for the strongest promoters J23100, J23104, J23105 and J23109 together with the weakest promoters J23112 and J23113. Conspicuously, the promoter J23109 revealed for qrtPCRand for relative fluorescence measurements nearly the same expression rates. The expression rates of J23114 and J23106 indicated massive differences in their expression rates and no common trend with the expression values from the parts registry. We detected comparable positioning in the ranking of expression rates (see characterization of constitutive promoters by qrtPCR ) for six out of our eight promoters. The promoters characterized as relatively strong were also, in our case, responsible for higher expression rates and the other way around. In the case of promoter J23114 and J23106, the data-sets exhibited a completely different"

1. Introduction
""How do fundamental research results be transformed into applications that benefit human?"" ""How do you apply social feedback to a project?"" ""How do you turn an obscure basic research into an easy-to-understand form?"" There are many questions waiting to be solved by OUC-China.
Through communication, we found that many other teams were also confused by these problems. In order to transform the basic research results into the practical applications, we communicated with many stakeholders, visited related biotech companies, and asked professors in related fields. Soon, an inspiration came into our mind, and we created a game based on our project in order to popularize the biology science to more people.
In the process of spreading our project, it is difficult for many amateurish people to understand these principles, especially when we mentioned some biological terms, such as ""CRISPR"". With the help of our game and the game brochure, the obscure principle became vivid and interesting to them, which was really a good feedback for us. Apart from that, we teamed up with five other iGEM teams to set up a Basic Research Results Transformation Team, in order to jointly research on local biotech companies and explore a fixed pattern for the basic research transformation, hoping to give a reference to the future iGEM teams. In fact, we have done a lot of work about education and public engagement based on our project, such as our game, biotech companies research report and so on, which is a part of our human practice.

In front of sequence 10 is the tadA gene, which codes for the tRNA-specific adenosine deaminase. This protein is essential for cell viability. After sequence 10 lies mltF2, coding for the Membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase F, which degrades the murein glycan strands and sacculi.
Sequence 11 is surrounded by ggt, which codes for the Glutathione hydrolase proenzyme, involved in the glutathione biosynthetic process and the uvrD gene, encoding the DNA helicase II, involved in the DNA replication.
The sequence before sequence 14 is lamB2, coding for Maltoporin 2. This protein is involved in the ion transport.  After the sequence 14 comes panF, catalysing the sodium-dependent uptake of extracellular pantothenate.
The sequences on the chromosome 2 in front of the sequences 16, 17 and 18 code for hypothetical proteins of unknown function. Sequence 21 is even surrounded by two hypothetical proteins. The gene pdeB 1 after the sequence 16 encodes a DNA helicase II, like uvrD. Behind sequence 17 lies glxR, coding for 2-hydroxy-3-oxopropionate reductase. This protein is involved in the catabolic process of glycolate and glyoxylate and to the cellular response to DNA damage respectively. The sequence 18 is followed by a putative phosphatase. These enzymes use water to cleave a phosphoric acid monoester into a phosphate ion and an alcohol and are therefore essential for many biological processes.
The penultimate sequence 23 has a rbs gene in front of it, coding for a ribose operon repressor. Behind the sequence lies cueR, an HTH-type transcriptional regulator. This protein positively regulates the carbohydrate metabolic process .
In front of the sequence 24 lies yusO, coding for an uncharacterized HTH-type transcriptional regulator. The sequence is followed by yccF, whichs inner membrane protein YccF is part of the plasma membrane.

Taking as reference a medium-size protein (40 kDA)  which moves with a speed of 5 nm per ms, the program only runs this thousand steps if the constant-time values 1000. If the number decrease, the simulation loss realism but it will run much faster, which could be interesting if we are interested in obtain just a more qualitative comprehension of the system.
The slider cell-cycle-length gives us the length of a cell cycle, by default 30 minutes.The button divide-cells? allows us to eliminate half of the repressors and RNAs in a randomly way every cell-cycle.
Controling the division cell process
Under the title of Actions, the user can interact with the simulation in real time. This way, the user can toggle the bistable switch between the two possible states. For convenience, we have taken as “On” the state in which the protein LacI has a high concentration in the cell. To turn off the bistable we have to release a high concentration of IPTG and be patient. We have to give enough time to the simulation, because the RNA must be transcribed to produce after this the protein c1ts and the RNA, and free LacI  proteins must disappear.
Controls to turn off the bistable
To turn on the bistable, we only have to increase the temperature. The temperature-effect gives us how many times faster grows old the protein c1ts. We can see that it is rather easier to turn the bistable on than to turn it off.
Controls to turn on the bistable
The show-view button allows us to turn-off the simulation window, although the plots and the monitor will carry on actualizing. To turn-off the view enables the simulation to run much faster, so it is strongly recommended.
The program also allows to export data to a .csv file with the name Simulation data, and it is saved in the root folder where is saved the simulation. It is recommended that if you want to use the simulation to produce data the program must be open from the .nlogo file.
The simulation represents the concentration of RNAs and repressors in the plot. Moreover, we can see in the monitors the amount of molecules of every kind, how many repressors can be found repressing, how many repressors with kind 1 are bound to IPTG and the temperature.

Overview
In order to achieve portable and simple field allergy detection, we designed and manufactured the hardware testing equipment for this project - a small, inexpensive ($20) system, including a device can measure OD600 and fluorescence intensity, and a small automatic vibration device avoiding the sinking of cells.
The device supports battery or micro USB for power supply. According to the prompts on the display, you can get started quickly; the device will judge your allergies based on the cell concentration and fluorescence intensity after a certain period of reaction.
In addition to the detection applied to this project, this device can also be used in other environments where fast and portable spectrophotometric detection or fluorescence intensity detection is needed.
We refer to the design of Team Aachen, 2014, but our Devices are more automated and miniaturized.
Designed steps for usage

MIT Collaboration
Our most significant collaboration was that with the MIT iGEM team. In this collaboration, the MIT team had the opportunity to explore the possibility of using microfluidic chips to culture mammalian cells. In return, we had the the opportunity to validate the performance of our microfluidic chips with mammalian cell cultures.
The goal in our collaboration was to feed mammalian cells into a cell trap on a microfluidic chip, and then to culture those mammalian cells with an nutrient solution that we could control the input of. The design idea is simple: we would have a single fluid input, and a single output. This fluid would be gated by a valve, after which it would pass over a cell trap bank, and then be gated by another valve. After the valve the fluid is allowed to exit. The design would look something as follows:
The red portion is the control layer, in other words, the valves that block or allow fluid to pass. The blue part is the flow layer, where our actual fluid is allowed to flow, and where our experiment is run. And the purple portion is the cell trap, where the mamalian cells will be cultured. To validate our workflow, we used Neptune to create the chip design schematic. The LFR code to create the chip is included below.
With this LFR file, we generated the below design schematic. Note that this is a to-scale design schematic that we fed directly into the CNC mill for fabrication. You may also notice that in this design schematic, the cell traps are much smaller than in the design above. This is because this design schematic is to scale, and the real chip has small traps, appropriate for the size of the mammalian cells. We milled this chip out using the OtherMill, following the MakerFluidics protocol. In brief, this entails milling that channels of the flow and control layer out of a thermoplastic substrate, and then bonding the layers with a inner layer of PDMS. Our final chip looked as follows:
Now, our first visit to the MIT iGEM team’s lab space was to give the newly fabricated chip a initial test run just to see how the mammalian cells would fare. Since our chip is very simple, with only one port, we ran the experiment without Neptunes control interface, instead manually generating flow with a syringe pump. We were able to successfully insert mammalian cells into the microfluidic chip. We were able to verify this by visualizing the cells through a microscope, we included the results below, in"

A number of Biobricks from the DNA distribution plates were suspended yesterday . Hugo and Kira did a transformation with 2 μL of the following BioBricks (antibiotic):
pSB3T5 (Tetracycline)
pSB1T3 (Tetracycline)
pSB1C3 (Chloramphenicol)
pSB3C5 (Chloramphenicol)
pSB1K3 (Kanamycin)
pSB1A3 (Ampicillin)
I13401 (Ampicillin)
Because our own competent cells were not good enough we used commercially available competent Top10 cells (Invitrogen). The cells were plated on LB-agar with the appropriate antibiotic. Biobricks plated  We will have to wait until tomorrow to see if they were successful or not. Hopefully we will see some colonies tomorrow. Wish us luck!
Thias PCRed some BioBricks with various primer concentrations and at different temperatures to see which PCR method would work best. The PCR products were tested on a gel, and we saw a difference between the primer concentrations and the temperatures used.
Media and Solutions

Nadine and I are planing to revive our Ps. putida strain (muahaha). So, we prepared some solid media for that purpose: LB agar and E2 agar.
For LB medium this is the recipe that we use:
Tryptone         10g
Yeast extract   5 g
NaCl                10 g
Agar               15 g
Water, as much as you need for 1 L of culture medium
For E2 medium this is the recipe that we use:

How much can we degrade?

Introduction
Before we began using synthetic biology to develop a system for bioremediation of chlorinated waste, we thought it was important to work towards an answer to the above question. To do this, we used information from the literature (Gisi et al, 1998) about the metabolism of the native bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens DM4.
We then worked on a model to calculate both the pH change of the system and the volume of DCM degraded over time. This was achieved by using a combination of Michaelis-Menten kinetics, ordinary differential equations and stoichiometric relations.
How much DCM could the native bacterium degrade?
How much DCM could the native bacterium degrade?
Calculating total DCM degraded
1) Obtaining a theoretical growth curve
To start this calculation, we needed to know how many bacteria we could expect to have in our system. To do this, we used the realistic bead dimensions and numbers shown in the Matlab screen shot on the left. This allowed us to calculate the volume of bacteria we predict to be infused the agarose beads. We then used the assumption that the bacteria would grow to an optimum density of 10^7 bacteria per ml of agarose[1] and combined these to give us an approximation of how to scale the growth curve:
A = Gompertz vertical scaling constant
N = number of beads
V = volume of each bead in ml
ρ = number of bacteria per ml
Our theoretical growth curves were based on Gompertz functions for the reasons explained when you follow this link: (what are Gompertz functions?) . An example output growth curve of the model is shown here.
The scaling of the growth rate of the Gompertz function comes directly from growth curves of the DM4 bacteria that we obtained in the lab.
2) Calculating the volume of DCM that the bacteria can degrade
Our next task was to model the average rate of DCM degradation by M. extorquens DM4. Using Michaelis-Menten kinetics[2], this was predicted to be:
d[Ndcm]/dt = rate of DCM molecule degradation (s-1)
kcat         = dcmA turnover rate (= 0.6 s-1 for DM4)
[DCM]    = DCM concentration (= 0."

Flow cytometry was performed on colonies from the leucine zipper controls, colonies from plates without induction, and colonies grown on plates contiaint 25% supernatants from a strain constitutive for TraI, the enzyme responsible for making TraR's recognized autoinducer.
The leucine zipper colonies were centered around 104, the colonies without induction around 101. The colonies grown on TraI suppernatant supplemented media looked very similar to those without induction, with only a small peak in the range that GFP should produce.
Though this result is not completely positive, some GFP was observed in the TraR fusion colonies. This could mean that with careful optimization of conditions, this system could function as designed.

TraR-NGFP translational Fusion TraR-CGFP Translational Fusion Leucine Zipper NGFP translational fusion
However, the NGFP coding sequence contained a Spe1 site. We mistakenly thought that though these parts would be  incompatible with some assembly methods, that the parts would still be accepted with proper documentation explaining what assembly methods could and could not be used. We are working with iGEM headquarters to make sure we get compatible DNA submitted to the registry for these parts.
We are in the process of using QuikChange site directed mutagenesis to remove the Spe1 site from BBa_K916001 and BBa_K916003 and will resubmit the parts with compatible sequence as soon as possible.
We sequenced all three parts and saw that all of them were correctly cloned into pSB1c3. All sequencing information can be found on the parts physical DNA page.

How to quantify channel capacity of gene regulatory networks?
We transfect HEK-293 human cells with our plasmid constructions as described in the form [ref: table]. Different concentrations of Dox are applied to cell culture at the same time.
Transfected cells are cultured for 48 hours before performing flow cytometry, long enough for protein expression level to achieve steady state. FACS examination measures florescent intensity emitted by each cell, from which we obtain a large sample of florescent protein expression level, tens of thousands of cells for each experiment group.
Data collected from flow cytometry are later analyzed on computers. We estimated probability density function (p.d.f.) from data using kernel density estimation, a nonparametric statistics method. Given high and low Dox concentration input, cells exhibit different probability distributions, as illustrated in the example below [ref: fig].
What we have in hand is the conditional distribution $p\left( {Y\left| {X = x} \right.} \right)$ , given a known level of input $x$ . In order to calculate mutual information $I\left( {X;Y} \right) = \iint {p\left( {x,y} \right){{\log }_2}\frac{{p\left( {x,y} \right)}}{{p\left( x \right)p\left( y \right)}}dxdy}$  and estimate channel capacity, which is $C = \sup I\left( {X;Y} \right)$ , we need to find the input distribution $p\left( X \right)$ and joint distribution $p\left( {X,Y} \right)$ that optimizes the equation. $p\left( X \right)$ , however, is not known in the first place. We first randomly pick a stochastic vector as the initial input distribution and then use an optimization algorithm to iterate the function and maximize $I\left( {X;Y}"

British_Columbia,2014,Team:British Columbia#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," lab for more than a year. Different from the conventional undergraduate research experience, the cool thing about iGEM is that it is totally student run and we have people who major in different fields in science and even engineering! As an undergrad who has always been working and studying with people in my own major, I really look forward to working with these people coming from various disciplines and coming up with something amazing!
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to explore the various parts of iGEM. IGEM is not just about designing and carrying out an experiment and presenting the result in the end. We also need to think about the practical aspects of the project: the funding, the feasibility and the social impact, etc. I hope at the end of iGEM, I can gain an insight into scientific research in general.
What inspires you:
The power of research. Research keeps pushing the limits between what we know and the unknown. The findings can be totally unpredicted sometimes and it can also shock the world.
Desired impact on the world:
I want to become a health professional and help out people in my community. And if possible in the future, I also wish to become a WHO agent and save the people who cannot afford the basic medical needs.
Hobbies:
Like many Asians, I go play badminton. I also enjoy ballroom dancing and swimming.

Major and Year:
Fourth year in Chemical and Biological Engineering
Why iGEM:
Having heard about iGEM from a former team member in my program, I joined the team in 2013. My interest in bioprocess engineering and genetics combined with my desire to find novel solutions to real world problems drove me to apply to UBC iGEM. Needless to say, I enjoyed the experience of iGEM so much that I decided to come back for the 2014 team!
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
Through iGEM, i hope to better realize the true scale of possibilities in synthetic biology and its true value in our everyday life! I also hope to gain a better understanding of the integration of science in society and develop skills to address these issues.
What inspires you:
""We were not put on this earth to be unremarkable, unimportant, or unnoticed. Make sure you live a life less ordinary."" Every individuals participating in iGEM lives by these words and I have never been as inspired as I was at the iGEM World Championships in Boston last year!
What impact do you want to have on the world:

As negative control, we used ''E.coli'' BL21(DE3) without plasmid. We also included LC-cutinase UC Davis 2012 gene construct (Bba_K936020) in this experiment. LC-cutinase UC Davis 2012 bacterial culture is induced after 2 hours of growth (after OD 600 nm ±0.6 was reached) using 1% of arabinose. All of the bacterial culture were harvested after 4 hours of growth.From ethylene glycol assay using chromic acid, we found that ompA-LC-cutinase from ITB_Indonesia construct (BBa_K1387006) has the highest activity after 4 hours of growth.
At first, we measured the activity at 60 degrees Celsius. We found that both ompA-LC-cutinase from ITB_Indonesia and LC-cutinase UC Davis 2012 still performed small activity. Then, we tried measure the activity at 25 degrees Celsius. The ompA-LC-cutinase from ITB_Indonesia’s activity was 0.001 U/mL. While, LC-cutinase UC Davis 2012 has ten fold higher (0.01 U/mL). The LC cutinase activity was determined based on the standard curve of p-nitrophenol. One unit of cutinase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme releasing 1 μmol pNP per minute under the assay conditions.
From this experiment, we are able to confirm that ompA-LC-cutinase from ITB_Indonesia successfully perform activity. But, its suggest that we still have to check the possible activity in different time of bacterial growth, expression rate,  LC-cutinase presentation by ompA and activity assay using different substrate.
Figure 1. LC Cutinase activity. The enzymatic activity was determined at 60C in assay condition using pNP-palmitate (C16) as a substrate. The experiment was carried out twice.
Figure 2. LC Cutinase activity. The enzymatic activity was determined at 25 C in assay condition using pNP-palmitate (C16) as a substrate. The experiment was carried out twice.
Small activity of LC-Cutinase maybe due to their oligomeric state. Tethering protein to cell surface may affect folding of protein and also their biological function (Park,2010). These suggest us to look futher detail on folding and displaying"

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the"

It should be noted that fructose is produced naturally by wild-type Synechocystis. It was therefore necessary to measure constitutive fructose production in wild-type cultures.
Fatty Acid Production was measured using the EnzyChrom Free Fatty Acid Assay Kit from Bioassay Systems according to the manufacture’s protocol. This kit uses a three step assay.
Assay Description: Fatty acids are enzymatically converted to acyl CoA and then to peroxide.  A Peroxidase then uses the resulting peroxide to oxidize a dye substrate forming a pink colored product with optical density (O.D.) at 570 nm.
Ethanol Production
Ethanol Production was measured using a similar protocol to the free fatty acid assay:
Assay Description: Alcohol Oxidase converts primary alcohols like ethanol and diatomic oxygen into a formaldehyde and a peroxide, respectively.  The peroxide is then converted into two molecules of water by a peroxidase using an ABTS substrate as an electron donor.  The resulting oxidized ABTS will absorb at 405nm.  There is a 1:1 ration of ethanol to oxidized ABTS molecules; therefore we can use the molar extinction coefficient of oxidized ABTS in order to quantitate the amount of ethanol originally present.
The fatty acid and ethanol assays were quantitated by generating standard curves of absorbance vs substrate concentration using known quantities of palmitic acid or ethanol standards.
Co-cultivation
      Co-culturing multiple bacterial strains is inherently complicated. The two species must co-exist while at the same time competing for resources. Over time the growth rate of two co-cultured species will establish equilibrium. However, conditions will not be optimal for either individual species. In our case, we want to grow the E. coli in a culture that is being provided with glucose from the cyanobacterium, Synechocystis PCC6803. It is clear that E. coli growth will be limited by the productivity of the cyanobacterium. Therefore, we need to develop a system that will optimize Synechocystis growth. One of the major considerations in cyanobacteria growth is the availability of sufficient light to optimize rates of photosynthesis. This is particularly important in our system since we are also depending on photosynthesis for the production of glucose to feed E. coli. While it is possible to grow E. coli and cyanobacteria in the same culture vessel (Niederholt"

Our Solution
“Well, if it can be thought, it can be done, a problem can be overcome”
E.A. Bucchianeri, Brushstrokes of a Gadfly
The vision for our bacterial solar battery is to combine two aspects, energy storage and energy conversion, by which we will produce a new and improved type of solar battery. We have named this vision The PowerLeaf. The PowerLeaf consist of two chambers that will be referred to as the outer chamber or energy storing unit and the inner chamber or energy converting unit.
The energy storing unit is comprised of genetically engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli), which  uses solar energy for ATP production to fixate carbon dioxide into the chemically stable polymer cellulose. The cellulose works as the battery in the PowerLeaf, storing the chemical energy. A light sensing system activates dormancy during nighttime, leading to a reduced loss of energy through metabolism.
The energy converting unit uses genetically engineered E. coli to consume the stored cellulose by using an inducible switch. Retrieved electrons are transferred by extracellular electron carriers to an anode, resulting in an electrical current.
The complete system will be combined into a single device containing a compartment for each of the two units. Details about the construction and device will be discussed in the Integrated Practices section .
The device was originally designed to resemble a plant leaf aimed to provide a nature-in-city ambience. This hypothetical implementation of the PowerLeaf in an urban environment was developed through careful consideration, public engagement, and collaborations. We worked with local city planners from our hometown Odense, as well as with a plastic specialist from SP Moulding, the purpose of which was to advance our pre-established design, as well as attaining other changeable designs.
Our vision was clear and ambitions were high. As it turned out though, we had aimed too high, considering the limited timeframe, so at an early stage, we decided to focus on the following features:
Light-dependent dormancy system
Converting CO2 into glucose
Biosynthesis and secretion of cellulose produced from glucose
Converting cellulose to glucose
Extracellular electron transfer
It will then be up to future iGEM teams to continue on the development of the PowerLeaf. We would love to see our project become a reality one day, and so we have created a special page for future iGEM teams , which includes suggestions for a further development of the project.

“To be or not to be, that’s the question.”- Shakespeare. I am Cindy Tsui, one of the principal investigators of the team this year; I also work on the wiki& art as a novice :P. Joining the iGEM team as a year III chemistry student is quite a big decision for me. Biochemistry, despite its verbal relation to chemistry, is a novel subject to me. Decided to make the best out of my final year in the university, I explore more in other aspects other than my own major- engaging in the project and doing psychology are two of them. I am certain that devotion to the project would be an thought-provoking experience to myself.

Waterloo,2010,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html,"1.2 ENRICHMENT BROTH METHOD
This particular method utilizes liquid broth, which is to support the growth of MRSA or S. aureus in general. Depending on which of the above is chosen, inoculation of the original sample could occur into one of the following broths – MRSA:  Iso-Sensitest broth  2.3% NaCl, 1 g of aztreonam/ml, and 2 g of oxacillin/ml (Fang and Hedin, 2003); or S. aureus: tryptic soy broth and 6.5% sodium chloride (Warren et al., 2004). These are left overnight, and are to be re-plated on the next day, on the same types of pates as described in section 2.1 above. Unfortunately, the enrichment step proves unworthy, as sensitivity is decreased to 92.4% and specificity, to 91.4% (Warren et al., 2004.) This method also proves very tedious, time and resource consuming.
2.2 RT-PCR METHODS
The above-mentioned methods are considered to be, although fairly reliable, extremely slow. Plating and sensitivity testing are time-consuming processes, which put the previously-mentioned techniques at a minimum delay of 20 to 24 hrs (Warren et al., 2004.) The quickest method available for the detection of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a PCR assay. Unfortunately, PCR assays are very expensive as compared to other techniques. The cost of some PCR assays (including reagents and technicians’ time) may be approximately $9 CAD per test if done in-house, and around $40 CAD if not (Mahony et al., 2004.) PCR involves the use of primers, which will recognize a sequence particular for MRSA and amplify it, producing a visible fluorescence –detectable result during the amplification stage (Elsayed et al., 2003.) While various testing facilities may use different genes limited to S. aureus, the most commonly used sequences for MRSA detection through PCR are the mecA (responsible for methiciilin resistance) and nuc (S. aureus species-specific marker) genes (Elsayed et al., 2003.) The two methods described below reveal differentiating ways of
1)preparing the samples obtained from patients to be analyzed, and
2)the PCR techniques which follow in accordance with the sample preparation.

8. CELLS GROWTH
Grow one colony in 5ml of LB+antibiotic O/N at 37°C.
In the morning make a 1:100 dilution in 30 mL of fresh LB+ antibiotic and grow the cells at 37C until you reach an 0.5 OD.
Once you have reached an OD of 0.5 split the culture in two parts and spin down the cells for 10min at 4100rpm.
Discard the supernatant and resuspend the each of the 2 cultures in 15ml of MOPS. One culture will be your control, the other will be the culture to be induced.
Grow the two cultures in the thermoshaker at 37°C until the OD is 0.7.
Induce one of the 2 cultures with 5mM arabinose or 0.1 mM IPTG (or other desired concentration).
Take an aliquot to measure optical density every hour for 8 hours.
9. TOXICITY TEST BY SERIAL DILUTION
Follow the same protocol as for the growth test.
After induction leave the cells at 37C for 8 hours (or desired amount of time).
After 8 hours take an aliquot (100µL) from the uninduced culture (sample A) and add it to 9.9 mL of fresh LB. Repeat the same procedure for the induced culture (sample B). These two samples will be used to make serial dilutions.
Sample A:           Prepare 3 tubes with 4.5 mL of fresh LB and label each tube. Add 500µL of cells to 4.5 mL of LB and vortex. Subsequently, remove a 500µL aliquot from this newly made dilution and add it to a fresh tube of 4.5 mL LB. Repeat the process until a 10^5 fold dilution is reached.
Plate 150µL of each sample on LB + antibiotic and incubate at 37C O/N.
Sample B:           Repeat the same procedure used for sample A.
The day after, you can compare the number of colonies in each plate for the two different samples.

We then began to probe the edge of the bead with the miscroscope to see whether an bacteria had begun to leak out. From the image below we can see that there is a definition between the edge of the bead, where inside you can see the bacteria fluorescing and outside you cannot.
The Next Steps
If we had longer to work on our beads there are several things we could attempt in order to improve their viability.
The first would be to try and coat the beads and provide a second physical barrier to prevent the escape of the bacteria. We had the idea of coating them in a second layer of the calcium alginate, or to have another chemical in the Calcium Chloride bath that would instantly form a coating around the bead as it formed. However, this would require much more complex chemistry and material science - beyond what we could attempt in 10 weeks.
Ideally we would also make the beads much smaller, giving the beads a smaller volume, and so more would be able to fit inside of the catheter – while simultaneously improving the rate of diffusion out of the beads due to the relative increase in surface area. This would require a needle with a smaller lumen. The approach of making the beads could easily be scaled up so they could be produced in bulk.
Semi-Permeable Membrane
We would use a selectively permeable membrane to contain the beads within a compartment inside the catheter. This membrane would also provide an additional level of physical defence against our bacteria escaping into the urinary tract. The membrane would be similar to that used in a dialysis machine, and thus would allow urine and protein to diffuse through while preventing the larger bacteria from passing. Our largest protein is approximately 40kDa, so the diameter of the membrane pores would have to be able to accommodate this, as well as the larger components of urine (in order to prevent damning and a build up behind the membrane, causing complications). We would most likely be using one of the many materials already used for dialysis tubing membranes: polysulfone, polyethersulfone, etched polycarbonate, or collagen.
After considering the various options, we decided that for our catheter polysulfone would be best as it is most the commonly used in the medical profession and in dialysis machines. It is also reasonably simple to control the size of the pores during synthesis and thus produce the desired pore size.
Coating
To prevent biofilm formation on the outside of the catheter we would immobilize bacteria in a gel that would coat the outer surface. One option would be to form the"
