Tasty-Style Videos
Taking inspiration from Buzzfeed’s Tasty videos, our team created an instructional video describing how to properly execute a serial dilution. In the video, we carefully went through the process and proper lab techniques needed when conducting a serial dilution. After filming and editing the video, we posted it to Youtube to expand the educational potential of our video.  We proposed the idea of a “Tasty-style” video to iGEM Peshawar, who thought it was a great idea, thus creating a video documenting the lab techniques of transformations. Our intention in creating these videos is to teach viewers about common lab techniques in a simple and engaging way to aid them in their scientific endeavors.
CloneCademy & Collaboration with TU Darmstadt
Under the instruction of the TU Darmstadt iGEM team, our team contributed to the educational program of CloneCademy. CloneCademy is a series of learning modules with the purpose of teaching readers about biology and related fields, including biotechnology and the ethics of scientific research. Our team sent our tasty-style video playlist to TU Darmstadt so their team would be able to incorporate our lab-technique videos into their teaching program.
Mini iGEM Convention
On August 4-5th, we collaborated with the Gaston Day School team to host the Southeastern iGEM Mini Convention for iGEM teams geographically close to us. Although there were not as many teams present as we would have hoped for (just Gaston and Duke), this event gave each of us the opportunity to get closer with all teams and focus our time and energy into giving thorough and in-depth feedback and analysis on each other’s projects. We were in charge of contacting guest speakers in the Biological Engineering field who would be willing to give a lecture on the emerging and flourishing field of synthetic biology, including its ethical implications. After sending out over a 100 emails, we finally got positive responses, thus finalizing the schedule for the first day of the convention.
The following speakers were in attendance:
Danielle Tullman Ercek, Associate Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Northwestern University: Discussed the way synthetic biology becomes part of a living system and redefines life. Also talked about the scope of synthetic biology, what it can achieve, and the applications and goals of the field.

Valencia_UPV,2016,Team:Valencia UPV#Grna testing system_-_-_TEXT.html," a valuable time waiting to see a phenotypic improvement on his plant. It would take a long time just to know if the gRNA has worked or not. Due to that, it’s necessary to previously check the gRNA proper functioning.
WHY WOULDN’T OUR GRNA WORK?
Our open-source database includes genes of interest, which can be selected by plant breeders according to their needs. It also directly provides the optimal gRNA which, afterwards, must be ordered to synthesize. The gRNA is obtained from gene consensus sequences acquired from big databases such as NCBI or Sol Genomic. However, the consensus sequence may match or not with the specific variety to improve. Insertions and deletions –Indels – and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms –SNPs – occur spontaneously and randomly in the genome of different plant varieties. That means the gRNA obtained by our data processing software could not work optimally on the desired variety. This makes even more necessary to test the gRNA before using it in the specific variety. Furthermore, even if the gRNA matches perfectly with the target sequence, mutagenesis may not occur - or be less efficient - due to gRNA secondary structure problems.
GRNA TESTING METHODS
The current methods used to test the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 -and therefore that can be used to test the gRNA- are digestion with restriction enzymes or digestion with T7 endonuclease and subsequent sequencing. However, these methods are not suitable if we want to make accessible and easy the testing of the gRNA.
Digestion with restriction enzymes: when choosing the target within the gene, it is mandatory to choose a target including a restriction site where the Cas9 will make the DSB. Therefore, in order to check if the Cas9 produced the mutation, a digestion is performed with the restriction enzyme, and an electrophoresis gel is carried out. If the Cas9 cuts, the restriction site will be lost and the enzyme won’t cut. Therefore, in the electrophoresis gel, a band with higher molecular weight should be observed. If mutation did not occur, two bands should be observed, since the enzyme can recognize the site and cut.
Problem: the range of possible targets is reduced, because they must contain a restriction site exactly in the place where the Cas9 cuts. Additionally, when you find a target with a restriction site you might not have the needed enzyme. Buying it may imply a high cost, not affordable for everyone.
Digestion with T7 endonuclease: this strategy is similar to the restriction enzymes one, yet"

Motivation for Modeling
In contrast to pure experimentation, modeling allows for the rational design of synthetic biological systems.  Part characterization makes it possible to apply the known activity of genetic parts to developing a prediction of their qualitative behavior when they are pieced together into a composite device.  Such an approach was aptly demonstrated in the paper by Dr. Ajo-Franklin (Ajo-Franklin et al., 2007).  They generated a Hill equation model for composite system, to which they applied experimentally-quantified values for the parameters representing the individual parts in the system.  Their predictions with this approach matched up considerably well to measurements they made once they have built their final device.
Seeing as we incorporating many of the same parts into our own limiter network, we decided to modify their Hill equations to suit our particular design.  It was important for us to model our system because it was necessary to ascertain, given the complexity of the transcriptional interactions, whether the design would generate our desired threshold-driven output.
Hill equation
According to a Hill equation, it is possible to model the relationship between a gene (G) and its transcription factors.  The equation varies slightly depending upon whether the transcription factor has an activating or inhibitory effect, and one observes a multiplicative effect if several factors regulate expression of the same gene.
We have modeled all gene products in our system using the following equations:
One will note that the variables correspond to this diagram of our system.
Modeling results
Here we display one of numerous modeling configurations used to understand the behavior of our system.  In this situation, we vary the constitutive strength of the promoter controlling expression of gene Y.  Specific values have been included below.  These values reflect experimental values taken for some of the same synthetic transcription factors (Ajo-Franklin et al., 2007).  Many parameters were made to be equal for simplification of the modeling analysis.
Initial values: X = Y =Z = 0  I = G = 25
Parameters values:
αX = αZ = αG = 15

Heidelberg,2010,Team:Heidelberg_-_-_TEXT.html,": ""Can simple biological systems be built from standard, interchangeable parts and operated in living cells? Or is biology just too complicated to be engineered in this way?""
International student teams participating in the iGEM compete to answer this fundamental question by engineering biological systems with a proper function. More than 100 interdisciplinary student teams from all over the world, mainly consisting of undergraduate students in biology, biochemistry, engineering, informatics and mathematics, carry out different projects during the Summer to follow this approach.
Projects involved in iGEM reach from medical applications, such as genetically modified bacteria used in cancer-treatment to environmental and manufacturing projects, which allow the construction of a dynamic, watch-like counter consisting of living cells. In contrast to classical genetic engineering where only one gene is transferred from organism A to organism B, synthetic biology advances into the construction of new systems as a whole with totally new emerging properties. Therefore, each iGEM-Teams gets access to a gene-Database called ""registry"", where hundreds of different genetic parts with characterized functions are available in a “plug-and-play”–like manner. These parts can be simply stuck together to create new functional systems. The rising number of iGEM-Teams over the last years as well as the upcoming public interest in iGEM as well as in the iGEM-Teams’ projects and synthetic biology in general shows that synthetic biology will demonstrate an essential contribution to understand the functional way of life and have an enormous impact on many different fields of both scientific reseach and every-day life.

Characterization of parts from Team Slovenia 2012
To test our chassis we decided to do a collaboration with a team working in vertebrate cells. After the Regional Jamboree, and the presentation of Team Slovenia during the final, we asked them to test one of their construction. Especially constructions using TAL activator constructs (basement of their switch system).
So they send us part BBa_K782029 in the eukaryotic plasmid pCDNA3, and part BBa_K782065 in the eukaryotic plasmid pGL4.16.
The first plasmid possesses the part BBa_K782065 which contains the TAL A effector and the VP16 core under the control of the constitutive CMV promoter
The second plasmid possesses the part BBa_K782029 which contains 10 binding sites for TALA followed by the minimal promoter and the mCitrine reporter.
The TAL A system in Xenopus embryos
To test this system we first injected embryos with the plasmid BBa_K782029 which will express few mCitrine. In a second hand both plasmids, BBa_K782029 and BBa_K782065 were co-injected. The TALA VP16 expressed with the CMV promoter bind the 10x[A] sequence of the second plasmid and over-express mCitrine.
We injected plasmids with rhodamine to be sure that embryos were injected. The result show that with only the plasmid with the reporter under the minimal promoter, mCitrine is not expressed. But with the co-injection of this plasmid and the plasmid with TALA-VP16 under the control of the CMV promoter, mCitrine is expressed. It means that the switch works and the TALA-VP16 trigger the expression of mCitrie when TALA-VP16 bind the recognition site for TALA in the plasmid with mCitrine. The mCitrine were still expressed 3 days after injection, and tadpoles were developing.  Details of this system is visible here (Team Slovenia page).

A core concept of iGEM is the collaboration in an interdisciplinary student team. Accordingly, students of different age, gender and field of study came together to found our team in Aachen, in order to realize our project with joint forces and enthusiasm for the overall goal. Working closely together, we therefore not only have the chance to learn from each other, but also to excel ourselves. Using our collective creativity and common responsibility, we will create something special in order to make our contribution to synthetic biology.

Also, dont really like the hyperlinks being the Titles of each section, doesnt fit in with the format of the rest of the wiki. Maybe use the 'Learn more' images that dineka made? Temporal Control Chemical Induction: Nothing here, sort it out! pictures writing eeverything Temporal Autoinduction: looks good really, text looks a bit overwhelming in the blocks, but its fine. NEEDS REFERENCES for sources used
Temporal Thermoinduction: not sure what is up with the resolution of the image looks a bit shit. Overview should perhaps mention why its been done as thermoinduction (ie that after encapsulation chemoinduction would not work). Writing needs bulking out, pictures need improving.
Temporal Drug Release: I just created this page here, so my fault its not very complete. Just thought it would be good to have a section on how the enzymes in the SI will break down colanic acid. Possibly some lit reviews if possible?
Temporal Results: same as above, nothing here yet, but diauxie growth stuff can start to go up. Make it look sexy
Temporal Modelling: Nothing here, put it all up!! This is half of our modelling.
Wetlab Hub: Looks good, needs reading over and checking thoroughly. Dineka, u wanted to change the picture format no?
Wetlab Cloning Strategy: Nothing here. HAS TO BE DONE SOON! BIG JOB
Wetlab Protocols: Good progress being made with these, need some sort of standardisation for them.
Royah’s format for the PCR protocol is good, and something I think we should all stick to the layout of https://2009.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/Wetlab/Protocols/PCR
Wetlab Results: Need to be put up as they come in. Perhaps make sections ready for the big experiments we are hoping to get done (those important sections that freemont mentioned.) Notebook: If we have the calendar in, we want it fairly complete. That might even mean going through lab books and writing stuff up that didn’t get put up the first time. What does everyone reckon? BioBrick progress is good, but don’t think we really want it on the final wiki (could make it obvious if we have things not working properly)

China_Tongji,2015,Team:China Tongji#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," to control and monitor the activities of individual neurons in living tissue—even within freely-moving animals—and to precisely measure the effects of those manipulations in real-time.[1] The rapid progression of such interdisciplinary ""optogenetic"" approaches has expanded capabilities for optical imaging and genetic targeting of specific cell types.
The key reagents used in optogenetics are light-sensitive proteins. Spatially-precise neuronal control is achieved using optogenetic actuators like channelrhodopsin, halorhodopsin, and archaerhodopsin, while temporally-precise recordings can be made with the help of optogenetic sensors for calcium (Aequorin, Cameleon, GCaMP), chloride (Clomeleon) or membrane voltage (Mermaid).[2]
2.2 Why we use the C.elegans?
C. elegans(Caenorhabditis elegans) is a small individual,which only has a few cells(959 in the adult hermaphrodite; 1031 in the adult male) and 302 neurons. Because of that,C.elegans become one of the simplest organisms with a nervous system. Besides, the body of C.elegans is  transparent and easy to observe. Based on the above, C. elegans is a convenient and effective animal model applied in the optogenetics.
Based on the characteristic of C. elegans,we choose it as our experimental objective.On the one hand, we can easily controll it by casting different waves of light on it .On the other hand, we can also clearly observe it and recort it’s track under the fluorescence microscope.
2.3 What proteins do we use?
Each opsin protein requires the incorporation of retinal, a vitaminA-related organic photon-absorbing cofactor, to enable lightsensitivity; this opsin-retinal complex is referred to as rhodopsin.The retinal molecule is covalently fixed in the binding pocketwithin the 7-TM helices and forms a protonated retinal Schiffbase (RSBH+; Figure 1) with a conserved lysine residue locatedon TM helix seven (TM7). The ionic environment of the RSBH+,heavily influenced by the residues lining the binding pocket, dictates the spectral characteristics of each individual protein; upon absorption of a photon, the retinal chromophore isomerizes and triggers a series of structural changes leading to iontransport, channel opening, or interaction with signaling transducer proteins.

1.Introduction
<p style=""text-indent:20.9pt"">It's essential for us to get accurate growth condition of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the natural environment to keep the concentration of toxin at a lethal level. But in fact, it is almost impossible to test concentration anywhere due to the lack of equipment and skills. Therefore, building the growth model can help determine the amount of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii they should use and when they need to add more. To build an accurate growth model, BNU-China team members who have much experience in the mathematics helped us to achieve it.</p> <p style=""text-indent:20.9pt"">Contacting with data provided by wet laboratory, we can draw the diagram of variation trend of algae population. Then we can get the key point where rate of algae population increment meets the maximal value so that the results can guide to culture of algae in their wet part. To control quantity of aquatic larva of mosquito by applying expression of specific protein in algae. There is an impressive impact of establishing mathematic modeling in population of algae.</p> <p style=""text-indent:20.9000pt"">They helped us to establish a mathematic model to illustrate the whole temporal change of algae population. In general, it's an original differential equations based on light intensity, mineral nutrient, organism and carbon dioxide, which are four main parameters in that. As for the temporal changing rate of population of algae growing in ideal conditions, there has been a lot of methods to solve this question. They referred to Huisman model and combined with practice factors. Then we got our deducted model. This model has a few parameters and it's easy to get the solution.</p> <p style=""text-indent:20.9000pt"">We provided the data of wet laboratory for us, and they run the model to get result. Finally, these results can help us to complete experiment. </p>
2.Hypothesis of Model
<p style=""text-indent:21.0000pt"">The fundamental way that the algae grow is through photosynthesis, in which the inorganic carbon in the water (carbon dioxide) can be transformed into the organic carbon (carbohydrate). However, the photosynthesis of the algae, which is fixed in the water, is influenced and limited by lots of factor.</p> <p style=""text-indent:21.0000pt"">Not only in the laboratory but also the factory, Culturing algae in the stirred-well mixed culturing vessel with fixed volume"

Hey Folks! If you've started Clement's and Geoffrey's descriptions, you'll probably believe that we are obsessed by food. As French people, it's true. But we are also interested in many other things. For example, as you, I decided to launch into this Great Human Adventure because I'm convinced that Synthetic Biology is the futur and I'm looking forward to meet people from everywhere. Sport also represents a large part of my hobbies: running, cross-country biking, swimming, climbing... One last thing to fit with the French stereotype! Even if I come from the Alpes, I prefere dishes from the South like Ratatouille, Bouillabaisse or Soupe au Pistou.

Hi everyone! I’m Morgane, and I come from Grenoble. Logic? Well no! As Grenoble is one of the best student cities, almost the entire team doesn’t come from here.  On the other side, I prefer listen music rather than sports making: I have never skied. The participation to iGEM is a unique experience, to have an approach of synthetic biology but is also a human adventure. And I’m proud to participate.

My ambition is to become a researcher, at the interphase of microbiology and immunology. moreover, my other passion are badminton, makeshift job, and informatic. iGEM is really in line with my love for biology. I think this adventure will give to me a great experience and plunge myself in the scientifc world, and show up some meeting with differents people who have alternative science-thinking.

The QIAfilter Cartridge was placed into a new tube. Afterwards, 2 ml buffer S3 were added to the lysate and mixed by inverting 4-6 times. The lysate was transfered to the cartridge and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. During incubation the QIAGEN Plasmid Plus spin column was put into the vacuum manifold and tube extenders inserted into each column. The plunger was inserted gently into the QIAfilter Cartridge and the lysate filtered into the tube. Thereafter, 2 ml buffer BB were added to the cleared lysate and mixed by inverting 4-6 times. Lysate was then transfered to a QIAGEN Plasmid Plus spin column on the vacuum manifold. Vacuum was applied until all liquid remains were drawn through the column. To wash the DNA 700 μl buffer ETR was added and vacuum applied. Residual wash buffer was removed by centrifugation of the column at 10,000 x g (9,700 rpm) for 1 min in a tabletop microcentrifuge. The column was put into a clean 1.5 ml tube. Finally, 200 μl water (55°C) was added to the center of the spin column. The column was let stand for 1 minute and centrifuged for 1 minute to collect the eluted DNA.
Preparation of large plasmids
For isolation of plasmids larger than 15 kb in size, 7 ml bacterial culture were harvested after 12-16 hours of growth in appropriate medium. Samples were centrifuged at 6000 xg for 20 min at 4°C. Supernatant was discarded and cell pellet resuspended in 200 µl of Buffer P1 (QIAGEN). Afterwards, 400 µl of Buffer P2 were added, mixed thoroughly by inverting until the lysate appeared viscous. Solution was incubated at room temperature (15-25°C) for 2 min. Afterwars 300 µl of Buffer P3 were added to stop lysis. Cell debris and Proteins were pelleted by centtrifugation at ~ 17,900 x g for 30 min at 4°C. Supernatant was carefully transferred into a fresh 2ml eppendorf centrifuge tube and isopropanol purification of DNA was conducted.

Ancillary Projects and Future Directions
This section covers projects we have designed and are invested in aside from our PUF research. Ancillary projects like utilizing the RNA scaffold and Enzymatic Assembly Line are directly related to the applications made possible by the use of our PUF toolkit which have not been previously elaborated upon. The characterization of the 2011 University of Washington's Petrobrick is unrelated to our project. However, as an endeavor in the standardization of synthetic biology and the Parts Registry, it was necesary for our team to contribute further to the foundational cause.

Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#pumi_-_-_TEXT.html," OD600 were determined and the glycerin concentration of the samples analyzed. The data are illustrated in Figure 7. At the beginning of the cultivation, the cells were in lag phase, in which they adapt to the medium. During their growth the cells consumed glycerin as well as O2, which leads to an increase of agitation speed to hold a minimal pO2 of 50 %. After 11 hours, the glycerin was completely consumed and the pO2 increased up to 100 %, which indicates that the cells entered the stationary phase. The maximal OD600 of 12.6 was reached after 12 hours of cultivation. The cells were harvested after 19 hours of cultivation.
Since Regionals: Purification of BPUL
The harvested cells were resuspended in Ni-NTA- equilibration buffer , mechanically disrupted by homogenization and cell debris were removed by centrifugation, microfiltration as well as diafiltration to concentrate the protein concentration in the cell lysate solution. This solution of the cell lysate was loaded on the Ni-NTA column (15 mL Ni-NTA resin) with a flow rate of 1 mL min-1 cm-2. Then the column was washed with 10 column volumes (CV) Ni-NTA equilibration buffer . The bound proteins were eluted by an increasing Ni-NTA elution buffer step elution from 5 % (equates to 25 mM imidazol) with a length of 50 mL, to 50 % (equates to 250 mM imidazol) with a length of 70 mL, to 80 % (equates to 400 mM imidazol) and finally to 100 % (equates to 500 mM imidazol) with a length of 100 mL. This strategy was chosen to improve the purification caused by a step by step increasing Ni-NTA-elution buffer concentration. The elution was collected in 10 mL fractions.  A typical chromatogram of purified laccases is illustrated here . Unfortunately, the data of this procedure are not available due to a computer crash after the purification step. All Fractions were analysed to detect BPUL.

In the presentation, we taught kids the basic definition of bacteria and  ubiquitous phenomenon concerning with bacteria in our daily life.
Also, we introduced the basic classification of bacteria and the common things related to microorganisms in our daily life, such as fungi, antibiotics, yogurt and so on .
One of our team member was introducing microbes.
Furthermore, we brought some beef-protein mediums and potato-dextrose agar mediums for these students to culture microbes. Children were all excited about it. In this visit, we hope to edify them and evoke their interests about nature and science.
Promotion
Since many people still unfamiliar with synthetic biology, we held an activity together with iGEM team NWPU-China 2016 in order to promote the knowledge of synthetic biology and our project in October 2016. We both made a presentation to introduce our own project and communicated with each other by live video streaming on platform “QQ Zone”. Many students who interested in biology and iGEM attended our lecture and watched the live video of team NWPU-China’s lecture. Also, we made a live video of our lecture for them. In this way, we can interacted with each other by sending comments online.

We chose to simulate the flux of output given a determined input. So we have for a wide range of inputs, the resultant outputs in a time manner.
Kappa
Also, having the Kappa binaries, we decided to model the system using Kappa as a stochastic modeling platform. Some preliminary results would be here if the Server didn't have an unexplainable aversion for .7z, .rar, or partial intolerance for .zip As soon as the Server decides to tolerate our files, we will upload them. In the mean time, here are some sample data. Please take note of the file extensions, as due to server issues, we had to append a .txt extension to upload the original code.
This graphs plot the Pop output of our Receptors, notice this output is of a TOTAL final production, not the rate of production (i.e. Polymerases per Second vs. Total Amount of Polymerases). The .ka code is available, however take into account that said code generates a single plane, to generate the 3D plot we used a perl script. The system begins in dark state, and at a given time (you can guess which one), there's a photon influx. These graphs are however in arbitrary units. We wanted to make a more useful characterization, but these simulations required some extreme computing time.

DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Repressor Section_-_-_TEXT.html," Both the digested PCR product and the digested plasmid were run on a gel in order to estimate DNA concentration.
The ligation was made using T4 ligase with a 5:1 ratio of insert to backbone. After the ligation the plasmid was transformed into electrocompetent DH5α E. coli cells. After an hour of recovery in LB media at 37 °C the cells were plated on LB plates containing chloramphenicol (Cam).
The next day five colonies on the plates were selected and restreaked on LB+Cam plates in order to assure pure colonies.  Overnight cultures were made of the transformants by taking one colony from each restreak and inoculating it in LB+Cam at 37 °C over night. Minipreps were made from the overnight cultures and a verification PCR was run on these in order to assure that the plasmid had the expected insert.

Lanes 6-10 show the expected amplicon of 672 bp from a PCR using the iGEM primer VR as reverse and a forward primer which anneals to the Gifsy2 immunity region. Lanes 11-13 show the expected amplicon of 450 bp from a PCR using the iGEM primer VR as reverse and a forward primer which anneals to the anti-repressor AntO. The Biobricks sent in are the ones corresponding to lanes 4, 9 and 11.

The Gifsy1 anti-repressor AntO was amplified by PCR using a plasmid containing the anti-repressor as template (Sebastién Lemire). The primers had tails corresponding to the standardized prefix and suffix making the amplicon BioBrick compatible. Once we had the amplicon it was digested, ligated and transformed into DH5α E. coli cells following the same procedure as in the above mentioned BioBricks. The results from the verification PCR can be seen in figure 1.
Finally we decided to have the submitted BioBricks sequenced. To our joy, the results showed that our BioBricks do not contain any mutations.

    Before the acid stress, the cell structure of the control strain and the recombinant strain remained intact. After 3 h of pH 4.0 stress, the cell membrane thickness became thinner and the surface became rough, and the cell membrane of some control strains ruptured. In comparison, the cell structure of the recombinant strain remains more intact, thereby effectively reducing the damage caused by acid stress on the cells.

    L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149-msmk-cspD2-gfp and L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149 strains were inoculated with 4% inoculation. When cultured at 30 °C for 2.5 h (OD=0.35), add 0, 0.5 ng/mL of Nisin, and then culture for 8 ∼ 10 h (OD=0.8), centrifuge at 4000 r/min. Resuspend them in the same volume of fresh M17 medium and count the number of colonies. Four freeze-thaw stimulations were performed on all samples by 1 mL of the sample after counting, and placed in a refrigerator at −20 °C to cool rapidly, frozen for 24 h, then slowly frozen at 4 min and 30 °C. Count separately and calculate the survival rate.

Day 2:
Charlie began work on the Project Description while Sam and Max continued work on the team wiki.  Lamya and Christina collected the notes of previous IGEM meetings that took place during the semester and built mind maps to be put on the wiki.  The lab team prepared overnights of E. coli in LB so that they could run a practice transformation and gel electrophoresis later in the week.
Day 3:
We completed the Project Summary form and Safety Proposal and put them on the team wiki.  The team then concentrated on finishing with the pre-summer meeting material. After completing the sponsorship proposal,  Christina began emailing potential sponsors.
In the meantime the lab team carried out practice transformations on the E. coli from the overnights.  They used a biobrick which provides resistance to ampicillin in order to learn correct antibiotic usage.
Day 4:
Charlie and Ogaga began researching various constitutive and positive promoters, in order to complete our basic biobrick sequence.  Because our decided coding gene region was so small, it was decided that it would be feasible to order the promoter, ribosome-binding site, coding region, and terminator from a DNA synthesis company.
We booked the flights and taxis for the trip to Norwich and created a St Andrews iGEM Gmail, Facebook, Flickr and Twitter accounts. The latter would be used to communicate with other iGEM teams throughout the project.
The lab team made more overnights of the transformed E. coli colonies for the experiments to be carried out on the following day.  Chris and Lamya continued to contact the 75+ potential sponsors to acquire us reagents and money for later use in the lab.
Day 5:
The lab team ran a mini prep, a restriction digest and a gel electrophoresis. The results of the gel electrophoresis showed that no DNA was present in our gel so we discussed the possibility that we had let the DNA sit in the wells of the gel for too long, causing it to sink through the gel. In order to corroborate this we decided to run another gel on Monday morning.
The team continued contacting sponsors, receiving some positive responses.  For our human practices project the team brainstormed various ideas such as conducting surveys across various topics, public engagement, etc.

IV Data

V Analysis
    From the results above, how could we design our two warriors? Let's see!
    First, we need to choose two kinds of AHLs secreted by each warrior, right? Let’s try to make warrior I secrete C4HSL and warrior II secrete 3OC6HSL. Then which receptor-promoter should we put into the two warriors to make them just killed by the other warrior? Let’s first try to determine warrior I. Can we find a receptor-promoter combination that just responds to 3OC6HSL but not to C4HSL? Unfortunately, we can’t. Therefore, we cannot choose C4HSL and 3OC6HSL to construct the two warriors that we want.
    Similar results of other 2 AHL pairs can be obtained by similar analysis.

Below an example of a JavaScript generated graph is shown, based on this spreadsheet . Note that the two views of the data are linked (although at this time both the kind of graph and the link is not optimal) and that it would be possible to create templates for creating these linked graphs. The current demo is based on the Dojo Toolkit as it has more advanced charting capabilities at this moment than Google visualization (and it seems to be supported well in different browsers).
Loading graph ...
Loading graph ...
Questions that would have to be resolved include:
How can we make this easy to use?
The graphs can now be defined using a more or less normal Wiki page and allow the use of templates.
What kinds of plots do we need?
How flexible do we need it to be? (Layout-wise.)
Can we make it that flexible? (And still easy to use.)
Can we create a relatively easy way to let the viewer select different data for exploratory purposes? We will likely run more simulations than you would normally graph.
How to support axis titles?
Currently done using some custom code (created by someone else and submitted to Dojo's bug tracker).
 ???
Taking this idea (much) further it would even be possible to run simulations using JavaScript (and charting the results), based on SBML models. However, this would involve much, much more effort than just showing a few interactive plots.
Note that we did implement simulations in JavaScript, but based on a function that return the time-derivatives given the current state. In principle this is surprisingly fast (in some cases graphing was the bottle-neck, leading us to subsample the simulated time series for graphing purposes) and it should be relatively easy to adapt to other models. Note that we only used a very simple integration scheme though (so if your model requires a more advanced integration scheme you'll have to program it yourself).

This solves the system in an iterative way, and will give you the concentration of all compounds as a function of time. For the example system we consider here, the results of this procedure are shown in figure 1. Although this is easy, it can be quite computationally intensive.
Figure 1: Results obtained for the example system using the Matlab scripts shown above.
A more elegant way, which can be applied to small systems, is to solve the system by hand, to obtain a closed form solution. Depending on your system and your math skill, this can be easy, hard, or impossible. A third option would be to search for steady state solutions. Steady state means that the system does not change anymore, i.e. all time derivatives are zero. Finding steady state solutions is usually not very problematic; however, it is not possible to find a meaningful steady-state solution for a lot of systems. The generic system described above has a steady state solution, but the only thing it will tell you is that nothing happens when [A] or [B] is zero.
Once you have found a solution to your system, you would like it to show (approximately) the same results as found during the lab work or in literature. To realize this, you need to choose your unknown parameters in such a way that your modeling results match the data. This is called fitting. When you have found an analytical solution to your system, you can use a range of Matlab functions to do this, such as nlinfit . If your system is more complex, or if you want to fit data depending on something else than the independent variable (time in most cases), this will usually not work.
Although this sounds quite non-scientific, the best approach in such a case is to guess your parameters and adjust them in a iterative fashion until you have found a fit that matches your data on eye. Following this approach, you will most probably not be able to determine the exact value of a parameter, but obtaining the order of magnitude of a parameter or the ratio between different parameters will nevertheless give you valuable insight in the system.

At the “Induction Stop” point, of the graphics below (Figure 6), the cultures of basic and improved flip-flop were set at 30ºC (without IPTG) and fluorometry data was taking  during six and a half hours. In these graphics it is also shown how the bacteria reach the 42ºC state after change their state. This assay was performed using our previously constructed X90 (SspB, RybB double deletion) E. coli strain expressing the improved flip-flop (module I and II) and the basic flip-flop with an empty plasmid (as control).
Figure 6. Fluorescence/O.D. of basic and improved flip-flop after 42ºC induction during 11 hours (before “Induction Stop”) and without any induction during 6,5 hours (after “Induction Stop”). We had to adjust the fluorescence level of the basic flip-flop, dividing the green fluorescence intensity by 7, as in this system the green fluorescence intensity is 7-fold higher than the red fluorescence intensity. This readjustment was not necessary for the improved flip-flop due to the fact that the basal intensity levels of the fluorescent proteins are similar. In the graphics we can see that the 42ºC state stability is markedly higher in the Improved Flip-Flop compared to the Basic Flip-Flop, and that the difference between the fluorescence levels of both states is also much more pronounced.
We have showed by fluorometry measurements that our improved flip-flop increases the difference between the fluorescence levels of opposite bistable states, lowering the repressed state levels to almost zero . We have also demonstrated that the stability of the improved flip-flop is much higher than the basic flip-flop under this stimulus.
IPTG state stability
We have collected a huge amount of data to determine IPTG State Stability using flourometry and flux cytometry. Unfortunately we haven’t been able to analyse all of them yet. Though, we have observed that the “IPTG state” tends to impose itself over the 42ºC state in the absence of induction. We expect to show these results in the World Championship Jamboree.
Note: For an easier understanding of the bistable system we denominate ""IPTG state"" to the transcriptional state caused by IPTG induction; and ""42ºC state"" to the transcriptional state caused by 42ºC heat shock induction. In the improved flip-flop the 42ºC state causes GFP expression and the IPTG state causes RFP expression. The"

Our Project: Context
Since the development of recombinant DNA technology (Cohen et al., 1973), recombinant protein production gradually became a major branch in modern biotechnologies bringing production of both biopharmaceutical and industrial enzymes to the unprecedented importance it reached today.
In the protein production process, the choice of a suitable host organism through several criteria is pivotal. In that regard, E. coli thanks to the availability of many molecular tools and the ease with which it is cultivated, remains an host of choice. Even though E. coli is a firmly established model organism, there is many remaining drawbacks to its utilisation. High among those, figures its inability to efficiently secrete protein into the growth medium but should also be noted that quite often high protein production induces E. coli’s stress response which hinders growth, and the very limited possibilities of post-translational modifications in E. coli.
In order to recover the biosynthesized product from an E. coli culture, bacteria must undergo lysis. This operation is expensive, inefficient, time consuming and implies that bioreactors must be restarted from scratch.
These problems drove a lot of researchers to the lab but it also drove the industrials away from E. coli and towards new host organisms.
The objective of our project is to reestablish E. coli as a microorganism of choice for recombinant protein production thanks to an easily implementable biobrick allowing regulable universal recombinant protein secretion.
Such biobrick could reveal itself to be a convenient alternative to cell lysis and be of great use in continuous mixed flow reactors for recombinant protein production and potentially many other applications. Moreover, cytotoxic protein production would also be greatly facilitated.
The idea behind The Gatekeeper is to create a porin regulated by inducers such as transition metal ions. To obtain this porin, we started from the pIV porin of the f1 bacteriophage. This porin allows the virion extrusion out of the bacteria without affecting its viability.
Through our semi-rational targeted mutagenesis approach, we should be able to quickly create  high diversity pIV mutants libraries. Among those we aim to select the mutants for which we could affect the open/close state through the use of the"

One of the goals of our project was providing our detection tool with a long shelf-life under simple storage conditions. For this reason, we investigated the use of Tardigrade-specific intrinsically Disordered Proteins (TDPs) to preserve Cas13a activity upon desiccation and storage at room temperature. These TDPs originate from the tardigrade, an extremely resilient micro-animal ( Sloan et al. 2017 ), and mediate the tardigrade’s desiccation tolerance. The mechanism behind this has been hypothesized to be a vitrification process ( Boothby et al. 2017 ). By forming a glass-like matrix upon desiccation, TDPs protect"

Now, while we wait for sequencing results, we go on as they were going to be correct in order to save time.
The next step is to build a transciptional unit (TU) with our sequences. A transcriptional unit is a structure composed by promoter, coding sequence (CDS) and terminator in an α or Ω vector.
Reagents needed for ligation:
1 μL promoter 75 ng/μL
1 μL terminator 75 ng/μL
1 μL CDS 75 ng/μL
1 μL vector α

Since bacteria and PHB have different settling velocities, the first centrifugation step can remove biomass while leaving PHB in suspension. The second step will likely require an ultracentrifuge but will allow to settle PHB granules and remove the supernatant. Adding a coagulant such as calcium ions can aid in settling PHB granules; we will experiment with coagulation to see whether it can eliminate the need for the second centrifugation step or reduce required centrifugation speeds.
Additionally, we discussed a fermentation experiment to produce VFA from synthetic feces. The experiment will aim to answer the following questions:
Is it possible to make VFA by inoculating synthetic feces with E. coli?
How much VFA can be made per amount of input feces and what types of VFA will be made?
How long does it take to reach maximum VFA composition?
Does temperature have an impact on VFA production?
Does the addition of yeast to synthetic feces make a difference in VFA production?
The proposed conditions for the first VFA experiment are summarized in Table 1. We plan to run the fermentation process for 5 days. Samples for VFA analysis will be collected on day 1 and day 5.

My Profile:
Chen Liao,       Room 418, Key Lab of Quantum Information, CAS, East Campus, USTC Hefei, Anhui 230026, China, liaochen@mail.ustc.edu.cn
I’ve just began my first year in the Optics and Optical Engineering program as a master candidate at University of Science and Technology of China. I became interested in iGEM because I found it a great chance to learn synthetic biology. Since iGEM is a student-run and student-manage programe which encourages students both to work collectively in a team and work individually to complete one's own task, it is a great experience to exercise my team working ability as well as creative ideas. In the last months, especially the summer, I worked with students from different disciplines to design and implement our project together and have learnt a lot from them. It is rather a wonderful experience to work with all team members. (^▽^)
As a student of department of physics, my research area is development of first principle theory and implementation of LCAO (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals) algorithms. As a member of LiXin He's group , I have successfully implemented atomic force calculation in LCAO method and my next project is to modify and develop algorithms under condition of  magnetic B field. Besides scientific research, I do sports very often. Basketball is my favorite and my favorite basketball player is Kevin Garnett (K.G.), his professional attitude on the court as well as his individual character in the life impresses me a lot.

Hi, I'm Zhen Wang, I mainly work on MoDeL and Database of iGAME. As a member of Lixin He's research group, I focus mainly on calculation of quantum information, quantum correlation and entanglement.
You might have noticed that my address is same as Liao's. Yes, we are from the same Research Group, and the same department, too. It will be boring if I repeat all the information again, so I am going to write some experience of myself participating iGEM2010.

According to some people, this issue is not transposable to nanoparticles, which benefit from stealth molecules. These molecules, like Polyethylen Glycol (PEG) for example, are supposed to avoid recognition by the immune system thanks to a steric repulsion. But this is not true, or at least only in single injection, PEG like other stealth molecules, offers an accessible epitope to antibodies and other body opsonins. Then, during the second injection, an immune response is put in place and clearance is speed up, decreasing considerably the therapeutic efficacy.
However, vectors recognized by opsonins are absorbed by hepatho-splenic system macrophages (liver and spleen), then it is quite easy to target these organs pathologies with this technology. It is totally naturally, via hepatic and splenic macrophages, that organism concentrate “vectorized” medicine dose in these two organs.
Industrialization is an issue from another nature. However, it stays essential to control. Many revolutionary techniques never succeeded due to a disability to be transposed to industrial scale. This can be the case for some type of vectors. Today, except prokaryotic vectors, vector production cost is very high. For example, viral vector has to be produced by eukaryotic cells, which seems to be a brake to their commercialization. For nanoparticles, prices are high for the moment, however some products with hepathosplenic tropism can be found on the market. Moreover, fabrication of more complex vectors, which need more components, several conception steps and organic solvents use has a production cost very high.
To sum up, a table of each vector type faces to the vectorization problems:
We observe in the previous table, that each vector type fails face to at least one of the problematics. So, we can say that this technology, as promising it is considered, is faced to a technological barrier.
This table shows that each vector type possesses at least one problem. But to each problematic, one or more vector reply positively. Viruses, phages and bacteria are biological vectors, so we can associate them to form an optimal vector, replying to all major problematics.

VIJAY BHOOPALAN
A foodie at heart and a potato by looks, Vijay can be the nicest person in the world if he chooses to be. However, his post as a student leader required him to be the strict cop that keeps everyone in check. The second Potterhead of the team (no one can beat Nishka), Vijay would love to read minds of people. But when given an option to choose between that or eating anything without worrying about getting fat, he unblinkingly chose the latter, to no one's surprise. Though he describes himself as a modest person, when asked about his accomplishments until now, Vijay feels that they are way too many to list down. His heart's desire is to build a school of his own someday. Vijay  played a crucial role in formulating our idea and the wet lab work.
PREETHI THUNGA
Being the student leader of the team, Preethi primarily managed our Human Practices and collaborations apart from working in the lab. She is fascinated by the idea of engineering things at the DNA level and was responsible for designing our parts for the project. She enjoys coding as much as she loves biology and has aptly set her eyes upon computer simulations of biological models. Preethi is a vibrant little girl who likes to keep everyone around her happy. When she is not flooded with iGEM work (which is close to never), she binge-watches TV shows or stalks random cute guys on social media (beware people). Also probably the best singer in the team (in very close competition with Akash), she gives unrecoverable live performances in the lab. Let us all hope we never get to hear her sing again!

Our visit to the Davyhulme Wastewater Treatment Plant taught us, however, that in some cases, higher sludge production volumes could also be desired. The staff explained that sludge incineration allows for on-site energy production, which is how Davyhulme powered over 50% of its processes. At times, Davyhulme would also sell phosphorus rich sludge as biosolids to the local farmers, which further increased their profits. As a result, we realised it is very hard to give a clear verdict as to which methods give rise to the best sludge outcomes due to the complexity of sludge treatment.
Environmental Sustainability Phosphostore achieves the highest level of environmental sustainability as it involves a chemical-free, stable and predictable solution. Furthermore, phosphorus recycling is an intrinsic part of the Phosphostore technology, as opposed to EBPR or chemical precipitation, both of which require additional steps for phosphorus recycling. EBPR takes the second place as it is still a chemical free method; however, it is less predictable than the other two methods and does not involve phosphorus recycling in its process. Through our interaction with Aqua Enviro , we also learned that chemical precipitation is clearly the least environmental friendly solution as it requires a lot of supplementary chemicals
Phosphate that is recovered from our bacteria can be reused as fertilizer for agriculture usage. Assuming that the fertilizer is sold at the same average market cost of Diammonium Phosphate (DAP), the most widely used phosphate fertilizer, the recovered material can provide revenue of $2.4 million, which is about 8% of initial capital investment.
Company Description
Company Description
We started as a group of nine students in December 2016, forming a team which would represent The University of Manchester in a synthetic biology competition called iGEM. With huge help of the academic staff, we have successfully designed phosphorus accumulating bacteria. For this reason, we decided on Phosphostore as our company’s name since it combines the words phosphorus and storage, which perfectly describes what we are trying to achieve. Our company aims to help wastewater treatment plants remove phosphorus from the sewage in a stable, efficient and cheap manner.
Company mission statement
To recycle phosphorus, help the agriculture, to clean up rivers, sustain a healthy water supply.

this part will show you the use of the iPhone in a standard case, and also show you some points developed during the announce we mailed on the others teams.
iPhone use case
We already talk about the software on computer, which allows us to create protocols, and managing databases. to transfer information to Soft>iPhone we need to use a standard format: the XML format. Now we have our iPhone in the WetLab who have got our daily merged protocol :-). And now what ?? There is the list of things that should (and would) be doing by the iPhone.
View of the protocol, step by step. Each step is name, have a timer on it, and can be modify :
adding Pictures : useful to add information on results, gel, petri dishes...
record any video or speaking support to add information without writing it, way more fast and easy
data: any machine, computer with data can/could be plug in the iPhone to download it. We can do even better to import data from the iPhone for making the machine work ;-)
Every picture data record are name and put in the protocol and classify in each step files.
Even if the timer is still running the user can tell when he really end his manipulation. In a long distance utilization, it would be a useful information to make more precise protocol adapted to the user.
Each active timer can be seen at all time.
At the end of the protocol, you can resynchronized your iPhone to the software, and it will download, and update all your notebook with data. It also create a database on each step to adapt itself to"
Waterloo,2013,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," for senders is a simple logistic growth equation:
where the growth rate G is modified by r since senders produce viral particles and therefore grow more slowly. The DEs for P1 uninfected and P2 uninfected incorporate loss due to receipt of DNA messages, and the DE for P¬2 ori incorporates production due to receipt of DNA message:
Since there is a turnaround time associated with receipt, modification, and retransmission of a DNA message in primary receivers, the “age” of P1 mod¬ cells – the time since they became capable of producing viral particles – is an important aspect of the system state for determining the rate of production of M¬mod. We are therefore interested in P1 mod (t,a), where a is age, and we must use a partial differential equation to keep track of this state variable. The boundary condition for the PDE accounts for P1 mod(t,0), the production of P1 mod through flipping of the switch in P1 ori cells as well as direct infection by M1 mod.
Production of Mori by senders occurs through intact helper plasmid at rate p,
The rate of production of Mmod by P1 mod cells requires consideration of the age of the cells. The rate of production of Mmod by cells of a given age is defined by the function
where viral particle production by a P1 mod cell begins at age j1 and increases with age to maximal production rate bp at age j2, where 0 < b < 1. Production in these cells is likely slower than the rate in senders, p, because one of the M13 cistrons has been picked apart to allow complementation.
The production rate of M¬mod at time t is determined from the distribution of P1 mod cells over all ages and the rate of particle production at each age through a convolution:
Estimation of Model Parameter Values
In the absence of precise parameter values, a literature review provided reasonable ranges for the parameters that allowed us to make qualitative statements about the behavior of the system.
Carrying capacity c was estimated as 1.5*109 cells/ml [1].
Maximal growth rate g was estimated as ln(2)/20 – ln(2)/30  / min, for a doubling time between 20 and 30 minutes.
Maximal growth rate of cells producing viral particles was taken as 1/4g – 1/2g [2].
Adsorption rate k of viral particles to cells was taken as 3*10-11 ml/min [3]. .
The rate of viral particle production p from the intact helper pl"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

Click to visit Mamma’s Burgers!
People tend to fear bacteria and oppose genetic modification, and thus synthetic biology. Our attempt at a novel outreach approach will teach the audience facts about bacteria, DNA and GMO in a fun and participatory way.
At the burger joint, Mamma's Burgers, crazy things might happen but it sure will be educational!
The Untapped Food Resource of the Century
Edible coli is a proposal for a sustainable food source.
A modified strain of the bacteria Escherichia coli will provide the optimal quantities of nutrition a human needs, by degrading otherwise non-degradable material for the human body.
First step is the production of a nutritional protein, the OneProt, and the biosynthesis of essential fatty acids – additionally, it will carry the appealing touch of lemon flavor. Then the Nutrition Generator, a custom designed, innovative and revolutionary cultivation tank will ensure an on-going amplification of the Edible coli products, easy to handle and drain from.
Could the world live off of microorganisms?

2018.3 Team building.
2018.4 Team meeting and topic selection meeting.
2018.5 Select topic and building up project’s overall framework. We analyzed current problems in the iGEM Registry, developed solutions and analyzed program feasibility.
2018.6.3-6.16 We held a large-scale publicity science activity in Sichuan science and technology museum and prepared for the iGEM southwest league.
2018.6.17 iGEM southwest league’s meeting was held in Ya 'an campus of Sichuan agricultural university.
2018.6.18 We went to Sichuan science and technology museum to organize the science activity. 2018.7.15-7.22 We decided to use blast to match integration and begun to localize blast. Based on existing research, we collected a large number of related documents and selected prediction method.

2018.7.18-7.22 This week we collected data sets for training. The prokaryotic promoters come from RegulonDB and eukaryotic promoters come from EPD. Non-promoter sample was selected from the CDS antisense strand.
2018.7.26-7.30 We built the CNN (convolutional neural networks) model today. Based on LeNet-5, we improved the model
2018.7.31-8.1 We interviewed with scholar Junbiao Dai. We collected the method of promoter recognition on the genome size. Following methods we chose:
Making the window moves 1-2 bp each time. If more than 10 consecutive windows are predicted as promoters, we call that region a promoter region and the segment with the highest score is selected as the promoter in this region.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,"B’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi. We simplify this process as the graph shows below.
As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation"

Nagahama,2014,Team:Nagahama Policy & Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," DNA parts, such as synthesis of amino acid, that are not dangerous for human, so there are no safety and health risks.
Q-2) Risks to the safety and health of the general public (if any biological materials escaped from your lab)
A-2) We only use E. coli JM109 and E. coli DH5α encoding extra DNA parts that are originated fromE. coli and in Spring 2014 Distribution. These organisms are derived from E. coli K-12 strain that belong to Risk group 1. So we think that these organisms have no risks to the safety and health of the general public.
Q-3) Risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab)
A-3) We are using only E. coli JM109 and E. coli DH5α. They belong to B1 level in biological safety in Japan, and can’t live in nature. So if they escape from our lab, there is no risk to the environment.
Q-4) Risks to security through malicious miss-use by individuals, groups, or countries
A-5) All E. coli and DNA parts are stored in private refrigerators for our project, and the refrigerators have been locked when we do not use them.
Q-5) What measures are you taking to reduce these risks? (For example: safe lab practices, choices of which organisms to use.)
A-5) As described above, we only use B1 level E. coli in our project and all biological materials are autoclaved before waste according to our institute rule.
Q-6) What new risks might arise from your project's growth? (Consider the categories of risk listed in parts a-d of the previous question: lab workers, the general public, the environment, and malicious miss-uses.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
A-6) We are planning to make two strains of transgenic E. coli. One has characteristics to release asparatic acid after addition of cadmium ion, resulting to collect other E. coli.  The other one can trap cadmium ion outside the bacteria.  When both transgenic E. coli will be used in natural field, the former might attract other bacteria and microorganisms to the cadmium-containing area, resulting to pollution of the organisms, and the latter has high concentration of cadmium ion outside the bacteria, resulting to bioaccumulation of cadmium in the predator of the transgenic E. coli.
Q-7) Does your project currently include any design"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html,". The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of ammonia concentration to the user’s mobile phone during the detection process.
Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace"

What you will need
1X TAE
Graduated Cylinder
125 mL flask
Agarose
Gel Pouring Tray
Tape
Gel rig
Ethidium Bromide
Protocol
Measure out 120mL of buffer
Transfer buffer to 125 mL flask
Weigh out enough agarose to make a 1% gel (in our case 1.2 g of agarose was the right amount)
Transfer agarose to 125mL flask
Melt agarose in microwave until solution is almose boiling, stirring every 15-20 seconds (should be around 2 minutes)
Allow agarose to cool (do not let it cool to the point where it is hard)
Add 3 uL of Ethidium Bromide to the cooling agarose
Assemble the gel pouring apparatus by inserting gate into slots. Use a pastuer pipet to run a bead of molton agarose along the edges of the gates to seal the box and prevent leaks
Allow gel to cool until flask can be handled comfortabley
Place comb in the gel rig
Pour agarose into gel tray
Allow to solidify. While the gel is solidifying prepare the samples. Add your sample and 1 uL 10x Loading Dye, 4 uL of DNA and 5 uL of water
Pour 1X TAE over gel so that gel is covered by a 3-5mm buffer
Load samples into lane (Don't forget to load a 1kb+ ladder into one of the lanes)
Hook electrodes to gel apparatus
Run the apparatus at 100V for 30 - 45 minutes (make sure to watch that the dye does not run off the gel)
Visualize the gel and record the results

This protocol is also described as a part of our Construction Technique . Start by selecting the order of the two parts you will be putting together; the one in front will be referred to as the insert, while the one behind will be referred to as the vector.  Both the vector and the insert need to have their own separate tube, at least in the beginning. This is important because it allows for clean addition new parts to a the circuit

USTC-China,2014,Team:USTC-China#modeling#measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," value of $D$. Firstly we use micro camera to record the motion of bacteria. And then we focus on several bacteria's movement locus to count $Ave(x^2)$ with time $t$. Using these statistic data we can plot the relation between $Ave(x^2)$ and $2t$, and  the slope of the plot is what we want, the value of D.
Results
We use Mathematics to simulate 500-step movements of 5 bacteria, the image above shows their locus (in different color). ALl the bacteria ""moved"" randomly to different directions. Than we calculate square of the distance from original point, plot it with steps $ n $
From the figure we can conclude that different diffusion coefficients correspond to different slopes of the fitting line. So we can develop a experimental method to evaluate the parameter of the system.
When we get the value of diffusion coefficients before and after we gave the signal STOP, we can compare them to see how our paths woke. What's more, with D, we can estimate how far a bacterium can move in a particular period of time, and predict how clear our image would be.
From a quantitative perspective, this work upholds the idea of using C.crescentus instead of E. Coli as chassis to make the image more clear.
This work is chiefly done by Hongda Jiang, with the assistance of Fangming Xie.

Safety in INSA Toulouse
INSA Toulouse is a public school for engineers. The biosafety guidelines are not specific to our institution; the French National regulations for working conditions and for manipulating genetically modified organisms are applied.
The regulation about the workers' prevention against risks resulting from their exposure to pathogenic biological agents (Decree No. 94-352 of 4 May 1994) includes microorganisms, cell cultures and human endoparasites which may cause infections, allergies or toxicity.
This Decree is the French transposition of the Directive 90/679 / EEC and is also transcribed in the Labour Code (Articles L4421-1 R4421-1 to R4427-5.)
The Decree of the 16th July 2007 describes the technical preventive measuresto set up in research laboratories (including containment), education, analysis, anatomy and surgical pathology, autopsy rooms, and industrial and agricultural facilities where workers are likely to be exposed to biological pathogens.
The rules of health, safety, and preventive medicine applied in public services in France (and thus in all public facilities working in scientific and technological domains) are set out in"

week 24-30-07.2017
The from silica column chromatography obtained fractions were analysed first with DC and building on that, the most prosperous fraction was sent to the cooperating  Grebe group for GC-MS. The spectra was analysed with the help of a chemist from the group, Fabian Ebner, revealing that the reaction did not successfully take place as only educt was detected by the GC-MS. After further informing ourselves about the exact reaction mechanisms and the conditions as far as published in the technical literature, we derived at two suspicions for the failure of there reaction. One was that the incativation of the catalytic activity of the protein through carben transfer to a protein side chain as described in >“Identification of mechanism-based inactivation in P450-catalyzed
cyclopropanation facilitates engineering of improved enzymes“ (H.Renata, 2016). Here the author states, that >“inactivation of whole-cell catalyst was previously found to be slower than purified enzyme“.
The other approach suggested that our protein was in its oxidised state due to lack of sufficient oxygen exclusion and no addition of reduction reagent to the samples, implying that Carben Intermediat formation is only possible with the reduced Heme group. For this reason, a set of test reactions were performed with the commercially available Dimethylphenylsilan as a replacement of the 4-(dimethylsilyl)-anilin, always requiring custom synthesis. Hereby, we referred to the procedure of >“Lysate-small scale biocatalytic reactions“, mainly differing from the previous experiment by the addition of Dithionite solution as a reducing agent and GC Septum vials as reaction vials. Besides four samples with purified cyt c under various conditions, two samples still contained the whole cell solution.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Model#Off Targeting_-_-_TEXT.html," target. Besides specific target recognition, proteins from the CRISPR-Cas family may also exhibit off-target activity. While offering possibilities to target related variants of antibiotic resistance genes, this off-target activity could also compromise the reliability of a Cas13a-based detection system. We address this problem by employing a recently proposed kinetic model ( Klein et al. 2017 ) to describe the off-target effects of our detection system for a given crRNA. As such, we are able to rank potential crRNAs - derived from our motif finding algorithm - by their reliability. In addition, these modelling efforts revealed a design flaw in one of the crRNAs, guiding the labteam towards the right crRNA sequences to utilize in our experiments.
The kinetic model we used was designed for proteins similar to Cas9, and required adjustment, as Cas13a has interesting properties that the model was not developed for. Cas13a has a seed region central to the spacer ( Abudayyeh et al. 2016 ), while other Cas protein variants, including Cas9, have a 3’-end seed ( Semenova et al. 2011 ). In addition, for Cas13a, a protospacer flanking site (PFS) – a nucleotide 3’ to the target that should not be guanine - is important, rather than a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) - a nucleotide sequence next to the non-target strand of for example Cas9 ( Shmakov et al. 2015 ). This can attributed to the fact that Cas13a detects single strand RNA sequences, rather than double stranded DNA sequences. As a result, we set the model’s energy associated to PAM-binding to 0. The process of target binding with a central seed region is illustrated in Figure 1 below.
Figure 1: Schematic of Cas13a target binding. Unbound Cas13a can encounter an RNA sequence and initiate binding. Matching between the nucleotides of the crRNA spacer and target results in further pairing of the two sequences. Upon complete binding of the crRNA to a matching target, the target is cleaved and Cas13a is activated (and will engage in collateral cleavage).
In the kinetic model, loaded Cas13a can be in a number of states. It can be unbound, have formed $n$ (correct or incorrect) base pairs with a sequence that is being probed, or have cleaved its target substrate, at which point it is also activated. The ratio between the forward and backward rates determines the probability of moving between states and can be"

A growth curve was also performed this week to determine if σ70/BTE in Iq cells would grow normally.  Samples were also collected and spun down for testing on a fatty acid assay and GC.  The results showed that there was no inhibition of growth relative to our control (σ70 without BTE).
Media was also made for toxicity tests of Iq cells in BG-11 with ethanol.  However, ethanol evaporated from the media before tests could be done, invalidating any data that could have been collected.

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," the respondents knew that there ewre enzymes in food and medicine. In addition, quite a few people knew the enzymes could be used in environmental protection due to the risen attention paid to this area.
Application fields known by the participants
Advantages
In most people's opinion, the advantages of biological enzymes were the high efficiency of the production process and the high purity of the product.
Advantages of biological enzyme preparation known by the participants
Products
Survey results showed that the common product as detergent, beer, yogurt and medicine had received more attention in daily life.
Biological enzyme preparation products known by the participants
Safety Consideration
Nearly half chose to believe in the safety of biological enzyme preparations. While the other half said it depended on the situation, and only a tiny minority did not believe in the safety of the enzyme preparation.
Safety consideration of the biological enzyme preparation
According the survey, most of the respondents who didn't fully believe in the safety of biological enzyme preparation were lack of the knowledge and understanding of it.
Reasons for concerns over biological enzyme production
Therefore, we believed that we could increase the public's awareness of biology enzyme preparation by promoting the knowledge of biological enzymes. So that people could gradually trust the safety of enzyme preparation.
Cross analysis between safety consideration and general awareness
Acceptance Degree
This question is based on the question 'Do you believe that the biology enzyme preparation is safe and reliable'. If the respondents didn't take a skeptical attitude towards the biology enzyme preparation, we would raise the question to know more about whether the respondents were really willing to accept and use the products of enzyme preparation. According the survey, we found that more than half of the respondents would like to accept the products, the other said it still depends on the situation. We think the result is quite reasonable and acceptable.
Distribution of degree of acceptance
Impacts on daily life
Only 9% of the respondents hold the view that the biology enzyme preparation has nothing to do with their life. Most of the respondents believed that biological enzymes had a certain effect on their lives. This suggests that the majority of respondents' opinions on this questionnaire are valid and worthy of reference.

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportNaturalityArtificiality_-_-_TEXT.html," in his way to answer it. The test is to establish to what point a machine can pass itself off as a human, in the scope of a discussion with a human. The success of the test is, then, the success for the machine to get the discursive appearance of a human being, succeeding in misleading the human. If I use the word “obsolete” to tell about the question, it is because of the kind of process Turing proposed. Indeed, the realistic imitation of the computer, relying on human failures and mistakes does not answer “directly” to the initial question, or let's say rather, it twists its signification and presuppositions : “could a machine think?” is now become “can we consider a machine as a thinking being”. In other words, the human failure in the qualification process means the success of the machine, now becoming a thinking being.
Picking up that pragmatical model of proof, researchers from the CHELL proposed :
« Their version of life is one that requires individual self-replication, self sustaining systems, and a mechanism that allows for spatio-temporally resolved organisation of information within these systems, though they themselves find this somewhat restrictive [Crowin et. al. 2006]. The equivalent of the Turing test would be one in which the chell was able to interact with natural cells in an appropriate manner so as to be unrecognisable from those same cells. They foresee an ever increasing level of complexity in both their understanding of the cell in its natural environment and their capacity to imitate those processes such that the test for life becomes ever more stringent. »
With the “replication” of the Turing test, the false question from the start is now appearing to our eyes. Indeed, the human process of qualification seems now very related to a certain unreliable perception. Turing's pragmatical approach is, that way, also answering to another question, which is upstream. How can we certify of the “thinking characteristic” of any other thing : machine, human, etc. We have built some cognitive process of recognition of what a “thinking being” is, and, through it, “being able to discuss”. In that perspective, the test is just saying that conditions through which we use to consider something as a thinking being can be fulfilled by a machine. Accepting that, we clearly crossed a huge step : we are forced now to admit that, if a computer can have a discussion with a human such as the human considers that the computer is actually a thinking being (a person), the computer is now a thinking being. In other words,"
NEFU_China,2016,Team:NEFU China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"10 W per gel might be set to ensure an even distribution of heat. The specific settings for electrophoretic runs depend considerably on the apparatus used and its cooling capacity, the length and thickness of the gel, and the acrylamide concentration of the gel. The settings given above can be regarded only as general hints to approach reasonable experimental conditions. For initial runs, it seems advisable to test considerably lower voltage and wattage settings.
