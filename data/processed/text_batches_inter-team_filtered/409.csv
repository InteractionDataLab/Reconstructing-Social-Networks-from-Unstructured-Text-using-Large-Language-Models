RCSB PDB
RCSB PDB (Protein Data Bank) provides the data of structure of protein or other biomolecules. Key feature of data from PDB is structure. NCBI or Uniprot provide the sequence of proteins, but it does not show us their 3D-structures. With the structural similarity between FGF binding domain of FGFR and single chain antibody 16A1, we can ensure that the replacement of FGF binding domain with 16A1 to detect MPT51 is appropriate.

Tools
During our project, we processed much bio-information. It is not easy to process that massive information manually, so we used many bioinformatics tools for our projects. We marked restriction sites to select proper restriction enzyme, searched the nucleotide which codes query peptide sequence to find the coding region of certain genes, virtual-translated given nucleotide sequence to check if our sequence codes expected protein, and predicted and aligned structure of single chain antibodies with FGF binding domain of FGFR to check single chain antibodies are structurally similar to confirm that replacement of FGF binding domain with single chain antibodies is appropriate. We used BioEdit to mark restriction site, BLAST to find the coding region of certain genes and to compare similar proteins, Transeq for virtual-translation, Modeller for structural prediction of single chain antibody, and Matt for structural alignment between single chain antibodies and FGF binding domain of FGFR.
BioEdit
BioEdit is the program for displaying biological sequences. It displays different amino acids or nucleotides in different colors to allow its users to check the change between sequences. It has many simple but useful functions. We used BioEdit for marking the restriction sites on given sequence to select proper restriction enzyme, which does not restrict coding region of gene. Other functions of BioEdit like phylogeny making or front-end of ClustalW are not used in our project, but they are also useful.

BLAST
BLAST is the alignment search tools for protein or nucleotide sequences. There are five modes of BLAST; blastn (nucleotide to nucleotide), blastp (Protein to Protein), blastx (nucleotide to protein), tblastn (protein to nucleotide), and tblastx (translated nucleotide to translated nucleotide). We used tblastn to find the location of coding region of given protein and blastn to"

We   then ran the digests on agarose gels to check the correct size parts   had been obtained. These all showed the expected bands so the   restriction digest had worked.  
We   also had a meeting with our supervisors in which we discussed upcoming   deadlines, London YSB 2.0 planning, Boston travel, outreach and   collaborations and lab work.  
Taylor carried on working on the wiki, creating the template design that the information will then be loaded onto. 
 
Day 29 (06/08/14): 
Today we prepared two agarose gels that we can run a digested limonene synthase plasmid on tomorrow. 
We carried out a transformation of parts BBa_174211 (limonene synthase) and BBa_B0015   (terminator), into competent E.coli cells. We also revitalised our   colonies BBa_J23109 (promoter), BBa_J23119 (promoter) and BBa_B0032   (RBS) transformed cells be replating them.  
We   also compiled an inventory of all of the cells, plasmids, enzymes etc.   that we have in stock, so that we can make/order more before we run   out.  
Taylor also uploaded our wiki template so we can start to upload information onto it. 
A   double restriction digest of limonene synthase plasmids was carried out   using the enzymes EcoR1 and Pst1. These were left to incubate overnight   at room temperature. 
 
Day 30 (07/08/14): 
The digested limonene synthase plasmid was ran on two agarose gels to separate the psb1C3 backbone from the limonene   synthase part. The bands were then visualised and cut out of the gel. A   DNA gel extraction kit was used to extract the DNA from the gel. This   DNA was then stored at -20°C. 
We inoculated cells transformed yesterday with parts  BBa_J23109 (promoter), BBa_J23119 (promoter), BBa_B0032 (RBS), BBa_174211 (limonene synthase) and BBa_B0015 (terminator) in LB and left overnight at 37°C.

Requirement 2: Collaborations with other teams
The UMN collaborated with Wisconsin Lutheran to facilitate a week’s worth of synthetic biology curriculum by sending detailed lesson plans developed by our iGEM team, along with strains of microorganisms used to facilitate trainings. In addition, we participated in Columbia iGEM's low-budget lab exercise, who in turn provided UMN iGEM with an interview with a local environmental health specialist who has extensive knowledge of the mercury contamination problem within Columbia.
Requirement 3: Describing and evaluating questions beyond the bench
The primary goal of UMN iGEM 2014 has been to design a project in line with the major safety, ethics, and intellectual property concerns of both scientists and the public. We took the following steps to address each of these issues:
Safety: Our project gives detailed attention to the prevention of releasing genetically modified bacteria into the environment via encapsulation and the development of several killswitch proposals. The device also includes an activated carbon filter to both collect mercury and prevent release of the bacteria. During an outreach event at 3M we also discussed this filtration element of our device with one of their filtration experts to further inform our safety measures.
Ethics: We have been committed to establishing an open and productive dialogue between UMN iGEM and the public. Our surveying at the State Fair of public opinion on safety and implementation concerns of our device helped to inform our design. We believe there is great ethical importance to involving the community in the design of a device that could potentially be used on their waters. We also developed an interactive game show at the fair to actively engage the public in synthetic biology knowledge. Our dialogue with the public has also included our outreach program at local schools, the Science Museum of Minnesota, and various STEM fairs allowing us to develop a dynamic dialogue with both children and their parents. The program focuses on the understanding of DNA in order to demystify the basic principles behind synthetic biology. It is our hope that a more solid understanding of these principles may help to familiarize children with biotechnological tools and decrease misconceptions about the nature of DNA manipulation. We hope this may help to develop an informed future community of consumers and constituents to facilitate open dialogues between scientists and the public. Finally, we interviewed various experts in bioethics and scientific fields related to our project to help further inform ourselves and give essential background to"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.

After a short break, we were ready to have our talks, starting with Team Leuven and their idea to use pulsating cells as biosensors for drug monitoring.
Next was Team Munich with their novel way of using CRISPR Cas13a as a biosensor to diagnose a range of infectious diseases.
Team Paris IONIS presented us their very hands-on (and also very French) approach to protect vineyards from extreme weather conditions caused by global warming. In addition, they assured      us that their project is also adaptable to other crops and vegetables.
The team from Amsterdam had an interesting talk about their modification of cyanobacteria to have an improved day and night cycle and engineering it to be able to produce fumarate,      an important bulk chemical. Their “super cyanobacterium” will be able to use CO2 as its sole carbon source to reduce and even reverse the oil industries impact on the environment.
Last but not least, we listened to the very inspiring presentation of iGEM Leuven`s PI Johan Swinnen, who explained what it means to be a scientist from his personal live as a      cancer researcher. On his long journey to Santiago de Compostela he raised awareness and funds for victims of cancer.
After a plentiful dinner and short poster session with valuable feedback about our talks and posters from the other attending teams we were ready to go back home.

Lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, can live up to several months ( Tough and Sprent, 1995 ). Our detection window could be further increased in the future if we moved away from detected doping DNA in plasma and isolated white blood cells instead.
Microdosing was determined to be the best doping method for doping athletes. The benefit of this method is that it avoids detection through the biological passport. Assuming that the athlete begins the treatment prior to becoming a professional athlete and continues microdosing during, their red blood cell count would appear to be constant and naturally high.
Figure 22. Effect of EPO gene doping using IM microdosing on red blood cell count. The initial dose is 96 billion vectors followed by smaller doses of 27 billion vectors every 20 days. The black horizontal lines are the range of EPO concentrations found in healthy adults. The red line indicates the red blood cell count at which the risk of stroke to due blood clot becomes significant.
Comparison of a Large Single Dose and Microdosing for IM and IV Administration
The red blood cell production model is combined with the compartment and infection model to determine the effects on EPO gene doping on red blood cell count. Intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) injection are compared, and two methods for gene doping are tested. The first consists of a single large injection while the second consists of a large initial dose followed by smaller doses every 20 days.
Large Single Dose Gene Doping
Figure 23. Comparison of intravenous (a) and intramuscular injection (b) at day 0 on red blood cell production. The black line is the total EPO (doping and natural) present in the blood over time. The red line is the number of red blood cells in circulation over time. The black horizontal dashed lines indicates the natural range of EPO levels. The red horizontal dashed line indicates the red blood cell count at which the risk of stroke due to a blood clot becomes significant. In (a), 94 billion Ad5 vectors containing the EPO doping gene are injected at day 0. In (b), 141 billion Ad5 vectors are required to achieve the same EPO and red blood cell production as the IV injection.

As of October 2013, there are 42 groups declared worldwide and 3353 members on DIYbio Google group mailing list.
Competitors
Market reaction
Open-source/DIY
Example: IO rodeo Most likely group to be affected initially by the Darwin Toolbox entry into the market. Like our start-up, small companies typically struggle to compete with regards resources and reach. However they may be possible sources of collaboration instead of competition.
Global Biotechnology Companies
Example: Bio-rad This group is unlikely to be affected in the first couple years. As their products are currently sold in mass quantities and with restricted accessibility to individuals, they don't currently reach Darwin Toolbox's target market. They may react to youGEM's entry by making their products better towards individuals.
Specialised Companies (e.g. forensics)
Example: Sirchie Similar to global companies, this group is unlikely to be immediately affected initially as it is well established. However as this group target a niche market, they may later be challenged by Darwin Toolbox's broader scope.
Competitor Analysis
There are no direct competitors who provide an alternative to our product. Our competition is more indirect and falls into three broad categories: companies offering laboratory equipment hardware kits, laboratory equipment supply and educational biotechnology kits. We assessed our product in comparison to other companies by the following criteria, and the results can been seen in the table below.
Competitor Analysis Criteria
Affordability
How cheap is the technology? How much does shipping cost?
User-friendly
How easy is the technology to use?
Completeness
Is it an all-in-one solution?
Convenience
Does the company ship internationally? Is it pre-manufactured or does it require assembly?
Brand strength
How easy is the product to find? How much does it push the market forwards? How reliable is the reputation?
Marketing Plan
Stakeholder outreach and product promotion routes
•Existing market groups –DIYbio: existing DIYbio spaces, mailing lists, Makerfaires, social media –iGEM HS: directly via iGEM HQ, including discount or promotion for registered iGEM teams –Schools: science education networks (STEM and PsiComm), educational funding bodies (BBSRC) –University Students: university representatives, advertise via iGEM teams, word of mouth –Field Researchers: targeted via specific case studies, academic journal advertising
•New markets, “mainstream” citizen scientists
Initially, we aim to target technophilic people, e.g. parents who want to do science with their children.

IPTG inducible CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA targeted to rRNA Forward
This part was designed using the code generated by Dr Daniel Pass in order to interrogate the E.Coli 16S rRNA locus for appropriate Cas9 target sites.
The sequence is below has the Forward guide sequence and the General Scaffold sequences highlighted.
This was synthesised as an IDT gBlock as a single fragment and we aimed to directly clone this fragment into pSB1C3 using EcoRI and PstI. However we were unable to identify a clone with the correct sequence. Therefore this aspect of the project will continue during future related research.

We took an E.coli codon-optimised version of Cas9 from the registry ( BBa_K1774001 ) and added the nucleotide changes to bring about the D10A and H840 amino acid alterations that remove nuclease activity.

BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"We also assisted with high school lab trainings and the Biobuilder Panel. During the high school lab training, members from our team hosted and taught a group of high school students basic laboratory skills and synthetic biology protocols. We demonstrated pipetting, plating cells, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols. The Biobuilder Panel was an event hosted in LabCentral for local high school STEM educators in order to better incorporate synthetic biology into the current science curriculum. We participated in a discussion of undergraduates performing research in the field of synthetic biology. Our team shared our iGEM research project to illustrate a current project aimed to assist synthetic biologist.
Northeastern iGEM (NEGEM)
In order to engage with the iGEM community, our team collaborated with the BostonU team to organize and host the Northeastern iGEM Meetup (NEGEM) on July 6, 2018. The BostonU, BostonU Hardware, Harvard, MIT, and UConn teams gathered at NEGEM to present their current projects and progress, as well as share and receive advice among teams. We provided feedback forms for all teams per presentation in order make it easier for comments and questions to be recorded and used to improve the presentations and projects.
Our team gave a twenty minute presentation introducing the applications of microfluidics in synthetic biology and our project, TERRA, to our fellow iGEM teams, most of whom had not been exposed to the field of microfluidics prior. We explained the general workflow of manufacturing and testing microfluidic devices, as well as discussed the impact of our project to the microfluidic industry and greater scientific community. We then received feedback on our presentation and answered questions regarding the function and applicability of TERRA. The general consensus was that our presentation on microfluidics as a field was clear, but there were questions of how sterile microfluidic chips were and the cost of our system. We incorporated this feedback to our project by creating a sterilization protocol and a cost analysis of our system.
Overall, NEGEM provided an opportunity for iGEM teams to discuss collaborations and obtain valuable feedback and advice from fellow teams and team mentors to further projects.
On July 20, 2018, our team had the opportunity to speak to research scientists at Fraunhofer Center of Manufacturing Innovation. One of Fraunhofer CMI's interests is integrating microfluidics with biomedical engineering to produce diagnostic devices. During our visit, we presented our work on TERRA and discussed the role it would play in the field of microfluidics. The scientists at Fraunho"

Exeter,2017,Team:Exeter#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"_sfGFP is expressed and does give rise to fluorescence. According to standard curves made in the lab on the same equipment and settings, we produced a 130 ng/ml concentration of sfGFP in the sample.
Figure 4: These data from an image stream show the fluorescence profile for wild-type (left) BL21(DE3) and BL21(DE3) with T7_FimH_225sfGFP (right).The wild type demonstrates no significant fluorescence, while same cell with the single plasmid insert shows a strong fluorescent signal in the highlighted portion of cells.
Figure 5: Data from Amnis ImageStream TMX show the fluorescence profile for individual cells of BL21(DE3) with T7_FimH_225_sfGFP. Due to the limitations arising from the magnification, the image stream can not be used to locate where the fluorescent protein resides.
These results show that a number of cells in the overall culture produced strong fluorescence. This fluorescence suggests successful folding of the sfGFP which can be taken as evidence by proxy of FimH folding. The result also suggests that sfGFP is able to move through the pore formed during pilus biosynthesis. Moving on from this result, we were confident that the fusion of metal binding domains to the FimH protein would not negatively affect pilus formation as our chosen domains, and other potentials that may make up a modular toolkit, were smaller than sfGFP .
Figure 6: Western blot of BL21 WT and BL21 with our T7-FimH_225_GFP construct, 1-5: sfGFP, BL21 WT soluble fraction, BL21 WT pellet, BL21 with T7-FimH_225_GFP solluble fraction, BL21 with T7-FimH_225_GFP pellet.
The Western-Blot indicated that FimH-225_sfGFP was mainly in the cytoplasm but to determine whether any proportion of expressed FimH-225sfGFP was exported from the cell and forming pili, TEM with immunogold labelling was attempted.
Figure 7: Pictured here are two wild type BL21(DE3) cells which should not contain the sfGFP antigen in their FimH proteins. A few gold particles are visible in these micrographs, though they can likely be attributed to non-specific binding.
Figure 8: In contrast, when BL21(DE3) in transformed with T7_FimH_225_sfGFP, it appears to specifically bind the gold particles as shown. The images suggest successful expression and export of these"

Protocol
The SDS polyacrylamide gels are prepared in the so-called PerfectBlue™ Twin Double Gel System.
After ensuring that the equipment is waterproof, the 12% (or 18%) running gel is mixed and filled                     into the chamber. Pipetting about 1 ml of H2O on top of the running gel to seal the gel.
After polymerization, the remaining H2O is removed and the 12% stacking gel is filled on                     top. Insert                     a comb to create sample pockets.
After the stacking gel also polymerized, 1 x running buffer is used to run the Double Gel System via                     the SDS gel.
After loading the generated pockets with the samples, the stacking gel is run at 100 V and then                     running gel at 120 V.

Problem: a lighter-than-air balloon
To be a useful tool, the bioballoon must be made of something (membranes), it must inflate (float), and it must do something (sensors). In the float sub-project, we aimed to show that it was plausible to use biological means to produce the hydrogen gas that our balloon would require to inflate. Towards this end, we used the naturally gas-producing algal species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. To read about this project, and see a latex balloon inflate with this bio-produced gas, see the gas production sub-project page."
Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," it is exposed to light. To better understand this system a model was constructed.
As a final biocontainment, we envisioned BeeT to depend on the presence of an artificial amino acid. Such a system had already been constructed 12 . We tried to improve this system , causing Cas9 to degrade DNA when the bacteria run out of synthetic amino acid.
Real-world Functionality
To be effective, BeeT has to be able to survive in the beehive. To make sure it does, we modeled the dynamics of the bacterium. Lastly, to assess the applicability of BeeT in a real-world scenario, we created a new module for the 'beehave' model 13 . The BEEHAVE model assesses population dynamics and foraging of honey bees. The newly constructed module includes BeeT in the model, giving information on what real-life factors influence its effectiveness.

Designing Life with Synthetic Biology
The Powerhouse is the largest branch of the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences in Sydney, Australia. The Macquarie University iGEM team have an ongoing relationship with the Powerhouse Museum who have devoted a section of their rotating science collection to synthetic biology, iGEM and other related materials. These contributions have exposed large numbers of people who visit the museum annually (approximately 64,000) to synthetic biology and the important contributions that the iGEM teams have made to this novel field.
In early September the Macquarie iGEM team were lucky enough to have their associated professors Dr Natalie Curach and Professor Ian Paulsen discuss their Hydrogen synthesis project at the ‘Designing Life with Synthetic Biology’ event hosted by the Powerhouse Museum. Their project was used as an example of how design principles in combination with molecular biology techniques can be utilized to address real world problems, such as clean and renewable energy production. Dr Curach also taught the audience a bit about the iGEM competition and the contributions that iGEM researchers have made over the past thirteen years.
Given the novel nature of synthetic biology, many members of the community have not been exposed to this field of science and experience a feeling limited understanding and awareness. This frequently leads to the generation of misconception and fear, which is often fuelled by distortion of synthetic biology in the media. iGEM maintains a rich tradition of fostering safe and ethical research in the field of synthetic biology. This was highlighted in Professor Paulsen and Dr Curach’s talk as they aimed to improve the publics perception of synthetic biology, encourage inquiry and contribute towards a positive evaluation of the field."

Un médicament « classique » est distribué dans l’organisme en fonction de ses propriétés physico-chimiques :
- pKa,
- Lipophilie,
- Kd (fixation aux protéines).
En revanche, un médicament « vectorisé » est distribué dans l’organisme en fonction des propriétés de son vecteur :
- Taille du vecteur,
- Lipophilie du vecteur,
- Charge globale du vecteur,
- Stabilité du vecteur,
- Immunogénicité du vecteur.
Sa distribution, donc sa biodisponibilité n’est plus la même. Or la biodisponibilité agit directement sur l’efficacité et la toxicité d’un principe actif. Si l’on concentre la dose injectée en un endroit, on obtient une meilleure efficacité que si l’on dilue cette dose dans un organisme entier.
Ainsi, un médicament vectorisé, n’étant pas distribué de la même manière n’a pas la même efficacité ni la même toxicité qu’un médicament « classique ».
Dans le cas d’un médicament « vectorisé », on s’affranchie de la distribution naturelle du médicament. On permet le ciblage du principe actif sur sa cible, et la concentration de la dose sur la surface d’intérêt. On augmente ainsi l’efficacité tout en diminuant la toxicité.

Mais de quelque nature qu’il soit, le réservoir à pour fonction le stockage et la protection du principe actif.

Even more, experienced users will take advantage of learning how to submit files to the iGEM wiki server, how to reference stylesheets or other files in the Mediawiki interface and how iframes can be useful to simulate the useful templates used in the Mediawiki interface. The tutorial consists of 3 videos which sum up to 2 hours of tutorial. We encourage inexperienced students to go through this videos in an ordered way, but it is not a requisite because each video can be understood by itself. Therefore, more experienced users can get the most out of this tutorial jumping directly to their topics of interest to learn more about the iGEM wiki interface. A brief description of the topics covered in each video can be found below. The tutorial consists also of a GitHub repository where the examples used in each video are stored so that the students can reproduce what is done in each video and get hands-on experience. The final version of each example is also provided in order to let more experienced users navigate quickly through the code.
Important notes
Note that the videos forming this tutorial are stored on the Youtube channel of our team instead of the iGEM server. The examples are also stored in the Github repository of our team. iGEM recommends storing all the information of iGEM projects in the iGEM server or the iGEM Github account because it is the only way to make sure that this information is available through the subsequent years. However, files uploaded to the iGEM server must be less than 100MB of size. This would not allow us to provide videos of the minimum length to teach one concept and with a decent resolution. Doing so is considered a form of cheating in the iGEM competition, but we made sure to be under equal conditions to other teams by uploading all the material of this tutorial before the wiki freeze deadline.
In addition, the wiki and GitHub freeze implies that users can not modify any of the contents after a certain date. By storing all the videos and examples in external servers which we are able to control we are able to incorporate the feedback we receive and improve this material. This way, we will be able to create erratum files or notes providing additional information for each video both in the description in the Youtube video and the Github repository. Therefore, storing the tutorial outside the iGEM server will make possible for us to maintain it.
Note that the audio of the videos is in the Spanish language for the moment due to time limitations. We will upload"

Abstract
Mosquito intelligence terminator(MIT)
Fig. 1. Mosquito Intelligent Terminator has three functions: (1) Cry weapon (2) Low-temperature release system (3) Population control system
The  Mosquito Intelligent Terminator (MIT) is designed and optimized to be an ecological and environmental friendly mosquito pesticide. MIT is an  engineered E. coli secreting crystal proteins isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis to kill mosquito larvae, or commonly known as wrigglers. These crystal  proteins are toxic to certain types of mosquitoes  only and are not pathogenic to mammals.  We designed a temperature-dependent genetic  circuit expressing high levels of crystal proteins at room temperature only,  thus production does not occur at incubation temperature. In order to make an  environmentally safe insecticide, our design also incorporates a genetic circuit  controlling the population size of E. coli, thus a surplus will never exist as E.  coli population is self-maintained within the system. This intelligent  terminator is not limited to mosquitos only, as the intelligent terminator system can be custom fitted with  different cry genes to other insect species. Currently, with more than one  hundred crystal proteins targeting various insect species, our design may  potentially serve as a promising pest control solution in the future.

Our third SynBio Club event took place on August 15th and was focused on the use of synthetic biology to create a live virus. As well, this SynBio debated the ethics and morals involved with using synthetic biology, and our responsibilities as scientists to communicate our research. This presentation focused on a paper that was able to use techniques, that we commonly use through QGEM, to synthesize a live and infectious horsepox virus using elements of modern vaccinia virus. The researchers in the paper divided the DNA into ten fragments with overlapping segments, and then ligated the sequences together. They activated the virus by using cells that were already infected with Shobe Fibroma virus (SFV), creating the necessary environment that was capable of assembling the virus fragments together. The research paper noted that this strain could be used as a vaccine against smallpox in humans. It showed less virulence and harmful effects in mice, with also providing vaccine protection. Following the presentation on the paper, the group discussed whether this was a safety concern for the public, the dangers behind the ability to create a live virus, and the accessibility of DNA for synthetic biology practices.

Iain George
Biological Sciences (2nd Year Masters)
This is my second year on our iGEM team at the University of Calgary.  I am a master student in biological sciences at the U of C. My research is in investigating how RNA-binding proteins act to regulate various genes at the post-transcriptional level. Previously, I worked as a member of the Biofilm Research Group at the U of C, studying how bacterial biofilms could be applied to bioremediate environmentally contaminated sites. When I am not living/sleeping/supervising in the lab, you may find me in the mountains surrounding Calgary hiking and trying my hand at photography.

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0v, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in parallel with the LED to reduce the voltage across"

Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Template:NotebookDataJuly2_-_-_TEXT.html,"'s PCR was done in a single tube, while all the others were done in a strip.
However, in addition to the expected band at approximately 300 bp, the bands for our ultramers was extremely streaky, indicating that there may be other contaminants. We decided to perform a PCR purification of these samples, using our protocols , and see if there was an improvement in the gel.
Gel of our product after PCR purification
Even after the gel purification, our bands were streaky. We decided to redo the PCR, placing all the reactions in single tubes, performing a touchdown PCR instead. Our annealing temperature started at 70*, repeated for 2 cycles, and then decreased 2*, every two cycles, until it reached 58* (the optimal annealing temperature), where it remained until the 25 cycles were complete. We left this PCR going overnight. (See July 13th for the gel image.)
PCR of expression plasmid cross-junction
We also performed a second PCR on colony nine (the colony we decided with which we decided to proceed) to confirm that our omega+zif268 in the spec backbone was successfully inserted into the E. coli. The expected product was the cross-junction on the plasmid, approximately 1.4 kb. We used the same recipe as that used on July 9th, except with a forward primer of PZE23G-3581 F and a reverse primer of PZE23G-2133 R, and had a 55* annealing temperature and an extension time of 45 seconds.
After running an e-gel, we confirmed that our w+zif268 was inserted into the plasmid.
Lane 3: Gel of our PCR to check for the cross-junction in colony 9.
PCR and gel extraction of omega subunit
We performed a PCR to get out the omega subunit+linker, with an annealing temperature of 56* and an extension time of 15 seconds. The miniprep from colony 8 was the template DNA. We will use the product in assembling our final expression plasmids.
We determined that the PCR was successful after running the sample on an agarose gel, and performed a gel extraction so that we could use the product in our isothermal assembly.

Idea
One of EOR methods by chemical injection is surfactant injection. The need of biodegradable and environmental friendly surfactant is important. One of biosurfactant is rhamnolipid, but it’s naturally produced by opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, ITB_Indonesia designs GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) bacteria, E. coli, to be able to produce rhamnolipid in a controllable and observable manner.
Using certain autoinduction media, rhamnolipid production is controlled by glucose-lactose composition in media. By utilizing glucose first, E. coli can grow without producing rhamnolipid. After glucose exhaustion, lactose can be utilized to induce rhamnolipid production. While producing, a chromoprotein reporter will be turned on and turn E. coli into observable colour. When lactose is depleted and no rhamnolipid is produced, E. coli will revert into being colourless, thus making observation much easier for further induction. E. coli is also controlled to not produce rhamnolipid when no lactose is present.
Rhamnolipid will be released into medium, making separation much easier. Only centrifugation is necessary. The medium supernatant containing rhamnolipid can be used for EOR.
This rhamnolipid-producing E. coli is called RHAMCOLIPID.

PAtpI in pSB1C3 ( BBa_K1930005 )
The promoter PAtpI has its origin in Bacillus subtilis. It is   responsible for the expression of atpA gene (ATP synthesis) during the first 30   min of the germination of B. subtilis (Sinai et al. 2015) . atpA gene is part of an operon atpI-atpB-atpE-atpF-atpH-atpA-atpG-atpD-atpC, therefore the promoter region in front of the first protein coding gene (atpI) in this operon was chosen. The region was checked for the binding of sigma factors and   transcription factors with DBTBS . No   binding factors were found with the highest significance level. In our   project we wanted to find a constitutive promoter for our ciprofloxacin   resistance casette. In the following part we put the promoter PAtpI in the   pSB1C3 backbone to make it available to other iGEM teams.
PCR
Experiment:
06/10/16: The promoter PAtpI was amplified (see PCR protocol ) from the    ciprofloxacin resistance cassette BioBrick BBa_K1930004 ) with the primers pATPI+prefix and pATPI+suffix (primer sequences can be    found here ). The    correct size of 372 bp for the PCR product was checked with DNA   electrophoresis. The PCR product was stored at 4°C.
PCR mixture:
50 μl PCR assay was performed according to the following protocol .
DNA Electrophoresis:
For detailed information on how to prepare and run agarose gel see    following protocol .
Figure 1. DNA electrophoresis with amplified PAtpI promoter     sequence 372 bp in size.
Conclusion:
The PAtpI promoter was successfully amplified with prefix and suffix    from the plasmid.
Procedure after gel validation:
PCR product was subsequently cleaned with PCR Purification Kit –    Jena Bioscience .
Restriction digestion
Experiment:
07/10/16: The PAtpI was cut with EcoRI and PstI. The backbone pSB1C3 (BBa_J04450) was digested with the same enzymes. This construct is carrying RFP reporter therefore it was used for easier screening after transformation. You could see self-ligations"

Transcribed brainstorming with Traci, Robert, Orit, and the lab. Created paper and Balsamiq prototypes of the MoClo Planner.
20Jun 2012
Finished transcribing the Beast Bu Plotbox audio and uploaded to Dropbox. Did some more research on Eugene - found a general guide to installation and opening (Chris Voigt's book) and some resources for when we acquire Eugene, which we can't because SourceForge seems to be down. But if we get it we can start learning to make it and compile with the dl and example files. Visualization Brainstorm crowdsourcing for the data sheets - could we have curated data entry that's voted on by the community, rather than done by anyone with an account?
21Jun 2012
Looking into Eugene script examples and documentation. I wonder if there's a way to automate the definition and declaration of various properties, parts, and devices? Writing it all out by hand would definitely by extremely time-consuming. Nahum and I started drafting a list of parts and properties based on the BU wetlab project and the Weber MoClo paper. Kathy, Nahum, and I started developing a paper prototype of the MoClo Planner based on Traci's feedback on the Balsamiq prototype. We also showed this to Orit tog et her feedback, and she gave us several helpful pointers as well. We wrapped up by putting the prototype on a free whiteboard with notes and postits below each.
22Jun 2012
Started implementing the MoClo planner, laying down the XML code for the program's structure in Visual Studio. The ideas were familiar but the syntax was different enough to be initially very frustrating, but things went a lot better as the day went along! Nahum and I managed to create the layouts for three different pages: the level 0 module parts selection page, the level 1 shutter in which selected level 0 parts are assembled into level 1 modules, and the level 2 shutter in which level 1 modules are assembled into level 2 modules.  Databinding is still rather unclear but seems like a useful tool for incorporating flexibility into our program, definitely bears looking into. We now have stepped up form paper prototypes, but so far it's all just window dressing. Next work is when we start working on functionality, and oh boy! Just looking at Eugene scares me, not to mention reading up on SBOL as well. And C#! It should be a very intense, information-dense week.

In order to prove the function of this receptor in yeast cell, another plasmid with our reporter device, pRS42K-mRFP-CYC1t, was transformed into CEN.PK2-1C, More details about this part of work will be displayed in host website transduction and detection .
The sense device, BBa_2368007 and BBa_2368008, was expressed successfully in the host yeast. Once the receptor can respond the presence of sweeteners, the mRFP will be expressed as output. (Fig. 13)
Fig. 14  A simplified model of the αpheromone pathway with T1R2/T1R3
Following the above, we separately added a list of sweeteners like fructose, sucrose, glucose into the culture to detect the red fluorescence intensity based on whether its regulatory interaction with sweet taste receptor T1R2-T1R3.
So we selected two sweeteners, fructose and sucrose, for the first testing.
Firstly, we selected a single cell clone of CEN.PK2-1C with the circuits mentioned previously and cultured this clone in SD medium with 2% glucose and corresponding concentration of antibiotic G418 at 30℃ overnight.
After harvesting cells, we centrifuged the cells and added new SD medium with 2% galactose and antibiotic G418 for inducing the expression of T1R2 and T1R3. Incubated at 30℃ for 12 hours.
Then added sweeteners into culture according to Table 1

After adding sweeteners, we used plate reader to measure the fluorescence intensity and OD600, calculated the value of fluorescence intensity/ OD600 as the  mean fluorescence intensity at the single cell level. The mean fluorescence intensity is showed in Fig.15.
Fig. 15 The mean fluorescence intensity of experimental group and control group after 12, 16 hours
As the picture shows, the fructose group and sucrose group established obvious increase compared to control group from 12h to 16h.
The red fluorescence intensity at the single cell level all increased, but the sucrose group and fructose group increased faster than control group, which meant adding sweeteners indeed accelerated the fluorescence protein production in"

Introduction to Synechocystis sp.
Synthetic biology and the domestication of microorganisms
Despite the significant progress that has been achieved in manipulating genetic circuits and devices, the application of synthetic biology methods and techniques needs to be widened to a larger group of microorganisms in order to fully reach its potential. Rather than struggling with the limitations of the available commercial chassis, scientist should have the ability to truly select an organism for a specific task that best suits the user needs.  In order to allow researchers to edit, rewrite and repurpose genetic circuits, one must first standardize and characterize biological parts, such as promoters, ribosome binding sites, coding sequences, terminators as well as other regulatory elements but selecting an appropriate assembly standard is also part of doing it in a fast, efficient, and affordable manner (Ramey et al. 2015).
Synechocystis and its role in synthetic biology
Aside from the biofuels and added-value chemicals that cyanobacteria have been shown to produce, Synechocystis exhibits traits that could make it useful as an industrial biotechnology strain, as it prefers growth temperatures between 30–34 °C and has a doubling time of 7–10 h under intermediate light conditions (Stevan C. Albers et al. 2015). Several strategies have been applied to manage metabolic burden in heterologous systems. Accurate control of gene expression via promoter engineering, control over transcription factors turnover number and codon optimization have shown to be essential components when managing the adverse conditions generated during product formation (Albers et al. 2015). It wasn’t until 2011 that cyanobacteria engineering seemed to be resurging, when a broad-host-range cyanobacteria BioBrick shuttle vector, pPMQAK1, was made available. The latter seems to show that lack of well characterized parts and plasmids, as well as the community’s disarray in adopting standards seem to be among the causes preventing non-model organisms from being widely used (Huang et al. 2010).

Two cultures were grown for 12 hours at 37°C and 200 RPM, and the mixture was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature prior to testing. Both lasers are used to excite both sfGFP and mRFP.
Fig. 4 Two repetitions were selected and the results showed no obvious green fluorescence.
Fig. 5 Two replicates were selected after addition of the inducer and the results showed no obvious red fluorescence.
The result shows no obvious fluorescence. We changed some conditions, such as lowering the temperature, adjusting the rotation speed, adjusting the time, etc. But we still did not get the expected results. We consulted the teacher and the teacher replied that there might be weak fluorescence but our instrument couldn't detect it.
Other Improved parts
We also improved other parts in our genetic circuit, such as BBa_K2557000 and BBa_K2557007.
BBa_K2557000 is improved from BBa_K2446055, which is the synNotch coding part designed by Fudan iGEM 2017 . BBa_K2557007 is the coding sequence of TP901 recombinase, designed by Peking iGEM 2017(BBa_K2243000).
This year's Improvement parts standard stipulates that comparative experiments must be conducted, but the two parts, BBa_K2557000 and BBa_K2557007, we did not characterize their original part, so we did not use them as an improvement part.

Providing them with the take home message of not throwing pharmaceuticals in the sink or flushing them down
What the audience asked and/or what we learnt:
General questions on our project
How can we discard pharmaceuticals safely?
How to engage an audience with explaining a complex process in very simple and understandable terms
Learning about our knowledge gaps and how to tackle the problem in providing the audience with answers
KTH opportunities fund, workshop
Being receivers of the KTH Opportunities Fund, we were invited to a workshop together with other receivers of financial support from KTH Opportunities Fund. The different projects were presented by each of the recipients, and we got the opportunity to record a movie about the project. We also got valuable information on how the KTH Opportunities Fund work, and the possibilities about becoming a KTH alumni in the future. It was a great success for us as a student group to receive financial support, and it was also a great confirmation for us that our project is thought to be feasible and successful.
SU synthetic biology course
We were invited by Samuel Flores from Stockholm University to give a presentation about our project. Our audience were students taking an introductory course in synthetic biology and 3D molecular modelling. It was the first time we presented our project to an audience with students that are well informed in what synthetic biology and iGEM are. They were very engaged with our idea and interested in our solution as well as the concepts of iGEM. We talked with Samuel about future educational collaborations and the promotion of iGEM at Stockholm University.
The Crastina conference in Eskilstuna 2018
The Crastina conference is a meeting of the Crastina community, which is a collection of people working within science communication. Our team was invited to the conference after speaking to the founder Olle Bergman at the Nordic iGEM Conference in Lund.
We spoke about iGEM from a communication perspective:
What kind of information we want to convey - who are iGEM Stockholm? What is our aim?
The team’s demographics
Tools that we use
How we handle the ”social media relay” which happens each year
The “social media relay” refers to the inherited social media account that can only be used during the time that the team is active. The year after, it will be given to the next year’s team which could mean that the interest for the page could fluctuate due to different ways of using it.
Since everyone attending the conference had different experiences within communication in science, the central part of the conference was to share"
SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Antitumor action_-_-_TEXT.html," tumor suppressors.
The COSMIC project from Sanger institute allowed us to determine which genes to bring to the therapeutic plasmid in the non-small cell lung cancer case. This project sums up all detected mutations for each type of cancer in function of their appearance frequency. So, from their data, the loss of apoptotic capacity of tumor cells for lung cancer can be due to the functional loss of proteins from the following genes :
These different genes play a predominant role in the application of the apoptotic process and are the most susceptible to be mutated in the lung cancer case. They compose the therapeutic plasmid .
Back to top
The objective
The objective of this study is to check if a wild type version of a tumor suppressor gene inside the tumor cell, for which the own version is mutated, induce or not the apoptotic phenomenon.
Experimental approach
Cancer cell line and reported gene
Cancer cell lines, which have a mutation of tumor suppressor gene has been selected from our database. We also possess a wild type version of the TP53 gene. Then we choose the prostatic cancer p53 mutated DU-145 in the goals to test if bringing the wild type version of the p53 protein (p53wt) in the DU-145 cell line allows to induce the apoptotic process.
Cell culture protocol :
Take out  ampoule from liquid nitrogen
Place the ampoule in 37°C water bath for 5 minutes
In a 50 ml Falcon tube, put 9 ml of 10% MEM + 1 ml of ampoule
Harvest 5 min at 1200 rpm
Discard the supernatant without touching pellet cells (DMSO elimination)
Resuspend pellet in 1 ml of media
Put the suspension in a new T25 containing 5 ml of media
Incubate at 37°C
Do not forget to change the media the day after to eliminate all DMSO traces
One week later, cells are at 100% confluence

Recruiting interacting protein domain and ligand on fusion membrane protein could help organize each component in order.

Fluorescence Complementation Assay
To prove that our membrane protein equipped with those interacting protein could assemble with each other, we conducted fluorescence complementation assay.
In fluorescence complementation assay, proteins that are postulated to interact are fused to unfolded complementary fragments of EGFP and expressed in E.coli. Interaction of these proteins will bring the fluorescent fragments within proximity, allowing the reporter protein to reform in its native three-dimensional structure and emit its fluorescent signal. We have constructed two split EGFP domains, Part:BBa_K771113 and Part:BBa_K771114 , respectively for 1EGFP and 2EGFP.
EGFP was split into two halves, named 1EGFP and 2EGFP respectively. If there is interaction between two proteins which were fused with 1EGFP and 2EGFP, it is expected that fluorescence should be observed. Otherwise, no fluorescence could be observed. The membrane proteins, which we call  Membrane Anchors, are registered as Part:BBa_K771002 , Part:BBa_K771003 , Part:BBa_K771004 , Part:BBa_K771005 , named Membrane Anchor 2 without MS2, Membrane Anchor 2,Membrane Anchor 3, Membrane Anchor 4 without VVD respectively.
Fig.6 :Group 1, 2, 3 are designed to test the interaction of SH3domain & ligand, PDZdomain & ligand and GBDdomain & ligand respectively. Proteins within each group were coexpressed in E.coli. If there exists interaction within membrane proteins of each group, we expected to observe green fluorescence in E.coli. Control group is expected to show much weaker fluorescence.
Proteins within each group are coexpressed in E.coli. L-arabinose is not added into culture media until OD value of bacteria culture reaches 0.6. Bacteria are induced at L-Arabinose concentration of 0.2% for 6 hours. Bacteria samples are smeared onto glass slide and observed under laser confocal microscope.

The coding sequences for mcpS and  for PA2652 have been codon optimised using our codon optimisation software, so that sequence is codon optimised for E. coli and B. subtilis. However we do realise that B. subtilis is Gram-positive bacterium and therefore is not compatible with mcpS and PA2652 receptors. We exploit terminator embedded in the backbone vector pSB1C3 for termination of transcription.  In addition, modularity of our system is ensured by putting 15bp insulator sequence between the RBS and the promoter. This sequence was specifically designed to make the promoter interchangeable without affecting the RBS strength and therefore translation initation rate is not affected by changing a different promoter in front of the insulator sequence. This allows us to change the promoter strength simply by changing promoter without modifying the whole genetic construct, thus it improves modularity of the construct. The insulator sequence acts as a starting point for PCR and it can be used to amplify the receptor sequence without the promoter.
Root uptake of both E. coli and the bakers’s yeast S. cerevisiae can be observed in the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana and in tomato plants. It is a process that occurs naturally (althought it yet remains to be observed in soil) and we do not need to incorporate additional genes into our design.

Current therapies
Current medicines [1]
Medicines are chemical or biological entities containing at least one active principle and act on a target tissue to treat it.
In the common language, a medicine is a substance delivered to correct, modify or restore a function in the organism.
In a chemical point of view, a medicine is a molecule that interacts with a molecular target. The binding modifies target properties, which give rise to a cell response. That is responsible for the benefits and side effects of a medicine.
Most current medicines target a protein. Proteins are necessary for organism survival and their dysfunction conduct to a lot of diseases. Nowadays, several proteins can be engineered to be used to treat a large number of diseases due to weak protein.
For cancer treatment, medicines act as inhibitors of mitosis. The toxicity selectivity of cytotoxic medicines is based on the higher mitosis activity of cancerous cells, which make them a preferential target. Selectivity is an important notion to evaluate a medicine. In fact, any medicine is really specific. Therefore, normal tissues with rapid renewal are also often damaged: epitheliums, bone marrow, and gonad.
It is essential to well-define a medicine. Among other properties, we have to study bioavaibility and resorption speed of a medicine. Bioavaibility may be incomplete due to different phenomenons as physico-chemistry characteristics or the intestine, hepatic or lung bypass.
The speed at which the drug is eliminated is also an important parameter for all administration routes without the intravenous route. The delay before the observation of the first (therapeutic or unwanted) effects of the drug also depends on this speed. Moreover, the existence of a biological rhythm is often neglected in the evaluation of their elimination. But, pharmacological medicine properties are closely linked to the phenomenon of temporality of the medicinal product. Several complementary and important concepts should be considered: systemic absorption speed and toxicity threshold.
Major problems facing these therapies are"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of ammonia concentration to the user’s mobile phone during the detection process.
Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive.

Team member Elias introduces the BioMembranes component of the project
The challenge of a biological membrane
The functionality of a balloon for any purpose is dependent upon the lift it can generate and the lifespan of its membrane. To generate lift, a balloon must contain lighter than air gas at a volume that counteracts the weight of its membrane. However, it must be able to withstand the strain of expansion and compression under low pressures and volatile temperatures. The extreme atmospheric conditions and radiation climate present on many extraterrestrial bodies form a challenging setting for balloon exploration.
These are the materials that we considered for our balloon and their various material properties.
Biological membranes are a key component of any living organism. However, most naturally occurring membranes are optimized for containing liquids and have little functionality with gas. Our team investigated the biological production of both synthetic and organic membranes resilient enough to contain hydrogen in high atmospheric conditions. To create a flexible membrane, we synthesized latex bacterially, and designed a composite membrane of elastin and collagen based on their dynamic properties in vivo. To strengthen our membranes against high stress, we investigated p-aramid fibers, the main constituent monomer of Kevlar. To increase our membranes’ radiation resistance, we produced bacterial melanin, and designed a novel binding agent to incorporate the pigment directly into our balloons. The results of these investigations are covered in more detail in the various subproject pages, but a quick justification for each membrane material is warranted.

The design itself includes two major functional parts, colored surfaces on the picture. The user can hold the device in one hand, press a finger against the bottom of the device to trigger a little needle hidden in the device. Then the user puts the droplet of blood from his finger on the central round of the device. Of course, one single droplet is not enough to have a correct fluid migration into the device. Therefore, a small bottle of buffer is provided, for the user to fill up the central reservoir in order to dilute the sample. Then the migration starts and the results are available within fifteen minutes. Each tested disease will have its name on a label above each detection pad, to ensure correct interpretation of the results. The shape has been designed to ensure optimal grip of the hand on the device. We think the end-user may be able to make the test with a quick look at the instructions.                                   This device is here to solve a huge public health concern, STIs. As shown in the human practices part (https://2016.igem.org/Team:INSA-Lyon/Human_Practices), it is not an easy question. This subject invades the privacy of each individual, so it’s sensitive. To this day, self-tests are still rare on the market. And those currently available are often only sold in specialized structures. Suggesting a device able of detecting several diseases at once and at an early stage is a rupture innovation on the market.
Our goal is to sell the self-test at a low price. The materials used are cheap, simply paper and PLA. So the device could be really less expensive. The shelf life is also a determining factor. With DNA we can hope to achieve a whole year of conservation time.                                   Of course a lot of development work would still be required to build a fully functional and reliable device. But with the results we got, we really think it could be a very good investment to pursue the development of such a test.

Douglas also repeated the mutation PCR using the new High Fidelity PLUS enzymes. In a bold and dareful move, he programmed the thermal cycler to carry out both a touchdown PCR AND progressively extended elongation steps (during the second set of cycles, those at the floor annealing temperature, the elongation step is extended of five seconds every cycle).
Friday, 29 July 2011
Douglas and Alessandro's transformed cells didn't grow (maybe problems with competent cells?). Alessandro transformed the cells again (with the J61002-Ptet-RFP Gibson plasmid) but this time he trasformed also the sample labeled Col1-RFP and Col4-RFP (supposing that these are the same as J61002-Ptet-RFP Gibson plasmid). Alessandro transformed the Gibson assembly made by Douglas on Lilia's (or Alina's?) competent cells and also on Henrike's competent cells. Due to an error only the lysis cassette has been transformed. On Tuesday the Gibson assembly has to be repeated since we ran out of the previous one.
The Mutation PCR yielded no product, probably because the primers were too diluted. It has been repeated with a higher primer concentration.

UC_San_Diego,2017,Team:UC San Diego#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," identified several aims of the research project, with the key challenge being the elimination or at least the containment of bio-contamination in industrial fermentation processes. At this stage, we wanted to get input from industry sponsors and turned to Dr. Kreisberg and the San Diego Center for Systems Biology. This was because his group has assisted past iGEM teams and includes several graduate students with competition experience, making it a valuable asset for us to discuss how to analyze our progress. We also wanted some secondary confirmation regarding our research proposal and thought that Dr. Kreisberg and his group could help us out.
Exploration
Dr. Kreisberg and his group were very impressed with what we were trying to accomplish; however, they also helped us rein in our expectations. They suggested that when we constructed the work flow for the project, it include a short-term vision and a long-term rollout for implementation.
They also noted that our solution was lacking because it was not very cost-effective. Dr. Kreisberg suggested that we do a quick economic analysis and calculation to determine which factors in the bio-production process could be handled more efficiently. He also encouraged us to keep the system easy to use because that would be a key selling point if we decided to commercialize the technology.
Deliberation
After discussion with Dr. Kreisberg and his team, we decided that one way to drive down the cost of our system was to synthesize the tagatose within our proposed system. Instead of having an external source produce tagatose and then introduce it to the environment for E. coli to metabolize, we decided that having a multi-organism approach would be more cost-effective This would also help reduce the costs to a point where our solution would become economically relevant in industry applications.
Our Applied Design section includes some economic calculations based on our implementation of a co-culture system with a ROBUST approach, leading to a nearly 50 fold reduction in costs.
Another key decision that our team had to make was the choice of organism to produce the tagatose. After several hours of discussion, our team settled on using S. elongatus PCC 7492 for several reasons:  cyanobacteria naturally grow on light and carbon dioxide, bypassing the need for fermentable plant biomass and arable land Because lowering costs was a key objective for our solution, cyanobacteria would play a key role in achieving that objective.

Mutated virG
Phosphorylated VirG binds to vir box containing promoters and activates them. VirG is activated by the acetosyringone receptor VirA.  This version of VirG activates virB promoters in Escherichia coli without the rpoA-gene from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (compare to Theory) . For this reason the point mutations G56V and I77V are brought into the molecule YC Jung et al., (2004) . Because this BioBrick is synthesized, the codon usage is optimized for E. coli and illegal restriction sites were removed. When you use this virG gene in a VirA/G signaling system you do not need <partinfo>K238010</partinfo> anymore to get the system working in E. coli.
You can find this BioBrick here: <partinfo>K389002</partinfo>
virB-promoter
Vir-promoters from A. tumefaciens are induced by phosphorylated VirG response regulators and control genes for infecting plants in their natural host. They are part of the VirA/G signal transduction system.  We wanted to use the vir-promoter from the partsregistry (<partinfo>K238011</partinfo>) but the same problems occurred as with the use of the VirA receptor BioBrick from the partsregistry. So we also had to create a new vir-promoter BioBrick (again from Ti-plasmid of A. tumefaciens C58).

Firefly luciferase
Bringing the firefly luciferase gene from Promega's pGL4.10[luc2] vector into a BioBrick compatible form as a sensitive reporter gene. To amplify the signal of the luciferase three different sensitivity tuners are assembled before the luciferase gene. The sensitivity tuners were created in 2007 by the iGEM team from Cambridge and amplify the readout signal. We also assembled the firefly luciferase behind three different strong constitutive promoters for gathering additional information about this reporter gene Cambridge, (2007) .

Nickel affinity chromatography: The fusion protein has a HIS-tag (used to purify both Tn5 and dxCas9 individually).
Heparin chromatography: The fusion protein is a DNA-binding protein (used to purify both Tn5 and dxCas9 individually).
MonoQ chromatography: It’s an anion exchange resin. To facilitate the binding of the fusion protein to the resin, the pH of the buffer was increased to pH8. At the higher pH the protein can interact with the resin, allowing us to utilize its charge as a purification property.
The final proposed process flow diagram for the production of dxCas9-Linker-Tn5 fusion ( BBa_K2643002 ) includes two chromatography steps: a capture and polishing step figure 8.

3.4 In Vivo Functionality of the Fusion Protein
Aim: Develop an in vivo platform for screening the efficiency of the dxCas9-Tn5 fusion protein ( BBa_K2643000 ).
Approach & experimental design: To visualize in vivo whether a donor DNA sequence is recognized by the fusion construct ( BBa_K2643000 ) and integrated close to a target sequence, we built a strain that harbors the dxCas9-Tn5 fusion protein ( BBa_K2643000 ), as well as a sgRNA that can guide the complex to a target site of interest.
LacZ is a bacterial gene that encodes for beta-galactosidase, an enzyme able to hydrolyze lactose and to cleave an analogue compound 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal), resulting in formation of a blue colored product, used to verify cloning attempts. Our in vivo screen methodology relies on lacZ disruption through targeted integration. To this extent, the assay makes use of blue/white screening, which happens on medium complemented with X-gal, Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and relevant antibiotics"

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design-2_-_-_TEXT.html,", gas chromatography would require the derivatization of progesterone so it could be vaporized during the mobile phase.  We determined that we should use liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry due to the convenience of the solid phase extraction system. Solid phase extraction utilizes the affinity of mobile phase solutes for a solid in its stationary phase to separate a mixture into its components by means of a cartridge. We would also use affinity column chromatography with progesterone-antibody beads, or ELISA for a more specific detection of progesterone. These methods would require progesterone antibodies and more preparation, but allow for immediate on site results.
DOSAGE
Our project requires a method for a consumer to obtain a reliable dose of contraceptive. Initially, we considered a galactose inducible progesterone biosynthesis pathway so we could establish a concentration of substrate to product curve. We abandoned this idea after learning that galactose inducibility is repressed by glucose which is present in the fuel source. We then considered methods of ceasing production of progesterone by use of a sensor that would inhibit the pathway at a specific concentration of progesterone.
Progesterone Receptor
The human progesterone receptor has 3 common isoforms, one of which is inherently cytosolic and translocates into the nucleus to affect gene expression after binding to progesterone. We considered using this action to initiate an apoptosis event upon binding of progesterone in the cell. This idea had some problems; the natural binding affinity for these receptors was much too high for our purposes and would result in apoptosis when the cell had accumulated ~0.05% of our target progesterone concentration of 20mg. This concentration is the required dosage for progesterone to suppress ovulation when taken sublingually. Changing the binding affinity of a cell receptor would require a large effort to intelligently design a new receptor or, more likely, a large library of random mutant receptors to screen. This idea was discounted fully after we discovered that the innate activity of the receptor tended to disrupt the apoptosis pathway.
Riboswitch
We still liked the idea of creating a sensor that could inform the consumer when the desired concentration of progesterone was present in the culture. From our mentor, McKenna Hicks, we learned about riboswitches, due to her extensive research and creation of the nucleotide-based sensors. We were informed that the guided mutagenesis process for a protein-based receptor was comparatively more labor-intensive anyways than for the sensors that could be created with riboswitches.

More importantly, we can not finish our project without the sponsor he found. As for Ning Xie, he played a key role in our experiment on both upstream and downstream. He offered us guidance on experiment such as ways of fungal transformant and activity of enzymes measurement. Additionally, he recommended his tutor to us for a better understanding of Metarhizium anisopliae. To make our downstream experiment systematic, he even provided us with a professional factory for fungal fermentation, so that we can cultivate a large number of spores.

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

Madrid-OLM,2018,Team:Madrid-OLM#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," this was the activity that closed the meet up, since the attending teams had organized to return to their cities after this tour.
Conclusion
It was an event that few people could attend, due to the conditions explained above, but from which the attendees took many advantages. Holding such an event in September could be much more crowded if it was announced from the beginning of the summer and allowed the rest of the teams to organize around it. As it provides a series of very useful tools for the presentation of Boston.
iGEM guide for new teams in Spain
This initiative emerged in the meet up of Marseille with a view to carrying it out in the meet up of Barcelona. In it, we agreed with the team of UPF-CRG-Barcelona organize an activity in their meet up.
Spain is a country with a low participation of teams in iGEM compared to other European countries. We have been the first team that has emerged in the city of Madrid. At the time of forming the team and carrying out all the activities of the contest, we usually find ourselves with a lack of knowledge. To promote the emergence of new teams in our country and facilitate the resolution of the problems they have at the beginning we decided to create a guide. In this guide, the main aspects of iGEM will be collected and explained and a series of tips will be given to face them. These tips would be a sharing of the way this year had each team to deal with them.
With this idea in mind, we presented the collaboration during the meet up to the rest of the teams and they were all happy to help. The participating teams in this collaboration besides ours are:
- UPF-CRG-Barcelona.
- BIO-IQS-Barcelona.
- Navarra BG (High School).
Initially, we have an index of main points of iGEM and we made a brainstorming where each team could contribute their ways of solving these aspects or could suggest new sections. For this part of the activity, a glass of the centre where the meet up was made was used and each participant was free to put the ideas in the section he wanted, writing on the glass.
After the great participation of all members, a large amount of content was collected and recorded. This content served as the basis for information for the drafting of the final guide. With which we hope it will help the teams of years to come and that, thanks to the availability of this guide, will emerge in more cities.

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR"
