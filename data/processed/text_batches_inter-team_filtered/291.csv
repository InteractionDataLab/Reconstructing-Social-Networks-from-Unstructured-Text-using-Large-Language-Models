Virginia,2012,Team:Virginia#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," concepts, visual metaphors, and relational phrases with researchers in mind.
Although a stereotypical “synthetic biology thought process” is not obviously easily characterized--synthetic biologists include people from a dizzying array of backgrounds, institutional affiliations, age groups, and (inter-)disciplines, working in an emerging field without a stable definition itself--there are also many aspects of the composite elements of synthetic biology practice that may be limiting.
Our language and physical actions and surroundings are not irrelevant to our design choices. A core lesson we’ve learned about cognition over the past few decades is that it is fundamentally embodied. Physical environments and actions are profoundly intertwined with higher-order mental processes scaffolded onto them (http://www.yale.edu/acmelab/articles/Scaffolded_Mind_EJSP.pdf). Seemingly irrelevant aspects of physicality influence behavior and cognition related to concepts connected by mere metaphor to the stimulus, such as room or coffee temperature impacting description of others as having “warmer” or “colder” personalities (height of ceilings, visibilities of certain colors, etc. also have strong effects - http://blogs.plos.org/neuroanthropology/2012/01/10/brainy-trees-metaphorical-forests-on-neuroscience-embodiment-and-architecture/, particularly on engineering creativity http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/01/30/120130fa_fact_lehrer), and similarly, physical metaphors in language frame how we think about problems. In the context of synthetic biology, metaphors like “BioBrick,” “circuit,” etc., as well as the structure of diagrammatic representations (such as block diagrams, genome annotations, smiley faces on E. coli) don’t just reflect but influence how we think about constraining our imaginable possibility-ome.
To make the forward-engineering of biological systems manageable, synthetic biology has largely relied on porting electrical engineering and chemical engineering language into a biological context. Although this kind of systematization enables the analysis, prediction, and engineering of otherwise impossibly complex systems, it also risks hampering innovation if it prematurely determines a single function-object pairing when many are conceivable, a cognitive bias called functional fixedness.
Our project specifically involved overcoming functional fixedness on a number of levels: the use of bacteriophages for diagnostics conventionally involves phage display reliant on a marker on the phage particle rather than the expression of a reporter gene, and pregnancy tests are usually used to determine pregnancy. We open-endedly describe potential uses for our parts in the Registry.

IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

Conference of China iGEMer Committee(CCiC)
From August 14th to 15th, Conference of China iGEMer Committee (CCiC) was held in the School of Life Sciences, Peking University. 34 teams from all over China accepted our invitation, a markedly increase in the number as well as the kind of teams compared with the 1st CCiC held by HZAU, 2014. More than 300 iGEMers have attended this year’s conference.
In the opening ceremony on August 14th, we invited two special guests, ZHANG Haoqian and LI Teng to give the keynote speech. Both of them are co-founders of BluePHA , an iGEM startup in China. More importantly, they are also the team leaders of Peking and Tsinghua iGEM 2010 team respectively. As predecessors in synthetic biology field, they shared their iGEM experiences, along with their opinions on the prospects of synthetic biology. Furthermore, they encouraged young scholars to study deeply in this area and fight for great achievements in the future.

CCiC Peking 2015 seeks to establish a sustained platform for Chinese iGEM teams to communicate with each other.
With excellent and attractive presentation, all the teams get numerous responses from others, including suggestions on the thoughts of experiments, heated discussions on pathway design, and reflections on safety and application. All teams' posters were exhibited in the hall, to facilitate the idea exchange of participants in an open environment. In the tea break, team members could present their projects to other participants who had an interest, and this has aroused passionate discussions among them.

Figure 1. Schematic diagram of the ligand-induced signaling through ThsS/R and the plasmid-borne implementation of the sensor components. ThsS/R was tested by introducing BBa_K2507004 into the pSB4K5 backbone and BBa_K2507008 into the pSB1C3 backbone. We submitted all of the parts to the iGEM registry in pSB1C3.
Characterization experiments were performed aerobically. Bacteria were cultured overnight in a 96-deep-well-plate, with 1ml LB media + antibiotics + different concentrations of inducer (thiosulfate) in each well. The conclusion is that while the system (ThsS/R) works, despite the leaky expression is rather heavy.
Figure 2. Characterization of ThsS/R system using sfGFP. 1mM, 0.1mM, 0.01mM and 0 Na2S2O3 were added as required.
Previously, Schmidl et al. have shown that thsR overexpression in the absence of the cognate SK can spontaneously activate a strong output (Schmidl et al, 2014), possibly due to RR phosphorylation by alternative sources (small molecules, non-cognate SKs), or low-affinity binding by non-phosphorylated RRs.
This reminded us to check the plasmid design. To our surprise, we found that the plasmid backbone (pSB4K5) we used for thsR expression has several mutations in the pSC101 replication origin, which means that pSB4K5 is actually a high-copy plasmid!
http://parts.igem.org/Part:pSB4K5:Experience
Due to the limited time after we found this bug, we were unable to test the ThsS/R system on a really low-copy plasmid backbone, but we will certainly do it after the 2017 iGEM Jamb"

1.3.1Conclusions & Future Plans
Human Practices
Science stands in an exciting position; in labs all over the world scientists work tirelessly to master the precise workings of cellular machinery, the genetic code, and intricate protein structures. Applications facilitated by the development of new technologies become more obvious and more essential each day. Problems we face in world-hunger, pollution, and disease, necessitate the development of these groundbreaking technologies. Science, and in particular biology, has advanced to a critical stage, which promises to deliver exciting, life changing, and even paradigm shifting advances.
Well, at least that’s what we think.
As budding synthetic biologists and students of science, the development of a game-changing technology is something that excites and intrigues us.  However, not everyone feels the same way.  Much of the world young or old, educated or uneducated, simply doesn’t get the same thrill from science.
Our goal is to educate and excite people about synthetic biology such that our contributions will encourage the development of a society that is scientifically literate.
Outreach
Outreach & Synthetic Biology
The newness of synthetic biology means that much of the population is not even aware that it exists (see Awareness & Attitudes Study ). Therefore, an important aspect of our outreach efforts is to introduce the topic of synthetic biology and show its potential. We also hope to give people the foundational information that they need in order to understand future scientific developments.  This form of outreach will help to improve the scientific literacy of the general population.
Another emerging issue is misconceptions held by the general public. In the development of synthetic biology, as with many new technologies, there is still much to learn and discover. As a result, the information made available to the public is often not a comprehensive, accurate picture of synthetic biology.
The following are the goals that we hope to achieve through educational outreach:
Inform the public about synthetic biology
Promote an education in science
Showcase opportunities in the field of science

Some members of the team are starting to develop the Extended Desktop; How do we envision this being used?
Week of 6/12/2011
Summary: Started designing widget; continued with wet-lab observations; devising a plan for BLAST visualization
6/13: Continued looking at the features of Geneious and looking up related works.  The circular chromosome design and the level of zoom in Geneious could potentially be interesting if we implement it in G-nome Surfer.  Now G-nome Surfer is called G-nome Surfer Pro because we are now focusing on E. coli chromosomes.
6/15: Wellesley lab meeting #2.  The team has divided into groups of two to work on aspects of the widget we pitched to Traci and the wet-lab.  Different people are working on the chromosome wheel, hands of the wheel, chromosome stream, and the chromosome bar.  Michelle and I will go to BU again.
Questions to consider for the widget (and to ask the BU wet-lab members):
Do we need a visualization level for the restriction sites as well?  Do we need to zoom down to the nucleotide level? If not, what components are necessary on the widget, and which are optional?
How would the wet-lab members interact with the surface?
Would it be mainly used for individual research, paired search with a post-doc, group research, or some other form of interaction we haven't considered, since there is a space restraint in the lab?
How do we look for genes?  What methods seem intuitive?  Do they want to look at specific restriction sites or genes?
How will the abstract layer work with the widget?  Do we use SBOL form for the abstract layer or not?
6/15: Wet-lab meeting #2 at BU with Suma.  The group talked briefly about transformation, and updates on what is happening in lab, and how fluorescent proteins are displayed in the samples.
A member of the wet-lab suggested that it would be cool to have barcodes for easier cataloguing.  The barcodes would go on the plastic, and ideally, after the bar codes are scanne we can use that to pull up specific protocols related to each tube with a barcode.  Michelle and I will look more into this.

However, we found no result in the previous history using this linker. Therefore, we modified the sequence and added three more amino acids into the linker in case it was still too short for proper protein folding. In the experiment(See the Link ), the fusion protein with the elongated GS linker did show the enhanced repellent effect. Observed from the phenomenon, we did prove the enhanced function of the fusion proteins, so we speculate that the fusion protein has a better secondary structure than the original ones. As a result, we have submitted a basic part for the improved elongated GS linker.(See the Link )

Microfluidics-work in progress
For the in vivo and in vitro characterization of our mutant transcription factors, we used two high-troughput microfluidic devices, a cell culture chip and respectively a fluidic platform for measuring molecular binding events, called ""MITOMI"".
The field of microfluidics has as an objective the manipulation and analysis of fluids within micrometer-sized channels, which, due to the small size, must be microfabricated using techniques adapted from the semiconductor and plastics industries.
The advantages of this technique include:
low sample and reagent volumes leading to lower costs low waste levels
unique physical properties of microscale fluid flow
the reduction of the size of equipment
fast analysis and short reaction times
parallel operation for multiple analyses
possibility of portable devices.

Michigan,2018,Team:MichiganState#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," the abstraction of the alpha-proton from D-amino acids, a precursor to the subsequent deamination reaction. These structural data provide evidence favoring a mechanism in which the ring cleavage is begun by a nucleophilic attack at the pro-S â-methylene carbon of ACC, with Tyr294 as the nucleophile. However, these observations are also consistent with an alternative possibility in which the ring opening is acid-catalyzed and may be facilitated by charge relay through PLP, where Tyr294 functions as a general acid. For most PLP-dependent enzymes, the reaction starts with the conversion of an internal aldimine between PLP and an active site lysine residue to an external aldimine between PLP and the amino group of the substrate which then followed by the removal of the R-proton of the substrate, which triggers subsequent transformations such as transamination and racemization.
Figure 7: The structure of the gem-diamine intermediate in Pseudomonas ACC deaminase complexed with ACC. The bonds are indicated with dotted lines. The interaction between the Tyr294 hydroxyl group and the pro-S carbon of ACC is indicated by a thin red line.
Figure 7 shows that the bound PLP cofactor in the Pseudomonas enzyme forms an internal aldimine with Lys51 through its side chain N_ amino group. The N atom of the PLP pyridinium ring forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate group of Glu295 (2.6 Å), whereas the O2 oxygen interacts with the side chain amino group of Asn79 (3.0 Å) and a water molecule (2.6 Å). The phosphate of PLP is anchored near the N-terminus of an alpha-helix formed by residues 202- 213, and interacts with the main chain amide groups of Val198, Thr199, Gly200, and Thr202, and with the side chains of Lys54, Thr199, and Thr202. Several protein residues also contact PLP through van der Waals interactions. These include Leu322, Asn50, and notably, Tyr294, the latter of which stacks against the plane of the pyridinium ring. These interactions firmly position the cofactor in the enzyme active site. As above there exists a bound sulfate molecule in the active site of the native enzyme which interacts with the main chain amides of Asn79 and Gln80 and with the side chains of Ser78 and Tyr294.
The fact that Tyr294 is located near the cyclopropane ring in the active site of ACC de"

As I know, some people even regard transgenosis as poisons. This is also our hope that more and more people can learn something about transgenic products via this competition and have a better understanding of genetic engineering. After all, we, as iGEMers, not only need to do experiments in laboratory, but also help synthetic biology understood by the public.
Surveys
Surveys on The Popularization of Synthetic Biology and iGEM  in high school students of Fujian Province
Our team conducted a synthetic biology survey before our lecture entitled ""Contemporary introduction to synthetic biology"". hWe wanted to compare how much they knew about synthetic biology and iGEM before the lecture with what their knowledge about them after our presentation in order to assess our work. We've prepared 300 questionnaires and handed out 227 of them. Among these drew-back questionnaires, 180 of them are valid. We put 12 questions on the questionnaire as below.
1. Have you ever heard about synthetic biology before our lecture?
2. If you have, in which way it was accessible to you?
3. Which parts do you think are the most intriguing about synthetic biology after our lecture?
4. Have you ever heard about iGEM before our lecture?
5. If you have, in which way it was accessible to you?
6. Are you willing to participate in iGEM after our lecture?
7. If your answer is no, why?
8. What's your reason for participation, why?
9. If you participate in iGEM in which aspects do to want to get supports?
10. How much time can you spend on iGEM?
11. If you participate, you and your family are willing to afford in which aspects? Some survey results are shown as below:
Discussion
Two major findings have been obtained from this analysis.
First of all, we drew a conclusion that almost everyone learned a lot from our lecture although they tended to be unfamiliar about the details of synthetic biology. Comparing the number of people who know about iGEM and the number of people who are willing to participate in iGEM we think the number of people who are interested in iGEM increases nearly 60%. Just look at the reasons why they don't want to participate, most people chose no time and no supports. Only few people claimed that they were not interested in it and far less people said they didn't like biology at all. Considering that our high school students"

The mechanism through which vitamin D exerts its effects on melanocytes is not yet fully understood. It is believed that vitamin D is involved in melanocyte physiology by coordinating the melanogenic cytokines (most likely endothelin-3 (ET-3)) and the activity of SCF/c-Kit system—one of the most important regulators of melanocyte viability and maturation.33” - New Insights on Therapy with Vitamin D Analogs Targeting the Intracellular Pathways That Control Repigmentation in Human Vitiligo, p.20)
“Furthermore, a proposed mechanism involving vitamin D in the protection of vitiliginous skin is based on its antioxidant properties and regulatory function toward the ROS that are produced in excess in vitiligo epidermis. It is also believed that vitamin D coordinates calcium fluxes in melanocytes, a similar function to that exerted in other cell types such as human keratinocytes, hepatocytes, and murine B16 melanoma cells.33,72,73 Based on these observations, it has been suggested that vitamin D is involved in the correction of the aberrant calcium fluxes that accompany the melanocytic loss in vitiligo.33,34,74,75 Several other studies emphasized the complex anti-apoptotic action of vitamin D on melanocytes76 and keratinocytes.77,78 It is likely that vitamin D can protect pigment cells against apoptosis, one of the cytotoxic mechanisms proposed among those causing melanocyte disappearance in vitiligo.” - New Insights on Therapy with Vitamin D Analogs Targeting the Intracellular Pathways That Control Repigmentation in Human Vitiligo, p.20
Nina: We need to apply the vitamin d into our bacteria that has been documented having the shortes pathway.
Andreas: Keep in mind that vitamin D (in the human body at least) is produced from a precursor that requires (UV?) light to be converted into vitamin D. Maybe this does not apply to bacteria, I don’t know.

Suggestion
1. The competition may be arranged like the SAGE project which the team would compete with their idea, not the experiment result because the senior school would not have enough money to cover the cost of the experiment and the equipment. And finally the winner group would have the budget and the Lab to help them.
2. Just like SAGE competition, the undergraduate students in the university who has attend the SAFE competition can be the consultant of the team, our iGEM team in the university could be the consultant of the team in then certain district or the school.
3. The team can consist of not only the students of a school or several schools, but also students of a certain city, district or even a country. And iGEM should give the chance to let the students to communicate with each other.

Hello world scientists.  My name is Juan Ricardo and I am studing Biotechnology at the Catholic University of Valencia, UCV (Valencia Spain). I think it's important to create useful applications using knowledge from different scientific fields. I love to read scientific articles, roller-skating to release adrenaline, playing guitar, singing, listening rock music and travel doing gastronomic and cultural tourism. I hope the project we decided to develop this year to disinfect contaminated water will improve the quality of life of living beings that inhabit this world.

Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.

This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."

Wageningen_UR,2014,Team:Wageningen UR#outreach#interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," That way you prevent it from getting established in the ecosystem and driving out other species from their ecological niche.
How do you see our project versus other possible treatments?
""I see it as more interesting than the the use of plaguicides and other molecules, but less interesting than good soil management.""
Have you heard of any synthetic biology approaches to agricultural problems before?
""No, I have no reference of such a thing, except only traditional GMOs. But now I do!""
Summary
Thanks to these interviews we could assess how people will view BananaGuard and the guarantees we would have to provide for the public to trust it. It also gave us insight into how people with first-hand experience view the current crisis with Panama disease. This plague is causing losses both for large businesses and small farmers, threatening food security and the sustenance of millions. Listening to them further encouraged us to find a solution. And not only that, we have also learned that bananas are not just a staple food or a cash crop, but they can also be of cultural importance.
It is clear that although the people we interviewed have a healthy dose of skepticism on the efectiveness of BananaGuard might show or its hypothetical impacts in the environment. Yet, they view it more positively than other possible solutions, like genetically modified banana plants or fungicides, and think legislation would probably allow its use. Of course, as they also remark, the layperson or even some of their colleagues may not embrace it as they do. Nonetheless, overall it does seem that, even if with some opposition, BananaGuard will be accepted.

Transformation of Enterobacter ludwigii FCP2-01
Materials
Electrocompetent FCP2-01 cells
1 mm electroporation cuvettes, chilled on ice
Plasmid DNA, works well with 100 ng per sample
SOC media
LB plates with antibiotic for selection
Methods
Thaw FCP2-01 cells on ice if using them out of the freezer.
Add 100 μl of cells to cuvettes on ice.
Add ~ 100 ng of plasmid DNA to cells, incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
Electroporate at 1.8 kV, add 1 mL SOC.
Incubate for 1 hr in cuvette at 30°C, warm plates to 30°C.
Spread 100 μl of cells on LB plates, incubate 24-48 hrs to see colonies.
Note: Some colonies grow which may not be transformed. It is therefore useful to include a fluorescent protein marker.
Characterization of endophytic isolates
Optical Density (OD) at 600nm as measure of growth rate
Overnight cultures in 6 mL LB were inoculated from colonies on solid media and grown for 24 hours at 30°C. These cultures were then diluted to a standard  OD and a plastic inoculation loop was used to inoculate a second 6 mL LB culture. After 24 hours at 30°C, The 1/10 diluted OD was measured.
Susceptibility
Cultures grown overnight at 30°C in 6 mL LB were streaked to form a lawn on MH plates. Sterile paper disks were soaked in either 35 mg/ml chloramphenicol  or came pre-treated with streptomycin. The disks were placed on the streaked plates are incubated at 30°C for 24 hours. The radius of clearance was measured are  compared to standards.
ACC utilization
Overnight cultures of isolates were streaked onto DF-ACC agar without  MoO3 to prevent nitrogen acquisition via fixation. After 2 days on these plates, presence or absence of growth was recorded.
Sequencing
The 16S region of the bacterial isolates was amplified using the universal bacterial primers 27F and 1492R. Polymerases Q5, Phusion, or Taq were used for amplification. PCR products were processed for sequencing via reaction with Exonuclease I and Antarctic Phosphat"

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#Project#LOV_-_-_TEXT.html," J-alpha helix in front of the isoleucine at position 539 (I539) should not be changed, in order to preserve its reactivity to light [10] . However the sequence following I539 can be adapted to small peptide sequence. We caged SspDnaX at the two most extreme positions, believing that those would result in the greatest differences in caging efficiency. The LOV - 12 mutant represents the caging of SspDnaX right after I539, resulting in the deletion of all remaining amino acids (-12) of the J-alpha helix. In the mutant LOV - 6, the short C - intein occupies the SspDnaX at the very end of the helix, resulting in the deletion of only 6 original amino acids (Figure 4).
Figure 3) Actual Caging Position
Plan of the cloned constructs. Only one intein is cloned in 2 different position.
In our sfGFP reconstitution assay, we already established an approach to easily read-out the intein splicing reaction. However in this assay we used the NpuDnaE inteins, which were known to splice even with unnatural exteins as far as the cysteine of the C-terminal extein is present. Therefore we obtained only this one amino acid scar in the spliced product, which can be crucial for the restoration of fluorescence in front of the chromophore region (65-67). It is not known if same assumptions can be made for SspDnax. To test this, we chose one LOV mutant using the sfGFP as split fluorescent protein with only one extein flanking the intein (figure 4, mutant 3). To provide a backup if SspDnaX does not splice with only one extein, we also designed two LOV mutants with split mRFP. In the case of mRFP, we decided for split position 168/169, since this position was already successfully demonstrated in bimolecular fluorescence complementation [12] . The split position is located between β – barrel 8 and 9, which provides enough space for larger insertions.
Cloning strategy
The three LOV mutants, namely LOV-12 SspDnaX-sfGFP, LOV-12SspDnaX-mRFP and LOV-6SspDnaX-mRFP, were created via a fast track cloning strategy using CPEC. Employing the same method, constructs were generated that do not contain the LOV domain. Both,"

Duesseldorf,2016,Team:Duesseldorf#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," visited the 5th information day about cancer in Düsseldorf at the “Haus der Universität”. The annual organizer is the tumor center from the university hospital Düsseldorf.
Some physicians from the tumor center presented different topics about current research, modern potential treatments and after treatments.
We were very interested in the speech by Prof. Dr. Wilfried Budach, director of the radiotherapy and radiooncology clinic at the university hospital Düsseldorf, about the significant progress in radiotherapy.
He said: “We can really see a substantial improvement for patients treated with radiotherapy. This concerns the optimal dose distribution, tolerance, duration and effectiveness of the exposure.         The limits of what is physically possible are exhausted by the “Volumetric Modulated Radiotherapy” with which we have had good experiences. This therapy spares healthy tissue despite using the maximum dose. Furthermore, a worldwide study shows that the time of exposure can be reduced without the loss of efficiency for some diagnoses (e.g. breast cancer: exposure for four instead six weeks).
However, the most promising insight is the combination therapy between radiotherapy and immune-checkpoint-blockers, which is already applied in the case of black skin cancer.""
That said, there is only experimental data that have yet to be confirmed by clinical studies. However, Prof. Dr. Wilfried Budach sees huge potential for this therapy, particularly for types of cancer that were difficult to treat before.
We had a very interesting afternoon and are looking forward to the next information day about cancer in 2017.
Beate Kaufmann educating us about Adeno-associated viruses (AAV's)
Looking into the future we intend to find a way how to insert our construct into cancer cells but due to time constraints we have not been able to try it out experimentally. Previous iGEM teams such as the iGEM Team Freiburg 2010, which designed a Virus Construction Kit, as well as the BGU team 2015, which inserted their constructs into cancer cells using AAVs, have already developed a way to do so. Therefore it is our aim to insert our construct in cancer cells with the help of the Virus Construction Kit designed by Team Freiburg 2010.
Luckily we had the opportunity to skype with Beate Kaufmann, a member of the iGEM Team Freiburg 2010, who was so kind to discuss our questions concerning the Virus Construction Kit and gave us useful tips as she still has expert knowledge about her own project.
Furthermore using AAVs comes with many advantages such as low pathogenicity and mild immune response. Additionally they have been"

On the sustainability and bio-safety of SynECO2
When selecting our project it did not take long before we agreed that we wanted it to be connected to climate change and the ongoing work of trying to lower the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide. We wanted to come up with a neat way of using a living organism to fix carbon; to provide a sustainable solution for a sustainable environment.
A lot of discussion took place with regard to how we would go about fixing carbon, in turn raising a lot of questions. Among these questions, two stood out as highly important: 1. How could we increase the level of carbon fixation to a higher rate without significantly impeeding the normal metabolic rates? And, 2. What measure could we take to ensure the biosafety of our GMO?
Increasing the carbon fixation rate
We came to the conclusion that one way of solving these questions was to utilize the machinery already existing in photosynthetic cells. In this way the organism could hopefully survive in its natural environment, while fixating carbon to a larger extent when compared to native carbon fixation rates. Since one of our team members was already familiar with photosynthetic bacteria, we chose to exploit this knowledge and decided to continue the work with the organism Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in mind.
What measure could we take to ensure the biosafety of our GMO?
Biosafety is an important issue for our project, as the goal would be to use the genetically modified organism (GMO) outside of the lab to fixate carbon. Before GMOs are allowed for use in natural environments, an extensive line of tests and validations are needed to ensure that they do not have any unwanted effects on the surrounding environment. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is one example of such an effect. This is the transmission of DNA between genomes, and is distinguished from vertical gene transfer were generic material is transferred from parent to offspring. Considering evolution and adaptation, HGT has been"

UCL,2017,Team:UCL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," If only one hydrophobic sequence is encoded the protein will be a single-span transmembrane protein. By default all proteins encoded enter the secretory pathway if they do not contain specialised signal sequences or signal patches, surface markers that define a proteins destination inside the cell.
We therefore had to incorporate a well characterised ER signal peptide into our PMDS, ensure the translation of a stable transmembrane domain and be cautious to not include a special signal sequence into the design.
iGEM LMU-TU Munich 2016 tested three different ER signal peptides of which ‘BM-40’ (BBa_K2170214) yielded the best result in a luciferase secretion assay. Unfortunately, this BioBrick is not in stock in the registry of standard biological parts and so we contacted iGEM  LMU-TU Munich 2017 who provided us with the plasmid.
The next step was to find the most promising transmembrane domain for our PMDS. We conducted a bioinformatic analysis of different transmembrane domains from the registry as well as from Nagaraj et al. 2011 and Quadrat and Truong 2016 . Both papers are from the Applied Protein Engineering lab, University of Toronto, and investigate strategies for the assembly of synthetic transmembrane proteins. The result of our analysis was that the TMD of EGFR (BBa_K2170210) would be most suitable for ensuring transmembrane anchoring and a defined orientation of the protein.
The final design of the coding region of our PMDS is shown in Figure .. . It consists of the signal peptide ‘BM-40’, an ‘ectodomain insert’, the ‘TMDEGFR’, the photocleavable linker ‘PhoCl’, ‘cytosolic domain insert’ and stop codon (5’ to 3’).
For our test construct we chose BBa_K648013, a GFP fused N-terminally to a FLAG epitope tag, followed by an enterokinase cleavage site, as our ‘ectodomain insert’. In doing so we further characterised BBa_K648013 because the entry from iGEM Penn State 2011 did not mention that the submitted BioBrick contains a FLAG epitope or enterokinase cleavage site. This BioBrick was chosen because the GFP allows for easy tracking of the protein during its synthesis and the secretory pathway. Additionally, the enterokinase cleavage site allows for easy orientation testing of our PMDS by adding enterokinase into the cell solution and recording delocalisation of the GFP from the PM into"

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.

Tail sequence of forward primer shown perfectly, tail sequence of reverse primer shown partially by sequencing. Plan is to re-do the digestion of gblocks and pFTV and then ligate, transform again. Inverse PCR completed again, this time shows extremely faint bands. We know that this was successful at least once because of the sequencing data, but we haven't been able to replicate it. Suspicion that the origional plasmid prep of pFTV may have been faulty due to the low concentration that was gathered makes us want to repeat this process. t

Heat sensitive lambda promoter in registry.  Exocytosis to cool the cell, similar to how mammals maintain homeostasis, sweating.
Insulator—capsule?
Comments: e.coli has advanced heat shock system. Many proteins to stabilize, involves mRNA. Cold just slowing down rate of reactions. Hard to get bacterial density up in a solution to generate enough heat. Possible spin to try to evolve a thermophilic version of e.coli, then sequence genomes. But there wouldn’t really be a biobrick.
Insulator/capsule under temperature dependent promoter is feasible.
Evolution at specific temperatures.

Multiple contaminant whole cell biosensor in e.coli
Builds off bacterial decoder from last year
Water contamination techniques. Detection techniques today are not always reliable.
whole cell biosensor: sensing component (usually resistance gene) reporter gene.
biosensors have been done in the past but only single input and single output.  Ours would take multiple inputs to give an output based on the input.
arsenic, lead.
ars operon—resistance gene, pump to pump out arsenic. Couple it to a reporter gene
pbrr—protein that binds selectively to lead ions. Clones into e.coli before so feasible.
theoretically simple, practical application of last year’s project.
problems: need to make it more sensitive than it is in nature for the ars operon. Not entirely sure what the products of the ars operon are. Don’t know much about lead sensing component. Need appropriate inputs, research what compounds are in water, what’s feasible to detect.
past projects: the traffic light project—altered promoter such that it’s stronger or weaker than wild type. Possible way to sense different levels of contaminants.  We could alter ars promoter in similar way.

The Colorado State University (CSU) iGEM team graciously invited us to their hometown in Fort Collins, Colorado for a weekend visit. There, we took turns presenting our project to each other and giving feedback on the presentation quality and the project itself. CSU gave us useful feedback and we will implement their suggestions for our final presentation in Boston! Afterwards, CSU brought in a guest speaker, Professor Jeff Kasser, who discussed some case studies on the Philosophy of Science. Professor Kasser presented many important concepts and, in doing so, gave us an opportunity to think deeply about the impact of our biological creations. Occasionally scientists may not foresee certain implications that could arise from a new biological system. Therefore, Professor Kasser reminded us to be thoughtful scientists as we dive into the new and uncharted waters of synthetic biology. We will take his important lessons with us and share them with future CU Boulder iGEM members in the hope of fostering thoughtful scientists who understand the full implications of their work.
We also participated in surveys from these teams....

UCLA,2014,Team:UCLA#Project#Functionalizing Fibers_-_-_TEXT.html," page).  We have also designed, ordered, and assembled functional silk sequences.  These sequences include the N terminus-sfGFP-C terminus fusion, as well as a sfGFP-MaSp 2 fusion (see above).  We synthesized the N terminus-sfGFP-C terminus fusion as a gBlock from IDT.  We designed the sequence so that the GFP in between the N and C termini could be swapped out for other functional proteins using Assembly Standard 23.  This is possible because the GFP is flanked by Bsa1 restriction sites that generate overhangs that are complementary with EcoR1 and Spe1.   We are assembling the sfGFP-MaSp2 fusion by introducing an extra two nucleotides the the end of the registry sfGFP coding sequence to keep the sequence in frame, and then using standard assembly to fuse the two sequences.    We are ready to clone both of these sequences, and will ligate them into the shipping backbone very soon.  The next step will be to express these proteins, purify them, and and then co spin them with the processed Bombyx mori silk.

This we are also continuing to work with Maya on biology animation. We went over the whole biological process taking place in the device to get a better understanding of the details so we can model it.
Week 16: August 18th - August 22nd
.
This week we got the results from the plate reader experiment and generated the graphs to visualize the data. First, cell count vs time was graphs for E. coli with RFP, E. coli with LacZ and B. Subtilis with RFP. E. coli with RFP grew more rapidly and reached the flat region after about 7-8 hours, while E. coli with RFP and B. subtilis with RFP did not reach the flat region in the 20 hours period, but steady growth can be observed. Our second graph represents fluorescence of RFP vs time. E. coli with LacZ was expected to be a zero. However, one of the controls for LacZ (blank media) was not zero which suggests it was contaminated with RFP. The graph for E. coli with RFP is really clean and follows the expected trend. The graph for B. subtilis with RFP is less clear, but still follows the general trend. The second graph shows fluorescence of LacZ vs time. The graph does not quite meet the expectations, so we are going to repeat the experiment using our colour sensor. This week we also continued working on the 3D animation of our device and prepared the draft animation that includes the animation of the biological processes taking place in the device. We talked to members of the biology sub-team to see what can be improved in the animation. Cesar will also be taking a look at the animation to make suggestions on how we can improve. At the end of the week, our device was manufactured, but we are still waiting for the Teflon tubing to be delivered (the tubing will connect the PCR chamber with three other chambers with bacteria). After the tubing arrives, we can attach this transport tubing and begin testing our device.
Week 17: August 25th - August 29th
This week we presented on our work to the rest of the team. Overall, the presentation went well. We received lots of feedback on the 3D animation of our device from the team and Cesar.  Areas for improvement were identified and it was suggested to change the part with DNA processes to show the interaction between the repressor gene and the promoter/operator/reporter"

BGU_Israel,2013,Team:BGU Israel#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," we would characterize it by checking how much nitrate and ammonia must exist in the medium to work properly. This collaboration was offered in order to examine the potential of their unique system in yeasts. We received a GFP  reporter gene under the expression of the NR promoter.  We intended to grow the yeast (post plasmid transformation and under selection conditions) in the presence and in the absence of different concentrations of nitrate compounds. The reporter gene would then be examined by using flow cytometry (FACS).
Tuebingen Excreted progestin are not eliminated from purified water in sewage treatment plants and therefore the progestin-contaminated purified water mixes with river-water and adversely affects the fish. Tuebingen team from Germany are developing a progestin measurement system based on yeast to function as a biosensor to detect the concentrations of progestin in the river. Since we had access to yeast and we take environmental issues very seriously, we offered our help to characterize their regulated FET3 promoter. The FET3 promoter is an iron regulated promoter of S. cerevisiae which is repressed by vertebrate progesterone receptors. It was sent to us on the pTUM100 backbone (BBa_K801000) with the URA gene for selection in yeast and mOrange as the reporter gene. We intended to transform the plasmid into our EDY100 yeast and grow them in standard SC-URA medium. FET3 should be usually repressed in the presence of iron and becomes active in a low iron environment . Therefore are intention was to grow them in different mediums containing various concentrations of iron and examine the activity of the promoter using FACS at 550nm which detects the mOrange expression.

After two days of shaking at 37° in 1 mM IPTG, the supposed IPTG inducible metA constructs in the metA auxotrophs were unable to grow.
- Jacob Toth
August 16
The supposed metA constructs still appears unable to complement a metA knockout. It has been suggested that the concentration of metA may have been too high, and this would have led to a severe detriment to the cell, and it has also been suggested that the IPTG, being a rather old stock, was no longer good. Another step that we are going to take is to see if the expression of the construct can be seen on an sds page under induction.
The YFP PCR for gibson assembly has yet to give us a solid band, so we are trying to move it into the psb1c3 plasmid in case there are some plasmid specific sequences that were giving us poor results. The ligation and transformation has been done, and we are waiting for colonies. The PCR products necessary for the gibson assembly of the GFP-IPTG-TrpA gene were also all available, and that gibson assembly has been done. However, due to the failure of several gels, there was very little product left, and PCR purification would likely result in unusuable quantities, so we tried a Gibson assembly with the straight PCR product, and we will see if it works.
All of the parts necessary for the assembly of the kill switch plasmid have been successfully PCR'd.
Another PCR was done to generate some of the other parts required for assembly of other parts.
A cPCR of the colonies with the MinC protein with the Sce VME intein showed that the gene for the intein was present in at least 2 colonies.
There are two distinct bands on the RFP PCR, one at the correct length, the other much lower.
The cPCR on the DszA colonies gave no result. This may have been due to an unoptimized Taq protocol,and might be worth repeating.

We spent over an hour and a half at this iGEM team meetup at Rockridge. Having worked extensively with fruit flies, Marissa gave them advice on how to best care for and test the fruit flies they were using for their project. The latter part of our conversation was geared towards planning for the trip to Boston to attend the Jamboree. Given both teams limited resources, and in the spirit of iGEM, we planned on sharing a single large beach rental property further away from the Convention Center so as to keep our costs low and also to use it as an opportunity to support each other. However, this did not transpire as the Rockridge team’s Jamboree attendee count was uncertain with their fundraising efforts continuing."

Aachen,2015,Team:Aachen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"] Right from the beginning we saw the great potential of methanol as a carbon source that is currently produced in large amounts but only partially used for fuels and not nearly up to its full potential. At this point we had the base for our project idea. It was further developed by research on other sources of methanol. We investigated the technical fixation of CO2 from the air and found out that methanol can easily be produced with this method as it is already by some companies. [2] But what comes next after methanol uptake and how can we make it available for various industries? The answer is sugars. In the bioeconomy most processes rely on sugar and therefore we decided to convert the methanol into glycogen, the storage molecule of sugar in bacteria. This contributes to making the bioindustry independent of plants and instead rely on renewable methanol.
How We Improved a Previously Existing BioBrick
Enhancing the glycogen accumulation in Escherichia coli is an important aspect of our project. In this context we developed our glycogen synthesis operon (glgCAB).  It is a composite part that combines all 3 glycogen formation enzymes. The ADP-glucose pyrophophorylase (GlgC) forms ADP-glucose from ATP and glucose-1-phosphate, the glycogen synthase (GlgA) elongates α-1,4-linked chains and the branching enzyme (GlgB) catalyzes the formation of α-1,6-linked branches. The GlgC is based on the part BBa_K118016 from Team Edinburgh 2008, but the RBS B0034 was added to the existing Biobrick. Since we could prove that strains expressing our polycistronic construct accumulate more glycogen than strains just expressing glgC, this part is an extension and improvement of the existing Part BBa_K118016.
The construct was confirmed by sequencing. The expression of all three enzymes GlgC, GlgA and GlgB was tested in BL21 Gold (DE3) strains containing BBa_K1585321 in a pSB1A30 expression vector.
SDS-PAGE of glgCAB in pSB1A30
glgCAB in pSB1A30 was expressed in BL21 Gold (DE3) strains and IPTG induced. The small arrows indicates the expected bands for all three enzymes . The BL21 Gold (DE3) wild type was used as the negative control.

Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"1). If humans are ever to live on the surface of Mars, the problem of radiation must be addressed.
While there are many proposed solutions to mitigating this radiation for astronauts or other life forms on the surface, one strategy that has not yet been studied extensively is the use of lipids to block radiation. Lipids could be especially useful at blocking galactic cosmic rays because of their high hydrogen density. According to Jonathan Pellish, a space radiation engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, ""The best way to stop particle radiation is by running that energetic particle into something that's a similar size."" (Frazier 2015). Because galactic cosmic rays consist of high energy protons and neutrons, the best way to block it would be with hydrogen which has a nucleus similar in size. The high hydrogen content of plastics is already being investigated at NASA where plastics and other trash is being compacted into tiles with the hope that they will provide increased radiation protection. Lipids are similar in structure and hydrogen density to plastics and so we investigated the possibility of creating lipids to shield our habitat from galactic cosmic rays.To this end our team identified a species of filamentous fungus which produces more lipids than other species, Mucor circinelloides (Xia et al. 2011). We considered incorporating this species of fungus into our structure to increase the radiation protective abilities. Our team took some pictures of this species under a phase contrast microscope that can be seen below.
Two images of Mucor circinelloides under phase contrast microscope. Taken by Leo Penny
We were not able to test the radiation protection abilities of this species but believe it could be promising. Our collaborating team, DTU, also sought to reduce radiation damage by increasing production of melanin, a pigment effective against solar radiation in the form of ultraviolet absorbtion (Brenner 2008). The results of their work can be seen on their wiki: DTU iGEM

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#History_-_-_TEXT.html," these reasons, we believe that SMX occurrence in an aquatic environment is one of the key drivers of pharmaceutical pollution in the Baltic Sea. It poses an implicit and imminent threat to the regional ecosystem as WWTPs are, in their current state, unable to sufficiently remove SMX from the wastewater.
Existing Solutions
To remove pharmaceuticals from the wastewater, advanced (tertiary) treatment procedures need to be implemented in WWTPs. Several ready-to-implement technologies have been developed in the past for treating pharmaceutical residues, but each one of them bears some restrictions that prevent its broad adoption and implementation in WWTPs.
To the extent of our knowledge, there is only one WWTP in the Baltic Sea region employing advanced treatment methods to remove pharmaceuticals from wastewater, and it is located in Linköping, Sweden.
The most preeminent methods for treating pharmaceuticals in wastewater are displayed and briefly described in Table 1 and Table 2 .
Note that the emerging solution pCure in Table 2, which was developed by Pharem Biotech, is a solution designed to be implemented in the topmost upstream level, which is the level of the toilet and not in the WWTP [19].
Table 1. Existing solutions for treating wastewater from pharmaceuticals [19].
Table 2. Emerging solutions for treating wastewater from pharmaceuticals [20].
Note also that one common system including ultrafiltration (or micro-filtration) in conjunction with a biological wastewater treatment (activated sludge) process is called Membrane Bioreactor (MBR), and it is not displayed separately as it is represented in Table 1 by the ultrafiltration method.
Combinations of the existing solutions can be implemented in WWTPs, either integrated into the primary treatment stages or as an extra stage of treatment. With this tactic WWTPs try to leverage the main advantages from different solutions, achieving sufficient removal rates of pharmaceuticals. As Sofia Andersson from Henriksdal WWTP disclosed: “With Ozonation, there is a risk of receiving compounds you do not want, but Linköping WWTP has moving Biofilm Membrane Bioreactor (MB-MBR) carriers implemented after the Ozonation” (Study visit S Andersson 10 Jul 2018). However, as it is logical to assume, this approach leads to an increased treatment cost as well.
Overall, the two most easily accessible and realistic solutions for the removal of pharmaceuticals are Ozonation and Activated Carbon (GAC & PAC).  On the one hand, the by-products produced after the redox reaction catalyzed by ozone (O3) have"

Collaborations
Since this was our first year in the competition, collaborating with other teams was one of the essentials for us. Through our Skype sessions and e-mails, we could understand what needed to be done and we learned the proper attitude that we should have in this competition. We would like to thank every single team who collaborated with us. You guys are the best. Good luck in the competition!
ACIBADEM University
Our biggest collaboration was with the ACIBADEM iGEM 2018 team. We have done the whole InterLab protocols together in their lab. We were together all summer. Even though it's their first year in iGEM as well, they are college students so they are more experienced than us therefore they helped us a lot during the InterLab. It's thanks to this dedicated team that we were able to complete the InterLab studies. Especially Yasin, Atabey and Ali Adem Bahar. They helped us with every single problem we had.
NYU Abu Dhabi
We have participated in a virtual conference which was organized by iGEM NYU Abu Dhabi 2018 team. The Skype session had 5 iGEM teams in total. Each team presented their projects and shared opinions with each other. It was a productive and beneficial collaboration for us!
Pasteur Paris
We have organized a skype meeting with iGEM Pasteur 2018 team. We showed our projects to each other and exchanged our views. We really enjoyed having a collaboration with an other francophone school team.
METU HS Ankara
We have contacted iGEM MetuHS 2018 team as we learned that they were joining iGEM for the third time. As they are the only high school team from Turkey other than us, it was a little bit easier to keep in contact. We believe we became good friends with the members.
2018 Turkish Meet-Up
We have participated in the Turkey iGEM Meet-up which was held by MetuHS iGEM 2018 team. We met with all other iGEM 2018 Teams from Turkey. Each team has presented their projects and asked questions to one another. At the end of the meetup as the only two high school teams, we stayed a little bit longer to share our memories throughout the preparations for iGEM. We had a great time and made new friends. It was great meeting other Turkish students who are passionate about science!

Intergrated HP with Prof. Gu
The background research on mitochondrial biology is the focus of our HP. For our project, which                         falls                         into basic                         researches and exploration, consulting senior scholars in related fields is probably the most                         effective                         approach to                         ""crossing the threshold"". With the help of Dr. Jiang, we contacted Professor Gu Zhenglong of                         Cornell                         University.                         Prof. Gu has long been committed to the function, evolution and correlation of mitochondria.                         Also,                         he                         devotes                         himself to the study of evolution of aerobic fermentation of yeast and the effects of this                         process                         on                         the                         physiology and multi-gene regulation of complex diseases such as cancer.
We have had an in-depth interaction with Prof. Gu in several substantial aspects, which are                         respectively project                         objectives and background research, genome design, project experimentation and subsequent                         genome                         delivery. And                         Prof. Gu indeed provided us with exceedingly valuable and specific advice and support.
Objectives and background:
We consulted Prof. Gu on the academic significance and possible specific applications of                         simplifying                         the                         mitochondrial genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its"
Lethbridge,2016,Team:Lethbridge HS_-_-_TEXT.html," outreach we have been conducting. For example, we have gone to schools in Southern Alberta to educate students with respect to our project and iGEM. In addition, we have devised a public survey, went door to door, and created a social media account to try and establish an amicable rapport with those affected by severe bleeding and members of our community.
In the lab, we hope to successfully express our recombinant DNA in E.coli, and produce an effective solution for clotting blood. After that, we hope to develop a fast-acting and effective prototype that will be able to clot pressurized blood being pumped through a simulated wound. If this is accomplished, we’ll attempt to design a tool or delivery system to make sure that we apply the right amount of our system to the wound in order to get the best clot. In addition, we want to test whether or not the clotting factors can move through the body causing an embolism elsewhere. This is something we want to prevent and need to test if our system can remain local in the wound.
Our team hopes that our inexpensive and effective technology will be able to help military personnel, disaster victims, and other people affected with severe bleeding survive their ordeals, and have a better quality of life afterwards. In doing so, we will reduce strain on healthcare systems, simplify treatment of major bleeding for EMTs and doctors, and keep families together.

Tuebingen,2016,Team:Tuebingen#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," is possible for the reaction to be both active and inactive in a living cell.
It is possible for the reaction to be inactive if no G6P is metabolised.
On average, the reaction is less active for minimal G6P metabolism.
These criteria were tested by conducting two FVAs. One that maximizes growth and a second that minimizes G6P metabolism. The mathematical formulation for the given criteria are then:
The minimum of the range is \(\le 0\) in both FVAs.
The maximum of the range is \(\ge 0\) in both FVAs.
The means of the ranges from both FVAs differ more than \(200\).
The analysis yields that a knockout of the \(\beta\)-phosphoglucomutase and the G6P-isomerase are able to prevent \(\beta\)-G6P metabolism. We summarized the results for up to three knock-out reactions by counting how often a reaction participated in KO combination, which shut down \(\beta\)-G6P metabolism. The ranked list of the top 5 knock-out reactions read:
beta-phosphoglucomutase
G6P-isomerase
G6P-dehydrogenase
alpha-phosphoglucomutase
maltose exchange
Overview over the reactions identified as knock-out candidates and                 complementary glycolysis reactions.
The reaction top 14 is adenylate-kinase and top 15 is asparagine-synthetase, which are biologically unlikely knock-out candidates. At no point we were able to bar the system from metabolising \(\alpha\)-G6P.
After disregarding unlikely candidates, the following pattern emerged in a visualization with the Escher tool, see figure 1 (King et al., 2015).
For an illustration of the normal metabolism flow see figure 2, and how a successful \(\beta\)-G6P knock-out affects that flow see figure 3.
Sample flow for a growth maximizing objective. Thicker reaction arrows                 indicate higher flux rates.
Fluxes are redistributed as a consequence of the knock-out (orange),                 leading to a decrease of Maltose phosporylase activity compared to the fluxes in figure 2.
Discussion and Conclusion
Our analysis involved flux balance analysis (FBA) of an inferred model for Lactobacillus johnsonii (ATCC 33200), and a flux variability analysis (FVA) of Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1. The inferred model yielded only noisy, numerically"
