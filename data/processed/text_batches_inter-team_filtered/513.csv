Background
Aim
Within NUTRInity-provide, we aim to establish a shuttle system with countless applications. In our case, we want to produce micronutrients directly where the absorption in the human body takes place – in the small intestine. However, we do not want to release genetically modified microorganisms into our guts if it is not really necessary. Therefore, we want to find a system that can produce valuable compounds but is no longer able to divide. For this purpose, we want to establish a minicell production E.coli chassis and show that we can produce micronutrients like β-carotene. Furthermore, we built a modular system to transform any bacterial chassis into a minicell producer.
Project Design
Figure 1: Animation of the project design
In order to get a functional production shuttle in the human gut, we used the minicell-producing E.coli strain TB43 whose min-gene system was deleted. We decided to utilize this kind of system to reduce risks of biosafety as far as possible for the minicells are not able to propagate. As comparison, we also tested a strain from the Keio collection with a deletion of MinC. We examined both strains via flow cytometry to evaluate minicell production. Originally, flow cytometry was developed for the examination of fluorescence in cells, which is why we had to optimize the measurement in order to differentiate between minicells and their parent cells. We decided to use both, size and complexity as distinctive features.
For the determination of the isolated minicells’ characteristics, we established a novel purification protocol using different filtration systems to get rid of chromosomal DNA containing cells. This was an important point in maintaining biosafety in terms of possible applications. Furthermore, we had to make sure that the minicells would not start dividing all of a sudden. For this reason, we performed a time laps experiment using fluorescence microscopy over several hours.
To see whether micronutrients can be produced by our chosen system, we transformed a plasmid encoding the four necessary"

E. coli DH5α containing the plasmid with operon for zeaxanthin biosynthesis were inoculated to production media and incubated for 24 hours. Zeaxantin was extracted using the same protocol as previously for lycopene and B-carotene.
8/9/2010 –8/15/2010
 
Production of zeaxanthin was confirmed by HPLC and compared to a standard.
8/16/2010 –8/22/2010
 
Fusion proteins with zinc fingers and genes for carotenoid biosynthesis were constructed, each one preceded by T7 promoter and followed by T7 terminator.
 
8/23/2010 –8/29/2010
 
We continued constructing above-mentioned fusion proteins.
8/30/2010 –9/5/2010
 
Results of sequencing  of fusion proteins revealed, that T7 promoter we were using was not functional. That was why we decided to change the strategy and started to build constructs RBS – ATG – zinc finger – enzyme under pBAD promoter.
9/13/2010 –9/19/2010
 
Sequencing of RBS-ATG-zinc finger-enzyme constructs showed that BioBrick parts with coding sequences for enzymes crtB, crtI and crtY ( BBa_K118002 , BBa_K118003 and BBa_K118004 , respectively) were not designed in such a way it would enable us to construct functional chimeric protein. A set of primers was designed to correct above-mentioned parts in a way which would allow us to construct fusion proteins.
We recieved plasmid with synthetic gene crtO.
9/20/2010 –9/26/2010
 
Genes crtB, crtI and crtY were PCRed, so we got constructs that allowed assembly of chimeric proteins. Constructs with RBS, zinc fingers and enzymes were assembled.
9/27/2010 –10/3/2010
 
PCR ligation of DNA program for biosynthesis was perfomed, PCR products were blunted with T4 DNA polymerase and ligated into pBluescript vector. Colony PCR on white colonies was performed and clones with the highest molar mass bend were sequenced.
Biosynthetic operons for carotenoid biosynthesis with enzymes liked to zinc fingers was beginning to be assembled.

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Lab_-_-_TEXT.html," is of a similar size to asRNA Construct Two would mean that this is no longer an issue.
After knocking out the holin gene whilst simultaneously introducing asRNA Construct Two we would have a lysogenic strain of C. difficile with the modified phiSBRC integrated within the C. difficile genome. The asRNA Construct Two should still be active within the genome, as it would be constitutively expressed, and have a similar toxin suppressing effect to that demonstrated on a replicative plasmid in our results section. The cytotoxicity assays performed earlier will have to be repeated with the modified phiSBRC prophage taking the place of the replicative vector to ensure that the toxin suppression effect remains. It may be the case that since the asRNA construct on the genome is at a lower copy number than on a replicative vector it no longer displays such powerful toxin suppressing effects.
Having verified that the modified phiSBRC prophage retains its impact on toxin suppression the next stage would be to generate a second modified phiSBRC prophage which does not remove the phage holin gene. This is necessary because the modelling results suggest that having the phage able to occasionally enter the lytic cycle would be beneficial when put into practice. Instead of targeting the holin gene a region of non-coding DNA would be found and targeted with different homology arms to those used previously in pSBRC_Cas9_PhageIntegration_holin. Once the new modified prophage is created it would be necessary to ensure that the phage retains its ability to infect C. difficile and undergo the lytic cycle. For this reason a plaque assay would be performed as previously with the wild type phiSBRC and any difference in phage parameters would be re-entered into the mathematical model.
After this research is complete we would have a C. difficile lysogen containing a modified prophage which has been demonstrated to suppress toxin. This lysogen could be used to generate pure infectious phage particles which could be used in phage therapy. The next factor to consider would be the means of delivery to patients. After consulting with experts and discussion groups as detailed in the human practices it was decided that a capsule would be the optimal delivery method. As such the final stage of research in future work would be optimisation of the encapsulation of phage particles ready for application to patients.

Tsinghua,2018,Team:Tsinghua#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," very trace amount of AHL should not activate the system. To test whether the Test System does possess these features, we will run a series of simulations of our model.
The parameter values used in the model are stated in previous parts. As for the intial states, the concentrations of CRISPRi related molecules are set according to the SimBiology simulation results. Concentrations of most molecules that are not supposed to be synthesized without AHL are set to 0. External AHL concentrations are tuned to reveal the effect of AHL concentration on the system.
To begin with, we set intial external AHL concentration as 10-6 M, which is relatively high. The simulation result is shown below.
Figure 4  Simulation Result——With Very High Initial AHL Concentration
The result meets our expectation. According to the plot, GFP concentration will begin to rise exponentially following the addition of AHL. The velocity of increment decreases gradually, till approximate saturation is reached. The simulation result implies that the Test System is inducible.
What happens when lower concentrations of AHL is added? The following plots represent 10-7 and 10-9 M of AHL concentration, respectively.
Figure 5       Results of Varied AHL Concentrations
As can be deduced from these plots, the decrease of AHL concentration from 10-6 to 10-7 has no substantial influence on the behavior of the system. Through further analysis, we found that the rate of GFP concentration increment is indeed higher when 10-6 M of AHL is added than when 10-7 M of AHL is added, however this difference can merely be detected after 100 seconds. Given these two different initial states, the state of the system will eventually become quite same. For one, this shows that the system is robust, to some extent. In addition to this, this phenomenon makes sense and has biological interpretations. Within a certain range of concentrations, AHL serves as a “trigger” which turns the system on by enabling expression of several proteins, so it has an “all-or-none” effect, to some extent.
When the concentrations of AHL is further decreased, to 10-9 M, for instance, the behavior of the system is altered dramatically. When AHL concentration is this low, the system cannot be activated and no GFP is expressed. This is partial thanks to the “safety catch” design. This result gives us confidence that leakage can be prevented with the presence of minor fluctuations.
You can interact with the plot down below. Use mouse to drag the slider to tune the initial AHL concentration and observe how this will influence GFP production in the cells!

BBa_K1763444 is our highest quality part: it is extremely well documented, from construct generation, to purification and expression of our final recombinant peptide, to even validating complete and proper function of the module.  We hypothesized that when the module containing sfGFP would spin with silk dope in small concentrations, the silk would fluorescence in fiber form.  As our micrograph analysis and stress/strain analysis indicates, we have successfully produced a silk fiber and fluoresces, consistent with proper function of sfGFP.  Our pat is extremely innovative, in that it can be extremely modularized to fit any functional domain of interest from the Registry of Standard Parts, and that any team can quickly screen these functional domains for proper function when processing silk, instead of having to produce direct silk fusions.  This product is extremely useful to the community, as the first novel peptide used to add new biochemical functions to silk structures.

Types of natural RNA thermometers   Back to top
Although RNATs show almost no sequence similarity among them, a number of structural features can be used to classify them. Here we enlist the most described RNATs structural groups described to date [ Kortmann and Narberhaus, (2012) ]:
ROSE.- ROSE stands for ""Regulation Of heat Shock Expression"". ROSE elements are 60 to >100 nucleotide sequences found upstream of heat shock proteins. They have been found to be conserved in alpha and gamma-proteobacteria. Among the structural features of the ROSE element family are: a) their folding in 2 to 4 stemloop structures; b) a short conserved sequence (UU/CGCU) near the Shine-Dalgarno sequence; and c) the presence of a number of non-cannonical base interactions (the G83-G94 pair; a triple bair among U96-C80-C81; the U79-U97; and the interaction of the AUG codon and C71, G72 and U73. Functional ROSE elements have been found in E. coli (rpoH and ibpA) and B. japonicum (hspA).
FourU elements.- these elements are characterized by a short motif composed of four uridines that pair with the Shine-Dalgarno region and is embedded in a hairpin that shows temperature-induced conformational changes. FourU elements have only one A-G non-cannonical base interaction. Among the structural features that characterize FourU elements are a) the A-G pair and b) the G34-C46 pair that regulates melting. Functional FourU elements have been described in Salmonella (agsA) and Yersina pseudotuberculosis (lcrF).
Synechocystis hsp17 element.- with a length of 46 nucleotides, this is the shortest RNAT described so far. The distinctive structural features essential for the function of this element are a) the pairing of a UCCU sequence with the AGGA in the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and b) the presence of two loops in its stems.
Coding region spanning RNATs.- RNATs are not exclusively found in the 5'UTR of genes; they can also span into the coding region and even be intergenic. Functional coding region spanning RN"

BBa_K2260000 and BBa_K2260002
We improved two parts. The first, BBa_K2260000 , was an improvement on Imperial College's phaCAB operon submitted in 2013. The gene order was changed to improve PHB yield (Hiroe et al., 2012), codons were optimized for expression in E. coli, and restriction sites were removed to allow part compatibility in all iGEM RFC assembly standards. The second, BBa_K2260002 , was an improvement on SDU Denmark's phasin-HlyA part submitted in 2016. Codons were optimized for expression in E. coli.

Since HydEFG are maturation genes, it was expected we may have some hydrogenase activity in the absence of this part hence we began testing the Fer/Hyd cells.
The first attempt at the SDS-PAGE gel of induced Fer/Hyd cells, checking for the hydrogenase enzyme was unsuccessful. This will need to be attempted again later.
Fer/Hyd on CAM backbone (from our backbone swap) was successfully screened by running digests on a gel so we sent that one off for sequencing (Figure 5).
Omega Ω which is our fondly named complete hydrogenase encoding plasmid with Fer/Hyd/HydEFG was not only assembled this week but cells were transformed, cultures grown, miniprepped plasmids digested and screened on gel showing positive potential (Figure 6).
This is a major milestone.
Being a large construct of 8777 bp primers were designed and ordered in readiness or sequencing.
A further attempt has been made to induce our transformed E. coli to translate our plasmids and measure hydrogen production.
There was an error in the media mix so things didn’t work this time.

Whereas，Currently antibiotics (including tetracycline) detection methods are more complex. Not only the instruments are very expensive, but also the cost of detection is high, which brings many inconvenience to the sample detection. Our group hopes to use synthetic biology to provide a simple, reliable and efficient method for the detection of antibiotics. And we hope it can serve testing organizations and the ordinary families to ensure their food safe.
Project Proposals
Our group constructed the tetracycline inducible expression system. And through plasmid mediated, the system was transfected into Escherichia coli TOP10 and GS115 Pichia pastoris. It can generate a rtTA transcription activation factor in cells. RtTA combining with tetracycline antibiotics can activate the fluorescent protein expression system, which can instructs the tetracycline class of antibiotics by fluorescence detection.
rtTA: combined with rTetR (reverse TetR) and VP16 transcriptional activation of regional. RTetR derived from the mutation of the 4 amino acids in TetR.
The fluorescent protein expression system: TRE (Tet-responsive element), PminCMV (minimal CMV minimal promoter promoter) and fluorescent protein gene composed of it.

Colonies grew for both conditions (xylose added to bacteria in initial inoculation, xylose added to SG media) and this suggested successful transformation. However, the next day the colonies appeared fuzzy and resembled fungal growth, so we were doubtful whether we were able to transform spores.
Figure 30:Transformation of spores that had xylose added to the sporulation SG media. It appears that transformation with spores was successful, but we are doubtful if these are B. subtilis cells or fungal growth since the cells were fuzzy the next day.
Figure 31:Transformation of spores that had xylose added to the bacteria during the initial inoculation. It appears that transformation with spores was successful, but we are doubtful if these are B. subtilis cells or fungal growth since the cells were fuzzy the next day.
We also left eight more tubes of dried spores (without the addition of water and DNA) and left these at room temperature to ensure they were as dry as possible.
Week 25: October 13 - October 17
Transforming with B. subtilis spores
Since the previous trial of spore transformation was doubtful due to the likely presence of fungal growth, we attempted transformation again. This time, we tried transforming with spores that were left to dry for several days and spread them on plain agar and spectinomycin plates. We left the plates at room temperature and saw no growth the next day. We then placed them in the 37°C incubator and the next day we saw growth on the plain plates and limited growth on the spectinomycin plates. Since the plates for the previous trial were checked after several days, we think more time might be required for the colonies to grow on the spectinomycin plates. As of now though, transformation with spores was unsuccessful.

Colonies grew on the plain agar plate (left), while there was no growth on the spectinomycin plate (right). More time might be required for colonies to grow on the spectinomycin plate but as of now, transformation of spores was unsuccessful.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Results_-_-_TEXT.html,", we assembled the fragments into a pSB1C3 backbone with the T7 promoter and transformed the resulting plasmids into the protein expression strain BL21(DE3). Their successful production was confirmed by both SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry.
From the different drying assays we performed, it was concluded that LDH activity was remarkably well preserved after 18 days in the samples containing LDH dried with SAHS 33020. Furthermore, we discovered that while both CAHS 94205 and SAHS 33020 preserved Cas13a’s RNase-like activity after drying, CAHS 94205 could not preserve its specificity; Cas13a dried with the latter CAHS showed RNase activity even in the absence of the target RNA. This was corroborated by iGEM Munich 2017 , when the same trend was observed under similar experimental conditions with a Cas13a protein originating from a different strain. Nonetheless, the results were positive for the tardigrade-specific protein SAHS 33020, as both the activity and specificity of Cas13a could be considerably preserved after drying and rehydrating. We therefore believe that the SAHS proteins hold great potential in simplifying the storage, usage and shipment of the many fragile chemicals and biological materials.
Vesicles - Exploring the cell's potential as a (future) factory
As indicated on the design page , we wanted to let our bacteria produce all our necessary proteins at once and package them in Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs). For this purpose, we tried to establish and characterize hypervesiculation in a strain with a knock-out of an important membrane envelope protein, TolA. Furthermore, we conducted experiments in which another membrane protein, TolR, was overexpressed. It had been suggested that this would further enhance vesiculation.
Achievements
Confirming the hypervesiculation plasmid
We received the plasmid with the mutation in the TolR gene from UNSW Australia 2016 . In order to confirm the sequence, we transformed the plasmid into a TOP10 strain. Some colonies were picked and screened with colony PCR (with primers IG0028 and IG0027 ). Simultaneously these colonies were grown and miniprepped , prior to performing a digestion with NdeI and SphI. Colonies 3.1 and 3.2 were picked for sequencing (with primer IG0028 ), where the sequence of both plasmids was further confirmed.

tetR mutants
Douglas designed primers for site-specific mutagenesis of tetR, following the protocol . We are testing this as another approach to inducing mutations. The primers were designed for the same mutations as attempted by extension PCR, i.e.:

The IPTG test gave us bad results (as expected due to data came from digestion): no increase in RFP and no decrease for the T4 lysis cassette. Alessandro made miniprep and the digestion for the only red colony that he inoculated the day before. The digestion gave a band of the expected size of the Gibson assembly (4428 bp) but we were expecting to see 2 bands instead we can see just 1; maybe one restriction site has been removed by the PCR or by the assembly.
Gibson assembly from the red colony doesn't show 2 bands but just one band between 4 and 5 kb. Maybe one restriction site had been lost during the assembly.

HP-Overview
     Human practice is an important part of iGEM. As future scientists, we mainly focused on scientific research which may create new applications and method used in everywhere and everything. Nevertheless, we also have a great responsibility about what and how we provide them.
     As stem cells therapy is unfamiliar for most of the people, we outstretched our project into the discussion of the safety and efficiency of stem cell therapy. So we discussed with lots of fellows and experts in CCiC about our project and the concern of medical treatments. We also introduced the concept and highlights about stem cell therapy to senior high school students and presented our ideas in SYSU-Bio-festival (an important activity in our university) to promote the treatments of stem cells and allow more people to know them. Furthermore, we set up a questionnaire to collect people’s opinions on stem cell therapy.
     During CCiC, iGEMers from different team were also helpful with advice on how we could improve our system. We harvested suggestions for our experiments, poster and presentation.
     For communication with the teams in SYSU, we helped SYSU-Medicine and SYSU-Software with the vital issues during the experiments and they also gave helpful advices to us. We also collaborated with SZU and FAFU.

Cooperation with Freiburg
We got to know the Freiburg iGEM team during the Biotechnology 2020+ conference in Berlin, where several teams from Germany presented their projects and were offered the opportunity to gather around, discuss and share experiences in the lab. Since we talked with the Freiburg team about our first experiences in the lab, we noticed that our two projects have something in common: the GibsonAssembly.  That was the start of our cooperation.
The iGEM-team Freiburg had already successfully conducted several Gibson Cloning attempts and was able to establish a well working protocol. They offered to realize a little workshop with us so we could improve our knowledge about Gibson Cloning and the practical implementation. On the other hand Freiburg had problems with the CHO cells they were working with for the realization of their project. As the Bioquant is in close connection with the German Cancer Research Center we managed to organise the urgently needed CHO-Pro5 to help Freiburg.
On July 15, 2013 Natalie, Fenja and Michael arrived in Heidelberg and we met in our laboratory in the BioQuant. After a short introduction of our team and the three team-members from Freiburg, we directly started with the Gibson Assembly. Together we worked 3 hours on the theoretical and practical introduction of Gibson Cloning. We managed to successfully assemble and transform their constructs and had positive results on the next day.
Of course the fun was not missed out. During a team-dinner we got to know Natalie, Fenja and Michael better and had good discussions about several similarities in the iGEM-teams like team compositions, how to embellish the long hours in the lab and general experiences we gained in the competition.
It was not only a great collaboration, but we also had a lot of fun and are very grateful for having gotten to know the iGEM team Freiburg better. We want to thank Freiburg for their help and are very much looking forward to a great time and new experiences in Lyon together.
Collecting Soil Samples for iGEM Team Norwich
As the iGEM team of Norwich worked with the bacteria Streptomyces, which can be found in soil, they wanted to collect samples from all over the world. We found their project very interesting as Streptomyces are an essential organism in our indigoidine project as well. Thus we went to the forest and dug little"

These are the main reasons we have explored running conferences in Second Life.
Some people might ask ""Why not hold a live conference? Why choose Second Life ™?"" In response, the Second Life resource provides an excellent mode of communication in which we can affordably run such an event. The Second Life ™ conference would avoid most of the costs that are required to organize live conferences, such as the booking of venues and travel expenses. Some guest speakers might have busy schedules and they might not be able to attend a live conference. A Second Life ™ conference would also avoid this problem, as the Second Life ™ software is easily accessible over the internet and it does not take much time to become familiar with the online virtual world of Second Life ™. As well, the Second Life has many educational and science-based communities comprised of individuals of various backgrounds that can provide unique insights to discussions held in Second Life. The affordability (it's free!) and accessibility have rendered Second Life as a suitable tool for creating public discussion.
TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION
Over the course of the summer, we have come up with many potential ethical issues that can be explored, based on our own exploration of this year's project, through the application of two frameworks. We used the E3LS framework to analyze the ethical issues surrounding our 2009 iGEM project and synthetic biology itself. E3LS is an acronym for environmental, ethical, economical, legal and social issues. This framework allows us to categorize the ethical issues surrounding synthetic biology and our project and thus making it easier for us to analyze these issues. Some questions that arose when using the E3LS were:
Would our system be cost-efficient (economical issue)?
Could our system be used to threaten bio-security (ethical issue)?
Would there be environmental side effects if we use our system in the environment (environmental issue)?
Should we patent our system or leave it as an open source for others to use (legal issue)?
What would be the society’s opinion on our system and its potential applications (social issue)?
These are some of the ethical issues we had discussed with our team and it would be great if we could get the opinion of other individuals on ethical issues like these. The Second Life ™ ethics conference would be a great platform for discussing ethical issues of a similar vein, as a varied audience (of academics, the general public, ethicists, etc.) would contribute many different viewpoints to such discussions.

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Notebook#SmallPhage#Summerexp_-_-_TEXT.html,"
These two weeks are the interim between summer term and fall semester at BYU. During these two weeks, we focused mostly on finalizing our mutagenesis procedure with the help of Phage Purification Team and their CsCl gradient protocol. We completed our seventh round of mutagenesis and we did see a variability in the size of phage plaques indication variability in phage capsid size. We conducted the eighth round of mutagenesis even more meticulously. Toward the end of these two-week period, we are working on characterizing phage. From our preliminary data, we are seeing the most concentrated phage after mutagenesis so far, which is very promising.

Fig. 5. Change the concentration of fixed nano-antibodies to                                         β2-MG                                         under the condition of immobilizing 500 ng/mL of β2-MG on slide. (a)                                         250ng/mL of                                         β2-MG nano-antibodies (b) 400 ng/mL of β2-MG                                         nano-antibodies                                         (c) 500 ng/mL of β2-MG                                         nano-antibodies (d) 600 ng/mL of β2-MG nano-antibodies
The results shows that when the concentration of β2-MG nano-antibody was 250                             ng/mL, the optical imaging spot of liquid crystal cell was star-shaped, whose quantity was                             more than that of the non-fixed β2-MG antibody, but the change was not obvious.                             When the concentration of β2-MG nano-antibody is above 400 ng/mL, the                             distribution of the optical imaging spot of the liquid crystal cell is similar to the                             phenomena of the concentration of β2-MG nano-antibody which is 400 ng/mL.
3. Determination of the concentration of β2-MG nano antibody
Through the experimental results, we could find that as the concentration of antibody                             increased , the crystal molecular orientation is getting more messy, and the bright spots                             gradually enhance in the optical imaging. However, 400ng/mL is the threshold of the                             concentration of β2-MG nano-antibodies. When the concentration of nano-antibodies                             increases again, the bright spots in the liquid crystal imaging did not enhance                             significantly. Therefore, the lowest antibody concentration at 400ng/mL was selected for the                             immobilization of β2-MG on the substrate surface, which could maintain the                             maximum bright spots in the optical imaging background.
Different effects of common β2-MG nano-antibodies and C18-modified                             β2-MG                             nano-antibodies on optical imaging of liquid crystal cells at the same concentration
1. Standard for the concentration of β2-MG antibody

The presentation given in the Judd medical society was focused on the issue of iron deficiency and excess iron in the body. The talk covered the prevalence of iron deficiency in the developing world and how our project is specifically designed for this demographic. The medical society presentation was a good opportunity to focus on the potential of our project in the real world before our interview with the haematologist. The medical society is attended by students from all years but primarily by sixth form who have an interest in studying medical sciences therefore the talk also covered why healthy iron is so fundamental to life and addressed common misconceptions surrounding anaemia and iron deficiency as well as discussing some of the latest research which illuminates just how harmful excess iron can be in body.

Detailed Description
Bio-glues
Bio adhesives are polymeric materials which are naturally produced from a variety of organisms and have adhesive properties. The monomers of the polymeric bio adhesives consist of a variety of substances, but proteins and carbohydrates are the most common.
Biological adhesion is a phenomenon present in many biological systems. Examples of organisms that produce adhesives can include bacteria, spiders, marine tubeworms, sea cucumbers, barnacles and mussels. These adhesives are well known for being very strong, durable and ecologically safe compared with human-made substances. On top of that, some of them can be applied in an aqueous environment being impervious to water and turbulent forces, they give rise for many qualitative applications.
How do mussels attach themselves to a surface?
At the basis of our project are proteins which are normally produced from blue mussels (Mytilus edulis). Blue mussels produce adhesives comparable in strength to human-made glues . However these adhesives have extra advantages like the absence of carcinogens (formaldehyde) and their ability to sustain adhesive under water. Byssus threads of the blue mussel attach to a (underwater) solid surface due to catechols on adhesive proteins.
The mussel’s byssus is an exogenous attachment structure which was first described in 1711 (Brown 1952 ). Byssus’ main role is the attachment of the organism to surfaces. The byssus is a bundle of extracorporeal threads. This bundle is at the proximal end attached to the mussel’s byssal retractor muscle and at the distal end to a surface by adhesive plaques.
Mytilus edulis has the ability to bind to a very broad range of materials, ranging from glass, plastics,"

As shown above in the gel image, there is still some PCR that needs to be done. It appears apparent that increased concentrations of DMSO and magnesium chloride help the reaction, so the appropriate amount of each was added to the mastermix. The reactions were as follows: TrpB with Kan cassette, TrpA, TrpB, ArgC, and MetA.
Since we were planning to put these into biobricks, it was imperative that we made sure that there were no restriction sites. To do this, we used the NCBI data for the gene sequence and ran it through Nebcutter, searching for all illegal sites. No illegal sites were found in TrpB, TyrA, TrpA, ArgC, or MetA. Lucky.
As shown above, a reaction for the tyrA gene worked. Using this PCR product and the rfp plasmid, we digested with EcoRI and PstI and ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The resultant product was used to transform Epi300 cells. Tomorrow, we will check for white colonies among the red ones, which would suggest that the ligation was successful. A colony PCR will be done to confirm.

It was unknown whether or not the plasmid had any methylation, so DpnI was used only in the PCR product digestion. The procedure will be uploaded to the wiki in the near future. A gel was made showing the ligation products.
3) The biobrick ligation products were used to transform K12 cells and were plated appropriately.
It should be noted that several of the transformations sparked during the electroporation procedure. Some success has been reported with sparked cultures, so they were plated"

Unluckily, we find that there is nothing in the medium of P0440 and R0062, but the transformation of K145270 and E0420 proves to be a success. We have a discussion about the protocol of transformation. After 10 minutes, we doubt that the failure of the transformation results in the incorrect operating of DH5. Then we carefully do the transformation of P0440 and R0062.
21st, Jul
The effort we took yesterday is not in vain. We successfully complete the transformation of P0440 and R0062. Then we begin to pick the right colonies from the medium. After that, we put all the tubes into the shaker and start to shake the bacteria.
22nd, Jul
It is an awful day today, because we have to do the plasmid extraction of K145270, R0062, P0440 and E0420. Without the help of Doctor Chen, the steps of plasmid extraction are too hard for us to complete them without any mistakes. We waste many centrifuge tubes and pipet tips. However, we finally made it.
24th, Jul
After our weekends, we come back to our lab. The task today is to finish the transformation of R0040, K081016.
25th, Jul
Today, we complete the transformation of I0500, K081009, E0430.
27th, Jul
We are puzzled to find that the transformation of I0500 fails. We try to find the reason. After about 15 minutes, we don¡¯t find any mistakes in our procedure. As a result, we contact Doctor Chen. He promises us that he will come tomorrow.
28th, Jul
Today, we have a discussion about the failure of the transformation. Doctor Chen supposes that there is some problem with the Kan medium. So he writes down the medium formula and asks us to make up some Kan mediums. With his help, we learn the method to use the electronic balance. Finally we use our new Kan mediums to do the transformation of I0500.
29th, Jul
We are very disappointed when we take out our mediums. The transformation fails again. Then we decide to find some information from the Internet. Maybe other IGEM teams face the same problem.
August
1st, Aug
After our weekend,we exchange our findings that searched from the Internet.We are very angry when we find that the plasmid doesn¡¯t work.Then,we tell the message to Doctor Chen and begin to find another plasmid to replace I050"

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR"

Excelling on the world stage
Learning from the best – that’s exactly what a group of research-focused students is doing at the University of Lethbridge.
Members of the U of L’s International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) team are part of a phenomenon that began 10 years ago as a course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Today, the annual iGEM contest is the world’s leading undergraduate synthetic biology competition – and each year, U of L students regularly rank among the top iGEM teams worldwide.
University of Lethbridge iGEM students Isaac Ward, Mackenzie Coatham, Harland Brandon and Erin Kelly are among the best young researchers in the world. Courtesy of University of Lethbridge Adancement.
An emerging field, synthetic biology sees cells, enzymes and metabolic pathways as more than biological entities; they’re sophisticated parts that can be programmed like machines to perform specific activities. As a result, research in synthetic biology is opening up remarkable possibilities in such sectors as agriculture, pharmaceutical, medical diagnostics, clean energy and resource extraction. In 2011, for example, U of L students developed a petrochemical-eating bacteria that could be used to help clean up water in tailings ponds, a discovery that placed the University’s iGEM team among the top 16 competitors in the world, alongside students from Harvard University, MIT, the University of Washington and Johns Hopkins University.
This October, the U of L’s iGEM team once again demonstrated its strong innovation abilities. In addition to creating a bioengineering part that works like a zip drive, compressing genetic information, the team developed software that rapidly determines what DNA sequences are compatible to compress together. These inventions, which will allow future bioengineers more flexibility in their research, captured top prize in the 2013 North American iGEM Regional Jamboree held in Toronto. Moreover, the first-place finish secured the team – made up of Dustin Smith (BSc ’13"
Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#10 August 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," $70 000 on top of that!!!). We took a lot of pictures of the land, machines, land marks and the team. We also learned how they scare ducks on their buttemen lakes with cannons. The guides showed us how much off the land was open to mining and explained their oil reserves and compared Canada's total cost/barrel to Saudia Arabia.
Overall, we had tonnes of fun meeting the other iGEM teams, talking to the supervisors and learning about the Fort Mac oil sands. However, we didn't have a chance to sell our project to anyone yet; it was more like, they were trying to promote their businesss. Hopefully, we'll be able to talk about quorum sensing and how iGEM Calgary can build a partnership tomorrow.

Second Life party!
Almost everyone was gone on the oil sands field trip but 3/4 of the Second Life team stayed back to take control. Today our supervisors were also exploring Second Life for the first time. This was great because I realized that some things in the Synthetic Kingdom couldn't be done by others so some permissions needed to be changed. One thing that was completely done today was the oil clean-up station. New features:
Fully functional moving squid
New plate that a person can click on to rez bacteria
Once clicked, plate goes to sleep so people can't rez many bacteria at once
Engineered cell disappears after a set amount of time in case to gets moved to other parts of the island

*Another* description of the oilsands tour
Like most of our team today, I embarked on a very memorable adventure in the Fort McMurray oilsands. It was quite an eye-opening experience: having been in Toronto and southern Alberta for the last few years, the oilsands projects have not been featured in a positive light, so this served as an excellent opportunity to shed some light on the initiative.
We participated in a tour kindly provided by represenatives from SunCor, one of the key players in the oilsands development projects. The guides - a dedicated communications rep and a plant manager (mining engineer by training) - presented a very confident front and were well-versed enough in the subject to answer most of the questions with credibility. It must be noted that I am approaching this with some inherent bias: most of my incoming understanding of these projects was of the environmental devastation that they left in their wake, as well as how the ratio of output to input energy is much lower than most other energy-production endeavours. Many of my questions were answered, but"

Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production"

We'll have to make a liquid culture to get the plasmid tomorrow, digest it to check if the insert has the appropiate length and see if it works. For the last part, we seed the bacteria in a plate with the signal and XGal that should turn blue when lacZ is expressed.

Overview
""Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work."" — Peter Carr, Director of Judging. What’s Human practice? It is not just a work  to confirm and strengthen what we think is right. Instead, we should learn to share our knowledge with the world. We can’t just instill our personal cognition into others, nor can we blindly believe in whatever others say. All in all, human practice is all about “gain, give and mutual interaction”.
First, we build up a system constructed by the three topics below: Project, Us and the World. What we found is that our activities can actually made up a comprehensive interaction (refer to the  picture above) For example, we “gain” professional suggestions from experts in various fields, which have made us think of repositioning our project; To conduct educating, we “give” what we know to those who are laymen in synthetic biology and sugar controlling. Other examples of give and gain also includes marketing and sponsorships. It is also necessary that we set up mutual pathways for knowledges, which are also known as meetups, collaborations and cross-domain communications. Totaling up all of them, we’ve excellently completed human practice.
To achieve our goal, we consult experts in different areas of study

Taiwan has the reputation of “the kingdom of Hem dialysis”. Yes, this is apparently not a thing we should be proud of. A huge sum of money is spent on this problem every year. But, you probably don’t know that a huge ratio of these cases are caused by neither drug abuse nor consuming too much salty food. Instead, diabetes is what may leads to kidney diseases. So, we invited Dr. Wu from the division of nephrology to tell us about the negative effects of diabetes. 
 In the interview, he mentioned that due to hyperglycemia, HHNK and DKA, which may cause headache, nausea, or even drive people into coma, is often found in people with diabetes. Furthermore, hyperglycemia can also cause"

The N-terminal transmembrane α-helix of human EGFR ( UniProt P00533 , amino acids 622-653) was herefore chosen (see below the topology prediction of EGFR via the TMHMM 2.0 server for the prediction of transmembrane helices [5] ). A stop-transfer sequence, that is also present in the endogeneous EGFR, consisting of clustered, positively charged amino acids - being characteristic for type I membrane proteins - was added at the C-terminus, and the sequence was furthermore flanked by a (GGGGC)2-linker at the N- and C-terminus, respectively. The addition of a stop-transfer sequence as in the naturally occuring EGFR sequence, as well as the addition of flexible linkers, makes our EGFR-TMD an improvement over the BioBrick BBa_K157002 , which does not possess either of these elements.

B) Transmembrane domain prediction by the TMHMM 2.0 server , indicating positioning of N- and C-termini out- and inside of the cell, respectively, as well as predicting functionality of transmembrane regions. C) Schematic depiction of the C-terminal stop-transfer sequence of the receptor.
Reporter proteins were included into the design to facilitate later characterization
Moreover, the receptor contains three functional elements for its detection: The intracellularly located red fluorescent protein mRuby 3 for detection of the receptor via fluorescence microscopy, an extracellular epitope domain for immunochemical detection via A3C5-antibody fragments and an intracellular Strep-tag II for the detection and purification via immunochemical methods.
The vector furthermore contains the poly-adenylation signal of human growth hormone (hGH) for functional polyadenylation of the transcribed mRNA. A description for the respective functional elements is given in the following sections.

Techniques to overcome frost or drought
They all  use special techniques to overcome the cold or drought.                     Of the 4 winemakers interviewed, 3 are not agree supporting the use of genetically modified vines to mitigate the impact of climate change.
Winemaker 1 :“Uncertain of how they will change the final product”.
Winemaker 2 :“Prefer to work with the local cultivars”.
Winemaker 3 :“As an old person, it is quite difficult to adapt to new technologies”.
For the question “Would you be willing to use Softershock on your vines to mitigate the impact of climate change?”
3 of the winemakers answered negatively,  for the following reasons:
Winemaker 1 :“It is not quite tested yet. Upon further testing I might be willing to use”.
Winemaker 2 :“Too new and untested. I wouldn't want to meddle with bioengineered systems, they have a bad history and are a pretense for monopolies”.
Winemaker 3 :“As an old person, it is quite difficult to adapt to new technologies”.
Opinion and advices about our project
Winemaker 1 :“Quite useful as thermal changes in the environment are being more drastic lately. However, I think it's a bit insufficient and not quite sure how it would over a wide area of vines. Keep on trying! Seems like a great idea!”.
Winemaker 2 :“We try to use the traditional cultivation methods only, because we are a household vineyard. We are not interested in employing industrial methods”.
Winemaker 3 :“Probably younger generations could use it, given that it will be safe to use and has the provided results. New technology will probably be needed in the future, given the climate change”.
Here are some photos from vineyards in Krini and Trikala from Greece, the photos were provided by the Greece iGEM team.

Education and Public Engagement
We're very proud of our Education and Public Engagement project because we had held two OPEN NIGHT(with network LIVE) and designed the first biology S.T.E.A.M-education course in China in last year. And we made a toolbox for children to experience biological experiment by themselves with the help of Fablab Shanghai. Compared with traditional education, our course, toolbox and OPEN NIGHT spreads knowledge to our society in a way which is interactive, original and easy to understand. So we think these are educational innovations! OPEN NIGHT focus on simplifying knowledge and spreading it accurately to everyone from all the groups. Everyone can come and listen to the lecture without invitation and express their ideas freely. We also had a live webcast so that people who cannot come to OPEN NIGHT can watch our LIVE via live network. As for the S.T.E.A.M course, we have already contacted some high schools in Shanghai and will add this course as a elective course.
Engagement
Model
We think our modeling has the following advantages:  1.  We unite existing solutions which were proved feasible to our project and modeling. And we established a new line with factors which were gained from our experimental data to compare the effect of pest control. We found the deficiencies in the old method and improve them.
2.  Specific reduction destinations are given for the specific problem of pest control.
3.  We have made a great prediction model in a short time and fished out a condition in which we can control the population of pest.
4.  The change of the population in the medium term was simulated by Leslie matrix, which verified the sustainability of the method in controlling pest population.
5.  The expected results obtained by the model are highly operable and feasibility.

While in both cases an increase in fluorescence could be observed, this increase coincided in timing with the exponential increase of growth, suggesting that a higher level of fluorescence was observed due to more cells being present in the medium. Further experiments will have to be done in order to disconnect these 2 variables.
Figure 7: Top: Comparison of relative fluorescence (left) and cell density (right) of MG1655 + pSB1C3-Pchr-gfp (A) + pUniprom-chrB (opt). Botton: Comparison of relative fluorescence (left) and cell density (right) of MG1655 + BBa_K1058008 . In both cases, an increase of both values can be observed at the same time, independently of the additive or the concentration thereof.
The original biobrick and our modified two plasmid system were furthermore compared by western blotting (Fig. 9 and 10). It was found that GFP was produced in the absence of chromate for both systems. This reason for these unexpected results could not be discerned, and further experiments are required to understand those. At this stage of the project the results indicate that ChrB might not be a repressor.
Figure 9: Comparison of presence of GFP in MG1655 + BBa_K1058008 , MG1655 + pSB1C3-Pchr-gfp (A) + pUniprom-chrB, and MG1655 + pSB1C3-Pchr-gfp (A) + pUniprom-chrB (opt). All samples were prepared and diluted to a suitable concentration for western blotting against GFP. PmanA-gfp was included as a positive control.

2013/6/1 From Tianfang
Today we followed Valencia’s protocol, use 30mM and 100mM H2O2 to treat transformed yeast. But we didn’t see fluorescence enhanced compare to control. So I decided to exam the vector to see if any relevant promoter fragment is missed. And I will construct many other vectors containing TEF promoter and TEF terminator. I’ll send the plasmid map to you and start PCR tomorrow.
Sad story: the lad do not have CYC terminator…it’s all my fault. I sent Jinyang the wrong plasmid map. Now we have plan B: 1. Wait for the construction of vectors containing promoter and terminator. 2. Test without terminator. Some of the senior members in my lab do this to express protein and it works.

Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," by OneWorld, UC Berkeley and Amyris, has been largely funded by donations of $42.6m from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  They argue it has ‘become the raison d’être of synthetic biology and given the field a philanthropic sheen’.  They suggested that its results have been greatly inflated to keep up funding, which simultaneously undercuts funding going to what they argue are more effective programs and ruining farmers in the third world who rely on growing wormwood for artemisinin, thus concentrating the supply and power ever more in the hands of multinational corporations. (ETC Group, 2007).  Furthermore when the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended artemisinin should be integrated with other anti-malarial drugs in ‘Artemisinin Combination Therapies (ACTs), to ensure that resistance does not build up’(Balmer, 2008) which seems a reasonable action, but as they continue, ‘However, ETC argues that Novartis has a virtual monopoly on ACTs and quote the Royal Tropical Institute of the Netherlands ‘This monopoly-like situation has created an imperfect market defined by scarcity of raw materials, speculation and extremely high retail prices’’.  However, polemically, ETC didn’t acknowledge (to the best of my knowledge), the role Novartis at least has played in providing qinghao (wormwood) to developing countries free or at cost (Stiglitz, 2006).   It could also be countered that the production of artemisinin through synthetic biology would help lower the cost, however this is uncertain, but what is certain would be the ruination of wormwood production in developing nations and inability for local, competitive production of anti-malarial products which will only reinforce monopolies and the ensuing discrepancy of wealth and health.  This sentiment is echoed across a range of reviews ‘there are other ways of reducing malaria mortality that would not make people in developing countries dependent on companies in rich countries’ (IDEA League, 2007).  It may be sensible to recall as Milton Friedman said “Concentrated power is not rendered harmless by the good intentions of those who create it.”
The ethics of all this?  It is currently popular to describe and aspire towards “sustainable development”, a decidedly vague term at best (Ferry, 2007).  However this takes as an assumption that economic expansion, labelled development is always our objective.  This has been regardless of the effects of mass urbanization and industrial agriculture throughout much of the developing world.  You cannot seriously argue that business"

Macquarie_Australia,2010,Team:Macquarie Australia#human practice and “to help another iGEM team” titles_-_-_TEXT.html," Yagiz Alp asked “why don’t we use our light switch system to screen and select your antibodies?”. Because the Macquarie’s E. coli light switch is designed to serve as a fundamental biobrick to be used in variety of biomolecular applications including screening and specific selecting of proteins and Tsinghua’s antibodies requires a simply screening and selection method. GU Xiang was very pleased to hear about that suggestion. After discussing the specific ways that how Macquarie can help Tsinghua Team to screen and select their antibodies, GU Xiang kindly accepted Macquarie Team’s offer which was the beginning of two teams’ collaboration.
Hilal, Yagiz and GU Xiang in Collaboration
They took the first step of their collaboration together by running that day’s experiments with GU Xiang at Macquarie iGEM Labs. “It was the one of the best moments of my day to help Macquarie Team with their experiments in their world- leading class level labs” commented GU Xiang. “By integrating such an important part of our projects, we, not only help each other but also complete each other’s project with harmony which is the best that we can get out of the iGEM” said Hilal. They have finished the day with social activities where they found chance to learn scents from Chinese and Aussie cultures.
Macquarie iGEM Team is honored to have GU Xiang in Sydney and cooperate with Tsinghua Team.

“It would be great to see some sort of organization like this! I     agree that unavailable parts should be followed up on and removed if     necessary. I also think that parts which are not sufficiently documented     should be highlighted in some way. Once these parts are identified,     teams can actively characterize them as part of their projects or as     side projects.”
“Think about these things: (i) who decides when a part is out-dated,     and how can that person know that an old part cannot have a novel use     in the future? (ii) likewise, an uncharacterized part may be both characterized     and used in the future”
We suggest building a backup system, such as an archive, to sort     out the rarely used, un-available and un-categorized parts until they     are in line with the enforced standards.
91% of participants have same opinion with us, which      is that standardization of the nomenclatures used for each different      composition of parts is necessary.
Standards that should be enforced and Additional New Standards
According to our survey, from high rated to low, these standards     have been rated which has been used while assigning a name to parts
33% Type of part
17% Input
17% Output
14% Version
10% Year
9% Group
Along with above, having short recognizable part names along with     function and performance , Genbank/EMBL link and organism information     is important.
93% of participants have said that for the parts that      are marked as “WORKS” distinguishing the parts with quantitative      experimental validation vs parts without this information is important. Most participants have encountered with similar problems about parts      that don’t work under their lab conditions or works but not they      were claimed for.
89% of participants have same opinion with us, which      is that iGEM should sub-categorize the “WORKS” comment into 1) “Quantitative”      for parts which are characterized with experiments and 2) “Qualitative”      for parts which are not characterized will be an appropriate measure      for standardization of Biobrick database.
In order to overcome these problems we suggest enforcing the working     conditions title for the registry entrance, in order to collect quantitative     experimental details on submitted parts, which might slow down the registration     process but will definitely increase the quality of the database.
61% of participants agree that POPS (Polymerase Per      Second) should be assigned to every part or biobricks with a promoter,      where appropriate. - 57% of participants have been agree that"

SYNBIO MAP
SynBio Map is a tool created to identify and locate companies, universities, research institutions, laboratories and other centers across the globe  active in synthetic biology research, from the Synthetic Biology Project . It is a good tool to compare the development of synthetic biology all around the world. This map was created by the Synthetic Biology Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. However the SyBio Map is under represented due to the fact that institutions need to be detectable by registration in the site project. Here we want to encourage labs, universities, companies and everyone working on SynBio to register at the ADD ITEM , doing so you can map your SynBio initiative!
In Brazil, as in whole South America, SynBio Map does not show the actual scenario in the field of Synthetic Biology. There are only three organizations added on, all located in São Paulo. Two of them at the University of São Paulo (USP), and the third one is a company.However we know there is initiatives throughout the country, as in the States of Amazonas, Pernambuco, Minas Gerais and more in São Paulo than is listed, just to mention few of them. Below follow a list of the SynBio groups registered at the Brazilian Research Council (CNPq):

We have begun preliminary research and development of our product. Thus far, we have expressed, purified and stored one of the proteins (protein A) with which we will develop BEAR. Currently, we are in the process of expressing our second protein (Protein B) of interest. We cannot release the names of the proteins at this time in order to protect our intellectual property.
Figure 1. Overexpression 15% SDS-PAGE of Protein A.        It is approximately 32 kDa in size though it appears to be appoximately 35 kDa in size.
Figure 2. Overexpression 15% SDS-PAGE of Protein B. The overexpression was not successful under the conditions we used. We will conduct several test expressions at lower temperature, lower IPTG concentration, and induce expression at different cell concentrations.

Start the Journey !
These days, the whole bioeconomy is dependent on one valuable resource: sugars. No matter if they are produced from starch or cellulose, they always originate from plants. But while the global demand for carbon sources is growing, the arable land is shrinking and droughts are more frequent.
At iGEM Aachen, we aim to make the bioeconomy independent from plant-derived sugars. We do this by teaching E. coli to use methanol as a carbon source and convert it to glycogen, the bacterial equivalent to starch.
Therefore, we introduce a synthetic pathway, implementing it in vivo for the first time.
For this kind of metabolic engineering research, chemostat cultivation of candidate strains is essential. However, traditional continous cultivations are very costly and not affordable for everyone. To solve this problem, we are developing a do-it-yourself bioreactor with very low culture volume. This bioreactor is accompanied by hardware and software that is cost-effective and user-friendly.
Concering the DIY principle of our modular selfmade bioreactor we established contacts to community labs to discuss about the developement of the European Community Lab Scene.
Regarding biosafety in the lab we tested and discussed our new documentation system with other teams to explore the technology and experiences.

Motivation
When we first started with extensive literature research at the beginning of the project, we came across an interesting paper about an ATP neutral cycle for methanol uptake. [1] Right from the beginning we saw the great potential of methanol as a carbon source that is currently produced in large amounts but only partially used for fuels"
XMU-China,2018,Team:XMU-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"combination method to transform the circuit into the genome of DH5α. Hence, DH5α would be improved and preserved easily.
After discussion, we decided to add mRFP or blue chromoprotein to the SAHS part for selecting E. coli transfected successfully. Since SAHS protein is an exogenous protein, it is preceded by a signal peptide, which allows it to pass through the cell membrane. We removed the LB medium by centrifugation and harvested our proteins in high concentration. As a protective agent, SAHS can prevent Cas12a from lyophilization.
Expectation
A new E.coli strain
We intend to transform the circuit into the genome of DH5α. Hence, DH5α would be improved and preserved easily. In this way, E. coli DH5α can be transported normally and easily.
A new way to preserve protein
We hope that the purified TDPs can be used to preserve proteins and other biological materials.

BostonU,2017,Team:BostonU#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," Mars has a 25-hour day-night cycle. Future human inhabitants on Mars may face metabolic and other health problems in this new environment, a change analogous to being jet-lagged every day.
Scenario: A Martian-born human baby has been modified in utero to have its circadian clock reset to the 25-hour Martian day-night cycle. The baby's biological functions will now be synchronized perfectly with those of its new home planet.
 
 
Outreach: Summer Pathways
In June, we partnered with STEM Pathways and the BostonU Hardware team to host Summer Pathways, a synthetic biology Workshop for high school girls interested in STEM fields. We organized and led four interactive activities to introduce them to synthetic biology.
Our activities included a bioethics forum, a plasmid design activity, gel electrophoresis with food coloring, and a microfluidic design activity. The bioethics forum was led by Steve, Sophia, and Manu. They held a fishbowl discussion about controversial issues in synthetic biology such as CRISPR and germline gene editing. The forum allowed us to hear opinions about synbio from those outside the field.
Thomas and Jason, a member of STEM Pathways, led a plasmid design activity in which they introduced the girls to plasmids, primers, and restriction enzymes. After the participants constructed plasmids using construction paper and scissors, Thomas and Jason demoed Benchling, the software we use to design plasmids in our lab.
The third station, gel electrophoresis with food dye, was adapted from William and Mary's 2015 Synthetic Biology K-12 curriculum. In this activity, Abbey, Sai, and Madeline discussed the basic biology and protocol of gel electrophoresis. Each participant then loaded a sample of food dye into a gel with a disposable pipette. The final activity, microfluidic design, was led by the BostonU Hardware team. The team first gave a basic overview of what microfluidics are and what applications they have in synbio. The participants were then given a basic protocol for E. coli transformation and challenged to design their own microfluidic chip on cardboard to perform the procedure.

Industry Visits
In August, we visited Ginkgo Bioworks in Boston's Seaport District. We toured their lab facilities, and were impressed by their automated workflow. We were shown some projects relating to synthetic fragrances and toured the workbench of Natzai Audrey Chieza , Ginkgo's current artist-in-residence, who uses bacteria to dye fabrics. Afterwards,"
