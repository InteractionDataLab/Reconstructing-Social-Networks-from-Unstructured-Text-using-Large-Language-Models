Triumph beim studentischen Bioingenieur-Wettbewerb iGEM in Boston: Das Team aus München hat mit seinem Zell-3D-Drucker den Gesamtsieg abgeräumt.
Riesen-Legostein nach München geholt
Die 13 deutschen Teams kehren mit reichlich Medaillen und Titeln von dem Megaevent an der US-Ostküste zurück: Für die hiesigen Teams gab es fünfmal Gold, sechsmal Silber und zweimal Bronze. Das Team Hamburg sahnte zudem den begehrten „iGEMers Prize“ ab, der von den Teilnehmern vergeben wird.
Damit geht die begehrte iGEM-Trophäe, der silberne Riesen-Legostein, wieder einmal nach Deutschland. In den Jahren 2013 und 2014 standen die iGEMer aus Heidelberg ganz oben auf dem Treppchen der akademischen ""Bio-Konstrukteurs-WM"". Team München überzeugte in der Ü23-Kategorie ""Overgraduate"" diesmal auf ganzer Linie. Die Studierenden, in Boston traditionell in Dirndl und Lederhosen unterwegs, hatten für einen 3D-Drucker eine neuartige Biotech-Tinte (biotINK) aus Zellen kreiert. Dank einer raffinierten molekularen Klebetechnik gelingt es damit, Zellen stabil und gezielt auf Oberflächen zu drucken und somit 3D-Gewebe herzustellen.
Mit ihrem Projekt verwiesen die Münchener die enorme Konkurrenz auf die Plätze. Auf Rang zwei in der Gesamtwertung von iGEM landete das Team der Uni Wageningen mit einem Bienenschutzmittel gegen die Varroa-Milbe. Neben einer Goldmedaille wurde das TUM-LMU-Team auch noch mit Sonderpreisen für „Best Hardware“, „Best Software“ und das „Best manufacturing project“ ausgezeichnet.

UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html,"acycline induced promoter. The mScarlet gene on each plasmid was tagged with a different protein degradation sequence of varying strength. Plasmid F contained the genetic circuitry for expression of the non-endogenous mf-Lon protease under the control of a lactose inducible promoter. Both plasmids also contained constitutive expression systems for their respective repressor proteins (TetR and LacI).
Upon receiving the DNA samples from William and Mary, plasmids A-E were cotransformed alongside plasmid F. Colonies from these plates were grown overnight to maximum culture density and then reinoculated into fresh LB broth at a 1:20 dilution. These cultures were grown at 37 C 220 rpm for about two hours to allow for the cells to reach log phase. Following this, each cotransformant culture was split in half with one half being induced with anhydrotetracycline (ATC) to a final concentration of 50 ng/mL while the other half was induced with ATC and IPTG to final concentrations of 50 ng/mL and 0.1 mM respectively. This meant that for each system (A-E + F) there were two testing groups. One where only mScarlet expression was induced and one where mScarlet was induced alongside the mf-Lon protease.
Following induction, samples were loaded into a 96 well plate and placed into an incubated plate reader set at 37 C. Fluorescence at an excitation of 569 nm with emission at 593 nm was measured every 10 minutes over a three hour time course. Shaking occurred between measurements. Fluorescence readings were then normalized against OD700 readings taken prior to and after the sampling period with the OD700 readings in the middle time points being approximated via linear regression.
Based on these graphs, we can see that steady states of fluorescence were achieved in several of the test groups after approximately 2 hours. These findings agree with the data collected by William and Mary, thereby acting to support the notion that their system is effective in controlling gene expression speed. It should be noted that the data collected for the B + F test does not appear to be reliable. Normalized fluorescence at time point 0 should have been identical between the two induction groups. The fact that it is not points to a high likelihood of experimental error in the testing of this particular device. Time was not available for the conduction of another test.

Washington University in Saint Louis has a history of volunteer activities at The Youth Learning Center (YLC) in the Central West End in Saint Louis. Many WashU students function as volunteer mentors, tutors, or assistants at the YLC. This year's WashU iGEM team will be traveling to the YLC to give a demonstration, lesson, experiment, and survey to a group of 6th through 8th graders.
We will end with a survey to gain knowledge of the kids' interest in the study of the sciences, how informative they found our presentation, and how it can be improved in their eyes.

Figure 7: Model for how TlpB Senses Acid: In low pH conditions (shown on the left), TlpB’s periplasmic domain is ina ‘‘relaxed’’ or expanded state due to decreased hydrogen bonding to ureaand consequent lowered urea-binding affinity. However, in high or moreneutral pH conditions, TlpB’s periplasmic domain is in a ‘‘tense’’ or condensedstate with increased urea-binding affinity. The state of the periplasmic domainis relayed through the transmembrane region, which affects CheA’s phosphorylationstate, ultimately affecting the flagellar motor and dictating stoppingbehavior. TlpB dimer is shown in orange, CheA in red, CheW in green, urea inpurple, protons in blue, and phosphate in black..
By sequence analysis, H. pylori TlpB is organized like a typical member of the MCP superfamily of transmembrane receptors with two transmembrane helices (tm1, tm2) per subunit bracketing an extracellularsensing domain[2,7]. The extracellular-sensing domain is responsible for detecting ligands directly or indirectly via interactions with periplasmic-binding proteins. Continuing from tm2, the C-terminal portion of the MCP is cytoplasmic and mostly helical. It contains a histidine kinase, adenylyl cyclase, methyl-binding protein, phosphatase (HAMP) domain, followed by a helical domain and a segment that binds to the CheA/CheW histidine autoki-nase complex[2,8]. Phosphorylation of CheA in response to an extracellular signal in turn controls downstream compo-nents that modulate activity of the flagellar motor. MCPs dimerize at the membrane, forming a four helix bundle with ligand-binding domains in the periplasm, whereas trimers of dimers assemble with CheA and CheW to form a high-perfor-mance signaling array located in the cytoplasm[2,9].

Dr. Robert J Meagher, Sandia National Laboratories
Dr. Meagher has worked in the field of microfluidics in POC diagnostics. He was eager to read our kit design proposal and offer valuable feedback. He clarified several aspects on the heating of the kit, such as the need to control the temperature in order to avoid overshoots and oscillations that might affect our mechanism. Dr. Meagher also suggested that a simple custom-made heat element from ceramic resistors, combined with a piece of aluminum to spread the heat, would be efficient and cost-effective.
He also offered us his view on the reusability of the kit, advising us on designing half the kit reusable and half disposable: the heater and the electronics will be reused and everything that comes in contact with the sample will be discarded, to avoid carryover contamination.
Future perspectives: Our kit as a generalized platform to assist viral detection
The detection mechanism we have chosen to implement for the detection of MERS-CoV is highly flexible, as it can also be applied to the diagnosis of other diseases. Toehold switches can be designed to respond to any RNA sequence; applications of this technology in Ebola[1] and Zika diagnosis [2] have already been published. Toehold switches could even be used to bind and sense microRNA molecules that are characteristic of cancer or metabolic disorders [3].
In our effort to explore the potential of toehold switches and use them to good advantage, we thought of developing a similar molecular test for the detection of West Nile virus (WNV). According to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, a threefold increase in human cases of WNV infections has been reported this year, with 1266 cases in European Union Member States, 261 of which in our country, Greece.
To evaluate these ideas, we met with Helen Giamarellou, Professor of Internal Medicine at the Athens University Medical School and infectious diseases specialist currently working at the Hygeia Hospital, and discussed the application of this mechanism on MERS-CoV and other possible viruses. Regarding MERS-CoV, Prof Giamarellou confirmed the need for rapid mass testing in POC facilities and airports, so as to immediately diagnose international travelers that show symptoms of infection. However, she had reservations about the use of toehold switches in the detection of WNV. This virus does not remain inside the host cells for long periods and therefore, it is generally recommended to detect the antibodies and not the viral RNA.
On the other hand, Prof Giamarellou expressed particular interest in the application of this diagnostic method in influenza"

The final point raised was: we (as scientists) chose to work on synthetic biology because we have a lot of expectations but what about a renovation of the SB movement? Or should it continue as it is? And who would decide for us?
We find that, in the end, their debate revolved around the essence of SB whether it is a tool or a proper scientific field. This question brings about all the issues of decision processes and risks versus benefits assessment.
Step 2: Synthesize information and spark debates
Once the data retrieved and some information obtained on the nature of the themes and some knowledge about the questions treated we started to get interested in the patents matter. We decided not to treat ethics any further since we had the Grenoble debate video. The theme patents has been treated a few times only which is surprising since it seems to be a crucial theme for the good progress of iGEM projects in an open-source manner. It must be noted that the following text may not represent the profound opinion and beliefs of all the members of the team, however it created a sort of consensus when we debated. The debates were hold on a non-official basis the whole team participated. By no means this is a complete overview of the matter but it brings together the thought and information we had so far. This is obviously an ongoing debate.
On the matter of patents and patentability: basics
It ought to be mentioned that there is no need for an extensive survey of the literature to get a grasp of what the issue revolves around. Conceptually, it is mostly an opposition of private versus public good or reward versus exclusivity. Here, I present a view that is clearly from the narrow point of view of students in research and participants in the iGEM competition.
The process in and of itself had been created to reward an inventor by allowing him exclusive economic benefits for usually twenty years. The European criterion is as follows:
Art. 52(1): ” European patents are granted for inventions that are new, involve an inventive step and are susceptible of industrial application. An invention can belong to any field of technology » 1
This is quite vague and probably inadequate as we will see later. From my understanding, in regards to patentability of the living, treatment methods on animals and humans are not patentable while the molecules used are. Naturally occurring organisms are also excluded. However, and this is where it is most relevant to us is the point about micro"
Valencia,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#modeling1_-_-_TEXT.html," nonlinear with respect to parameters K1 and n, we applied a global optimization algorithm based on stochastic search. Actually we applied it to fit the data at t=60 min, and t=120 min independently. The estimated parameters were:
The results can be seen in figures 7 (t60), and 8 (t120) respectively.
Figure 7.
Model and experimental data for t=60min.
Figure 8.
Model and experimental data for t=120min.
Compare this results with Are you hot? results .
One  question of interest is whether  the increment observed in the ratio IF/OD is caused by an incement of fluorescence during the time elapsed, or it is caused by a varying dilution effect due to a decrease in the specific groth rate during that period [1].
To answer this question notice that the absolute growth rate can be obtained from the regression model OD(t)= p1+p2*t obtained above. Notice t is expressed in minutes in our model. Indeed, the specific growth rate at time instant t can be roughly estimated as mu(t)= [dOD(t)/dt]/OD(t). This gives mu(t) = p2*60/(p1+p2*t) if mu(t) expressed in h^(-1).
Therefore, we took our models and weighted them by mu(t60) and mu(t120) respectively. The result can be seen in figure 6. Indeed, the increment observed in fluorescence from t=60 to t=120 minutes could have been caused by a dillution effect. Of course, the main point to keep is that the ratio IF/OD (or, alternatively IF/OD*mu(t)) increases with temperature. So...our construction works!

Since the measured absorbance was not lower that the control with no venom, it is clear from table 3 that the amilCP was not degraded by any of the three snake venoms. In conclusion this means that it is safe to use amilCP as a reporter molecule in our device with snake venom.
Test of lacZ degradation by venom
As in the test for amilCP stability in venom, the reporter enzyme β-galactosidase, which is used in the composite part (BBa_K2355313), was incubated in venom to test whether or not venom incubation would degrade or otherwise interfere with the activity of the enzyme. After 70 minutes of incubation at 37°C, the activity of venom-incubated lacZ was measured using ONPG (1.5 mg/mL) and a spectrophotometer. The result can be seen in figure 17.
Figure 17: the activity of β-galactosidase is measured in the presence of different snake venoms. NN: Naja nigricollis, BA: Bitis arietans, BG: Bitis gabonica. Brij is the buffer that the snake venom was dissolved in.
The activity of β-galactosidase is not decreased in the presence of the chosen snake venoms as seen in figure 17, suggesting that it is not degraded by the protease activity of the venoms. This makes it a suitable candidate as an amplification molecule for our device.
Assembly of linkers derived from substrate screening and literature
The linkers found by screening was ordered as oligonucleotides from IDT. The oligos were annealed to each other by heating it up to 94°C for 2 minutes and then gradually cooled.  The linker part BBa_K2355001 was ordered as a gBlock from IDT. The linkers were assembled by digestion, ligation and transformation.
For verification a digestion of the purified plasmid was made.   All linkers were single digested first with Eco"

BostonU,2017,Team:BostonU HW#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," Thus, the design rule was updated to be more relaxed and accurate for the Makerfluidics workflow.
Primitive locations can be set in the X and/or Y direction. When designing a chip using Fluigi’s place and route system, primitives are defined by the user but the location and connections of these elements of these primitives are determined by Fluigi’s place and route system. However, for some designs the location of primitives must be in specific locations. Fluigi contains a function that allows primitives to be locked in place, the set function, however this function requires both an X and Y coordinate. For some designs, only one of these coordinates is known or required. To accommodate this, Fluigi’s pre-existing “set” design rules was updated to allow the user to set a primitive’s X coordinate, Y coordinate, or both. This updated design rule made the “set” function more practical to use.
Subtle routing changes were added to make designs more practical and functional. Fluigi’s place and route system is effective at connecting primitives with channels, however, it did not always make these connections in the most practical or functional ways. For example, random bends or “kinks” would sometimes be added to channels during the routing process. While a chip with random bends is still a valid design, it may not necessarily be practical as these bends may affect fluid flow. Fluigi’s design rules regarding bend tolerance have been progressively increase over time, thus limiting the amount of unnecessary bends that can be added to a design.
The impact of these improved design rules can be seen in the two Fluigi-routed chips below. On the left is an output design for eColiBasic5. This chip was designed and routed prior to many of these improvements being implemented. While this chip represents a valid design, it is not optimized or practical due to bends and port location issues. On the right is an output design for eColiBasic6 following the implementation of the previously identified improvements. The MINT code for these two microfluidic chips is nearly identical, but the outputs are entirely different. eColiBasic6 is a cleaner, more practical and functional design that can be manufactured and tested.
eColiBasic5
This chip was designed and routed in an earlier version of Fluigi in which the design rules had not been updated.
This output is not ideal as it has many unnecessary bends make the design impractical for real life usage. Fluigi's design rule limitations also made it so that elements of the final design could not be included, such as properly connected ports in the middle of the device.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help from"

Plans, Possibilities
The remotely activated transcription factor concept can be used to construct highly complex synthetic biological systems, for us it was a very appealing concept. Physicians may use fruit fly hormones in humans to titrate specific genes in gene therapy patient in selected tissue, such as dopamine receptor genes in schizophrenia. Worm species that can synthesize a different color reaction based on the amount of environmental pollutants in the soil they live. Scientists may induce stem cell pluripotency by titrating the exact amount of oncogenes needed for a fibroblast to turn into an embryo.
The defenite next step would be to add DBD's to the registry, or more exact a way for users to synthesize a DNA binding domain according to their sequance of interest. DNA binding domains are themselves modular from sybdomains as: helix loop helix, leucine zippers, helix turn helix and zinc fingers (the most popular subdomains). Once our team assembles a zinc finger toolkit with carefull construction instructions, a user could in vitro or in silico assemble and predict where in the genome his artificial transcription factor/ nuclear receptor will act on gene expression. In the future this will allow full freedom of harnesing the potency of artificial titratable transcription factors.

In addition to that, cells expressing NLS-Dronpa show a higher fluorescence intensity than the NLS-Dronpa expressing cells. Possibly,  the Dronpa proteins are localized to the nucleus and cannot be degraded as efficiently as the Dronpa proteins located in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, one can see that the resuspension media does not have an effect.
In order to characterise Dronpa we tried to express it in E. coli and afterwards purify it. Therefore, we cloned the coding sequence of Dronpa in the pETue, previously known as pETblue vector and transformed the vector in BL21(DE3) E. coli. The pETue vector introduces an N-terminal 6xHis-tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site to the inserted DNA fragment.
A liquid culture was inoculated with BL21(DE) bacteria containing the pETue-Dronpa construct. The culture was grown to an OD600 of 0.8 and the cells were then induced by adding 0.5 mM IPTG and shifted to 25°C overnight.
Induced and uninduced cells were pelleted, lysed and loaded on a 10% acrylamide gel (see figure 2).
Figure 2: Test expression of E. coli containing the pETue-Dronpa construct.
The induced cells show an additional band at around 25 kDa, which cannot be seen in the non-induced cells.
We then tried to purify 6xHis-Dronpa in a larger scale experiment. We used the same expression conditions as before. Then, the cells were pelleted and lysis was performed using the sonicator. After that, the lysate was centrifuged to remove the insoluble parts and incubated was incubated with Ni-NTA beads at 4°C. We eluted the proteins from the beads by using buffer supplemented with 200 mM imidazole (compare figure 3).
Figure 3: Purification of 6xHis tagged Dronpa.
It can be observed  that the His-tagged Dronpa protein is clearly visible in the soluble, flow through and wash fractions. Unfortunately, almost all protein is lost during the washing procedure. Milder washing conditions could probably improve the protein yield. Due to time constraints, the purification could not be repeated.
Pulldown of Dronpa with the GFP-trap
As the GFP-trap offers an easy purification method for all GFP-tagged proteins, we wondered whether it would also bind to Dronpa, as it"

有人认为现代生物技术包括合成生物学技术会对人类社会安全带来严重问题。你是否同意这个观点？
Modern biotechnologies have developed of human society in many ways, for example clinical treatment, biofuels and GMOs. Nonetheless, some people worrys that biotechnologies may cause ethic or safe problem in human society. Hence, we ask people this question to find their opinions about biotechnologies. Result was that 32.5% of people agreed that synthetic biotechnology may cause safe problems. While, 28.75% of people considered it was absolutely safe. However, over one third people were not sure that if it had positive effect or negative effect. We thought that many people in China did not accept biotechnology, they worry that it would be harmful to their heath. We should do more work to ensure the safety of biotechnology so that more people will trust it.
Question 5
What do you think is the current situation of global climate?
你觉得目前全球气候的状况是怎样的？
We wanted to find Chinese people’ views on climate change. Results are that over a half of people considered that the situation of global warming was quite serious and almost half of people felt that climate is changing currently. Particularly, there was nobody thinking that the climate is as same as many years ago. Therefore, we can know Chinese people still care about the climate and had similar view that climate is changing currently.
Question 6
Which of the following item do you think is the main cause of greenhouse effect?
你觉得什么是造成温室效应最大的原因?
We asked reasons for climate change, the majority of people thought we destoryed the environment and a few people considered it was the automatical process of on Earth's development.
Question 7
Which behavior do you think will intensify the greenhouse effect?
你认为社会上哪些行为会加重温室效应？
According to the result, industrial pollution is considered as the most serious issue on environmnet as well as the most significant reason of the climate change. Also, people thought that the reducing vegetation and the destruction of eco-environment caused global warming. They did not view the urbanization and garbage were the main reasons.

Wanting to improve last year's forum, we held a seminar together with East Chapel Hill High iGEM team and the Museum of Life and Science to discuss future outreach projects as well as how to improve our success in engaging a diversity of thoughts. Our mosquito forum from last year drew primarily from Duke University and thus most people already came from a very scientific background. A variety of backgrounds and point of views is essential to having an engaging and meaningful forum.
We discussed with Chapel Hill and the Museum of Life and Sciences on collaborating to create forums in the future that can achieve this goal. During this seminar we examined the the incredible gap of opinion between the general public and scientist communities, and conversed about how scientific communities must create spaces to speak with and hear public opinion surrounding genetic engineering topics. We deliberated about appropriate ways to engage the public in learning about the scientific process and the research already being done with genome-editing technologies. We concluded that one of the most important goals of such public engagement is the interaction between trained scientists and laymen - this gives ""science"" a human face and allows researchers to learn from perspectives not often considered in their daily work or by their colleagues.  The key structure of a forum is that it is NOT a lecture, but rather a chance for opposing sides to discuss; this enables scientists to reach out to people not accustomed to academic settings.
We also discussed price structuring to improve attendance in such public engagement forums. From what the museum found in their past experience, charging people a nominal fee encouraged a higher retention rate but saw an attendance consisting of people already knowledgeable and interested in the topic such as local scientists and graduate students. Making the event free, however, saw a dramatic drop in attendance since there was nothing to disincentivize dropping out the day of the event. What is important is to find a balance between maintaining acceptable retention of attendees but also keeping the event open to all community members. This often requires grant funding to attract a crowd diverse enough to have representative opinions ("

“Completing my Nuffield Research Placement with the Warwick iGEM team reaffirm my decision to study a Biology-related degree at university. I have discovered Biology beyond the syllabus of my A-level studies, further helping me to prepare for my Year 13 exams. In addition, the lab work experiences I gained during the placement, for example completing gel electrophoresis and PCR, will assist my application to university. Working with the team has made me more aware of what university life is like; during my 5 weeks here I have learnt more about self-management and independence. I am now far more comfortable exploring biology on my own, having been encouraged to read research papers to gain greater background knowledge of the team project. This placement has given me a deeper understanding of what working in research is like; it is now something I hope to explore further.” – Gurpreet Dhaliwal, Nuffield Research Student.
Warwick University Open Day
On the 24th of September, the Warwick iGEM team collaborated with the teams from Cardiff University and the University of Sheffield to educate potential undergraduate students about the rising field of synthetic biology. We felt it was important to highlight the significance of iGEM with regards to the progression of understanding and innovation of biology as an engineering discipline. As part of this event, we explained our projects and designs in conjunction with presenting our posters, enabling us to develop our ability to effectively communicate scientific concepts to members of the public that had not necessarily previously been exposed to advanced science.

On the 28th of September, members of the Warwick iGEM team aided in hosting a SynBio CDT PhD Cohort training session, where the objective was to brainstorm a problem that could be solved using synthetic biology – very similarly to how our iGEM project started. As part of this, we gave a presentation explaining the iGEM competition, elaborating on how to successfully brainstorm a project by approaching the problem with an engineering perspective, and more specifically - what our project entails, and our personal experiences.
After the presentation, the PhD students split into 3 teams, each with an iGEM member. In these teams, the students attempted to brainstorm a project that would be rewarded funding in a real life scenario, whilst trying"

Fig.1  Farmers release nutrient (graphed in green) into surrounding grids
Placing Warriors
When placed, warriors eject AHLs to surrounding 3×3 grids, and the amount in each grid increases by 1; Then the amount of AHL molecule will hold on until the farmer is removed. When warriors being removed, the amount decreases by 1.
Fig.2  Warriors release AHLs (graphed in red) into surrounding grids
Iteration rules
In the i_k-th iteration, our program traverses the whole mesh grid and checks for two missions: death penalty and probabilistic growth based on states of the i_(k-1)-th iteration. We may call the grid which the program is checking ‘present grid’ for convenience.
Death Penalty
There are two and only two cases which causes cell death: nutrient in present grid is depleted; or there are enemy AHLs in present grid. It is noted that farmers cannot die of case I because they create nutrient themselves. As for case II, when AHL-I and AHL-II are in adjacent grid and the colony inside the grid is warrior, one of them will be killed (randomly).
Another mission during iteration is to simulate bacterial growth. Concentration of AHL is excluded in this section, because it only functions in Death Penalty part. Since nutrient contribute to cell growth, a natural idea is to set a probabilistic model of any empty grid, described by a linear equation:
Where (x,y) are coordinates of present grid, P_k (x,y) is the probability an adjacent cell can grow into present grid in i_k-th iteration, C_k (x,y) is concentration of nutrient in present grid in i_k-th iteration, α is a coefficient that remains unchanged during simulation. We have tried different values of α and eventually set α=0.013 to fit experimental results well.
This equation helps our program to judge whether or not an adjacent cell can grow into present grid in i_k-th iteration; after this judgement is settled, we choose randomly from surrounding grids that have cells in them, supposing we select cell A, and inherit its cell type to get clone cell B in present grid. Now we see cell A successfully ‘grow’ into present grid and has its duplicate cell B. Note that when B is generated, aforementioned placement rules will be applied according to B’s type and position.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With"

""Years from now we will treat most infections with bacteria and not antibiotics.""
Professor James Malone-Lee
Barlow Professor of Geriatric Medicine
A solution is urgently needed for the increasing number of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The engineering of bacterial cells to fight human pathogens is a promising alternative to administering traditional antibiotics. Our project involves the use of synthetic biology to engineer living therapeutics that have the potential to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs), which are a major public health concern in developed countries. This is largely due to growing antibiotic resistance.
The Problem
Antibiotics have negative side effects and their resistance is a growing problem
UTIs are the most common hospital-acquired infection and the bacteria that cause them are frequently resistant to antibiotics
Antibiotic resistance in UTIs is caused by biofilms
Biofilms are currently estimated to be responsible for over 65% of all hospital-acquired infections
Current UTI treatments are ineffective and fail to prevent recurrent infections
Problem with Antibiotics
Antibiotic use is associated with numerous negative side effects, allergies and reactions. The most common side effects of antibiotics all impact the digestive system and occur in around one in ten people. Around one person in fifteen has an allergic reaction to antibiotics, especially penicillin and cephalosphorins [ 10 ]. Half of the patients we spoke to during our project wanted us to find an alternative to using antibiotics, owing to the severity of the negative side effects that they experience.
Despite their negative side effects, antibiotics have been used so widely and for so long that the targeted microbes have adapted to become resistant, reducing the effectiveness of the drugs. A vicious cycle ensues in which ineffective antibiotic treatments leads to overprescription and overexposure, which amplifies the problem of antibiotic resistance. Global antibiotic consumption grew by 30% between 2000 and 2010. [ 27 ] Described by the Chief Medical Officer of England as “a threat equal to that of terrorism”, the growing resistance to antibiotics is hindering the effective prevention and treatment of an ever increasing range of infections.

Do not whirl, as this will lead to cutting genomic DNA. If necessary, continue to turn the tube until the solution becomes viscous and slightly removed. Do not let the cracking reaction be carried out for more than 5 minutes. If the lysate is still unclear, reduce the bacterial precipitation.
    5) Add 350μl of buffer P3 and mix gently with the tube upside down 6-8 times immediately. The solution should be cloudy. Centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes (~ 13,400 x g) in a benchtop centrifuge. Note: To avoid localized precipitation, the solution is thoroughly mixed immediately after adding buffer P3. If there is still white precipitate in the supernatant, please centrifuge again.

‘A&B’ and C  were cut both ways:
‘A&B’ w/ Eco, Spe and C w/ Eco, Xba
‘A&B’ w/ Spe, Pst and C w/ Xba, Pst
Running diagnostic gel of digest: C w/ EX and AB cut w/ SP worked
Needed to run it for 2 hrs @ 120V in order to separate the bands effectively because the bp lengths of different parts are too close to each other.
Extract gel was unsuccessful
Results: bands were not bright & separate. Top of gel was deformed.  Maybe ran too hot for too long?  Next time, we will run at 90V or 100V & possibly change out TAE in between.
The following parts were redigested and ligated:  ‘A&B’ w/ ES; C w/ EX and ‘A&B’ SP, C w/ XP, however, they look like they have failed: there were many colonies on the AB (ES) w/ C (EX) plate but more on 3 AB (ES) insert plate.  None on AB (ES) insert or AB (SP) vector plate. Very few on AB (SP) w/ C (XP) plate.
Thus, we propose a new plan of attack:
We will PCR out inserts, in which we will need to PCR 8 things 4 of ‘A&B’ and 4 of ‘C’

genetic fence
induction of barnase (death gene) reduces cell growth
We characterized the activity of Barnase on an inducible plasmid constructed by UC Berkeley for iGEM 2007 (part I716408C). This contruct works by expressing background levels of Barstar with Barnase controlled by an arabinose inducible promoter such that it will overwhelm Barstar when induced. Higher levels of Barnase expression resulted in lower rates of growth in the bacteria, affirming the principle of Barnase-based growth control for the genetic fence, and confirming the results from Berkeley 2007. We characterized the growth repression of Barnase under a range of arabinose inducer concentrations.
Our results show that expression of Barnase is effective in reducing cell growth, suggesting that Barnase will enable the genetic fence to prevent growth of iGarden plants outside of their designated areas.

Our team worked with parts from British Columbia 09 team. Part BBa_K206000 , PBAD,  is an Escherichia coli promoter that is induced by L-arabinose. In the absence of arabinose, the repressor protein AraC, BBa_I13458 , binds to the AraI1 operator site of PBAD and the upstream operator site AraO2, blocking transcription [1]. In the presence of arabinose, AraC binds to it and changes its conformation such that it interacts with the AraI1 and AraI2 operator sites, permitting transcription.
BBa_K206000 is a variant pBAD promoter with a modified AraI1 site that has been shown both to be responsive to lower concentrations of arabinose and to exhibit a higher maximum expression than the wild type ( BBa_I13453 ), as measured by coupling to a fluorescent reporter by iGEM09 British Columbia Team.
We aslo used as a RBS the Kozak sequence used normally on most constructs, part BBa_B0034 , followed by a Green Fluorecent Protein ( BBa_B0040 ), supposed to act as a reporter in order to meassure effectivness of the arabinose promoter. This construct was meassured in E. coli strain BW27783, which is unable to metabolize L-arabinose (our inductor).

Stanford,2009,Team:Stanford#ProjectPage_-_-_TEXT.html," With a faster growth rate and higher incidence than other well known autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis and asthma, IBD will affect an even larger percentage of the world's population, particularly in industrializing nations like India and China, over the next thirty years.   While both diseases, CD and UC, affect similar demographics, they tend to have very different symptoms that requires differential treatment methods.  In Ulcerative Colitis the inflammation is usually continuous and can stretch from the colon to, in many cases, the rectum.  The inflammation results in a continuous stretch of ulcers in these regions but very rarely in fistulas and abnormal passageways, a characteristic of Crohn's disease.  Because of this shallow and continuous inflammation, Ulcerative Colitis can often be treated without remission by removing the affected areas of the colon or rectum.
Crohn's Disease
Fig 2.2 Localization and Discontinuous nature of Crohn's inflammation
In contrast to Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn's Disease often includes the terminal ileum, the most distal part of the small intestine, and the colon.  Unlike other forms of IBD, CD also results in  patchy areas of inflammation with the localization of the disease ""jumping"" from distal portions of the small intestine to the colon.  The localized bands of inflammation are often accentuated by the presence of fistula, granulomata and deep, transmural inflammation.  As a result of the nature and localization of the inflammation, Crohn's Disease is usually hard to treat through surgical resection procedures that remove affected areas of the colon.  In post-operative Crohn's patients, the site of resection often results in proximal inflammation that can travel distally, resulting in a reemergence of patchy inflammation in the colon.
As a result post-operative Crohn's patients are particularly appealing demographic for whom to design treatment options since current resection methods designed for UC seem to be ineffective.
IBD Immunology
Numerous clinical studies with IBD patients have suggested that the disease is an outgrowth of cellular imbalance, namely an imbalance in two different T cell populations - Th17 and Treg.  Thought to have an inverse relationship, increased naive CD4 differentiation to Th17  and associated inflammation is hypothesized to decrease naive CD4 differentiation to Treg and  associated immunosuppression.  In the case of IBD, experimental work suggest that Th17 strains begin to cause inflammatory damage to the microenvironment of the colon by (1) proliferating unexpectedly and (2) becoming self-recognizing.

MODELLING
        In our project, we have constructed a series of SRRz based heavy metal ion detectors. The gene circuits can be summarized as one circuit shown in the picture.
1.Heavy metal ion detection part[1,4,5]
        In the center is a bidirectional promoter Pmer , which can be regulated by MerR homodimer and metal-combined MerR homodimer.
        Under normal condition, MerR dimer binds with Pmer and recruits RNA Polymerase for the left part to transcript. While the right part, because of the wrong span between -10 box and -35 box which cause them located at different sides of DNA helix, is silent.
        But when metal ion binds to MerR dimer, things come different. MerR dimer changes the configuration of DNA, repressing the transcription of the left part and recruiting RNA Polymerase for transcription of the right part.
        On the left side of Pmer, we have put a MerR coding sequence here, which can be expressed constitutively when there is no metal ion. For this part, the model is shown in the flow chart.
        Then on the left side is the SRRz lysis gene, which is the responding module in our system. This part is a competitor for Pmer against the former part. The flow chart describes the regulation of MerR dimer and metal and the expression of SRRz without the former part.
        Up to now, the metal ion detection and reporter protein expression part is done. The whole process is shown in the following figure. The competition between two directions is obvious.
2.Cell lysis part[2-3]
        In this part, we constructed our model by hypothesizing that the permeability of cells can be estimated by degradation rate of compound composing the cellular membrane and cell wall. Besides, there should be a cellular membrane repairing mechanism that is in proportion to the degradation rate. Therefore, we built up the following model to describe the process.
3.Reporting part
        Because cell lysis process usually happens extremely fast, we set a threshold that when"

DESCRIPTION
Bacteria that acquire resistance to antibiotics pose a serious health problem globally. Following our team’s project model for last year, Elan Vital Korea’s new project is also related to MRSA. This year, however, we instead focused on the early detection of MRSA infections using quorum sensing. Below, we have briefly described the health threats caused by MRSA, and have explained the method of quorum sensing. We also detail how we have designed and implemented our experiments, and what results we have obtained. Finally, we briefly outlined the implication of our results and our future plans.
Threats of Antibiotics-Resistant Bacteria
Infections by antibiotic-resistant bacteria are serious health threats worldwide, including countries such as Korea and the United States of America. It is a serious threat primarily because, as its name suggests, bacteria have evolutionarily developed a resistance to antibiotics. It simply means that our current drugs don’t work. Furthermore, the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria makes it more difficult to control or contain the spread of infectious diseases, because it undermines the effectiveness of treatments. It also substantially increases the cost of healthcare, the burdens placed on society by prolonging treatment periods and the likelihood of death. The WHO declared that the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria “threatens the achievements of modern medicine” (Antimicrobial Resistance: Global Report on Surveillance 2014, WHO, 2014). Antimicrobial resistance already causes 700,000 deaths every year, which is expected to increase to 10 million annually by 2050 (An international legal framework to address antimicrobial resistance, WHO, 2015)
Existing Methods Used for Detection
The CDC’s efforts at outsmarting the antibiotic resistance focuses on 4 core actions: detect, respond, prevent and discover. The project is called the AR Initiative (Detect and Protect Against Antibiotic Resistance Initiative), and it is is an integral part of the CDC’s strategy to target investment aimed at AR. Among the AR initiative, detection is the first step that impacts the whole controlling process. Detecting antibiotic resistance quickly and effectively is crucial for determining treatment methods for different patients as well as for quarantines to prevent it from becoming epidemic. Currently, several methods are used for the detection of the antibiotic resistance. The most common and traditional method is using growth inhibition assays performed in broth or by agar disc diffusion. For clinically critical bacteria, diagnostic laboratories perform phenotypic-based analyses using standardized susceptibility testing methods"

INTEGRATED HUMAN PRACTICE
Highlight of UI Human Practice projects and how it builds an integrated human practice
Process 1: Developing Major Framework Idea
In early 2017, Indonesia seeing an outbreak of diphtheria, sparking fear among the people and the government. The government of Indonesia has recorded 593 diphtheria cases, spread across 95 regencies in 20 provinces. With total number of victims has reached 32 people only for around 2 months. The World Health Organization data on diphtheria shows that the number of cases in Indonesia has fluctuated since the 1980s, even though some prevention already executed. In 2014, 7,321 cases of diphtheria were reported to the World Health Organization, but there are likely many more cases, make the disease continues to cause illness globally.  As UI IGEM team works are dynamic in term of activity and diverse in term of targeted participants, we design our programs not only to fulfill the goals of integrated human practice, we also tried to achieve but also to integrate each program into our project. We realize the urgency of fast, reliable, and cheap early detection method for diphtheria infection to overcome this issue. However, in order to develop device which have the criteria above, we have  to spent most of our time project by interviews with the expert in the field with multidimensional approach (safety, religions, policy aspects), creating events with diverse segment participants in order to get their feedback toward the project, and finally, implementation. We got safety training and certification before entering the lab, working lab project whole summer, and finally we created our product, Diagnostic Track: Utilization of LuxAB-eYFP Resonance Energy Transfer System to Detect Diphtheria Toxin.
ETHICAL REVIEW
Process 2: Ethical Review
Our project, Finding Diphthy, is expected to be implemented among the society in the future. But in the other hand, there is a potential controversy within this project by using HB-EGF genes (which comes from human genes) as one of the materials. Thus, we need to ensure the society reaction and acceptance due to its ethical aspect including the legal and religion"

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.
Participated teams: AHUT_China, BNU-China, UESTC-China, FAFU-CHINA, HZAU-China, NAU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, Tianjin, TUST_China, WHU-China, UCAS

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

Sometimes they do give us some answer that is beyond our imagination and we are kind of not sure the answer, and sometimes they may answer easy questions wrong, however this is a process, a process that children and we are both teaching and learning at the same time.
This week actually start with a little sadness, when the children asked us “Is this the last time you come teaching us?” The answer is a sorry and a yes. We build up the relationship in very short time, nonetheless everyone has to back to the normal school life. At least, when we think of the time we spend together is full of laughter and that is enough.
We are thankful to the teachers of Tong Kuang Elementary School and the students giving us a chance to experience this unforgettable journey and help us a lot, and many other people give us courage and a lot of love, we can never done this without all the help.

Positive side [1st debater]:
My fellow debaters, I’m afraid I disagree with your opinion and reasons are as follows. As a country of 1.3 billion people, China is confronted with the population inflection point, and the increase rate of human beings will definitely slow down in the future. Moreover, nowadays sustainability has become a tendency of technology development, which means many materials can be recycled in the future.
I’d like to point out that GMOs and synthetic biology may probably lead to tremendous biological disaster just as many movies implied. Our technology cannot wholly predict the consequence of genetic modification. What’s worse, if GMOs and synthetic biology are illegally applied, we’re not able to detect the problem immediately. As far as I’m concerned, “we should stop developing GMOs technology and synthetic biology”. Thank you.
Second Round
Negative side [1st debater]:
Thank you for your reasons but I cannot agree with you. Indeed potential problems caused by GMOs and synthetic biology may not be detected quickly, but GMOs and genic engineering (GE) are one of the quickest solutions for the problem because these technology can mutate the target genes in a short period of time, which is superior to traditional technology. What’s more, laws and regulations related to GMOs are made step by step. In the future, the legal system will definitely be improved and thus many illegal application of GMOs can be prevented.
From my point of view, advantages of GMOs and synthetic biology also play an important role in controlling the side effects of pesticide and chemical fertilizer. For one thing, the drug resistance of many pests has a bad influence on grain output, while some sorts of pesticide of high efficiency are harmful to human beings thus cannot be used on a large scale. For another, the residue of pesticide, soil hardening and such problems effect the grain output as well. With the aid of GMOs and synthetic biology, crops themselves can resist pests so no extra chemicals would be added into soil.
Positive side [2nd debater]:
My fellow debaters, I feel the same way as you mentioned. Nevertheless, GMOs’ defects cannot be neglected. From the aspect of ecology, most GMOs have higher adaptability than ordinary crops so GMOs may compete with many wild species and then the biodiversity may probably be destroyed. Thank you.
Third Round
Negative side [3rd debater]:
Thanks, I have got the point. In order to avoid the problem you mentioned just now, we could restrict the planting or raising area of GMOs so that their existence will not pose any threat to"

Ryan Pederson
Entombed by walls of monolithic stone while barred from vistas of bucolic plateaus regularly interspersed with the linear and euclidean masonry of modernity awash in the scintillating light of a gibbous moon occluded by peripatetic clouds, I toil on my work as scion of Darwin and Mendel peering at incalculable numbers of lilliputian bulbous creatures of peculiar properties imposed upon them by the contriving mind of man in the midst of a rancour of vacuous ribald jest and interminable pedantic criticism, precisely the sort pernicious and incessant buzzing that produces a deleterious effect on those possessing particularly sensitive sensibilities of the anachronistic variety. Or, in non-Lovecraftian speak, I work in a synthetic biology lab with no windows and discussions by me and my lab-mates are not always suitable for all audiences.

Hey, I’m Sutherland (yes, that is my first name) and I just completed my undergrad in Neuroscience and will be beginning grad school in the fall. This is my second year on the Lethbridge iGEM team, in addition to being an advisor for the 2012 Lethbridge High School team. iGEM has been a great experience over the past couple of years— I’ve learned a ton! When I’m not in the lab (either neuroscience or iGEM), I love playing soccer and reading.
Richard McLean
Howdy y’all! I’m Richard and I’m entering my fourth year of biochemistry at the U of L. I spent a few years out of school before last fall exploring the culinary world so now I spend most of my time trying to catch up on my studies; The rest of my time I divide between iGem and the local Research Center. I like to think that if I wasn’t as busy, I would fill my free time with activities that would make this bio a more interesting read… At any rate, I’m looking forward to meeting everyone at the workshops and jamboree.

ShanghaiTechChina_B,2016,Team:ShanghaiTechChina B#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," half a year. Furthermore, 50% people get the diseases once or twice, while the rest suffer more often. Among all the intestinal tract diseases, diarrhea, bellyache and stomachache are the most common ones. In this part of survey, we mixed intestinal diseases and tract diseases intentionally, and we are surprised to see that only 50.69% of participants can distinguish one from another. However, people know about detailed intestinal diseases, i.e. 70.6% heard about IBD . They also know about common treatments of these diseases. 60.44% know about dietotherapy, 66.21% know the Chinese traditional treatment. Medicine and operation are the most known. 26.37% are conscious of fecal bacteria transplantation, along with the strict test it needs to run, which could be considered a disadvantage. The other advantages of tradition treatments mentioned by participants are pain (58.52%), immune system disorder (53.57%), drug allergy (52.2%) and others (i.e. slow effect). 64.19% of participants never came into contact with any propaganda or advertisement on intestinal diseases, and most (95.87%) of them feel it important to strengthen people’s comprehension of intestinal diseases.
In the second part we asked about gut flora. Most of participants believe the relationship between gut flora and intestinal to be symbiotic. Nearly all of them heard about Escherichia coli, while 49.18% knows Enterococcus faecalis.
In the third part we started propagating our project and gain feedbacks.
In conclusion, the result gives a proof of our initial conjecture that people are unconsciousness of the severeness of intestinal diseases, while they have been suffering from such things greatly. Besides propagating our project, we managed to make respondents aware of the differences between tract diseases and intestinal diseases and the detailed treatments to these. Consequently, we keep popularizing the knowledge in this field, as we always do.
Social Media
People nowadays spend a lot of time on social media, gaining information fragment by fragment. Subscription account on WeChat is a very popular form of social media in China. In the previous survey, our team found out that most Chinese know little about intestianl diseases and much more superficial about synthetic biology, many of whom having no idea what it is.
In order to create a window for our team to communicate with the world, our team applied and managed a WeChat subscription account, trying to share the knowledge of synthetic biology and trending news about medical treatment responsibly. This account recorded our progress and interesting comments about synthetic biology. The articles were"

THE 2018 UNIVERSITY OF IOWA iGEM TEAM
WHO ARE WE?
Welcome! We are Iowa’s 2018 iGEM Team – a group of 14 undergraduate students at the University of Iowa, pursuing studies from all across campus, including biology, engineering, anthropology, chemistry and more. We have come together to compete in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition. We are the second-ever team from the state of Iowa to compete in this world renowned synthetic biology competition.
The competition provides students like us—from diverse majors and backgrounds—the opportunity to collaborate, develop teamwork skills, and carry out real-world experiments that have a substantial impact. Our team will spend the summer working in various labs, designing and conducting experiments. We are focusing on how to genetically engineer a microbe, called Bacillus subtilis , to produce an industrial bioplastic in an environmentally-sustainable and affordable way. You can read our full project proposal here .
Although we are working with faculty advisers from four different departments here at UI, this project is primarily student-driven and will demonstrate the excellence of Iowa research and the potential of Iowa undergraduates on an international scale.
We could use your help!
In order to conduct these experiments, we need to raise money to pay for materials such as chemical reagents, bacterial cultures, and genetic engineering tools. All donations are tax-deductible and will help our team partake in the opportunity of a lifetime. Thank you for your support!
About the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition
iGEM is an international synthetic biology competition where student teams, from across the world, work                          during the summer to build a microbe that carries out some sort of ‘programmed’ function (something that the                          specific microbe would not normally be able to do). iGEM was founded at MIT in 2003. Last year, 340 teams from                          around the world entered the competition, creating microbes that can sense atmospheric carbon monoxide, clean                          up wine stains, convert sugar into biofuels or medicines, and much more. These teams ranged from Pakistan,                          Kenya, Canada, Mexico,"

Organism
Rhodobacter sphaeroides is a purple Alphaproteobacteria.  It is metabolically flexible: it can grow heterotrophically, via aerobic and anaerobic respiration, as well as phototrophically under anaerobic conditions with light.
R.  sphaeroides is one of the best understood photosynthetic organisms.  The photosystem is located in intracytoplasmic membrane invaginations and the main components are the Light Haresting Complex 2 (LH2), Light Harvesting Complex 1 (LH1), and the Reaction Center (RC).  These pigment-protein complexes non-covalently bind bacteriochlorophylls and carotenoids.  LH1 and RC make up the core complex and are often found in the ratio of 1:1. LH2 is more peripheral and naturally ranges in the ratio to LH1/RC of 3.0:1 to 6.7:1 under varying light conditions (Scheuring et al., 2005). LH2 absorbs photons maximally at the wavelengths of 850 and 800 nm and funnels its energy to LH1 and the reaction center for photochemistry. (Scheuring et al., 2005).
The two subunits of LH2 are coded for by the pucB/A genes and are naturally promoted by the puc promoter.

The answers to these question result in one specific risk level of the environmental and health related risk associated with the release of the GMO in question. This risk level governs an advice given on the required lab safety.
Figure 4: Risk matrix about the synthetic biology risks
The analysis of our own tool
We have used the tool ourselves to analyze the risks of our project again. Based on the analysis it appears that no high chemical risk levels are associated with our project. Of course, risks are present, however, the conditions of our experiments are such that an acceptably low risk level is ensured at all times. For example, we use ethidium bromide, which is a carcinogenic compound and thus has serious consequences. Therefore, we wear protective gloves when working with it and we limit the frequency of use to the lowest number possible, to reduce the probability of occurrence of the health risks associated with ethidium bromide. An experiment cannot be free of risks, but in every situation much focus is placed on keeping risk levels as low as possible.
The GMO risk assessment of the tool showed that this risk level is limited in our project as well. We do not use pathogenic organisms or vectors derived from a virus. However, when our product is used outside the lab, a high severity of consequence is associated with the risk of bringing an organism with antibiotic resistance into the outside world. The reason for this is that it could lead to widespread antibiotic resistance among micro-organisms in the environment. Therefore, it is important that we try to mitigate this risk. We will analyze how we can diminish this risk level in the section Risk assessment .
The Synthetic biology risk assessment tool can be downloaded Risk assessment Tool . After downloading, extract the zipped folder and save all files in the same folder on your computer. To run the program, go to the folder in which you saved the extracted files and look for EXE-Risk_assessment_tool_TU_Delft.exe. Double click this executable file and the program will open.
Risk Assessment
Summary
In this section we have analyzed the safety measures that have to be taken to implement our biolenses into real world applications, such as the solar panels or in a microscope. We have concluded that our biolenses are not allowed to leave the ML-1 labs because of the antibiotic resistance or our microorganisms. When we sterilize the biolenses, which basically means that the cells inside the lenses are not viable anymore, our biolenses will be allowed to leave the ML-1 lab.

We also got a lot of inspiration in the communication with them. We also used two parts they distributed last year in our construction. We also used two parts they distributed last year in our construction. Then we helped them with their Indigo synthesis experiment in return and helped them obtain the water samples of polluted water in Tianjin in return.
Integrated Human Practices
Communicating with experts in technology and academic fields, discussing with other teams and helping each other, our HP activities have made our project more complete. By studying anaerobic culture techniques, we have enabled anaerobic intestinal bacteria culture in vitro to become a reality in our project. It's our first step in making intestinal bacteria fluorescent in vivo. Communicating with experts and intestinal field, we clarified the limitations and shortcomings of current research methods of intestinal bacteria, further confirmed the feasibility of our method and application in the future, which gave us more inspiration and encouragement. Communication with other teams has helped us a lot in physical and technical aspects, including the use of parts and the gift of the strains, which have led to a smooth direction for our project.
So, our HP activities helped our project a lot. We also hope that our far infrared fluorescent protein system can be better applied and expanded in the future, and what we got will carry forward.

Waterloo,2017,Team:Waterloo#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"ating abilities of the prion domain. Research done by a team at Tsinghua University in Beijing used ELK16, which forms “highly active enzyme aggregates”, and inteins, also known as protein introns, to reduce the cost and time associated with the production and purification of medium to large sized peptides [1]. The C terminus of the protein you want to purify is fused to the N terminus of the intein, and the C terminus of the intein is fused to the N terminus of ELK16[1]. The ELK16 regions form insoluble aggregates, which are easily isolated via centrifugation. A reagent induces cleavage at the N-termini of the intein, causing the isolated insoluble unit to shed the target protein, which are then isolated via reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography.
Benefits
The potential use of prion domains instead of ELK16 could further reduce the costs associated with this process by allowing for the reuse of the intein-aggregation domain.
Application
This could be achieved by inducing the prion domains into their normal state, and using expressed protein ligation to attach new target proteins to the N-termini of the inteins.
Restrictions
The question that must be asked is whether the reduction of costs gained in the reuse of the intein-aggregation domain will offset the increase in cost associated with protein ligation. It essentially boils down to what would be more expensive, the act of producing new fusion proteins, or the act of de-aggregating and reusing your existing fusion proteins.

Targeted Apoptosis Application
General Concept
The misfolding of proteins leads to the formation of prions, aggregates of misfolded proteins that crowd within a cell, up to the point where the cell undergoes apoptosis (cell death) due to overcrowding. While prions do cause diseases in humans and other animals, and are rightly considered dangerous, there are some circumstances for which overcrowding is a desired feature of a treatment system.
The general idea is to take advantage of the “natural apoptotic process of prokaryotes” which was coined as “proapoptosis” by"

Upon reaction, the intein (both parts of the split intein) is spliced out, fusing their respective N- and C-terminal parts. If the reaction conditions are not met, a side reaction can take place. This reaction is termed N-cleavage and is illustrated in the graphic below.
Figure 1: Schemtic of the reactions the intein can undergo.
The larger Intein part we expressed coupled to another part which was used in last year’s project: NAGA, α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (BBa_K1483000) . The expression vector we used was the pETue (BBa_K1680026) , which we created last year based on the pETBlue-1 vector. This had the added benefit that any protein would be expressed with a 6xHis-Tag for purification.
Results
Figure 2: Schemtic of the experiment procedure.
To make sure the Intein-part we sent in last year actually worked, we devised a simple assay, which could be read out in an SDS-PAGE. We acquired the synthetic peptide from last years team. This peptide was labeled with fluorescein in it’s extein part.

Gel I: Expression/Purification
Figure 4: Coomassie blue stained SDS-PAGE of NAGA-Intein testexpression.
Figure 5: Coomassie blue stained SDS-PAGE of different purification steps of the NAGA-intein.
As we can see, before purification we could not determine whether or not the expression had worked as intended. However, after purification using the 6xHis-tag, the SDS-polyacrylamide gel clearly showed a band at 70 kDa, which is the exact height at which we expected our 69.4 kDa protein. Since 6xHis-tag purification unfortunately also enriches untagged proteins, we needed to make sure that the promising band was the NAGA-Intein construct. To this end, we cut the band from the gel, digested it with trypsin and analysed it using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer.

This experiment was conducted according to the protocol outlined here . We used the two bands around 70 kDa in the Eluate fraction. The lower one is not present in the Flow Through and Wash fractions. Additionally, it’s weight is closer"
Tsinghua,2018,Team:Tsinghua#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," simulation results. Concentrations of most molecules that are not supposed to be synthesized without AHL are set to 0. External AHL concentrations are tuned to reveal the effect of AHL concentration on the system.
To begin with, we set intial external AHL concentration as 10-6 M, which is relatively high. The simulation result is shown below.
Figure 4  Simulation Result——With Very High Initial AHL Concentration
The result meets our expectation. According to the plot, GFP concentration will begin to rise exponentially following the addition of AHL. The velocity of increment decreases gradually, till approximate saturation is reached. The simulation result implies that the Test System is inducible.
What happens when lower concentrations of AHL is added? The following plots represent 10-7 and 10-9 M of AHL concentration, respectively.
Figure 5       Results of Varied AHL Concentrations
As can be deduced from these plots, the decrease of AHL concentration from 10-6 to 10-7 has no substantial influence on the behavior of the system. Through further analysis, we found that the rate of GFP concentration increment is indeed higher when 10-6 M of AHL is added than when 10-7 M of AHL is added, however this difference can merely be detected after 100 seconds. Given these two different initial states, the state of the system will eventually become quite same. For one, this shows that the system is robust, to some extent. In addition to this, this phenomenon makes sense and has biological interpretations. Within a certain range of concentrations, AHL serves as a “trigger” which turns the system on by enabling expression of several proteins, so it has an “all-or-none” effect, to some extent.
When the concentrations of AHL is further decreased, to 10-9 M, for instance, the behavior of the system is altered dramatically. When AHL concentration is this low, the system cannot be activated and no GFP is expressed. This is partial thanks to the “safety catch” design. This result gives us confidence that leakage can be prevented with the presence of minor fluctuations.
You can interact with the plot down below. Use mouse to drag the slider to tune the initial AHL concentration and observe how this will influence GFP production in the cells!
Summary:
- Increased AHL concentration tends to result in faster GFP production.
- A threshold for AHL concentration exists. AHL concentration below this threshold cannot activate the system thanks to the safety catch mechanism.
Concentration=10-5 M
Concentration=10-6 M
Concentration=10-7 M
Concentration<=10-8 M

The fluorescence disappeared completely after digestion, which seems too good to be true. Hence, we performed Western blotting to be sure of the result.
Western Blotting
The cell components were first fractionated before blotting.
1. Sonicate the bacteria culture.
2. Centrifuge 13000rpm, 30min to separate soluble protein and membrane components from the cell debris and the non-soluble protein.
3. 51000rpm 1h to separate soluble protein from membrane components.
The majority of the OmpA-GFP protein is in the pellet after the first centrifuge, indicating incomplete cell lysis or inefficient protein folding. Nonetheless, from the later result, we can see that it is exclusively in the membrane and not in the soluble proteins.

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Results#BioBricks_-_-_TEXT.html," our project the possiblility to dictate the cellular localisation of proteins (cytosolic, secreted and receptor bound). For this purpose the open reading frame of the protein has to be fused to a N-terminal signal peptide (for secretion) or has to be inserted into the extracellular domain of a synthetic receptor. We converted the following BioBricks to RFC 25:
Laccase <partinfo>BBa_K863000</partinfo> was improved to the BioBrick <partinfo>BBa_K1159002</partinfo>
Protein phosphatase 1 is a BioBrick BBa_K1012001 created by 2013 Dundee iGEM team. We have also thought to target microcystin as an important environmental toxin. We liked the idea of using the protein affected in the natural toxicity mechanism to solve the problem. Therefore we contacted Dundee team, they sent us their BioBrick which we converted to RFC 25. This was necessary as we wanted to localise it extracellularely in a receptor of our moss.
Adding improved versions of the protein
The fluoresceine binding Anticalin FluA was already present in the Parts Registry in RFC 25. As this BioBrick is from 2008 we used a higher engineered variant with three additional mutations which make it 75-times more affine to fluorescein (KD from 152 nM to 2 nM). This seemed an imporatant point as this Anticalin was twice present in the finals of iGEM (Freiburg Team 2008 and 2009) and an improved variant may be helpful for further iGEM teams as well as for our purpose to use it as a binding protein on trangenic moss. The outdated FluA with a lower affinity was <partinfo>BBa_K157004</partinfo> and the newer version is now available as <partinfo>BBa_K1159003</partinfo>.
Correcting the incorrect sequence of a working BioBrick
When we designed our synthetic receptor for Physcomitrella patens we planed to fuse a fluorescent protein to the cytoplasmatic domain of this receptor in order to be able to localize it by fluorescence microscopy. For this purpose we needed a fluorescent protein in RFC 25 which can be used to create the desired protein fusion. This BioBricks we obtained from the LMU iGEM Team 2012 who had created this BioBrick. After fetching it and a initial sequecing we realised that there was a false sequence"
HUST-China,2012,Team:HUST-China#Modeling#GM_-_-_TEXT.html," the nonlinearity of the Hill functions, the solutions of a system of ordinary differential equations of a network of many genes cannot generally be determined by analytical means. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=15100022 For the different oxygen distributed in the biofilm and different hydrogen ions’ distribution in the panel , we can solve these equations at different oxygen concentration and hydrogen ions’ gradient.  The nonlinearity of the Hill function makes it a big obstacle for us to use ODEs for solving equations of the bacteria batteries’ pathway.
Simulation
In the above circuit, E.coli forms biofilm but what we concern is the activity of inner bacteria. Thus, this part of simulations focuses on the equilibrium of all substances。 Notice that we care about the final state of the bacteria in different concentration of hydrogen ions and oxygen condition in biofilms. The situation can be reached to the final steady without any change. We can assume that all of the variables differential by time can be equaled to zero. That is, let  $$\frac{d[X]}{dt}=0$$ [X] stands for every substances of equation (1) –(14) Since all equations above are all constructed, the connection between CsgD and concentration of H+ can be derived from other substances when the state can be reached to equilibrium.The formulation can be calculated followed:
[IPTG] is external concentration of IPTG and its value sets to be zero during simulation. As we applied Pvgb to construct the biofilms, we should analyze the different concentration of oxygen which may inhibit or improve the activity of CsgD. The data below is derived from ZJU-China igem 2011.
From the figure, we can get the relationship between the distribution of oxygen in the biofilm and expression rate of GFP, RFP and YFP. Clearly, the behavior of this system can be determined by the two promoters, i.e., PureI and Pvgb. However, as the hill equations cannot be solved by OEDs. Then, we hope to illustrate the behaviors of this system precisely. We will discuss this in two cases. a) Under the assumption that the concentration of H+ where the distance from bacteria’s aggregating panel is not high enough to active the circuit to form biofilm, and the expression of Pvgb on the high concentration of oxygen is very low. So [H]=0,and a=0.Now the change of concentration of CsgD is shown in the following figure.   b) Under the assumption that the concentration of H+ where the distance from bacteria’s aggreg"

Collaboration with NYMU-Taipei team
(National Yang-Ming University)
When we were doing our interlab measurement, we were not able to transform the plasmid into our competent cell DH5α. After doing the transformation four times without a successful result, we started debugging and also searched for assistance.
We are thankful for the NYMU-Taipei team, who gave us a hand after we told them our dilemma. They reviewed our lab notes to help us debug. Furthermore, we met each other online to discuss the problem together.
Also, as a backup plan, we borrowed from them E. coli which they had successfully transformed with plasmids for the interlab.
Plates from NYMU
With their timely help, we were able to conduct the following experiment including the conversion between absorbance of cells to absorbance of a known concentration of beads. Without their help, we merely could complete the measurement of the silica beads and we would not have been able to calibrate against a known concentration of fluorescent molecule to reduce the variability in measurements between labs.

Vesicles Maturation Modeling
This part of the modelling works was dedicated to the vesicles creation understanding. Indeed if we want to control the emission of vesicles we need to discuss phenomenon which lead it. We decided to attach ourselves to the biophysics of the problem and especially on the biophysics of membranes. We finally linked the creation of vesicles to the free diffusion of PAL and TOL proteins in the membranes depending of the lipidic bilayer shapes.

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," The risk group mostly includes young, elderly, immunocompromised people and is spread through injection or contamination of broken skin with bacteria which can cause inflammation. The release of bacteria in the environment poses the risk of spreading of antibiotics resistance. By following appropriate laboratory safety precautions and waste disposal regulations, we can minimise unsafe exposure to the bacteria and prevent release into the environment.
Species used as a chassis
E.coli DH5 alpha, E.coli Sexpress (A derivative of NEB Express containing the R factor R702).
C. difficile SBRC 078 (clinical isolate)
Risks the chassis species pose
The SBRC have risk assessments and waste disposal management that will ensure that chassis are not released into the environment as they possess antibiotic resistance that could be spread to other bacteria. Except that, E. coli strains used do not possess pathogenic properties and therefore pose minimal to no risk to human health.
C. difficile could pose a risk to human health in immunocompromised patients or patients receiving antibiotic therapy. However, they would need to ingest spores, which can be removed with hand washing. Colleagues or team members are not authorised to enter the lab whilst on antibiotic therapy. Providing correct PPE is worn and hand washing procedures are followed, C. difficile will not pose a risk to the lab-based team members. Release of C. difficile into environment could cause a hazard due to production of spores that can survive in the environment for a long time. The lab follows specific disposal rules for C. difficile in accordance with standard operating procedures and risk assessments.
E.coli DH5 alpha, E.coli Sexpress (A derivative of NEB Express containing the R factor R702) is a new strain created at SBRC Nottingham and the research paper on it has not been published yet. C. difficile SBRC 078  is a clinical isolate of C. difficile belonging to PCR ribotype 078

How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for some widespread fish disease in China.
After finishing the brochure, we delivered the brochures to farmers who contacted us online though China. In brief, nearly 400 brochures were sent to twelve cities and counties in China, including Suzhou, Yanan, Yancheng, Jining, Guanzhou and so on.
Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.

He provided us several other contacts to reach out to for an opinion on our next steps and offered to pass our project summary onto his colleagues. John seems really eager to help us move forward with development, and we are so honored to have him as a resource.
Our other teammates spent another long week in lab and, in their off-time, worked on completing their assigned website pages. We are making great progress!
In preparation to start our backup plan, this week we linearized D17. We also attempted to linearize our contaminated lox-ura-lox in an attempt to clean it for future use. As a backup, we reordered lox-ura-lox from IDT in case our clean up failed.
Using the newly revised restriction digest protocol, we performed new rounds of restriction digests with the PSb1C3 backbone, the P450scc gene, and the 3BH gene. Then we ligated the results from the restriction digests and performed a transformation with chemicompetent and electrocompetent E. coli cells. None of the transformations yielded successful results.
The terminators we received (from Hal Alper) were synthetic, which allowed for it to carry a lower amount of base pairs. After discussing our procedure with our lab teaching assistant, we found a fitting method for both using bacterial stabs and for plating them afterwards.
On luria broth high copy plates, we plated Tsynth8, Tsynth30, and TEF1 in E. coli which were left to incubate over the span of nine hours. We also followed this method with our terminators when growing them in S. cerevisiae on a Histidine plate. We were presented with successful results the following day and observed growth of all three terminators on our E. coli plate and then inoculated them in liquid cultures. We then performed a miniprep procedure and then inoculated them in a falcon tube with luria broth and ampicillin to get to the proper ratio of 100 ug/mL in the 5 mL of luria broth.
We then performed another miniprep of the liquid E. coli cultures and continuously tailored the iGEM protocol to fit our experiments. We then analyzed each terminator’s absorbance via nanodrop which yielded us the results necessary to analyze whether or not each terminator would be fit to continue with based on their DNA concentrations; we gathered that TEF1 and Tsynth8 would be the most promising. We then transformed the plasmids from the minip"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,", to construct a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

Introduction
Motivation
The natural resource exploitation of human is a severe problem. 3Rs (reduce, reuse and recycle) are the strategies of human reducing natural resources usage, by recycling the resources we can reduce the amount of resource exploitation. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations*, global forest area had decreased 129,135,000 ha from 1990 to 2015. Forest plays an important role in earth environment, trees are extremely important for temperature maintaining, oxygen providing, nitrogen cycle, carbon fixation and water cycle. Woods are one of the most important natural resources, they are necessary for building materials, furniture, food industry and paper. The decreasing of forest area is a critical problem for the Earth.
Woods are both important for human civilization and natural environment, reducing deforestation is one of the most important issue for protecting the Earth. In the wooden product supply chain, the woods were chopped down from the forest, then processed into products by the manufacturing chain and sold to the customers. In order to lower the speed of deforestation, the current business model must be changed. The technology must reduce waste of resources and increase the percentage of natural material. At the meantime, the purchase habit of the customers also influence the market, promotion for buying eco-friendly thoughts is the motivation of changing the whole market. To sum up, cutting edge technology and new ideas of marketing are the keys to change the manufacturing chain and bring us a better world.
Purpose
The ultimate goal of protecting the forest is when tree wouldn’t be cut down or limited. To achieve this goal, good recycling technology must provide the possibility to minimize the lost during each manufacturing process.
Meanwhile, the promotion of buying eco-friendly product. Wood could be processed into variable products including building materials, furniture, paper, etc. Here we are providing of an imagination for the future world when deforestation remains stopped.
Paper is one of the most common seen product made from wood in daily life. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, 40% of the annual industrial wood harvest is processed to make paper and paper"

Introduction of synthetic biology to interested science students
Expand knowledge of biotechnology in the community
Practice presentation skills with a patient and constructive audience
Information Data
Gathered survey data
How did Lambert iGEM address the survey data
Lambert iGEM created a 3 day camp for rising 8th and 9th graders from the local middle schools, where the team taught them about biotechnology. The team gave lectures over basic content in biology and labs based on biotechnology principles. The participants began the camp not knowing much about science, but by the end, they understood the importance of biotechnology and the different aspects in it. The Lambert iGEM team ran this camp to expand the knowledge of the students in our community about biotechnology in hope that they will consider it a career option. We integrated feedback from the girl scouts troop while planning the summer camp.
Market Research
We created the guide in hopes that other iGEM teams will refer to it as a helpful outline.

The magnetization curves dosen’t saturate even when the field is 3000mT, indicate that there are antiferromagnetic biomineral in E.coli which is hard to get saturated magnetization curves, such as ferrihydrite.
The coercivity is 7.6 mT at 5K, which is generally similar to the coercivity(9.2 mT) of magnetoferritin reported by Cao et al , 2010,JGR [12], indicating there are nanoparticles similar to magnetoferritin in E.coli.

Most proteins in E.coli are antiferromagnetic, therefore, the Magnetization Curves at 300K shows antiferromagnetism in general: magnetization decrease with the increasing of magnetic field. However, there is a saturated magnetization curve between ±200mT which is the feature of ferromagnetic mineral. The curve closed and saturated at 100mT, suggesting that the ferrimagnetic minerals: magnetite or magnetic hematite exist.

Abstract
Every year, one third of global food production -1.3 billion tons of food- is thrown away, partially due to the “best before” dating system.
iGEM Groningen 2012
seeks to provide an alternative method of assessing edibility: the
Food Warden
. It uses an
engineered strain
of Bacillus subtilis to detect and report volatiles in spoiling meat. The introduced
genetic construct
uses a promoter to trigger       a pigment coding gene. This promoter,
identified by microarray analysis
, is significantly upregulated in the presence of
volatiles from spoiling meat
. The activity of the
promoter
regulates the expression of the
pigment reporter
and will        be visible to the naked eye. For safe usage of the system, spores of our engineered strain are placed into one half of a semi-permeable
capsule
, the second containing a calibrated amount of nutrients. Breaking the barrier between the two compartments allows
germination and growth
, thereby activating the
spoiling-meat sensor
.
Completed after European Regionals
Tested a construct with downregulated promoter WapA
Performed enhanced construct characterization
Characterized the influence of oxygen on germination and growth within the sticker
Expanded the scope of the market survey
Collaborated with Cambridge 2012

Questions
Our Message in a Bubble project aims at developing a communication system between bacteria. Among the various problems raised during the design phase, we investigated 3 of them with modeling and simulation:
What is the link between Tol/Pal expression and vesicle formation? Or, more precisely, can we explain vesicule formation solely by the diffusion of the doubly anchored Tol/Pal complex in the membrane ? Understanding this connection is instrumental, since our project relies on the hypothesis that an increased in vesicle formation can be obtained simply by destabilization of the Tol/Pal complexes.
How to improve the quality of the signal sent? Or more precisely, how can we get a good synchronization between the maximal production rate of vesicles and the maximal concentration of proteins to encapsulate ?
How to optimize the quality of the reception? Or more precisely, how can we get a robust response despite  a potentially very low number of signals (ie, vesicles) received ? Two characteristics of the response have been investigated: response amplitude and response time.
Results
Understanding the link between Tol/Pal expression and vesicule formation
Overall, we showed that the formation of vesicles can be simply explained by the diffusion of Tol/Pal protein complexes. This very surprising result comes from 3 specific phenomena:
The initial formation of small blebs can be explained by differences of osmotic pressures between intra- and extra-cellular environments, together with a non-perfectly uniform distribution of Tol/Pal complexes acting like press studs. ( Details and figure "

I also wish to see a world where everyone gets as excited about proteins as I do and so I also have an interest in science literacy advocacy and science communication! These interests lead me to joining my university’s iGEM team to gain more hands on experience with gene editing and design and communicating this research to the public; this is my first year in iGEM. When I’m not in the lab or science communicating, I’m at a local art exhibit or music show.
Simmone D'souza
Hello friends, and welcome to a short autobiography of yours truly. I grew up in the harsh winters of Northern Alberta and decided to head to Lethbridge to pursue a degree in Biochemistry. I believed Lethbridge to be one of the warmest cities in Canada and little did I know that I would become a kite flying enthusiast due to all the wind. I am currently entering my third year as a Biochemistry student at the University of Lethbridge, and if you don’t find me in my books you’ll find me napping. This is my first year participating in iGEM and I am extremely excited to have the opportunity to be working with such a great team and learning about all the amazing feats we can conquer through synthetic biology. I can already tell that iGEM is going to have a huge impact on my experiences at the Universty of Lethbridge and I can’t wait to see what impact our project is going to have on others here in Lethbridge and around the world.
Travis Haight
My name is Travis Haight, and this is my first year with the Lethbridge Collegiate IGEM team. I grew up in Calgary AB, and I am in the fourth year of my Chemistry undergraduate degree. I joined IGEM because it seemed like an excellent complement to the work I do in an RNA based research lab, and to meet and work with others that share a passion for science.
Dong Ju (DJ) Kim
My name is Dong Ju Kim and I am 4th year chemistry student in University of Lethbridge. My experience with Synthetic biology alters my point of view towards issues on multidisciplinary subjects. Instead of looking for literature value from another person's work, we suggest, design and, create the solution. I believe that we, a part of iGEM community, are the trailblazer in this mysterious synthetic biology.

Future Version of Our Software
Introduction
Now our pc software  and online tool can predict the efficiency of rho-independent terminator. The algorithm is based on two scoring systems, which were created by d'Aubenton Carafa and Elena  A Lesnik respectively. In the future, we want to better predict the efficiency  of terminators using better formula and create a model of terminator efficiency prediction. What’s more, we hope we can do mutation on user’s  terminator sequence to give a derived terminator which meet the user’s requirement of efficiency.
Future Plan
1. Mutate the coefficients of the  scoring formular to help get the best simulation formular of score and  efficiency
The formula of d  score calculation is ：
D Score = nT *  18.16 + deltaG / LH * 96.59 – 116.87
(nT is the score of t tail, deltaG is the  energy change of the stemloop formation and LH is the length of stemloop  sequence.)
Here the coefficient of each terms can be  adjusted to help make the best simulation between score and efficiency. We can  even try to treat efficiency as a function of those terms directly, which means  we can calculate terminator efficiency using nt, deltaG and LH directly without  calculating the score first, ie : Efficiency = E(nt, deltaG,LH).
2. Create  a model of terminator efficiency prediction
The score of terminator includes two parts, stemloop and  ttail. We can do some experiments to know how stemloop and ttail effect the  efficiency of terminators and then create a model of that. We’ve bought about  100 terminators sequences. These sequences are mutated in their stem，loop  or t tail. We will measure their efficiency and then analyze the experiment  data to find some regular"

""Praziquantel is the recommended treatment for schistosomiasis at 40 mg/kg body weight. The cost of a single 600-mg tablets is about US$ 0.08 and an average treatment is estimated to be between US$ 0.20–0.30. Praziquantel is now available free of charge to a few high-disease burden least developed countries (LDC), through a donation from Merck KGaA to the World Health Organization."" (WHO, 2010)
Treatment - Communal approach to treatment
Because of the difficult nature of schistosomiasis diagnosis, treatment is often not provided after individual diagnosis, but instead it is very common to test only a sample of individuals in a community, especially school children, and if a certain proportion of the sampled people is infected, the whole community is treated with Praziquantel. This measure allows control of the disease to some extend if done in a coordinated approach with treatment on a large scale with safe and effective drug, and at regular intervals (WHO, 2010) . The communal approach aims at reducing the late stages of schistosomiasis that go along with malnutrition and often cause developmental problem in children. Based on the sampled disease burden is also the length of the period after which treatment is repeated. This method will not eradicate the disease but rather to lower the total number of infected people and prevent severe infection in order to reduce morbidity as well as socio-economic impact. In theory it is also possible to break the parasitic life cycle with this method and permanently prevent reinfection, however in practise it is well known that eradication does not take place for a number of different reasons, which is why treatment is repeated regularly. Even if Schistosoma were completely eradicated from one area, due to the continuing presence of the water snail vector, recolonialisation by Schistosoma would take place rapidly.
The Schistosomiasis Control Initiative based at Imperial College is involved in treatment of this and six other NTD in sub-Saharan Africa. Professor Alan Fenwick and Dr Wendy Harrison have also been a great help in the development of our project (make sure to read up in our Human Practices Report ). Alternatively here is a link to a Documentary about NTDs and their impact on human health, featuring Professor Alan Fenwick .
Prevention and Control - Detection of the parasite
The key to prevention of schistosomiasis is infrastructure, especially sanitation including water treatment and proper waste disposal. These relatively simple measures would not necessarily eliminate the"
