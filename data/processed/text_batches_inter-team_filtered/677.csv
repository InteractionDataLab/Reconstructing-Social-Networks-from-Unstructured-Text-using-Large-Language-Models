This discussion ought to be based on the facts, while arguments based on emotion and dogma should be put aside. Furthermore, one can argue that a technology (or knowledge of it) carries with it no ethical dilemmas, but it is the application of it that has an effect we can discuss. In the same way that nuclear fission has no ethical or moral agenda, but it is the application of the knowledge that should be evaluated and discussed.
Fig 1. Arguing on the facts [10].
This topic also relates to genetic engineering of microorganisms. Genetic modification of microorganisms differs from modification of higher animals in that it does not cause any physical or psychological suffering as we currently understand and define it. Therefore, our focus will be on potential impacts that the modified organisms could have on the environment and biosphere of the planet as well as human life. The discussion regarding genetic engineering of life in general, and whether it is good or bad, is certainly still relevant but outside the scope and aim of our integrated human practices discussion. The focus will be on the application of synthetic biology and genetic engineering of microorganisms, and the considerations that were made during the design and development of our project idea.
Safety of Genetically engineered microorganisms
To be able to assess the risks of using a genetically modified organism (GMO), several factors have to be taken into consideration, especially when estimating the potential danger to human health as well as to ecosystems. As all microorganisms currently used within the field of synthetic biology originate from nature, unmodified strains of these organisms could be considered safe to the ecosystem at large (of course excluding directly pathogenic strains). To make a reasonable argument of the risks regarding the use of a GMO, the specific modifications must be considered. For a GMO to be considered as a threat to the ecosystem, the modification needs to provide a significant evolutionary advantage over the wild type (WT) of the organism. This relates to unintentional damage that GMOs might cause if it ends up in the wrong hands (intentional misuse of the technology is further discussed later in this section).
In general, the modifications made to industrially used strains of microorganisms rarely provide such an evolutionary advantage. Most often the opposite is true. For example, modifying a strain of Bacillus subtilis to produce an enzyme (a common application of biosynthesis) is highly metabolically costly for the organism and would put it at a significant evolutionary disadvantage compared to the WT strain. This would lead to the GMO quickly being outcompeted by the WT in a natural setting.  In fact, contamination of the fermentation"

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," organisms via nanowires, together with the ability to accurately print these in the form of biofilms, one could create cell coatings that would be easy to produce and ideally suited for bio-composite leaves. A coating of cyanobacteria could simply be printed on a piece of porous paper and placed in the gas-phase of a photobioreactor for a steady supply of CO2, where it would function much in the way as described by Bernal et al. [2014]. Further leveraging Amsterdam’s consortium design, a layer of cyanobacteria would be printed on top of a layer of chemotrophic cell-factories like E. coli, who would use the constant supply of carbon provided by the cyanobacteria to produce end-products like biofuels, which would be transported to an extraction chamber where the product would be isolated.
Conclusion
Together, the work of team Amsterdam and TU Delft shows how combining separate iGEM projects can unlock new solutions to existing problems that could lead to highly disruptive innovations. Indeed, the sustainable product formation enabled by Amsterdam’s consortium and the ease of printing biofilms with immobilized nanowires developed by TU Delft could turn the type of biocomposite devices described by Bernal et al. into the cheap, versatile biofactory of the future.
KU Leuven
KU Leuven team developed a ‘proof-of-principle’ which can form the basis for unravelling the secrets behind bacterial pattern formation. Patterns are formed by engineering bacteria themselves in a controllable way, by using different types of chemicals.
The similarity of our projects is the formation of certain structures with bacteria. Our printer could facilitate the process of making patterns in a more reproducible and automated way. This could be useful for the formation of artificial bones, by using bacteria that can produce porous structures similar to bones. With our printer we can design a unique bone structure exclusively made for the patient.
Another application for a collaboration would be to use the nanowires in combination with the cell-cell communication approach of KU Leuven. Their engineered bacteria could form an addition to the formation of specific biofilms with our nanowires. The moment bacteria find a suitable location, with the method of KU Leuven, the production of nanowires will be induced. Then, the bacteria will be fixed to this location.
By using these two example we have proven that combining our projects would proceed in future applications. To achieve this further fundamental research is required in combination with practical engineering.

Composite parts
Our best composite part: BBa_K1913011
BBa_K1913011 contains a vitamin b12 riboswitch with an inverter and reporter gene (mRFP). This Biobrick allows for inducible mRFP production based on the concentration of vitamin b12. Riboswitches are pieces of mRNA that can regulate gene expression depending on if it is bound to a ligand. They consists of two parts. An aptamer that binds a specific ligand, and an expression platform. This dual system makes riboswitches interesting tools for utilization within synthetic biology: aptamers and expression platform of different riboswitch sequences could potentially be combined to create new riboswitches. The riboswitch used for this biobrick is the btuB of Escherichia coli which normally stops expression after it binds to vitamin b12. Thanks to the TetR QPI system, expression of mRFP will start after binding to the ligand.

What are the applications
We have conducted tests on the properties of BC including doing Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). We figure whether it is possible for our lab-produced BC to be applied in real-world industrial manufacturing. Therefore, we visited Shandong Nameide Biotechnology Co., Ltd and asked them to do a quality check on our product. The result is positive and they pointed out the greatest potential of our product is wound dressing material.

“It would be great to see some sort of organization like this! I     agree that unavailable parts should be followed up on and removed if     necessary. I also think that parts which are not sufficiently documented     should be highlighted in some way. Once these parts are identified,     teams can actively characterize them as part of their projects or as     side projects.”
“Think about these things: (i) who decides when a part is out-dated,     and how can that person know that an old part cannot have a novel use     in the future? (ii) likewise, an uncharacterized part may be both characterized     and used in the future”
We suggest building a backup system, such as an archive, to sort     out the rarely used, un-available and un-categorized parts until they     are in line with the enforced standards.
91% of participants have same opinion with us, which      is that standardization of the nomenclatures used for each different      composition of parts is necessary.

93% of participants have said that for the parts that      are marked as “WORKS” distinguishing the parts with quantitative      experimental validation vs parts without this information is important. Most participants have encountered with similar problems about parts      that don’t work under their lab conditions or works but not they      were claimed for.
89% of participants have same opinion with us, which      is that iGEM should sub-categorize the “WORKS” comment into 1) “Quantitative”      for parts which are characterized with experiments and 2) “Qualitative”      for parts which are not characterized will be an appropriate measure      for standardization of Biobrick database.
In order to overcome these problems we suggest enforcing the working     conditions title for the registry entrance, in order to collect quantitative     experimental details on submitted parts, which might slow down the registration     process but will definitely increase the quality of the database.

We made a 5MM stock of our sequencing primers. We took 20uL of the 1 in 10 dilution of the primers and added 20uL of water to this. This was done for all three primers  We prepared the parts to be sent out for sequencing. Using the purified PCR fragments formed by using the sequence primers, we prepared four PCR tubes to be sent out. For GFP, we used 9.5uL water, 0.5uL sample, and 5uL of 5MM sequencing primer. This was done twice, once using the forward primer and once using the reverse primer. For UV, we used 9.0uL water, 1.0uL sample, and 5uL of 5MM sequencing primer. This was done twice, once using the forward primer and once using the reverse primer. The different amounts of sample was because GFP had a higher concentration than UV.   We co-transformed the UV+pACYC184 and GFP+pBR322 following the transformation protocol. 1uL of each plasmid was used. Also, we heat shocked for 50 seconds instead of 40.

He told us that the state has allocated 180 million dollars to revitalizing the soil in the 1000 square mile radius most heavily contaminated by the plant’s destruction. As of today, approximately 90 million dollars have been spent on the area’s recovery, but only a small fraction of potentially dangerous areas have been tested. With the information gained from meeting with Mr. Tanbara, we learned how crucial it was for our project to be both easily useable and affordable for homeowners. The creation of an at-home test for arsenic will allow citizens to test the soil and water themselves, before requiring assistance from the health department.
Meeting with David Lloyd
Our team was lucky enough to get a meeting with David Lloyd, CEO and Co-Founder of FREDsense Technologies. FREDsense is a Canadian startup based on the 2013 and 2012 Calgary iGEM projects. The focus of the company is to create easily usable field tests for environmental toxins. FRED (Functional Robust Electrochemical Detector) made his first appearance in 2012 alongside OSCAR (Optimized System for Carboxylic Acid Remediation). While OSCAR, the “destroy component” of the project, has not been developed since, FRED (renamed Field-Ready Electrochemical Detector) has made incredible strides since then. Today there are four FRED systems available for pre-order or trial on the FREDsense website, as well as the option of custom sensor development to fit your needs. As an iGEM veteran, current member of the iGEM Human Practices Alumni Committee, and experienced biosensor developer, Mr. Lloyd had welcome advice for us. His guidance helped us develop a plan for what our sensor needed, both ethically, and entrepreneurially.
Meeting with Jeff Nivala
Earlier in the iGEM season, we had a morning interview and lecture with Dr. Jeff Nivala, Sr. Research Scientist and P.I. at University of Washington, as well as a recent addition to the Forbes “30 under 30” list. Dr. Nivala is most known for his research on the storage and transmission of information through molecular barcodes made of DNA and proteins. He has also been an integral part of the development of nanopore sensing technology as a method of protein analysis, which he believes to be the first step in decoding the vast complexities of whole proteomes. After recovering from our initial starstruck reactions, we were thrilled to hear his insight on our project!"

As you can find above, in order to achieve the two goals of (a) detection by reporting the concentration of heavy metal cadmium and (b) forming CdS nanocrystals followed by flocculating when needed, we need 2 plasmids with their one replication origin different from another and different antibiotics so that they can adapt themselves and replicate in one host cell. To make sure that the backbone fits the host cell and the system we design, we chose 2 types of vectors with different copy numbers to see which one is fitter. And to make sure the reporter module can work well, we chose 2 reporter genes from previous registered parts (iGEM11_Uppsala-Sweden), amilCP ( BBa_K592009 ) and RFP ( BBa_E1010 ) to see which one is better. So that adds up to 4 plasmids for function (a). As for function (b), the vector we selected is pET-28b(+).
FIRST plasmid designation:
Gene smtB and smtO-P will be spliced with the reporter gene RFP by SOE PCR. And the product as a new target one (RCP) will be inserted into the backbone by double digestion with the chosen enzymes BamH I & EcoR I and ligation with ligation kit. In order to maintain the function of the original smt locus we will insert smtO-P and smtA (OPA) into the backbone at another site also by double digestion with the chosen enzymes BssH II & Nsi I and ligation with ligation kit.

Small interfering RNA
This approach is based on the gene silencing by small interfering RNA [ 9 ] and is given in the following scheme.
Figure 11. Genes 1 and 3 are present in the self destructive plasmid. Gene 2 is present in the cell and is always produced.
Protein 1 is always produced in the cell and is controlled by the constitutive promoter on gene 2. This protein must be selected carefully since the gene 1 producing the siRNA must be decided based on this protein and the siRNA must be specific for silencing the mRNA of protein 1 without disturbing the other mRNAs of the host organism. The protein 1 will be in excess concentration and hence will inhibit the production of protein 2 (restriction enzyme or fluorescence protein) by repressing the promoter of gene 3. When the production of siRNA is induced by activating the promoter of gene 1, on reaching a threshold it will interfere with the translation of protein 1 and hence the repression of gene 3 is released to produce the protein 2.

Disease rates can drop by up to 88% virtually overnight by providing a community safe drinking water.
For a person with HIV/AIDS, even if he/she has access to medical treatment or antiretroviral medication, but is still forced to drink dirty water from contaminated sources, the diseases in the water he/she drinks will actually kill them faster than AIDS itself.
Women and children spend an average six to eight hours every day walking to fetch water, and the average distance that women and children in developing communities walk to obtain water is 3.75 miles.

How did Lambert iGEM address the survey data
Lambert iGEM created a 3 day camp for rising 8th and 9th graders from the local middle schools, where the team taught them about biotechnology. The team gave lectures over basic content in biology and labs based on biotechnology principles. The participants began the camp not knowing much about science, but by the end, they understood the importance of biotechnology and the different aspects in it. The Lambert iGEM team ran this camp to expand the knowledge of the students in our community about biotechnology in hope that they will consider it a career option. We integrated feedback from the girl scouts troop while planning the summer camp.

Lambert iGEM recognizes the significance of disproportionate demographics in the biotechnology and the scientific community as a whole, especially with women.

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

The primary goal was to simulate bacteria growing on the surface of an agar plate, as these conditions are easy to recreate experimentally and thus provide verification to our model and afterwards expand it to growth on a cell line monolayer we use in our experiments as a colorectal cancer model. Our collaboration with iGEM Columbia was meant to enable these experiments, but unfortunately material shortages only allowed us to experiment in liquid cultures.
Model Description
We start with Fick’s laws of diffusion. In the simplest case of isotropic media without mass transport phenomena or external potentials, the driving force of diffusion is the concentration gradient and the diffusion coefficient is a constant real number. Thus, the general diffusion equation takes the form of the simpler heat equation:
∂
[
A
H
L
]
∂
t
=
D
∇
2
[
A

L
]
It is a parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) in space and time. To specify a solvable problem based on such an equation, many more ingredients are needed:
a geometry
initial conditions
boundary conditions
To actually solve it, we furthermore need to select a solution algorithm, which requires its own ingredients.
If we allowed the diffusion coefficient to vary in space, we’d have a more general form of diffusion. Adding a production term $q$ to the right side, it becomes:

Geometry
The first design decision is to express the problem’s geometry. At a first glance at the task at hand, to model bacteria growing on an agar plate, one might assume a top-down 2D perspective, with the AHL diffusing across the surface away from the bacteria. The diffusion of AHL is inherently a 3D phenomenon though, and this perspective couldn’t easily incorporate the effects of diffusion along the height of the agar gel. In the end, we decided to model the entire 3D volume of an agar plate, with the bacteria at the top of the agar. The agar forms a short cylinder (a disk), surrounded by plastic on 3 sides and air on top. The cylinder is in the order of millimetres in height and centimetres across. An E. Coli cell is about 1μm -- a huge difference in scale"

Freiburg,2017,Team:Freiburg#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,". A puzzle termed immunology for everybody (Immunologie für Jedermann) which was gratefully provided by the German Society for Immunologie (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Immunologie e.V;. DGFI) helped us to explain the different types of immune cell in the body. We talked to people about the importance of vaccinations and faced their questions and insecurities by explaining how the immune system actually works.
DNA Extraction from Fruits
For young science enthusiasts we offered a DNA extraction from fruits by materials commonly found in households and taught them about the properties of the DNA and its building blocks, the nucleotides. Not only the kids, but also their parents were impressed since they do not get the opportunity to see DNA with the naked eye every day.
DNA extraction of bananas at the science fair.
To investigate the origins of such concerns a survey was conducted. Participants were asked for their opinion on specific applications of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and synthetic biology to identify factors which facilitate or hinder acceptance.
Survey
The survey was spread via social media; we got feedback from over 140 participants from different countries, who shared their beliefs and opinions.
The survey revealed, people can be convinced about the benefits of synthetic biology by displaying its practical applications, for example recombinant human insulin or Golden Rice.
In respect to the immune system and vaccinations, there is a clear faction which takes sides for the necessity of vaccines for the whole community. Those who are reluctant towards vaccinations, reveal what their main reasons for their attitude is.
Key Findings
A high proportion of participants is studying sciences.
Genetic modification is most accepted for the purpose of medicine or pharmaceuticals.
Majority in favor of recombinant insulin for diabetes.
Three times more people accept GMF in specific case of golden rice.
41 % of participants do not feel adequately educated about the immune system at school.
A majority is open to receive more information about the immune system.
A disturbingly high fraction of 21 % does not vaccinate themselves and more than half think nationwide mandatory vaccination would better prevent outbreaks of infectious disease.
A vast majority claims to take responsibility for their health and the health of those around them by vaccinating.
91 % would prefer a reminder provided by the government for necessary vaccinations.
42 % of those not vaccinated state they have lost track of their immunization schedule.
Detailed Results
More than 140 participants shared their opinion. The survey is not expected to be representative, but it can give an idea of what people are most concerned about. People were asked to answer simple 'Yes' or 'No' questions or to rate statements on a scale. They also"

WLC-Milwaukee,2015,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"5) There is also much less risk of resistant bacteria forming as only the target bacteria will be infected while the others remain untouched. This is very different from antibiotics that cause drug-resistant strains of numerous species. If, and when, a bacteria does become resistant to a phage, it is much easier and faster to find a new bacteriophage than it is to develop a new antibiotic. (1) Finally, while a phage’s ability to mutate could be seen as a safety threat, it also provides a built-in mechanism to continue to infect bacteria that have adapted a resistance to the original strain. (5)
Conclusion:
While phage therapy is not a new technique, it has only recently started a comeback as a viable antibacterial treatment. Bacteriophages are viruses that can be selected to target and lyse bacteria of choice. Phage therapy has overcome many of the obstacles that cleared the way for antibiotics to take over, and is now in many ways superior to antibiotics. The new surge of research being done on phage therapy continues to reveal exciting new options for the technique.

BNU-China,2014,Team:BNU-China#Chemotaxis.html_-_-_TEXT.html," attractant concentration decreasing for 8F and McfR. There was a significant difference among test and control (p < 0.05), and quantity of cells of 8F and McfR was much more than that of 5A. So both of 8F and McfR have chemotaxis towards malate. And McfR shows stronger response.
Succinate: The tendencies of curves of 8F and McfR towards succinate are same. As the attractant concentration increased, the number of cells arose and reached the maximum at attractant concentration of about 10-2 M and fell sharply with the minimum at attractant concentration of 10-1 M. The quantities of cells of 8F and McfR were almost equivalent and did not have significant difference. But there were significant differences among 8F & 5A, and McfR & 5A: the number of cells of 5A are far less than 8F or McfR (p < 0.05), which demonstrated that 8F and McfR have chemotaxis towards succinate and the capacity of chemotaxis of 8F and McfR towards succinate are almost equal. When compared with malate, 8F shows stronger response, while McfR shows weaker response.

Analysis
The tendency of the chemotaxis towards chemical gradient may be influenced by two factors: pH and phosphorylation state of McpS. The motor of flagella is energized by a H＋ (or Na＋ in some species) gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane (Schmitt, 2003) , but the mechanism is not clear. Lisa M. Maurer and Elizabeth Yohannes proved that low pH (at pH 5.0) induced the expression of some flagellar and chemotaxis genes and proton export, while coinducing oxidative stress and heat shock regulons to maintain internal pH homeostasis and to prepare the cell to survive future exposure to more extreme pH conditions (below pH 5 or above pH 9 which is higher or lower than the cytoplasmic pH 7.6) (Maurer, Yohannes, Bondurant, Radmacher, & Slonczewski, 2005) . The pH of attractants showed below (Fig.5) is at the range of pH 1.0 – 6.4. The highest concentration of 0.1M is pH 1.0 of malate and 2"

Problem Introduction
The core of our project is the signal transducer system on the cell membrane, which consists of a transcription factor chain (TC chain) and a protease (PR) chain (PC chain). The two chains can be combined with the help of an exogenous ligand, thus producing an transcription factor (TF), which is regarded as the output. This is the main mechanism of our system[1], as is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1. The mechanism of our system.
There are several properties measuring the faculty of the system: background noise, system (saturated) output, dynamic range (DR) and system efﬁciency.     The system output without exogenous ligand, regarded as the background noise, comes from the random collision between the two chains[1]. And the system saturated output, on the contrary, characterizes the maximum response strength of our system. Without question, the system will be superior if we maintain the saturated output as well as reduce background noise, namely the increasing of dynamic range. Moreover, the TC chain without transcription factor may still be combined with a PC chain, which makes the PC chain occupied but does not contribute to system output. This phenomenon reduces the utilization of system resources, which is measured by the indicator called system efﬁciency. The practical signiﬁcance of promoting system efﬁciency lies in achieving the same level of system output with fewer resources (i.e., lower chain generation rates).

Detection of Copper ions (Parts’ Improvement)
Overview
This idea was inspired by the naturally-occurring metal-ion-induced promoters. Ligating this kind of promoters with a reporter gene such as RFP is a common idea to visibly monitor the concentration of metal ions.
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C, there naturally exists a copper-induced promoter – CUP1p. The CUP1 promoter is activated by ACE1, a transcription factor which binds to copper ions. It is previously available as a standalone part as BBa_K945002 , produced by Tec-Monterrery’s 2012 iGEM team, and team iGEM16_Washington modified this part with illegal restriction sites removed to make this part ( BBa_K2165004 ) easier to control and operate.  Our goal is to more perfectly characterize this promoter and improve it to create some handy parts.
Improvement
The characterization of this promoter wasn’t perfectly completed, so we first construct a biosensor based on CUP1 promoter ( BBa_K2165004 ) and yEmRFP ( BBa_K2407012 ) to improve the characterization and function of this BioBrick.
To improve this promoter, we first want to shorten this promoter with all core sequence retained. Compared with other promoters used in the prokaryote, this promoter is much longer, which is not beneficial for BioBricks to easily assembly. Under this condition, we want to shorten its sequence as much as possible without functional changes.
In fact, this promoter is leaky in the absence of inducer. To make it more sensitive and lower the threshold of expression, we chose to transform the promoter with error-prone PCR. After finishing the library, the sensitivity and response range of engineered promoters will be characterized by the fluorescence intensity.
After the detection, we will use Mating Switcher to rapidly open following gene’s expression. We can either overexpress CUP1 to enrich copper in the yeast cell or display the Metallothionein on the"

Imperial,2014,Team:Imperial#The i in iGEM_-_-_TEXT.html," Our first assumption was that all judges speak English. We then took each name and tried to match it to an individual and via online CVs, LinkedIn, academic and business profiles we tried to discover the lingual background of the particular individuals. The best case scenario was people listing the languages they can speak (and their level of competency) in their CVs and LinkedIn. If that was not the case, we moved to the university they come from and where they gained their undergraduate degree from. Finally, some judges mentioned their country of origin in their business/ academic profiles and the language was matched. While we recognize that a lot of mistakes could have been made in the process, we tried to be as precise as possible throughout the procedure.
The Countries and Continents
Over the years, 43 different countries have participated in the competition. North America is home to iGEM and the continent with most participating teams. With 33 of its universities in the top 100 of the QS rankings, it’s arguably the leading continent in academia. Over the years, 453 teams originate from the continent, mostly from the United States. Over the years, the US has had teams in the finalists (top 6), 9 times. Alongside North America, Europe was one of the initial participants in the competition when it became international in 2005. It has been represented by 343 universities and colleges over the years. Home to 41 of the 100 top universities in the world, according to QS rankings, Europe attracts a large student population from around the world to its academic institutions. Universities in the UK and Germany have had particularly strong presence in iGEM. European teams have been finalists in the competition an amazing 26 times, more than any other continent in the history of the competition. The best year for Europe was 2009, when all the finalists originated from the continent. Last year, all of the Undergraduate finalists and 2 out of the 3 overgraduate finalists where European teams.
Asia is the continent whose participation in the competition has seen the most rapid increase. Between 2010 and 2014 the participation of Asian teams has grown 115% percent, compared to the 76% of Europe, 79% of North America and the 91% growth in the competition overall. The key player here is China, which has seen a huge 455% increase in number of teams, significantly more than any other participating country. Despite the growth of the continent in the competition, this has not translated into finalists. Only 12% of finalists come from Asia, a mere 5 out of 41"

If there is room at the sides of the plate after this initial zigzag pattern has been made, one can make even more smaller zigzags that borrow cells from the original zigzag pattern. Placed plates in the incubator at 11:28 pm.  Will check on them tomorow at 1:28 pm.  Put the plates from last night into the fridge.

Jamie indicated that hairpins and self-complimentarities should not be a problem in our primers, especially since they can be expected for primers with Biobrick restriction sites.  He suggested that we run a control PCR reaction without any plamid DNA to see what kinds of PCR products will be made just with the primers we use.  Granted, we expect these unwanted PCR products to be small.
Took yeast cells out of incubator at 1:45 pm.  Made two glycerol stocks of each strain (W303_1a and W303_1alpha), each from the same culture/colony.
Also, took plates out of incubator around 1:40 pm.  With the exception of PCYC, they demonstrated few if any isolated colonies. However, it looks like it will be possible to take at least one isolated colony from all plates but p413_GPD. Replated p413_GPD in order to isolate more colonies.  Placed in incubator around 11:40 pm.

Project Description
Sections
Darwin is a software package to document changes to DNA which allows for easy, standardized, and collaborative editing on DNA data up to the genome scale. It builds off of tested and proven version control software, so the entire history of the tracked data is easy to browse and transfer. But Darwin is specifically focused on DNA data, speeding up the tracking process and offering significant security improvements from any current system.
Because Darwin uses existing version control systems, the majority of the heavy lifting is complete already; Darwin can be installed right on top of the existing software. Darwin's contribution is to parse and format the biological data so that it can be used more effectively with these systems. It uses a variety of heuristics to effectively split the data and granularize the changes made to produce change logging orders of magnitude more time- and space-efficient than any other method.
Current Status
The project in its current status can be found in its repository on github . Documentation on the produced software tool can be found on the Program page
The project description is split into four main sections:
Motivation
Process
Experimentation
Conclusions
It's important for teams to describe all the creativity that goes into an iGEM project, along with all the great ideas your team will come up with over the course of your work.
It's also important to clearly describe your achievements so that judges will know what you tried to do and where you succeeded. Please write your project page such that what you achieved is easy to distinguish from what you attempted.

Agent Orange and the American - Vietnam war
During the War between the US and Vietnam in the 1960’s, thousands of kilometers of land were heavily sprayed with an herbicide called Agent Orange, which was used to clear heavily forested areas. But TCDD was an unintended byproduct of Agent Orange production; thus, the military had unknowingly contaminated all of that land with this toxin. Even today, over 50 years after the event took place, the United States is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to reclaim that land.
Seveso disaster in Italy
An accident at a chemical factory in Seveso, Italy in 1976 resulted in the highest known exposure to TCDD in residential areas. A mixture of toxic chemicals, including TCDD, was released into the air, contaminating an area of about 15 km2 where over 37,000 people lived. Within days, over 3000 animals in the area, including livestock, had perished, with over 80,000 animals being put down in order to prevent the contamination from entering our food chain. In addition, nearly 500 residents received severe skin lesions. In studies on the long-term effects of exposure on the affected population, higher incidences of cancer, nerve damage, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and impaired liver function were observed. This event gave rise to numerous scientific studies and standardized industrial safety regulations in Europe.

Chemical Induction
From the Module 1 genetic circuit , in the absence of IPTG in the system, the LacI repressor inhibits production of the protein of interest.  When IPTG is added in we start the production of the drug of interest:
In a batch culture system, a defined volume of media is innoculated with a small number of cells. If the cells are being used for protein production, it is vital that synthesis is initiated at the right time. The optimum time for protein production is when there are a large number of rapidly dividing cells in a nutrient rich media.
In our system, the protein of interest is synthesised at the start of the production process in a phase known as Module 1 . Importantly, the time at which Module 1 starts is controlled by the addition of a chemical inducer called IPTG. This means that Module 1 can be initiated when there is the optimum ratio of cells to remaining nutrients.
Induction with IPTG
IPTG is an allolactose analogue. Allolactose is the lactose metabolite that triggers the transcription of the lactose operon in natural systems. Allolactose and IPTG activate transcription of the lac operon by binding to the LacI protein. When such binding occurs, the LacI protein changes confirmation, which renders it unable to bind to the operator region thus allowing the RNA polymerase to continue reading beyond the operator and transcribe the downstream genes.
The Lac operon
The lac operon is responsible for transport and metabolism of lactose in E-coli, and has the following architecture: The lacI gene codes for the LacI protein, which inhibits transcription of the genes downstream by binding to the operator region (po). This inhibition is effective because the RNA polymerase is forced to drop off the DNA template when encountering a bound operator region. LacZ encodes the enzyme β-galactosidase responsible for the degradation of β-galactosides. Since lactose is a β-galactoside, the enzyme will degrade lactose into galactose and"

In order to verify the function of P-atp2, we attached it to Lac Z alpha. In a pXMJ19 plasmid, it was used to transfer this sequence. As this has been thoroughly tested in our lab, we designed to put X-gal into four fermenters equipped with P-atp2-B0034-Lac Z alpha, maintained at ±1 units in different pH from 6.0 to 9.0. The pH was controlled by addition of HCl or NaOH. Compared with empty plasmid, experimental group was bluer than the corresponding control group. However, it became bluer and bluer along with the increasing extracellular pH.
So far, the promoter P-atp2 induced at a range of alkaline pH has been verified. To achieve precise control of the acid production, error-prone was utilized. In this step, we optimized the function of P-atp2, to mutate and filtrate a number of accurate promoters with activity. Despite using EP-PCR, the function of P-atp didn’t change, so we chose those promoters to build a database.
Overall, we have achieved important success in establishing P-atp2 promoters with different efficiency. And we can use it in plenty of specific alkaline situations.

Valencia,2009,Team:Valencia#A short story#Osamu_-_-_TEXT.html," different fluorescent proteins that emit various colors, from blue to red. Today, GFP is widely used as a fluorescent marker of protein molecules and cells, and it is an essential tool in the study of biology, physiology, and medicine. GFP has been used also in other fields, such as the detection of cadmium, zinc, and explosive TNT and fumes (Zimmer, 2005). The range of applications of the fluorescent proteins is beyond imagination.
After my retirement
I retired from the Marine Biological Laboratory in 2001. Because I wanted to do some more experiments and also I was still supplying aequorin samples to people upon request, I moved all my laboratory equipment and chemicals to my home, where I set up my Photoprotein Laboratory. My retirement symposium, ""GFP and Aequorin,"" was held at the MBL's Lillie Auditorium on July 27, 2002, through the kind arrangement of Dr. Shinya Inoué, a world authority on microscopy. Among the attendees were Martin Chalfie and Roger Tsien. I started to write a book for the next generation students who want to explore the chemistry of bioluminescence. The book Bioluminescence: Chemical Principles and Methods was published by World Scientific Press in 2006. The book contains a comprehensive overview and chemical information on all known bioluminescence systems, comprising 35 different types of bioluminescent organisms. The summer of 2004 was splendid. In July, I received the Pearse Prize from the Royal Microscopical Society for the discovery of GFP. In early August, I gave an invited lecture at the International Bioluminescence and Chemiluminescence Symposium. In the end of August, I attended the symposium, ""Calcium-Regulated Photoproteins and Green Fluorescent Protein"", which was held in my honor at the Friday Harbor Laboratories as part of the lab's centennial celebration. At this symposium, almost all the well-known researchers in bioluminescence and related fields gathered from all over the world, including Martin Chalfie, Roger Tsien, Shimya Inoué and Atsushi Miyawaki. I was happy to see many of my old friends, though I was a little sad to observe that the sea at Friday Harbor was steadily being polluted. In 2006, I received the Asahi prize, one of the most prestigious prizes in Japan.
I would like to add a note on the jellyfish Aequorea at Friday Harbor. Between 1961 and 1988, we traveled"
Munich,2017,Team:Munich#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," informed patients may be harmed in case of false-negative results; treatment will be postponed and the condition will worsen. Consumer information should promote more informed usage for self-testing 12 .
False-positives occur when the device shows a positive result, though the true result should be negative. Although this incorrect result might be seen as less harmful, because a positive result for a severe disease like HIV must be then confirmed 3 , a patient testing positive for a milder condition might receive unnecessary and potentially harmful treatment.
Analytical sensitivity
False-negative between infection and seroconversion (time period during which a specific antibody develops and becomes detectable in the blood): this risk is related to immunoassays and is less relevant for tests like ours which are based on the detection of nucleic acids.
Accuracy
Accuracy depends on the performance of the test and the ability of an inexperienced person to properly use it 13 . While the performance is a subject of regulation, it was shown that some devices fail to deliver clear complete usage instructions 13 . However, even when the instructions are provided, they are not always followed by all the users 13 . There are contradictory results regarding this aspect, for example a review about the studies on usage of HIV self-tests showed that most participants properly performed home tests and obtained accurate results 3 . The same review suggests people often had trouble performing blood-based tests. On the other hand, the results of another study among young adults suggests that many of them did not follow all instructions while performing the test for such severe conditions as a HIV infection 4 .
A poorly functioning home test may harm credibility in the reliability of rapid tests and, for example, weaken efforts to expand HIV detection 2 .
Absence of professional counseling
In case of self-testing the user does not get immediate counseling from a health professional, which means delayed access to professional care 11 . Currently available HIV self-tests have limited follow-up options, for example, in the U.S. generally only a phone number is provided which participants may call 8 . Instead, governmental programs of follow-up counseling with clear further instructions are required in case of a positive result. This study also points out that self-tests additionally fail to guide users, whose tests are negative, to preventive services in order to reduce the risk of future HIV infections 8 . As a possible solution, self-test devices may be equipped with an Internet of Things module reporting the case with delivery of timely, active follow-up counseling and referrals over the phone 8 .
Some users may initiate self-treatment based on results they found on the Internet, which may be misleading and harmful for their health.

Let us tell you a fabulous TALE...
Transactivator-Like Effectors (TALEs) are a brand-new technology that currently revolutionizes the way researchers manipulate DNA with exceptional site specificity. Originally derived from ''Xanthomonas spp.'', this type of protein comprizes an effector domain and a modular DNA binding domain that can be rationally designed to bind to virtually any target sequence of DNA. Over the past two years, universal endonucleases (TALENs) and transcription factors have been tested in various organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. According to existing protocols, TALE assembly requires several weeks of work and substantial lab skills. In order to bring this technology within reach for iGEM students, we invented an extremely fast and easy TALE assembly strategy and developed a TALE platform with expression plasmids and new classes of TALEs. With our so called GATE assembly kit, future iGEM students will be able to precisely manipulate genomic loci easier and faster than anyone else in the world.

ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#Modeling#Photoinduction_-_-_TEXT.html," [s-1] for our ODE model can be computed as integral over all events at all wavelengths, i.e. the integral of the product of the photoconversion cross section σλ times the photon flux Nλ; In our case approximated numerically.
For CcaS and Cph1 we computed kon and koff, for Lov and YcgF kon only. Additionally our ODE model used dark decay rate constants for all of the receptors to approximate the spontaneous deactivation.
Validation of the model
The results of our method are consistent with the results of a corresponding book chapter [Mancinelli1986] and of the 2010 ETH Zuerich Team’s model. In both cases we reached high accordance; The small difference can be explained by our approximation of the extinction coefficient.
Results & Discussion
Our primary target was to compute rate constants as input for our ODE models. Nevertheless we gained immediate insights from these first results.
Reaction rate constants
The following table contains the reaction rate constants for source-receptor-combinations. The values for activation and deactivation are of the same order of magnitude except for all combinations of sun/room with Lov/YcgF. This is due to a fixed dark decay rate and no light induced deactivation of these receptors.

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"ium would be free in the environment and thus not contained in an enclosed container with medium. Therefore, an auxotrophic mechanism would not be applicable. Here we turn to a ‘kill switch’ or induced lethality mechanism, which is less reliable because of spontaneous mutations that could inactivate or disable this ‘kill switch’.  Different kill switches are already being used in the iGEM competition and we find it very important that the work of previous iGEM teams do not go to waste which is why we decided to look into several 'kill switches' developed by previous iGEM teams.
Genetic safeguard strategies
Recombinant DNA (green) is introduced into the host chromosome. Two pathways for engineered auxotrophy (A and B) kill synthetic organisms once they lose access to a supplement (+) in a controlled environment. The supplement either (A) suppresses a toxic gene product (−) or (B) provides nutrition to compensate for a genetic deletion. The induced lethality system (C) produces a toxic gene product (−) in response to an inducer (i) such as IPTG, sucrose, arabinose, or heat (Moe-Behrens et al., 2013).
Auxotrophic mechanism
We, the KU Leuven iGEM team of 2013, propose the use of an auxotrophic mechanism as our main genetic safeguard, when we use our 'sticker system'.
The basic mechanism of the tryptophan auxotrophic bacteria is based on the fact that they are unable to synthesise the essential compound, tryptophan, required for their survival, which means we must provide tryptophan in their medium. They therefore rapidly die once they escape from the controlled environment where the compound is supplied.
Already in 1987, Molin and colleagues designed a DNA cassette that functions as a conditional suicide system in any healthy bacterial strain. In the absence of an artificially supplied growth supplement, the cassette produces a toxic protein that disrupts the bacterial cell's membrane and kills the cells. A stochastic activation of this toxic component could also be used to kill a predetermined fraction of cells per unit of time. This helps to tune the level of lethality so that an optimal level of bioproduction is achieved (Moe-Behrens et al., 2013).
This is a good candidate for the biocontainment of BanAphids in the 'sticker' (Design of Groningen iGEM 2012) or 'sticker system'. This plastic sticker is composed of a plastic film with"

So we designed a device to allow the cells grow at low density when the Eco-Lock is closed and at high density when the Eco-Lock is open.
As described in the gene circuit, when add inducer(AHL) as input, the compound that bound of inducer and LuxR can inhibit promoter R0063. Therefore, when the cell concentration is under a certain threshold, the isolated gene MinC won't express in cell under normal growth. With the number of cells increasing, Aii expression increasing as well, Aii will cause the decomposition of AHL, leading to a lower input concentration. When the input concentration decrease to a certain threshold, promoter R0063 works, gene MinC (or suicide gene) expresses, cell division stops, the number of cells stay stable.
3.3 RESULTS
Min system contains three functional genes, MinC ,MinD and MinE . MinC is cell division inhibitor of the MinC - MinD -MinE and DicB - MinC systems that regulate septum placement. MinD is membrane ATPase of the MinC - MinD - MinE system that regulates septum placement .MinE is cell division topological specificity factor .We designed 3 pairs of primers to copy MinC, MinD and MinE from E.coli which contained the enzyme digest sites of EcoRI, XbaI, spaI and PstI . MinC, MinD, MinE were constructed into pSB1C3 as new standard parts.  We constructed MinC and MinD in this part. We obtained standard biological parts J23119 - B0034, C0060, J23119 - B0034 - C0062, R0063, B0032 from iGEM, and we finished the ligation of the whole circuits of Min system through 3A assembly and OE PCR. While the verification of this section is still in progress.

Outside the Lab | Wiki editing tutorial
Have a look!
The iGEM wiki is the public face of iGEM projects and the most effective way to communicate the results of the project. However, most iGEM teams members don’t know how to edit a webpage. If you are one of those, this tutorial was created just for you.
iGEM wiki editing tutorial (Spanish)
iGEM wiki editing tutorial (English)
Wiki editing tutorial resources & examples
The iGEM wiki is where teams write all the information about their projects to make it available for teams participating the next year, judges or people interested in the project. It is also the place where team members itself go to remember their iGEM experience and see how the project looks like after all the work done during the summer. The wiki might be the most important derivable of the competition for the iGEM community since it lasts for the subsequent years and it can be inspiring for other iGEM teams. Therefore, having a nice wiki it is a requisite to make an important contribution to the iGEM community. However, most iGEM teams are mainly composed of students of biology-related fields, which usually do not have the necessary skills to set up a wiki.
This tutorial was created with the intention to facilitate learning how to edit a decent iGEM wiki page to team members with no prior experience in wiki editing. This way, teams will be able to document their project in a better way in their wikis and let them focus on iGEM projects without struggling to learn how to edit the wiki. At the end of this tutorial, team members will be able to interact with the iGEM wiki properly and to design their wikis to have an impact in the iGEM community.
Orientation
This tutorial was created for non-computer science students by non-computer ones. In fact, the idea and the motivation of creating it arose from the difficulties found during the beginning of the summer while editing the wiki. The more we tried to make things work, the more we realized this tutorial could be very useful to other teams.
As the content is created by non-experts, all the concepts are explained so that they can be understood without prior knowledge in web development. This is a must in order to reach the final audience for which the tutorial was created, inexperienced students. However, some concepts might not be exactly accurate in its definition. We did our best to maintain a good equilibrium in being accurate without making things excessively difficult or confusing for inexperienced students"

Understandability determines whether or not the encoding information can be decoding, that is, whether is in a form that they can comprehend.[4][5] High understandability allows educated layman and non-experts to access to information and knowledge transferred. Definition and explanation of technical term is strongly recommended by National Cancer Institute[6]. Moreover, since today’s reader is not tomorrow’s reader, we can’t expect the audience of carry-on learning.  The assistance of illustration or infographics can enhance the audience’s comprehension of an issue[7]. For Newspaper and Journals in Taiwan, providing alternative language for technical terms can be important. Generic category label, or Schema, helps people activate proper and related structure of information. Offering terminology in more than one language can help people acquainted with different language and different knowledge level to reactivate the right structure and storing place of knowledge[8]. We would consider if terminology explanation, additional assistance and terminological translation are provided in the context.
Besides information sufficiency and understandability, we also want to know in what attitude is the information being transferred to the audience. In the sub-study of the attitude part, we perform consistency test on the analyzer and our instructor who are also a sociologist, Professor Tsai.
Research Limit
There are three main limit to our research:
1. The limit of transfer effectiveness access. Information sufficiency is highly related to the audience needs, thus it is challenging to define and                     measure whether or not the information presented is sufficient. In addition, in our research, we are not going to do any experiment and survey testing                     whether the 2 elements we investigating in would really affect the transfer effectiveness. All we could do is cite it from paper. Here are some cases we                     consider it helpful for iGEMers who are also interested in social research.
(1). In 2015 iGEM Oxford , the problem they want to tackle with is presented as below:
• Antibiotics have negative side effects and their resistance is a growing problem
• UTIs are the most common hospital-acquired infection and the bacteria that cause them are frequently resistant to antibiotics
• Antibiotic resistance in UTIs is caused by biofilms
• Biofilms are currently estimated to be responsible for over 65% of all hospital-acquired infections
• Current UTI treatments are ineffective and fail to prevent recurrent infections

Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Pace_-_-_TEXT.html," we tested M13 phages encoding 4 different split T7 variants for their ability to propagate on an E. coli selection strain transformed with a pT7-geneIII accessory plasmid. The variant encoding the split site at T7 residues 564/565 showed highest propagation and was therefore chosen for further optimization via PACE. We generated a PACE strain, by co-transforming our T7-gene III AP and MP4
RN159
. Then, by using our custom-build setup, we performed 30 hours of in vivo directed evolution via PACE (Figure 6).
Figure 6: Concept for evolution of split T7 towards improved auto-reassembly by PACE
Phages are continuously propagated on a mutagenic E. coli selection strain, carrying an AP comprising of a T7 promoter driving gene III. Thereby, variants should evolve, which show improved split T7 function.
During the PACE run continuously monitored the phage titer as well as optical density of our E. coli hosts (Figure 7). The used flow rate was approximately 1 lagoon volume per hour and adapted according to the optical density measurements.
Figure 7: Monitoring of Phage Titer and Optical Density during the Split T7 PACE run.
(A) Phage titer was estimated by manual sampling every 5 hours followed by plague essay. (B) Samples were taken every two hours and OD600 was determined using a nanophotometer. During the whole PACE run, the optical density is located in the range of 0.5 to 1, which is equivalent to the reaction conditions reported in the literature
RN44'
.
After having finished our PACE run, we performed plague assays and PCR amplified the Split T7 genes from 5 different plagues followed by sanger-sequenced. As hoped, we observed a recurrent, coding mutation (T877P) present in three out of the five sequenced split T7 variants (Figure 8).
Figure 8: Mutational pattern of the evolved split T7 variant.
Following three days of in vivo evolution with PACE, a plague assay was performed and the split T7 insert of five individual phage clones was analyzed by sanger-sequencing. We observed a recurrent mutation (T877P) in three out of the five clones, suggesting an evolutionary advantage (i.e. increased fitness) of the corresponding split T7 mutant as compared its non-mutated counterpart.
Interestingly this residue is located very close to the interaction surface of the two split T7 domains, suggesting a possible role in T7 auto-re"

Auxotrophy of PACO strain
The aim of this test was to assess the behaviour of the auxotroph strain PACO at different levels of polyamines being 10mM of Putrescine and 5 mM of spermidine and 0.0195 mM of Putrescine and 0.00975mM of spermidine the highest and the lowest concentration of polyamines respectively. As a control DH5alfa strain was used. The schema of the 96 wells plate can be observed below.
Procedure
Both strains, DH5α and PACO, were harvested in a liquid culture with optimal conditions until saturation.
Optical density of both cultures was  mesaured and the concentration was readjusted to be 0.1 A.
Growth mediums were cleaned twice in order to ensure a perfect control over the growing conditions during the test.
A M9-polyamines Mix (x2) was prepared.
M9-polyamines Mix (x2)
22.12 μL Putrescine (1000x)

2.5 mL
Last column of the 96 wells plate was filled with 100μL of M9-polyamines Mix (x2) and 100 μL of M9.
100μL of M9 was placed at each well except for the last column.
100μL of M9-polyamines Mix (x2) was placed at well A-11 and resuspended.
100μL were transferred from well A-11 to well A-10.
1:2 serial dilutions were performed all along the row until well A-1, discarding the 100μL remaining in the last step.
This procedure was repeated for all the remaining rows of the 98 wells plate.
Finally, 100μL of cells with the convenient antibiotic were placed at each well; form A-D with DH5α strain and from E-H with PACO strain.

ASIJ_Tokyo,2016,Team:ASIJ Tokyo#ASIJProjectDescription_-_-_TEXT.html," Thus far we have determined that we will be using a western blot test to help us deal with the signal peptides. We also have three promoters (one on the slightly weaker side and two on the stronger side) taken from the list of Anderson promoters to test in order to determine how to make PETase most efficient.
However, before testing such promoters, we need to isolate and evaluate each promoters' effectiveness and efficiency. This information is essential before we proceed onto our next steps and think about real world applications. Questions we may ask ourselves following this first step include: “How long will the degradation take?” and “Will the byproducts of the degradation be harmful in any way to the environment or to people?”
Our aim, as stated above, is to find a faster, more efficient process to degrade plastic. Answers to such questions will be essential in seeking solutions to global environmental problems. In regards to the first question, to our current knowledge, 450 years is the timeframe for the natural biodegradation of PET. From our perspective, this time frame is inefficient when you consider how much PET is used daily. As a result, our experiment focuses on increasing the efficiency of the degradation of plastic through the manipulation of PETase. These are just some examples of the types of questions that we must first consider. Once our confidence in our research progresses, we can fully focus on individual procedural steps of our project such as the Western Blot test.
Abstract
In recent years, the production of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) has increased rapidly, as a result of low production costs and consumer demands.  PET is one of the most common plastic polymers, comprised of repeating monomeric subunits of Terephthalic Acid and Ethylene Glycol. It is frequently used in the manufacture of plastic bottles and clothing fibres, especially in Japan. As avid users of PET-based products, our team decided to research how to optimise the degradation of PET, which takes an average of 450 years to degrade naturally. We were further inspired to pursue this goal with Keio University’s recent discovery of Ideonella sakainesis — a unique bacteria capable of PET degradation. Thus, we have focused our project on the synthesis of an optimal PETase biobrick, which would be included in the iGEM database. Ultimately, our goal is to find an ideal promoter to expedite the production and secretion of PETase.

Plus les séquences bactériennes qui vont interférer avec tous les processus de méthylation et déméthylation, qui font que cet élément génétique transposé sera moins stable. C’est un peu l’intérêt d’être à la croisée entre l’eucaryote et le procaryote ».
Par ailleurs, Willy Rozenbaum a rappelé que « sur ce type de sujet, c’est très bien balisé aujourd’hui en termes de sécurité » : le produit ne serait évidemment pas mis sur le marché avant d’avoir subi de nombreux tests visant à vérifier son innocuité. Des organisations comme l’Afssaps, les modélisations les essais cliniques////Si on considère que le risque est non-négligeable, il faut se demander s’il vaut la peine d’être pris en compte. Thierry Magnin a donné une traduction du principe de responsabilité formulé par Hans Jonas : « ayant essayé d’estimer les risques, je vais essayer de travailler au maximum sur le risque le plus grave ». La maladie à laquelle on s’attaque le justifie-t-elle ? D’après Bernard Baertschi, « le cancer est une maladie extrêmement grave, pour laquelle on accepte de prendre des risques déjà maintenant ».

  ③: The fast flow rate may make the upstream beads to be washed to the downstream, so that the aptamer’s complementary strand would cleavage and release lysine with absence of the AFP,which would increase the risk of false positive diagnosis
 In contrast, in this regard we need to meet the requirements as following:
  ①: Ability to perform a smooth injection without blocking and bubbles in constant injection rate condition.
  ②: Magnetic beads would not be washed to the downstream.
Experiments
 In order to verify whether the chip can meet the demands,we designed the experiment as following
2.1 Verify the flow of liquid in the microfluidic chip at the best injection rate.
2.1.1 Experiment purpose
 At an improper injection rate, a lot of bubbles will be generated when the liquid is injected into the microfluidic chip,which will cause increase of dead volume and decrease of the biological reaction space.There will be a large deviation as a consequence. The purpose of this experiment is to observe and record the flow at a suitable injection rate we have determined.It is proved that it will not produce a large number of bubbles when we inject liquid into microfluidic chip at this rate.
2.1.2 Method
 1.Put a certain amount of pigment into the water, to simulate the sample solution
 2. Adjust the syringe pump parameters so that the flow rate is 37 μl per minute and connect the syringe and microfluidic chip
 3. Start to inject and take a picture
2.1.3Experimental results：
 From the experimental results (Figure 1.7)we can see that it will not produce a lot of bubbles when we inject liquid into microfluidic chip at the rate of 37ul/min, that is to say we can ensure the accuracy of the test results.
 
2.2  Verify the adsorption of magnets and bead - aptamer complexes
2.2.1 Experiment purpose
 To verify whether the bead-aptamer complexes will be rushed downstream at 37 μl/minute.
2.2.2 Method
 We used a magnetic bead-aptamer complex with a fluorescent complementary strand in this experinment.First we inject magnetic bead suspension into chamber II,then keep injecting water at the speed of 37μl / min for 8 minutes. While injecting water,we used a centrifuge tube to catch out of the liquid from the outlet.After that,we pointed the liquid in the 96-well plate,and detected the fluorescence"

In conclusion colicin Fy inhibits the growth of yersinias very fast and the effects lasts for a long while acording to the results, the negative control always grows much more.
Colicin Fy specificity test
To see if the Colicin Fy really is as specific as we thought, we had to try it on other bacteria. Apart from testing them on Y. enterocolitica we also managed to get a hold of risk class one versions of Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Klebsiella as well as Lactobacillus plantarum and the standard E. coli DH5-alpha. We did multiple tests with varying results.  The tests were performed in the same way as the inhibition test above. However OD600 measurements were made here since no aggregations could be seen in most of our cultures, see table A. The table indicates that the colicin Fy is probably specific, but something seems to have gone wrong with the plating, see figures E, and that result was inconclusive.

Expert consultation
From the very beginning we have interviewed an expert, Prof. Shiru Jia who specializes in microbial fermentation,for his professional viewpoints and deep understanding about BC.
Q：Why is the application of BC in China rare? The reason why the BC products are low-value.
A: BC has high water retention, high mechanical strength and outstanding biocompatibility. This means BC can be used in medical products and cosmetics. However, these types of products fail to widely appear on the market because of its cost. Producing BC medical products and beauty products is very strictly controlled, which requires professional equipment and workers, so it is costly. In contrast, BC food products such as coconut production is very simple and inexpensive. That is why BC mainly produced into some low-value products such as food. Therefore, if you can optimize the pathway of Acetobacter xylinus to increase BC production, you may reduce the cost of BC products in the future.
Q: What is the focus of future research on BC materials?
BC composites can make up for the deficiency of natural BC, but there are still problems of high producing cost, low performance and low level of industrialization. To solve these problems, the future research focuses on:
Obtaining stable and high yield strains through efficient genetic engineering.
Exploring the new BC industrial producing methods, including the design of efficient                                 and inexpensive biofilm production device.
Use BC structure of light-based easy to combine and synthetic biology, improve product value and expand the scope of product applications.
Q: What is the current situation in BC production?
A: BC production is slow, so the fermentation cycle is very long. In addition, the producing process requires sterile conditions. Thus, the production requires a lot of labor cost and capital investment. Therefore, the study now focus on accelerating the speed of fermentation so that BC could film quickly.

Debate
Presentation:
In the beginning of July 2011, we were contacted by the KULeuven team, the other Belgian team participating in the iGEM competition. They proposed we meet to organize a joint debate on bioethics and our respective projects.
We immediately accepted! then began the preparations for this event. We had to contact professors, politicians, medias and so on. We quickly agreed on a date regarding the teachers’ availability, the 1st September. Even though we had different types of organization, we succeeded in making this debate as nice as possible for both of the teams. We finally had 4 professors come to our event. Hereunder, you’ll find a brief description of each:
Prof. PhD. Filip Rolland is professor at the K.U.Leuven in molecular physiology of plants and microorganisms. His research topic is plant metabolic signaling, mainly on ‘sugar signaling’. The department of molecular physiology of plants and microorganisms, functional biology is further investigating the SnRK1 (discovered in Arabidopsis thaliana) signaling pathway and its role in controlling plant metabolism, development and stress resistance.
Prof. PhD. Jacques van Helden is professor at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, and director of the Laboratory of Genome and Network Bioinformatics (http://www.bigre.ulb.ac.be/). Initially trained as agronomic engineer, his PhD thesis focused on the genetic regulation of nervous system development in Drosophila. Since 1997, his research activities have been dedicated to the development of bioinformatics approaches to analyze genomes and networks of molecular interactions (regulation, metabolism, protein interactions).
Prof. PhD. Johan De Tavernier is a professor at the K.U.Leuven. He has a degree in Moral Theology and since 1996, he has been the director of the Centre for Agricultural Bio- and Environmental Ethics (now the Centre for Science, Technology and Ethics). In one of his books ‘science, ethics and society’ (published in 2004) he discusses whether biotechnology is necessary to solve world hunger.

This gene does not contain upstream regulatory elements and lacks the sok gene. Thus, the hokD locus probably constitutes an evolutionary relic of an ancient hok-homolog.
Application in our project
Since we just need a killer gene to realize the suicide procedure, only the toxin protein is needed.
In early stage of our project, according to the document literature, considering protein stability, dose relationship, accessibility and theoretical lethal efficiency or some other factors, mazF (theoretical lethal efficiency reaches to 95%)and hokD(has a relatively clear quantitative relation with Lon protease which can hydrolyse hokD’s corresponding antitoxin) are chosen as our candidates of killer gene from the frequently-used TA system.
After constructing the circuits of killer device and testing the efficiency of mazF and hokD controlled by pBAD, which can be induced by arabinose, mazF finally become our final choice for having better lethal effect and will be applied in our final circuit.

Since 221 BCE, when the Qin Dynasty first conquered several states to form a Chinese empire, the country has expanded, fractured and been reformed numerous times. The Republic of China (ROC) overthrew the last dynasty in 1911, and ruled the Chinese mainland until 1949. After the surrender of the Empire of Japan in World War II, the Communist Party defeated the nationalist Kuomintang in mainland China and established the People's Republic of China in Beijing on 1 October 1949, while the Kuomintang relocated the ROC government to its present capital of Taipei.  China had the largest and most complex economy in the world for most of the past two thousand years, during which it has seen cycles of prosperity and decline.[15][16] Since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978, China has become one of the world's fastest-growing major economies. As of 2014, it is the world's second-largest economy by nominal total GDP and largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). China is also the world's largest exporter and second-largest importer of goods.[17] China is a recognized nuclear weapons state and has the world's largest standing army, with the second-largest defence budget.[18][19] The PRC has been a United Nations member since 1971, when it replaced the ROC as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. China is also a member of numerous formal and informal multilateral organizations, including the WTO, APEC, BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the BCIM and the G-20. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower by a number of commentators."

Figure 1. One-third of community health center patients were uninsured.
(Data from Community Health Network of Washington)
Access to health care benefits individuals and the society in various ways, while limited access to health care negatively influences the quality of life. The major barriers concerned with the access to health care include lack of availabilities, high costs and lack of insurance coverage. These limits lead to delays in receiving appropriate treatments, unmet health needs, inabilities to get preventive services and hospitalization. The access to health care could be improved in four different aspects: services, costs, timeliness and effectiveness, which are also considered to be critical factors for effective pathogen detection service.
Improving the pathogen detection system depends on ensuring that people have a common and ongoing source of health services, especially increasing the access to and the use of evidence-based preventive services or facilities. Prevention of illness should be improved by detecting early warning signs or symptoms before they develop into serious diseases, considering the detection of diseases at early stages leads to the most effective and cost-effective treatments. The cost of health care directly affects the access to related services or facilities for the reason that people could not afford the cost for health care would be less likely to receive appropriate medical care and more likely to have poor health status. Lack of inexpensive pathogen detection services makes it difficult for people to get better health care and burden them with large medical bills. Timeliness refers to the ability of health care systems to provide health care quickly, including reducing the time to wait for services or facilities and the time for detection or treatment. Prolonged time for detection of pathogens decreases the satisfaction of patients, increases the number of patients who give up detection or treatment, and is closely related to the clinically significant delays in medical treatment. The effectiveness of health care is one of the most important concerns in improving medical conditions because it’s directly related to the quality of medical treatments and the reliability of the health care system.

Q15: Where you get the date for modeling?
A: We obtain the most data from the experimental results. To some date cannot from the experiments, we adjust these data from the latest literature to make the models more consistent with the experimental results.
Q16：Can we change the promoters to prevent the problem of basal expression?
A: Those promoters could be replaced by other promoters. The aim of our project is to provide a new solution for logic lock in microorganisms; all biobricks in our system are able to be changed if the architecture is intact.

Biota Beats at Ginkgo Bioworks
After several weeks of publicizing the YSI, the first session took place on October 15th, 2016. That                     morning, our pioneering cohort of youth participants arrived at Ginkgo Bioworks - a bioengineering                     startup nestled on the drydock in Boston’s Seaport District. After a brief introduction to YSI and                     its core organizers, the majority of the day centered on the idea of “Making Molecules.” Initial                     interactive lessons described several microorganisms in nature, how some make their own molecules                     and for what purposes. Presenters drew on examples such as haloarchaea and yeast.
Kit McDonnell of Ginkgo Bioworks presents to youth on microbes in nature.
Didactic lectures were kept to the bare minimum while activities, videos, pair sharing, and                     demonstrations were the main educational tools used. YSI participants were always encouraged to                     participate and ask questions.
Ranjith Anand of Ginkgo Bioworks and YSI participant Aspen Johnson talk about the relationship between yeast, fruit, and smells.
A design activity, where participants were given the opportunity to design their own microbes,                     yielded incredibly innovative ideas ranging from microbial pollution eliminators, water purity                     indicators, mini-machine repairers, and even microbes that would enable ovenless baking!
YSI participant brainstorms on what her microbe of the future might do.
Following a pizza lunch, the cohort was given a personalized tour of the Ginkgo Bioworks foundry.                     There, the youth were given an overview of how the lab uses robots and tools like bioreactors,                     fermentation hoods, and mass spectrometers to build microbes that make molecules.
EMW Street Bio’s first-ever Youth Science Initiative cohort. At Ginkgo Bioworks, local youth were introduced to topics in microbiology, synthetic biology, and Biota Beats.
Street Bio founder David Kong providing a brief overview of microbiology and engineering to YSI youth.
Eventually, following the foundry tour the cohort had a second set of interactive lessons on the                     human microbiome and the intersections between the microbiology and engineering. Through a guided                     question-and-answer lesson, the YSI participants demonstrated a strong understanding of microbiota.                     We then transitioned over from our science studies to music. We brought in and set up a classic                     vinyl record player and while playing a Stevie Wonder record, we explained how we might be able to                     create records out of our own microbiota.

Waterloo,2013,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html,"ering it to be packaged into viral particles and preventing further accumulation of the RF form [1] (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Life cycle of M13 bacteriophage.
M13 bacteriophage is routinely used to isolate single stranded DNA by “tricking” the M13 viral proteins into packaging heterologous DNA that carries the M13 viral packaging site. This site, called the M13 ori, is necessary and sufficient for packaging of circular DNA carrying the site into M13 viral particles [7]. Heterologous DNA packaged this way can still be delivered to an F+ cell and the cell will maintain the circular DNA as a plasmid. A plasmid carrying the M13 ori is termed a “phagemid”. This aspect of M13 bacteriophage is used in DNA messaging.
Importantly, cells infected with M13 bacteriophage do not lyse. Rather, the bacteriophage is secreted through the cell membrane and the cell continues to grow at ½ to ¾ its normal rate [7].
In our attempt to design a system that regulates DNA messaging by controlling M13 particle production, we had the option of manipulating any of the 11 genes in the M13 genome.
M13’s relatively small genome can be classified in three subsets: structural (genes III, and VI - IX), morphogenetic (genes I, IV, and XI), and replicative (genes II, V, and X). The main function behind each of the proteins can be seen in the table below:
Protein:
Function:
pI
Spans the inner membrane of infected bacteria; interacts with viral pIV and host’s thioredoxin; potentially initiates phage assembly [1, 9, 10]
pII
Nicks at specific site in intergenic region of + strand of replicative form (RF) DNA, starting rolling-circle replication; cleaves single-stranded (ss) product of rolling-circle replication; required  for the initiation  of fl RF DNA synthesis [2, 10]
pIII
Minor coat protein; required for adsorption of phage to sex pili of new hosts [1]
pIV
Resides mainly on outer membrane of infected cell; interacts with pXI and pI within the perisplasm in order to form a gate channel for secretion [1, 9, 10]
pV
Sequesters the viral strands displaced by the rolling circle replication of + strand DNA to prevent their reconversion to double strands [3-7]; needed for the accumulation of  exportable ssDNA; controls the"

Just after arriving at the camp site and setting everything up, the first official point of the program was already about to begin: bar tour, yeah! A long and noisy night followed ;) The next morning, the teams from literally all over Germany and extended Germany, also known as Denmark, assembled at the main event building and grabbed some awesome breakfast, including appropriate amounts of coffee, before being welcomed by our great hosts from iGEM Marburg . After introduction speeches by the sponsors of the event, the teams took the stage and presented their projects. As some time had passed since the Paris event, we got to see how the ideas had developed, and there were also some we had not seen before. Really awesome! After grabbing lunch, it was our turn to show what we had done and would still do in the lab.

The next morning came way too quickly, but luckily it was a beautiful sunny morning. We had the chance to hike to the castle and enjoy the amazing view from the top before it was again time to say Goodbye for a while and hit the road back to the lab.

This will hopefully help future teams from all around the globe to better understand them and apply them in the lab without being required to understand English perfectly. Especially other future Highschool teams should profit from this.
We are happy to be part such a great project and make iGEM even more international.

We were very lucky this year to have a diverse group of students with a diverse skill set. Some of our students are new to the iGEM team while others are joining us again in our research endeavors.
Alvin Lee
I am currently majoring in Biochemistry at the University of Lethbridge, and I will be entering my second year in the fall. This will be my first year contending in the iGEM competition. I joined the UofL iGEM team to exploit the many opportunities it has to offer. And so far, the program is very rewarding: it allows me to explore an alternative and fascinating field of biology, and provides me with the privilege of working alongside and learning from veteran iGEMers. But enough of the science-y stuff! When I’m not working in the Kothe RNA lab or the iGEM lab, you can find me on the battlegrounds defending the Sanctuary from the Prime Evils or living vicariously through the Game of Thrones series. But aside from the medieval fantasy, I also enjoy hiking, and playing badminton.
Anthony Vuong
Anthony Vuong, that is my full name. I am brother to the one with the same surname (Ben). Majoring in Biology; the University of Lethbridge I am attending. This will be my last year—oh my, so near the ending. Also, this is my third year iGEMing. A single beer is all it takes for a crimson glow to grace my face. A common problem, they do say, for the people of my race. For me, it is a bother, though not one for my younger brother. Is it ironic that “Red” is my favourite colour? Some may say I have a unique sense of fashion. Though shy I once was, not one for social interaction. But now, others shout “Eccentric” whilst smirking at my actions. A lion’s head, I may embellish in a dance of which I do so relish—a musical exhibition originating from the Chinese tradition (Chinese Lion Dance).

Safety
Safety is, of course, one of the foremost concerns when designing a synthetic biology system. Addressed here is a wide range of points on the safety of the Michigan Synthetic Biology Team's project in the laboratory and beyond.
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of public saftey or environmental safety?
Our project is designed to function entirely on a piece of paper; no organism (besides the user) is required to make it work. Our cell-free design is made up mostly of DNA and other components necessary for protein synthesis. Some form of these components exists in every cell of every species, from E. coli to elephants. The in vitro nature of our final product would remove several potential hazards associated with a device utilizing live cells. There is no chassis organism in the final product which can escape into the environment.
The DNA used in our design is unlikely to be taken up and expressed by a naturally occurring microorganism because all DNA segments are linear and the T7 promoter driving expression is not transcribed by healthy bacteria. This greatly reduces the risks of using our recombinant DNA outside the lab. Even if the recombinant DNA used in our project were taken up by a natural microorganism, it codes for two fragments of beta galactosidase, an enzyme which is classified as a non-hazardous substance by GHS and HCS (4). The antibiotic resistance plasmids that are used for cloning should never leave a laboratory setting and would not be a part of the final product. Although these precautions alleviate some common concerns regarding the use of recombinant DNA outside the lab, it is important to remember that the project does still utilize recombinant DNA and therefore requires diligent consideration of possible unforeseen environmental effects.
The primary safety considerations of the project relate to its use as a diagnostic device. When developing such a device, false negatives and false positives are a major source of concern, and the potential damage of misdiagnosis must be carefully weighed against the benefits of diagnosing the disease correctly and quickly. Although accuracy and reliability have a large effect on a device’s safety, it is difficult to predict these parameters at such an early stage of development. Another potential danger would be the requirement of working with a small quantity of bodily fluid to operate  the"

Fudan-CHINA,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". Yin also introduced the history, composition and approval process of the Chinese Hospital Ethics Committee to us. When we talk about the current ethical situation in China, we find that the lack of cross-disciplinary talents is one of the major reasons that leads to issues in medical ethics. Humanists show their ignorance of medical knowledge, while physicians lack ethical literacy and critical thinking. While law is the lowest bottom line for developing technology, ethics makes the ever-changing technology responsible for the world. We take this opportunity to review the purpose, design and execution of our project through an ethical perspective. The STEP system is designed to treat tumor, which is the second leading cause of death in the world; we hope that our system can be good for the world. In the experiments, we think that cell and molecular cloning experiments are not mature enough to reach phase where use of mice is possible as we don't want to hurt innocent mice just to produce good-looking data. We hope that the input of scientific research resources can bring real results. Medical ethics have been neglected for too long in China. Under the guidance of Dr. Yin, we improved experimental design and execution and wrote a paper on the ethical issues of Chinese tumor immunotherapy, hoping to arouse more ethical awareness of scientific and clinical researchers to make our investigation more responsible for the world.
Jun Yao Associate Professor, Law school of Fudan University Expert in Health Regulations
Is there a lack of regulations concerned in China? Yao was graduated from Shanghai Medical College and later changed his major into law. He has years of experience in dealing with law problems with hospitals, patients and the health administrative department. He was just compiling the book Medical Law when we arrived at his office. After consulting literature, we found that there are still problems about the cellular immunotherapy in China, such as undefined supervisor, ineffective measures of standardization and so on. And that's why we are here to consult him. According to Yao, there is not a single organization that has gained permission for the clinical application of cellular immunotherapy, and all are still at the stage of clinical trial. Therefore, as far as medical organizations are concerned, they are obligated to report their cases to the health administrative department and obtain permission, inform patients of the potential risk and outcome of their experiment without charge. As for China Food and Drug Administration(CFDA)and National Health Commission，they should establish a sound legal system to supervise the whole process from research and development to industrial production and clinical application comprehensively. In addition, he also called for the emergence of cross-disciplinary talents in medicine and law. Yao made compliments on our attention we had paid to relevant laws"

Building a Team
iGEM is more than hard work, learning about synthetic biology and solving the problems of tomorrow. It is about being part of a community and this very unique community begins with each team.

""Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success.""
Henry Ford
Being part of an iGEM team is a lot of fun, because you get to be part of a worldwide community, and you get to spend your summer with a group of likeminded people all working towards the same goal. The DTU BioBuilders is a team gathered from different faculties across year groups and nationalities. So to get to know each other and promote the team spirit, we arranged a handful of different social activities outside the office and the lab.
Having Fun with the Group
The whole team gathered one afternoon for a game of the Danish version of softball called ""Rundbold.""
