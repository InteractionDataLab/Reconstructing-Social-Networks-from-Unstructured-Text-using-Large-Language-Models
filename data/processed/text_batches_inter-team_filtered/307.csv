TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Team#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"owing Plant Team which has set itself the goal to develop glowing transgenic A. thaliana plants using luciferase based on the work of iGEM Cambridge 2010 . They were quite interested in our idea using transgenic moss plants as light source and we agreed on a meeting on October 25th. Ahead of the European Jamboree (October 7 th they have also posted our project video on their blog in order to promote it. We would love to see glowing Physcomitrella plants in the future.
Glowingplant performed an extremely successful kickstarter campaign to raise money for their idea of plants which gather energy by photosynthesis and emit it again later by bioluminescence.
On the 25th of October we had the great chance to meet Antony Evans of the glowingplant team on his visit to Europe. After having talked about the current status of our projects we had a great knowledge exchange about legal regulations, the public opinion on transgenic plants in Europe and in the US as well as about the potential sizes of the market for transgenic plants for home use. We intend to intensify our collaboration in the fashion of testing their gen cassette used for the luciferase reaction in our moss. It would be interesting to check how the utilized promoters for A. thaliana work in our moss P. patens. However we plan to build a new gene construct using our tested Actin 5 promotor from Physcomitrella.
Maybe one day our moss will be usable to enlighten our living environment in aerated lava lamps like the one shown in figure 2. Having explored the scientific opportunities of our moss for this purpose glowingplant could become an extremely valuable partner on the way to a commercial product.

Wet Lab
In order to generate a Herpes Delta Virus thermozyme [1], we first constructed a library of variants to be utilized in systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). To generate our library we incorporated random nucleotides into the U1A-RBD stem loop with either N9, N10, N11 or N12 random nucleotides for a total of 1.7 X 108 potential combinations. All of these variants were then assembled into the HDVR through oligo assembly followed by overlap extension PCR. Upstream of the HDVR there is a MS2 binding domain and a T7 promoter with an XbaI cut site at the 3’ end and a SpeI cut site at the 5’ end. A second module was used in order to generate an MS2 variant that will no longer dimerize [2] and assembly into a viral capsid (BBa_K2109108). This was accomplished by using a characterized MS2 variant (V291-d1FG)2 with an N-terminal HIS tag, controlled through a T7 promoter and strong RBS followed by a double terminator (B0015). The MS2 will be overexpressed and used to saturate a Nickel Sepharose column so that the Thermozyme library can be applied to select for positive mutants. Two HDVR controls were generated (BBa_K2109109, BBa_K2109110) the first is a U1A mutant which was used as a negative control. The second HDVR mutant U1A-C75T is a negative control that can be induced to cleave in the presence of imidazole[1].

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#SiruiNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," we bring in a teacher to be interviewed as well?
Week of 7/25/2011
This was a crazy week!  We managed to recruit 8 Wellesley biochemistry and biology students for usability studies on Wednesday and Thursday.  The students came in pairs in the afternoon, and learned how to use the G-nome Surfer Pro software after a quick tutorial on designing primers and navigating the MS Surface.  Most of the students have moderate to strong genetics backgrounds, and seemed to really enjoy using the tool!
A few students suggested for us to interview Professor Suzuki in the biology department, a developmental biologist who would have great ideas for improving the system.  We will do that, after we test the software tool at BU on Monday.  We’re taking the surface to BU!
Week of 8/1/2011
One of many iterations of G-nome Surfer Pro.
Deployment of G-nome Surfer Pro at BU photonics center for the wet lab members.  The students worked in groups of threes, while Consuelo, Heidi, Taili and I observed their interactions.  There are still a lot of kinks to work out on this iteration; sometimes GenBank notes don’t work, and other times the PubMed are blank!  Also, the extended workspace is confusing some students these are all small things to focus on for future designs.
8/2: interview with Professor Suzuki it was incredibly useful and Professor Suzuki was a wealth of information!  Consuelo and I learned about model organisms in developmental biology, and how a professor doing research would want the software to be different for learning and personal research.  Definitely a highlight of my summer research experience- having a professor say our software was really cool and potentially useful!  Perhaps we can one day even design it for seminars and for research for student theses?
8/3-8/4: Worked on designing the front-end of PermuteTrumpet, while the rest of the lab put together the posters for summer research.  We have THREE posters this year- a GreenTouch one, one on iGEM, and one on Trumpet and the eLabNotebook and future plans.  Now we have to practice for the presentations on Thursday!
8/4: Presentations!  Also, the BU comp team came over and we did brainstorming on things to do between the end of summer and the beginning of the school year.  Each member was given tasks to do for the website.

Quantification of Indigo Degradation
In order to quantify indigo degradation, we then carried out two rounds of selection in order to find the highest indigo degrading strains as determined through optical density (OD) measurements. We started with all 16 strains isolated from denim, and after several days of incubation we were able to select 8 strains for the second round: F1, F2, F6, F7, S1, S3, S4 and P1.
In the second round of selection, the 8 strains chosen from the first round were grown in the same conditions, but in triplicate, measuring the OD each day. As the deep blue color of the indigo confounds spectrophotometric reading in the first couple of days of the experiment, we only analyzed time points beginning at day 3 of the experiment. As shown in figure 2B, indigo degradation was easy to visualize, as the media changes from dark blue to nearly transparent. OD measurements for the 8 strains at the final day 7 time point are shown in figure 3.
In the end, the three strains we identified from this experiment, Streptomyces fumigatiscleroticus, Streptomyces coelicolor, and Pantoea agglomerans, were coherent with the strains observed in the plate and culture tube experiments described above.
Figure 3: Indigo absorbance measurements. A : Indigo absorbance at last day of first round experiment. Measured for 16 strains and P. ostreatus . B: Indigo absorbance throughout the experiment The ten most interesting strains are shown. S1 and S4 were not used for further experiments and we finally kept 8 strains for the second round.
Microbe Wash Denim
Knowing that our three last strains degrade indigo in liquid and more or less on plates, and keeping our goal of denim fading in mind, we needed to asses degradation of indigo on fabric. In order to do so we used cotton: as denim is made of cotton but is a very thick fabric. Pieces of cotton were stained with indigo (see more on staining with indigo in the methods ). Then they were put in either solid media or liquid media: for plates M9 media was used, for liquid culture it was liquid M9 and LB. The three remaining strains, S3, S4 and P1,"

Crop Burning
Another method of pest control involves crop burning, which is the process of setting fire to crop residues after harvest seasons to clear large areas of land. Remaining pests on particular crops are killed in order to prepare the soil for the following season. Crop burning is considered a quick and easy method for clearing farmland, but it is usually only used by farmers when other methods for clearing pests is unsuccessful. A burning permit is required by farmers interested in crop burning, which may end up being expensive if used continuously [11]. Bigger risks that come with crop burning include air pollution, soil pollution, and an increase in soil erosion from wind and water. Crop burning also has a big impact in local ecosystems surrounding farm land [12].
Buffer Zones
Buffer Zones are placed between organic crop fields and fields containing genetically modified (GM) crops to protect the organic farms from any contact or contamination, keeping organic crops as close to organic as possible. Contamination of organic crops by GM crops can occur through many different methods such as: gene transfer through cross-pollination, seed translocation, and contact with inorganic pesticides [13]. Wheat pollen has been detected to travel up to 50 meters via pollen drift [13] therefore, buffer zones must be greater than 50 meters to have an impact. A 200 meter buffer zone is not enough to stop pollen-mediated genetic antibiotic and drug resistance [15]. When commercial scale equipment is used in harvest, an extra 50 metres is added on to the required distance between the wheat trials [14]. This extra distances helps to protect organic crops from any other form of contamination that could be transferred by the machines. In order to effectively protect organic crops from contamination the distance required for isolation should be further tested and increased.

Relocating the pathway into the peroxisome enables proximity of the enzymes and substrates. Furthermore the yeast cell is protected from the toxic substance hydrogen peroxide. Yeast peroxisomes have no problem with this as their main function is the beta-oxidation of fatty acids and the detoxification of the thereby produced H2O2 (Erdmann R. et al., 2007) . Because VioC and VioD are FAD-dependent, it is additionally an evidence for FAD availability inside of the peroxisome, if the synthesis of Violacein works. Otherwise the two enzymes would not be able to catalyze the reaction.
The genes for VioA, VioB and VioE were amplificated via PCR with Golden Gate compatible overhangs from the biobrick VioABCE (Part: BBa_K274004).
By Golden Gate cloning the peroxisomal targeting sequence (PTS1) was attached to the C-terminus of every pathway protein. Combined with the other necessary parts of the toolbox they represent the level 1 plasmids.
The PTS-tag marks the proteins for the import into peroxisomes. This should first of all point out the functionality of the yeast’s natural import mechanism and also be the basis for demonstrating our own modeled PTS*, proving our designed orthogonal import mechanism . Furthermore we also aim to optimize the working conditions for the enzymes inside of the reaction room - the peroxisomes. For example to vary the pH with new membrane proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin. To secure this change, we can also check the current conditions by our designed sensors .
There are several methods to verify the pathway’s enzymes. First of all, violacein and several intermediates (prodeoxyviolacein, deoxyviolacein, proviolacein) are colorful and the production in yeast can be visualized easily. Furthermore we added a His-/Flag-tag to the N-terminus of every protein (see geneious plasmid cards) to confirm their expression via SDS page and western blot. After verifying the presence of the enzymes the next step is to test their functionality. Before performing in vivo experiments in yeast an in vitro assay was implemented. For this the three"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Degradation_-_-_TEXT.html," Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of ammonia concentration to the user’s mobile phone during the detection process.
Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users"

Acid Resistance
The main goal of this part of our project is to enable our E. Coli we used to eradicate H. Pylori to become acid resistant in order to live in gastric juice's low pH (pH:2) microenvironment. Wild-type E. coli already have couple systems to show acid resistance up to a certain pH level (pH: 5). Among those systems, the most stable-working and efficient one is known as Glutamate Dependent Acid Resistance(GDAR) system. The most important protein of Gad system is GadE, which controls the synthesis of all other proteins. By overexpressing this protein, we aim to have our bacteria resistant enough to live in gastric juice for a while.
Background
Escherchia coli Natural Acid Resistance System
E. coli possesses four phenotypically distinct systems of acid resistance. These systems:
1. Glutamate dependent acid resistance system (GDAR)
2. Arginine dependent acid resistance system (ADAR)
3. Lysine dependent acid resistance system (LDAR)
4. Ornithine dependent acid resistance system (ODAR)
The most effective one of these systems is the glutamate dependent system so we decided to focus on glutamate dependent system (GDAR).
The GDAR system has in the acid resistance complex pathways. We decided to do the certain pathways that how to do acid resistance with our results of research.
EvgA is the most effective positive regulator of GDAR. (Efficiency: evgA>ydeO>gadE) But evgA takes part in countless number different genes regulation and cellular processes (2,6,7) and also most of this cellular processes are unclear. We cannot predict the results of the overexpression of evgA so we chose gadE and using by overexpression of gadE we can induce glutamate depended acid resistance system.
Briefly talk about the impact of the GadE on the mechanism.
The central activator is the LuxR-family member GadE (formerly known as YhiE). GadE"
Ionis_Paris,2016,Team:Ionis Paris#Biobrick Design_-_-_TEXT.html," depending on their binding strength:
Strong RBS:
The Elowitz RBS is the stronger RBS with an efficiency of 1.0. This RBS is a sequence of 12 bp and is available on the iGEM registry at this ID access: BBa_B0034.
An other strong RBS, based on Ron Weiss thesis, is available on the iGEM registry at this ID access: BBa_B0030. This RBS, a sequence of 15 bp, has an efficiency of 0.6.
This type of RBS allows a high translation rate that leads to a high protein production. However, a too high production can be harmful for the organism because a lot of proteins could be unfolded or misfolded.
Middle RBS:
An example of Middle RBS is available on the iGEM registry at this ID access: BBa_B0032. This RBS, a sequence of 13 bp derivative of BBa_B0030, has an efficiency of 0.3.
Weak RBS:
The weaker RBS is a sequence of 11 bp with an efficiency of 0.01, derivative of BBa_B0030. This RBS is available on the iGEM registry at this ID access: BBa_0033.
An other weak RBS is available on the iGEM registry at this ID access: BBa_B0031. This RBS, a sequence of 14 bp derivative of BBa_B0030, has an efficiency of 0.07.
In our project, we chose to use the stronger RBS, the Elowitz RBS (BBa_B0034), in order to have a maximal production rate. Indeed, as we already specified, the induced luminescence has to be proportional to the pollutant rate. Therefore, when pollutant molecules enter in the bacteria, the XylR protein has to be present in an enough amount and the Gaussia luciferase has to be produced rapidly in an amount that is proportional to the pollutant amount. This allows a luminescent response corresponding to the pollutant rate.
Double terminator
A terminator is a genetic part placed at the end of a gene, in order to end transcription thanks to a stop codon. Several types of terminators exists but the most used are forward terminators. In general, some RNA polymerases will continue the transcription after the terminator, thus the terminator efficiency is not 100% in the most cases.
In order to increase the terminator efficiency in our plasmid we chose to use a double terminator. We selected two different double"

Approach A: Chemotaxis based.
Scroll
Fast Biosensing
Introduction
Our approach to creating a fast biosensor is based on post-translational processes to circumvent slow acting mechanisms like gene expression currently employed in most cell-based biosensors. To this end, we exploit the naturally occurring and       highly adaptive Tar receptor that can be readily engineered to respond to new ligands. The use of phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions allows us to generate a readout in the time scale of seconds. In our project, we propose two       such approaches for a biosensor reacting to molecules of interest.
Approach A: Chemotaxis
Concept
This figure shows a cartoon representation of the chemotaxis pathway, which we utilize for our biosensor. The Tar receptor on the left, senses a specific molecule and induces a fast phosphorylation cascade. This results in a change in the rotational bias of the"

1. None of our ideas raised safety issues inside or outside the laboratory.
2. The Bench work was done inside the National Center for Biological Sciences(Bangalore) premises and strictly followed the safety protocols and guidelines set by the safety review board at NCBS.
3. The National Center for Biological Sciences, Bangalore has well equipped labs where  bio safety is properly taken care of. Current facilities at the labs full fill the requirements of bio safety level-1 as mentioned in Bio Safety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (4th edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health, U.S. Government Printing Office Washington: 1999).
There is an Institute level committee, which looks into the issues related to Bio Safety. Our part BBa_K221000 produces a harmless and eco-friendly organic compound “Geosmin”.Since it is ensured that we  follow all standard lab practices, the bio safety committee does not have any issue with our experiments.
4. None of the BioBrick parts raise any safety issues.

Tom's split primers for the lux vector (pSB1C3 backbone) has arrived, so he retried the colony PCR. Unfortunately still nothing has came out. We will do another run tomorrow.
We've run out of competent e.coli cells, and we need some more. Unfortunately, the TOP10 cells that were grown up over the weekend were too old to use, so Paul is using our final vial of TOP10 to make some more that should be in the log phase by tomorrow morning. Then we can get on with the protocol to make them competent.
Tuesday
A very practical day today, as various people (Paul and Andreas in particular) undertook to perform the rather long electro-competent cell production protocol . We also recieved our delivery of reagents we ordered yesterday. Using some quite stinky NAD+, the isothermal reaction buffer for the Gibson assembly reaction was finished off and lots of aliquots of Gibson master mix stored.
Having made all this, we did some Gibson for the riboswitch and fluorescent constructs, which *should* work this time. Certainly, we're pretty confident we have all the ingredients in the mix this time. We'll transform some cells with the resultant DNA cocktail as soon as we have some competent cells. Hopefully tomorrow then, though such efficient hopes have had a way of failing in the last couple of weeks.
Tom struggled through his PCR again, retrying the split luciferase primers. No successes, alas...
Wednesday
We are all at that stage where our various pieces of DNA need putting into cells. To that end, we began transformations, and lots of them. We started using the electroporation device for the first time today, possibly making lots of cells with plasmids shoved through their walls. Or else we've just made a load of dead bacteria. Only a night in the incubator will tell.
Desperate to find out the reasons behind the failure to Gibson our fluorescent contruct, Emmy did a restriction digest on the Gibson product of the fluorescent components- and there were no bands. She suspects that there wasn't enough DNA in the sample to be shown in the gel. Looks like this diagnostic test can only be performed after we successfully transform E.coli with the construct, grow them up and miniprep the plasmid. With our lack of functioning competent cells looks like it's not going to happen until earliest next week.
We also began thinking about what we're going"

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#prueba_-_-_TEXT.html,", as beekeepers visit their bees every 8 or 15 days, they are the target for many people that take advantage of this situation. Engineer Bianchi assists to the Beekeeper's society meetings, and he sees there are not young beekeepers to take the hard work of beekeeping, he sees that as another issue.
Finally, after approximately an hour of conversating, he shared us his book of memories from the 25th International Apicultural Update Congress which was held in Queretaro last year and invited us to visit his beehives as well as the facilities of his company.
July 16th
Valencian beekeeper interview
Thanks to our colleagues from Valencia_UPV, we received written feedback from a Valencian beekeeper and information about the current status of foulbrood in his province. Our Valencian colleagues interviewed the beekeeper for us, thank you Valencia_UPV team! (LINK collaborations) Given that our interest diseases have a global presence, it is essential for us to make contact with beekeepers from all around the world; knowing how they face illnesses, the used treatment methods, their effectiveness and consequences, and the beekeeper's concerns and opinions about our solution proposal in
order to also integrate them into the development of our project.
The interviewed beekeeper has spent approximately 70 years dedicating himself to the invaluable work of beekeeping and he shared with us some already experienced foulbrood implications that are lived in his province. In Valencia the treatment against foulbrood consist in the following:
First, the combs with the infected brood are replaced by healthy brood and then antibiotic with powdered sugar, is applied. The adult bees, when they realize the larvae are dead, clean the cell. The beekeeper ensures that with this treatment he has managed to heal all his hives, and has not suffered any loss from the disease, the drawback for this method is that it contaminates pollen, so it would no longer be suitable for human consumption, and when this treatment is not applied on time, beekeepers get to have very large losses of money and even the total loss of their hives (between 20 to 100 hives per beekeeper). Regarding this information, we could realize that antibiotics indeed are currently used and although they are effective in treating the disease, the innocuity of the honey is always altered resulting in market issues.
Once the beekeeper heard about our project and learned about biotechnological alternatives that seek to solve beekeeping problems, he considered it an adequate proposal which does not contaminate the bee products and he was expectant before the results of"

German Meetup
After a long period of researching, we finally met most of the German iGEM-teams in June at Marburg.              We not only got to know many inspiring people, but also had the opportunity to discuss our projects with them.              Especially, the sharing of experiences and failures would help us later on in our journey.
Furthermore, various scientists and organizations joined the meetup and presented to us their experiences and advice.              We learned how to handle steps backwards and how they can improve a scientist's work.
A big thanks to the iGEM team Marburg for organizing and hosting this great event!

European Meetup
Only one month after the meetup in Marburg we went to the European meetup              in Munich where we had a great time. We had the chance to meet the German teams again as well as meeting even              more awesome young researchers, in particularly, the iGEM team of Utrecht with whom we started a collaboration afterwards.
In addition, we met a bunch of scientists and entrepreneurs who shared their wisdom with us.              We listened to talks about current topics in the field of synthetic biology and learned new skills at workshops.
We thank iGEM LMU and TU Munich for the organization of this thrilling weekend!

FAFU-CHINA,2016,Team:FAFU-CHINA#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," proteins are activated by being cleaved again by intestinal protease. When toxins reach to the brush border membrane microvilli, they bind to the proteins, or known as receptors on the membrane. The binding process takes two step. Firstly, the monomeric Cry toxin binds to cadherin, resulting in the formation of pre-pore oligomer as Figure5. 
 
 
Then the oligomer binds to a GPI-anchored APN or ALP. Secondly, the previous binding induces the oligomer insertion into the lipid rafts membrane. A formation of ion permeable pore is followed by the insertion which allows small molecules to pass through the membrane. The membrane potential inevitably changes greatly, causing the swelling of cell and finally breaking down. When the cell lysis reaches to a certain degree, the midgut necrosis and epithelial denaturation follow. Then, the alkaline hypertonic inclusions in midgut enters into hemocoel and the pH of haemolymph rises causing paralysis of larvae and finally death.
However, there are evidences shown that there is another model of pore formation caused by Cry toxin action in Lepidoptera. The interaction between Cry toxin and cadherin can trigger the programed death of by lysis.
5.The shortcomings of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt.)
There is no doubt that Bt. stains own many advantages as biological pesticide, such as, efficiency and highly species-specific toxicity. Howerver, B. thuringiensis also does have disadvantages. Many strains are sensitive to the sunlight and their toxic proteins will degrade within a week.  To test the resistance of LLL29 to the sunshine, especially about UV, we measure the curve of survival as Figure6 under the different time length under different illumination time by using UV as Figure6
 
6.2A-Expression system
The interaction between Cry and Cyt toxins can enhance the toxicity to mosquitoes. Therefore, it is essential for us to develop a system which co-expressed Cry and Cyt genes together to kill the larvae of mosquitoes. For this system, the expression of multiple proteins is the most critical stage in synthesis biology. From previous studies, we found that an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) has been widely used to construct bicistronic or multicistronic vectors. But, due to the unbalanced expression of upstream and downstream proteins and the limit of their sequence lengths, we proposed"

Human Practice Overview
Thinking beyond laboratory is one of the key factors that would affect the yield of scientific researches into real social interests. Thankfully, this idea has been recognized by the iGEM community for a very long time. Not only should every team participate in various social activities, but also we need to keep a real time interaction with the society, the place that we ultimately hope to create significance.
This year, our team applied the knowledge of synthetic biology to seek feasible solutions to the energy issue. Urgent as it is, the energy issue is more than a regional problem, but has raised global concerns.  In this social context, converting solar energy into chemical energy is undoubtedly of fundamental and industrial importance. Our original interest on this topic was initially sparked by recent cutting-edge research in artificial photosynthesis. To enhance our understandings about energy issues, and meanwhile, arouse public awareness of synthetic biology, we raised multiple public questionnaires and dialogues within academe and industry. In communications with industrial community, field experts as well as administrative authority afterwards, we realized that development of a robust, sustainable and scalable approach for hydrogen production would be socially relevant, industrially important, but technically challenging. This has led us to set our ultimate goals to solve such challenge by leveraging the power of synthetic biology. We eventually proposed and demonstrated a sun-powered biofilm-interfaced artificial hydrogen-producing system, Solar Hunter. Benefiting from the real time social interactions, we kept modifying the system to be more and more adaptable to the scalable industrial application. This new system will in return, introduce a synthetic biology-based approach towards energy applications in industrial context.
Additionally, while conducting the research, our team not only kept real-time interactions with the society regarding to the project itself, but also we actively participated in a variety of educational propagation and public engagements. As the first-ever iGEM team at ShanghaiTech, this year we established the iGEM Day for Public Interests (iDPI), a special social activity for every iGEMers at ShanghaiTech. For this"

These two models for lighting conditions were then incorporated into the in-house software to control the Multi-Cultivators with which we used to characterize our strains. Furthermore, these two models can be used in conjunction to generate realistic industrial light conditions, exhibiting both oscillatory and fluctuating behavior. With these new tools, we are now able to characterize our strains in an industrial setting from the comfort of our own lab!
Methods
FBA was performed using the CBMPy ( http://cbmpy.sourceforge. net/ ) package and IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimizer by IBM. To simulate the different trophic modes of Synechocystis between day and night lighting regimes, we changed the objective function of our model to either maximize the reaction R_BiomassAuto in the day, or R_BiomassHetero in the dark. The day regime is defined as setting the lower bound of light exchange reaction, R_EX_photon_LPAREN_e_RPAREN , to a value of -30 and the lower bound of the glycogen sink reaction, R_Sink_glycogen, set to 0. The night regime has the lower bound of the light reaction set to 0 and lower bound of the glycogen reaction set to -0.6816. This value for the glycogen reaction was chosen so as to have the same growth rate under both lighting regimes when no other reactions are perturbed to allow for ease of comparison. Note that negative values imply consumption, whereas positive is production. These definitions for the light and dark regimes hold true for all simulations, unless stated otherwise. All reactions mentioned here were already present in the original iJN678.
Dynamic FBA (dFBA) simulations were performed using an in-house script which tracks the biomass and relevant chemical concentrations via integration between FBA calls. The two integrals [17] used were:
\[   X =   X_{0} e^{\mu \cdot \Delta t}   \]   \[   C_i =  C_{i0} + \frac{q_{ci}}{\mu} X_0 (1 - e^{\mu \cdot \Delta t})   \]
where X is the current biomass concentration (gDW L -1 ), X0 is the biomass concentration of the previous step, μ is the current growth rate (hr -1 ), Δ t is the time between FBA calls (hr -1 ), Ci is the current concentration of chemical i (mmoli L -1 ), Ci0 is the"

Will is a rising junior studying biomedical engineering. He participated in iGEM in order to learn how research is conducted and gain the ability to perform useful lab techniques. Will hopes to continue on to grad school, pursue a PhD, and someday work in the field of DNA technology. He is highly interested in the field of synthetic biology both for its potential to solve real world problems and for its ""design and build"" nature. Outside of the lab, Will also has a strong interest creative writing, and he enjoys writing stories as a hobby. Fun fact: Will plays the electric violin.
Marisa Mendes is a junior studying biomedical engineering. She joined iGEM because she wanted to gain experience working in a lab to help her decide if she wants to pursue a research-oriented career path. As a child, she remembers looking at her hands and wondering what hands were made of and what allowed them to perform simple day-to-day tasks. She knew biomedical engineering was a subject she needed to pursue when she saw a brief news report that cardiac tissue had been synthesized in a lab and was able to pulse like a human heart. Now, she wants to mass-produce synthetic tissues to replace malfunctioning ones. When she is not playing the role of a student researcher, you can find Marisa in a theatre designing lights for her next theatre production. Fun fact: The first time Marisa traveled away from her home in Southern California was for her freshman orientation at BU.

The best way ever to preserve lithic relics
an innovative biochemical method to resolve erosion.
View Our Works
The inscriptions on Precipice are one of the most common and fundamental forms of traditional Chinese relics. Due to having been carved in open areas plus the exposure to sunshine and raindrops, which is often the case for most of them,the Inscriptions are weathered readily. Currently, there are quite a few methods to resolve this phenomenon but some of them are not used properly which occasionally cause the damage for the Inscriptions. Our research project aims at using microorganism method, which is to put a plasmid with the ability to convert bio-oriented oxaloacetic acid to oxalate acid into the cell of E.coil, inducing the cell and the product will react with one component of the Inscriptions-- calcium carbonate-- to generate nearly insoluble calcium oxalate monohydrate to adhere to the Inscriptions for protection. Another E.coil with the ablility to secrete lipase has also been constructed; we aim to add this cell when we are cleansing the Inscriptions to resolve the oil substances on the surface of them. By constructing these products, we are able to protect the relics either from human errors as cleaning and protecting or from natural damnification.

From literatures and information gathered from doctors and professors in medicine and food fields, we know that D-psicose can be used for a potential drug for the treatment of obesity and diabetes.  A series of clinical trials is further needed for safety issues. In addition, the market, price, and the current production situation of D-psicose are still needed to be addressed.

Prof Sun worked in Japan Sugar Research Center which is the pioneer in this field, and she has devoted herself into rare sugar research since then, owning a lot of patents for rare sugars. We conducted an interview with her on the application, market share and production of D-psicose.
Keypoints
D-psicose is by far a perfect substitute for sucrose, not only in taste, sweetness, calorie, but also in food processing. The most similar sugar to D-psicose is tagatose, but it is more expensive, and its comprehensive characteristics are not as good as D-psicose.
Japan is a pioneer for study of D-psicose, and the three companies to commercialize D-psicose worldwide are Matsutani Chemical Industry Co.,Ltd.(JP)，CJ Cheiljedang Crop.(KR) and Tate & Lyle P.L.C (UK)
All three commercialized companies for D-psicose use enzymatic production instead of chemical synthesis, which means high activity of key enzyme in D-psicose biosynthesis is essential.
D-psicose has been approved by FDA in 2011. FDA-related information shows that D-psicose is sufficiently safe to be used in food. In China it is"

The result of question 7
A fictional situation is established in question 7, aiming to test people’s reacts and comments on synthetic biology products. The choices are designed to test the attraction, value, safety issues of the imagined product, as well as to test people’s attitudes towards the product. From the results we see that most people hold positive attitudes towards synthetic biology products. Some attendants have concerns about such a product. Others thought that the safety of the products need to be proved.
The result of question 8
The last question is a general question, so as to show the attendant’s overall points of views on synthetic biology. The results, however, is the most “unbalanced”. Most respondents held positive views on synthetic biology, and only a few think it indefinite about the future of synthetic biology. In all, the public are more likely to approve the future of synthetic biology, despite the fact that they know little about it.

Now, J23101 has been previously characterized  by Kelly et al. 2009, who found that it has a value of 0.03PoPS (polymerases per second).  Multiplying 0.03 by the ratio of the J23101/J23100 promoter strengths gives us a value of 0.021905PoPS for J23100. Thus, we can conclude that EtnR1 (under the control J23100), has a constitutive transcription rate of 0.021905PoPS, per molecule of DNA construct. This translates to 4.381 molecules/sec for our plasmid (mean copy number of 200)
However, this is by no means a conclusive value. A study by Yale iGEM2015 revealed that the relative expression rate of J23100 may vary depending on the reporter gene fused to the promoter as well as the particular strain of E. Coli used. In this model, J23100 is fused to EtnR1.
Finding parameters for EtnR2 (Constitutive Transcription)
In the final construct, EtnR2 has been placed under the control of the T7 Promoter. The Imperial College London iGEM2007 team characterized this promoter, giving a value of 8.88*10^13 molecules in 240 minutes, for 4 ug of DNA. This translates to 1 molecule every 905.7 seconds, per molecule of DNA construct. This rate is multiplied by 200, which is the mean copy number of the plasmid in use - yielding 0.22 mRNA molecules/sec.
Finding parameters for the AmilCP reporter protein (Induced Transcription)
For our reporter genes, the model for expression is complicated by the binding of signalling molecules. In contrast to the constitutively expressed genes, we must assume that the transcription rate is a function of the amount of signalling molecules that are bound.
This rate can be modelled by the Hill equation
Where Vm is the maximal transcription rate, [S] is substrate concentration, and K_d is the dissociation constant. In our model, [S] is Etr1. Using promoter strength as the maximum transcription rate would be preferred, however finding literature values for the uncharacterized Etn promoter was extremely difficult. In the absence of existing research on the Etn promoter, an alternative, but more intuitive method for transcription rate determination must be used"

The two cleavage sites should not be too close to each other for that it may be too crowded for two kinds of enzymes to bind onto the DNA together. We faced this problem in our experiments. The fact is, though the two cleavage sites are linked, double digestion is still the most efficient way. So use double digestion as possible. 3. If denaturation is needed, choose two kinds of enzyme that have the same denaturation protocol as possible. 4. Do not use isocaudarner to digest plasmid. Instead, it’s convenient to link fragments together in this way.

SCUT,2015,Team:SCUT-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,"eme(300-700 times). Recent research shows the combining mechanism is involved with two steps: During the first step, NO combines substrate sGC to generate the ferrous nitrosyl heme complexes D3 which then decays to a fully activated state mixture D2.
The first step of NO combined with sGC can be expressed as a reversible biochemical reaction process:
D1 and D3 represent the initial and intermediate states of sGC. Accordingly, k and k-1 are rate constants. The second step has two parallel paths which are depend or independ on NO. The two are all involved in the transition from D3 to D2. The process of independent NO was considered to be a natural decay from the state D3 to D2, with the His105 residue separated from the heme. The process can be expressed as a first order and irreversible kinetic equation(rate constant is k2):
The path which depends on NO can be described as enzymatic action based on the traditional Michaelis Menten kinetics. Since the reversible and dissociation reactions of NO and sGC heme were rapid (association rate constant is 7.1±2*108 M-1s-1 in 4℃), the damage of His105 residue becomes the rate limiting step in the process (the observed value of rate constant of the process which depends on NO in reference documentation is 2.4*105M-1s-1 in 4℃). Therefore, we assume that the NO dependent pathway can be equivalent to a single step irreversible process with a rate constant k3:
Another side of NO-sGC reaction’s is NO disaggregates from sGC, which means D2 is inactivated、sGC return to the initial state. We can express the process as a first order and irreversible kinetic equation:
Rate constant k4 can be regulated by multiple factors, including NO scavenger, substrate concentration and so on. Under the stimulation of cGMP, the yield of NO presents biphase. Along with the initial rapid growth to the peak，following is a recovery to a lower level, with the increase in degradation rate makes the concentration of cGMP reaches to a steady state. Bellamy suggested that the unknown sGC regulatory factors may exist and that the sensitivity of sGC to NO in the late state of cGMP reaction is decreased, and these regulatory factors are active in response to NO's exogenous and endogenous. Now, we assume that the local feedback loop of the final product's cGMP level is a regulator of sGC desensitization. In the hypothesis that cGMP"

Abstract
When information flows through gene-regulatory networks, noise is introduced, and fidelity suffers. A cell unable to correctly infer the environment signals from the noisy inputs may be hard to make right responses. But there are so many “parallel circuit” in gene-regulatory networks where independently transcribed monomers assemble into functional complexes for downstream regulation. As we know, when we talking with two person at the same time, we could not fully understand them. But if things they talked about were more similar, we could understand their words much better. So that would tighter connection of monomers benefit the quality of gene-regulatory networks?
Inspired by these thoughts, we construct synthetic biology circuit by using split florescent proteins. And we add inteins to split florescent proteins to the make the connection tighter. Then, we quantitatively measure the capacity of these information channels. Computation and wet lab work are combined to optimize our understanding of such systems, and to interpret potential biological significance of reoccurring parallel designs in nature.
Description
From information theory to our project
As we can learn from Wikipedia[1], information theory studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information which was originally proposed by Claude E. Shannon in 1948. The theory has developed amazingly and has found applications in many areas. It’s not exaggerated to say that we can see the power of information theory all the time.
Based on this, we would like to explore something originally in biological pathway using information theory.
Our project has a close connection with two terms in information theory, mutual Information and channel capacity. And what are them?
In probability theory and information theory, the mutual information (MI) of two random variables is a measure of the mutual dependence between the two variables. More specifically, it quantifies the ""amount of information"" (in units such as bits) obtained about one random variable, through the other random variable. The concept of mutual information is intricately linked to that of entropy of a random variable, a fundamental notion in information theory, that defines the ""amount of information"" held in a random variable. You can understand it trough from the figure below.
Formally, the mutual information of two discrete random variables X and Y can be defined as:\[I\left( {"
Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Outreach#TEDxCalgary_-_-_TEXT.html," Worth Spreading""
In accordance with TED’s mandate, we needed an idea worth spreading.  We had a lot of ideas about our project, the iGEM competition and synthetic biology in general.  The hard part was coming up with the right theme for our presentation; one that would resonate with the general public both within and outside Alberta.   One of the reasons we chose the project that we did is that it is something important to Alberta but that can also have implications around the globe – environment and energy.  There are obvious implications of our project for the oil sands in Alberta, but also to a broader audience in terms of environmental remediation.  This was clearly an important theme to us.  We felt that the fact that the bacteria we are designing can not only remediate wastes, but can convert them into reusable fuels was particularly important. Every day, the landfills around the world have been growing incessantly. Communicating the potential for applying synthetic biology to clean or recycle the wastes and reclaim these lands would be an interesting focus.  What is more exciting is the potential that synthetic biology gives to maintain a self-sustainable environment. Instead of relying on the city for energy and waste processing, we could use synthetic biology to clean our cities and generate energy from waste products for our cities.
Outside of the environmental implications of our project, open source was also an interesting theme as it is a major underlying premise of both synthetic biology and iGEM in general.  The open access nature coupled with the drive for abstraction in synthetic biology make it something with huge potential for participation, something missing from other scientific fields.  The amount of knowledge required to master biology is immense, but building systems with standard parts is not so hard.  Just take a look at the things coming out of iGEM each year and you’ll understand.  Undergraduates on small budgets can accomplish quite a lot in a summer!  This idea of democratizing science was thus another angle worth exploring.
The theme we chose to go with was merging these two.  We wanted to emphasize the potential synthetic biology could have in remediation, while showing that this technology can be used by many, allowing people to actively participate in science and synthetic biology, and in turn help improve the environment. Through our TED talk, we want to emphasize the democratization of science and generate new discussions and ideas for improving our health and our cities’ health through better environment, raising more questions on how to build a self-sustainable city!

UCLA,2014,Team:UCLA#Project#Spinning Silk_-_-_TEXT.html," spider's glands are forced through small-diameter spinnerets, and expelled as solid threads.
A simple syringe extruder setup. It consists of a gas chromatography syringe (Hamilton Co.) in a syringe pump (Pump Systems, Inc.)
Centrifuge Extrusion
Another method that we are investigating is centrifuge extrusion, in which a column with a small-diameter channel is loaded with silk dope, and placed into a centrifuge tube containing the coagulation solution. The loaded column and tube are then centrifuged at high speeds, and the resulting centrifugal force extrudes the dope through the channel into the coagulation bath, causing a fiber to form. The extrusion column was designed this past summer by the UCLA iGEM team for rapid, small scale production of experimental fibers.
An ""extrusion column."" 3D printed with a Stratasys PolyJet printer.
Our extrusion column fits into a 15 mL centrifuge tube, which can be kept empty or hold a coagulation bath.
Rotary Jet Spinning
The rotary jet spinner, designed and diagrammed by the Parker lab at MIT [4] .
A final method for fiber production that we worked with is rotary jet spinning. Rotary jet spinning is very similar to centrifuge extrusion, in that the dope is spun at very high speeds and centrifugal force pushes the dope out of the channel. However, in rotary jet spinning, the dope is loaded into a reservoir that is mounted vertically onto a motor shaft. This method does not allow for the usage of a coagulation bath, as the reservoir holding the dope must be spun in air [4] . If the reservoir were to be spun in a liquid bath, the resultant turbulence in the bath would cause structural instability and destroy the apparatus.
Post-Spin Stretch
A very important part of creating fibers from expressed recombinant silk is the stretching of the fiber after it has been extruded. This can be observed in actual spiders, who tug on the silk threads they produce in order to stretch them. This stretching not only results in longer lengths of threads to work with, it confers extra strength and elasticity to the fibers [5] .
What We've Done
Over the summer, we carried out steps 1 through 4 of the silk processing procedure according to published protocols (see above).  Additionally we made silk pH gels by treating the dialyzed silk with acid. Overnight incubation caused this mixture to solidify into a gel.   We have put together our syringe pump extrusion setup based on published protocols.  As an alternative,"

If we were to measure estrogen concentration from the river compared to 20 minutes from its collection, then there would be a significant decrease due to the absorption into the container. There is ongoing research still happening on finding a container in which micropollutants do not stick to instead of going through a lengthy chemical process to ensure decontamination (future iGEM project?) This posed a lot of questions of how/where we were going to collect water samples.
Richard Pell, Director of the Center of PostNatural History
The Center of PostNatural History, with the slogan “That was Then. This is Now.” is dedicated to advancing knowledge related to the “complex interplay between culture, nature, and biotechnology.” The subjects and exhibits of this museum are all based on genetically altered living organisms! When talking to Richard Pell, he told us that his interest began ten years ago when he started flipping through books on synthetic biology and genetic engineering. An engineer and artist, he found it fascinating when scientists were able to almost-robotically manipulate bacterium to do what they wanted. “These weren’t scientists. These were engineers and the applications of this was mind-blowing.” Reading up some more, Pell could not find a central location where all of this information was available for him to peruse. He decided to “create a place where people can go in and expand their knowledge, without the politics.” He also wanted to reduce the political controversy surrounding synthetic biology and have his visitors come up with their own conclusions about the unnatural nature behind synthetic biology. Pell was also one of the co-founders with iGEM back when it started in 2004 and has enthusiastically brought his art expertise and passion for synthetic biology to the table. This year he was enlisted to help judge the art and design projects, but will be unable to so that he can support his wife and upcoming baby. We wish him the best of luck!

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Plant_-_-_TEXT.html," principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.
Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Postcards
iGEM Duesseldorf, Heinrich-Heine University, Germany
We designed a postcard containing something characteristic about the project and a small description. The scope of this collaboration was to exchange postcards with teams from all over the world discovering easily about projects we didn’t know about and using those postcards to spread information about synthetic biology and iGEM.
DH5 alpha cells
iGEM Lund, Lund University, Sweden
We gave to iGEM Lund the DH5-Alpha Cells, E. coli cells that are used for maximizing the transformation efficiency. We plated them in LB and deliver them to their University. We believe that this kind of collaborations, in which teams exchange materials, are very useful because we save a lot of money and time and we understand the value of sharing and cooperating with other researchers.
Engineered Probiotics Around the World
Unesp Brazil, School of Pharmaceutical Science, Unesp, Brazil
The purpose of this collaboration was to exchange opinions about how engineered probiotics are regulated all around the world. By regulation we mean laws, trials, startups etc. After having thoroughly searched these information for the swedish and european countries, we wrote a document containing a summary and we sent it to Unesp Brazil Team. They will share with us what they learnt at the end of the iGEM period.

TecMonterrey_GDA,2017,Team:TecMonterrey GDA#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," main things caused by the huge amount of bagasse produced by this industry. The environment is not the only one affected by the obtention of this waste during the production of tequila, but also the same tequila producers because it is extremely hard for them to get rid of it, and sometimes they even have to waste time and money in order to do so.
To corroborate this information, we visited several tequila factories, where we concluded that indeed bagasse management is a huge problem that is affecting our home state in a environmental and economical way. To eradicate this issue, we searched the components of bagasse, noticing that it is composed mostly of sugars, having a great potential as carbon source for bacteria. This means that bagasse can be effectively converted to glucose, and this sugar can be used to feed our recombinant bacteria, which has the ability of convert glucose into PHA bioplastic.
PHA production
This is how iGEM Tec GDA, created PHAgave, a project that consists of using bagasse to create a bioplastic.
The team proposed different ways of production that allow us to obtain the PHA from the Agave Tequilana bagasse. The production of this compound has been detailed in two subprocesses, and agrees with the recommendations proposed by Gonzalez, Gonzalez and Nungaray in 2005.
The following diagram shows the proposal realized by our team to obtain PHA from bagasse:
The first system is aimed for pretreating the bagasse so that it can be processed by our bacteria. This process is characterized by physical, chemical and biological methods that will allow us to obtain a processable bagasse.
As mentioned before, the bagasse is characterized by containing high quantities of complex sugars, some of them are in form of lignin and cellulose which are rarely exploited  (Iñiguez, Acosta, Martínez, Parra, González , 2004).
In order to be able to process those components it is important to dry in the sun until values of 2-5% of humidity are obtained, which will allow us to control competitive bacterial growth and will help us to triturate them. This process must be done, so that the particles are smaller and the microorganisms can have more access to the sugars in order to process them.
After the trituration process, the bagasse enters to an enzymatic treatment inside a bioreactor where Aspergillus niger will realize the first step by removing lignocellulose from the bagasse (Trejo, Oriol, López, Reoussos, Vinie"

Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#Notebook#Summary_-_-_TEXT.html,", we identify variants of chemoreceptors with new binding specificities in the mutant library. By these means, we aim to train the bacterium to detect new molecules such as tumor cell markers. Once having established E. coli as our ""tracking dog"", the possible applications in medicine but also to environmental issues are virtually countless.
#1 - Selection / Swimming
Fine tuning of the experimental setup
During the course of the experimental work it has been the task of group one to design and test the parameters for the optimal swimming and chemotaxis assays. Eventually, it was the goal to be able to select for fast E.coli cells that show a chemotactic behavior. Firstly, swimming is only possible in media with a low concentration of agar. After testing agar concentrations in a range between 0.2% - 1%, it turned out that 0.3% is the best concentration for fast E. coli cells. Lower concentrations were not appropriate due to a lack of solidity of the swimming-agar. Secondly, different nutrient compositions were tested. On the one hand, it was necessary to identify a convenient nutrient composition to trigger bacterial swimming. On the other hand, the nutrients in the media should enable E. coli cells to follow a chemoattractant.
Fig. 1:Chemotaxis and swimming of different E. coli-strains on tryptone- and M9 agar. Chemotaxis strain MG1655 (left), laboratory strain BL21 (top), laboratory strain DH10B (right) and laboratory strain XL1 blue (bottom) were tested for swimming and chemotaxis properties on two different media. (A) MG1655 and BL21 both showed extensive swimming on 0.3% tryptone swimming agar after incubation at 33°C for one day. In contrast, the laboratory strains DH10B and XL1 blue did not swim at all.  Swimming towards the attractant L-aspartate in the central Whatman paper was not observed. (B) On 0.3% M9 minimal agar the E. coli strains MG1655 and BL21 displayed swimming, but had to be incubated at 33°C for 2 days. Strikingly, chemotaxis was clearly observed for both strains, MG1655 and BL21, towards the attractant L-aspartate.
Here, we focused on two different media: Tryptone-swimming agar for the induction of E. coli swimming after one day of incubation and M9-minimal agar for the observation of chemotaxis (Burkart et al. 1998; Far"
Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Market#_-_-_TEXT.html," month. Other sampling locations such as acid-sensitive lakes, may only be monitored a few times per year.
Competitors
Currently, monitoring in the oil and gas industry is performed through both short- and long-term collection methods with samples then being shipped to an external lab for testing. This process requires transportation costs, sample processing, and wait times in which the composition of a sample can change dramatically. In addition, trained technicians are required who can operate expensive analytical lab equipment. Traditional Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) can cost upwards of $500 a sample to prepare and run on the equipment. Intensive sample preparation is also required, increasing both cost and testing time. Current testing regimes require multiple sample collections and tests per site to allow for proper analysis. Though these analytical technologies are highly rigorous, their cost, need for highly trained personnel, as well as sample transport make it unrealistic to meet the changing regulatory market for increased spot-test monitoring sites planned by recent legislation. We do not wish to, nor can we compete directly with this highly analytical technology, however our system provides an advantage in that sites can be pre-screened. This allows samples to be screened for toxicity both rapidly and on-site, following which samples containing toxins or some level of significant change from baseline can then be sent for further processing if highly analytical data is needed.
Biosensor technology does exist in the industry to provide a faster alternative to these traditional analytical detection methods when a simple output as to the presence of a toxin in the sample is required. The major system used by the industry currently is a technology known as Microtox®. This system uses a naturally luminescent bacteria to which an environmental sample is added. If the sample contains a toxin, the bacteria will slow in growth or die, causing a decrease in luminescence which can then be read on a spectrophotometer or luminometer.
Figure 7: The Microtox® system uses a luminescent bacteria.  When a toxic water sample is added into the device, bacterial death occurs and the luminosity of the solution is reduced.  This allows the user to determine toxicity based on the rate of death in the sample.
This test is mainly done in a laboratory environment. Although a portable version does exist and can provide results within a 30 minute time window, there are numerous concerns associated with its reliability. A similar test, ToxTrak™, is also available in both a laboratory and portable version, though bacterial survival and respiration is measured by addition of a chemical that is utilized during respiration"
Chalmers-Gothenburg,2017,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," can be demonstrated by the estimation from Cancerfonden, that about 200 to 500 people, of patients dying each year of lung cancer in Sweden could be saved with a screening program [4].
During the development of a screening program for lung cancer, including the system and prototype created by the team, the first step was to investigate the screening programs currently ongoing. The screening program for breast cancer and cervical cancer were the initial inspiration. In the design of the screening program the following factors from the criterias has been taken into consideration: Frequency, patient group, economical model and examination method. To make the screening program efficient, high participation is of outmost importance. With this in mind, a survey was created to ensure the interest of the public and to be able to include the potential participant’s wishes and thoughts in the design of the screening program.
Frequency
The frequency of the examinations were discussed from a cost and time consumption perspective but also determined by the speed of the disease progression, although the progression of lung cancer progression can vary greatly. According to Pedersen et al. (2017), the optimal screening interval is not yet determined. However, a suggestion for the Nordic countries is a baseline screening, followed by a single annual examination that results in a biennial examination in participants without pulmonary nodules, where pulmonary nodule is defined as round or oval growths in the lung. One suggestion based on the article as well as the frequency of breast cancer examinations, is to have a lung cancer examination every two years [6].
The distributed survey regarding public opinion of a screening program for lung cancer, show that down to one year recurrent examinations was not considered a problem, and as many as 89% would have attended if they were called.
Patient group
The question of who to include in the screening program was discussed with two parties from different areas; Tommy Bjork, chairman of the patient organization Stödet and Dr. Hirsch Koyi, Associate professor at the Department of Respiratory Medicine at Gävle University that is working on bringing forth a model for implementing a screening program in the nordic countries.
According to Cancerfonden, the largest part of the patients suffering from lung cancer are people over 60 years old that have been smoking for a longer time period [7]. The initial thought was therefore that the screening program would include the part of the population above 60 years of age. After discussions with Mr. Björk and Dr. Koyi, this idea was challenged. Mr. Björk thought that the best would be to only include smokers since it otherwise would make the program too complex and expensive."

Cells were grown overnight on Chloramphenicol containing media.
Overnight stocks were prepared using single coloured colonies in 10ml LB Broth tubes with 4ug/ml Chloramphenicol.
Stocks were incubated in shaking incubator for 16 hours at 37°C
Stocks which showed visible colour after overnight incubation were used as bacteria paint Paintings were done on LB agar with Chloramphenicol (4ug/ml) and incubated overnight, inverted at 37°C.
Paintings could be done using a variety of instruments, including pipette tips, toothpicks, plastic loops or cotton buds.
Tips to note:
It was important not to overlap the GFP and RFP expressing bacteria on the plates as one microbe usually dominated and grew over the other.
Care had to be taken to ensure instruments used to paint with GFP expressing bacteria were not used to paint with RFP expressing bacteria to ensure stock remained pure.
Stocks could be stored at 4°C and used for several weeks.
Plates should be dried thoroughly before beginning painting to avoid smudging.
Using the minimal amount of stock to draw lines gave the best effect.
Game: Genetic Engineering Lucky Bag
Kids were given 3 pieces of paper and asked to write down 3 different genetic traits on each. These could be realistic such as “Ability to fly” or fictional such as “can read minds”.
All sheets were handed up, shuffled and re-distributed at random.
Kids were then assigned a living creature which would have the genetic traits they had been given.
The kids then drew a picture of how their genetically modified organism might look.
Although unrealistic, the kids enjoyed considering what a genetic trait was and how a creature could be modified with both positive and negative outcomes.

PhoA was also fused to intracellular GFP as a negative control and to an extracellular domain of LiaI as a positive control. The PhoA-deficient B. subtilis strain MH3402 will be used for expression of all PhoA constructs.
Unfortunately, the status of these constructs is still ""cloning"".
Pathogen binding
Binding of BaKillus to pathogens in general, and for this project to S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in particular, should be mediated by specific peptides that had been identified via phage display. Unfortunately, evaluation of the S. aureus-specific peptide Nrx1b ( BBa_K1351000 ) was not possible due to the lack of an S2 laboratory, as the Nrx1b-binding partner SdrC is a virulence factor of S. aureus.
Evaluation of peptides binding to S. pneumoniae was done by a biochemical pull-down assay with their binding partner NADH oxidase (NOX). As shown in figure 3, NOX was bound to streptavidin-coupled beads via an N-terminal fused Strep-Tag II, for which the pASK-IBA expression vector system was used. S. pneumoniae-specific peptides C4P, CSP and L5P ( BBa_K1351001 , BBa_K1351002 and BBa_K1351003 , respectively) were fused C-terminally to a maltose-binding protein (MBP) and a 6xHis-tag into the pKLD66 vector. This was achieved by digestion of the BioBricks and pKLD66 with NotI and HindIII and ligation of the products. The MBP prevents degradation of the short peptides by proteases and was used for detection of the peptide fusions on an SDS gel. To increase specificity of the detection, the 6xHis-tag was used for Western Blot analysis of the pulled down proteins. Additionally, S. pneumoniae itself was used as cellular beads for a pull down of the same peptide-MBP-His constructs, again followed by analysis with SDS gel and Western Blot.

Abstract
What is bioHYDRA?
BioHYDRA is a project to create biological artificial muscles that respond to changes in humidity. This past year, Chen et al. [1] at Columbia University devised a way to utilize the power of evaporation and the way Bacillus spores expand and contract depending on ambient humidity in order to create contractile structures coined as “HYDRA” (Hygroscopy driven artificial muscles). We wanted to improve on this technology by creating fully biological hydras, using cellulose instead of polyimide, and incorporating cellulose binding sites on the spore coats instead of using artificial artificial glue. By affixing the ends of these HYDRAs to a given substrate, we could produce a folding mechanism that not responds to humidity, but is also reversible.

Introduction
How spores and the Stanford-Brown 2015 iGEM team first met
In our search for a folding mechanism for biOrigami, we wanted to find a something that wasn't a material, but a biological agent that could contract and at the same time have high resistance to harsh environments. That is how we first met bacterial spores. But, bacterial spores are usually thought of as inert, hibernating organisms with little to no metabolic function.  So how can these actually be useful to us?
In response to stressful environmental conditions, vegetative Bacillus subtilis will sporulate to produce robust organisms called spores, which can survive in extreme conditions for many years. To be able to germinate and regain full vegetative function, they have to maintain a certain internal environment so as to preserve the integrity of its organelles while in spore form. To regulate the humidity content in the spore core, B. subtilis have adapted by changing the shape of"

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#Human Practices#Outreach#Campus Events_-_-_TEXT.html," Synthetic Biology courses or programs here, we need students as well as professors to be interested in the field.  Our activities included three research symposiums, participation in the University of Calgary campus fair as well as participation in 'Discovery Days', an event put on by the faculty of Medicine.
CAMPUS FAIR: JUNE 6TH
The University of Calgary Campus Fair was one of the first campus events we participated in. Campus Fair is an annual event held for children to explore science, media, engineering, and the arts through fun activities. The goal is to inspire them to think of the possibilities in the future, and showcase the different programs and faculties present at the U of C.
At Campus Fair, our team had a booth set up with fun crafts and contests. We made craft kids for children to make their own bacteria art, and ran pipetting competitions. While this was a lot of fun for the kids present, we also wanted to spread the word about iGEM and our project. Along with these activities, we set up the iGEM poster from last year's team, prompting questions about what iGEM was. These came from parents, older siblings, volunteers, and other faculty members that were present at the fair. Thus, we were able to speak about synthetic biology and our iGEM project to many individuals.

UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT RESEARCH PROGRAM (USRP) RESEARCH SYMPOSIUM: SEPTEMBER 23RD
On September 23rd, the University of Calgary iGEM team had another chance to display our work at the Markin Undergraduate Student Research program symposium (USRP).  This symposium features summer undergraduate research projects from a variety of faculties at the University. We participated in the poster session, submitting two of our posters.  This was a great chance to showcase our work to other students and faculty at the university, working on establishing more of a campus-wide presence for iGEM. We set up a demonstration of Second Life and gave out handouts to people on the four aspects of our project.  We had a lot of fun talking about our work and it gave us some practice explaining our project to people outside the field, with no prior knowledge of iGEM or of synthetic biology.  This was the first of a few research symposiums that the University of Calgary iGEM team will be participating in over the next couple of weeks.  Upcoming symposiums include the BHSC Symposium in October and the University of Calgary"

⇒ Continued work on the submission plasmid project. Digested the recovered plasmid and then ran a 1.3% gel with the plasmid and all of the digested parts to hopefully be submitted (digested by Josh a couple weeks ago). Some of the results looked very strong and some did not. The plasmid was not recovered well; 3 samples from a different colony from the pSB1C3 plate were placed in LB + chloro to be incubated over night. This work will continue tomorrow.
⇒Samples on gel from left to right: pSB1C3, ladder, Lac-OmpA, Arabinose-OmpA, ladder, Arabinose-OmpA-Gli sample #1, Arabinose-OmpA-Gli sample #2, Arabinose-OmpA-Gli sample #3, Arabinose-OmpA-Zif sample #1, Arabinose-OmpA-Zif sample #2, Arabinose-OmpA-Gli, and Lac-OmpA-Zif.
⇒ SB1C3 plasmid did not digest well, start new cultures from pSB1C3 plate overnight to continue work tomorrow. Will also try new digests of parts that did not appear clear on the gel.

An estimated 1 in 133 Americans, or about 1% of the population, has celiac disease.
It is estimated that 83% of Americans who have celiac disease are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed with other conditions.
6-10 years is the average time a person waits to be correctly diagnosed. (Source: Daniel Leffler, MD, MS, The Celiac Center at Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center).
5-22% of celiac patients have an immediate family member (1st degree relative) who also has celiac.
Over a four-year period, people with undiagnosed celiac disease cost an average of $3,964 more than healthy individuals.  (Source: Long et al, 2010).
The celiac disease diagnosis rate may reach 50-60% by 2019, thanks to efforts to raise public awareness of celiac disease. (Source: Datamonitor Group, 2009).
The number of celiac patients in Israel is rising from year to year and now has several tens of thousands. Celiac disease awareness has also increased among the population of the State of Israel and, therefore, the potential customer base in the country and abroad is growing from year to year.

The kit can be used by other people by changing the device who are sensitive to other foods containing lactose, peanuts etc... 
The technology can be used to identify other materials that are not necessarily related to any food sensitivity.
an expret opinion
One of the essential steps in a new product which has not yet entered the market is - checking with experts from various fields related to the particular product.
In order to test the feasibility of our product we approached three different experts who are involved in some way to the ""Alergln"" kit.
The first expert: Dr. Irina Barsleviski –pediatrician. Dr. Irina brought the medical aspect of the field.
The second expert: Dr. Maayan Gal –protein biochemistry expert. Dr. Maayan was interviewed in order to learn up front the scientific feasibility of the product.
The third expert: Dr. Erel Margalit. Erel Margalit is an active Member of Parliament in Israel. A businessman, founder and chairman of the international capital risk fund JVP, with it's HQ in Jerusalem, he also works in promoting the city of Jerusalem, the Southern periphery region (Beer Sheva), and the North (East Galilee).

Fig.3 We communicated with Professor Du about our project.
2. Integration with biotech companies
The best way to further verify the practical application of our project is to investigate in the biological companies who are good at transforming basic researches into practical results . We visited some relevant local biotech companies such as BGI, Qingdao Bright Moon Seaweed Group Co.LTD and Qingdao youdu biotechnology Co.LTD. We introduced our project to the stakeholders and also gathered many good suggestions. Importantly, they applauded our ideas and proposed some application of our project on production. Enlightened by the investigation, we ensured our ideas of applying our system to polycistron expression system and put it into practice.
See more details in our Gold & Integrated human practice
Fig.4 We went to biotech companies and it really inspired us.
3. Integration with other iGEM teams
In CCiC(Conference of China iGEMers Community), we communicated with other teams about our project.  XJTU-China came to exchange their ideas with us, and the similarity between the two project made us collaborated. After finishing the experiments of polycistron system, we integrated the system with their project and built a model for them. In the process of human practice, we established a platform with stakeholders for a long term cooperation and feedback. Our project is a great example of fundamental research being transformed into application. So we shared our experience with Tianjin, ZJU-China, NUDT-China team and documented for future iGEMers.

Week 2
Week 2 in the Manchester iGEM house... (that’s old now, I won’t use it again.) This has been a busy week for the less sciencey aspects of the project. We finalised our team logo, made a great poster for a Community open day we will be attending in July, and made the final changes to the sponsor packet we will be sending out soon. The team attempted to split into two subteams: core experimental team and core modelling team. Despite working on these two separate things, the group still managed to come together regularly to update the others on any progress made. Both experimental and modelling research started in Week 1 was built upon, and we feel that we are at least going in the right direction!
We put a request in for 3 BioBricks from the Repository, and are eagerly awaiting a response. Lab work will start soon. To begin with it will just be building up a stock of media and plates etc, but it will make the lab feel more like home. Which is good, because we plan on living there for the next 10 weeks.
We also met with Dr. Andy Balmer to have a chat about Human Practices. There was so much we hadn’t thought about! He definitely gave us a few things to consider, and we set a date for another meeting in Week 3. Following the meeting we thought it would be a good idea to appoint a Head of Human Practices and a Head of Ethics on the team, which fell to Rob and Tan respectively (congrats on your new job, here is a cake).
5 of the team will be visiting London in July for the first ever Young Synthetic Biologists meet-up! Accommodation and travel has already been paid, so now it’s just a matter of waiting for the day to come. We’ll be there with bells on (and also with a soil sample, at Norwich iGEM’s request!)
Week 3
This week we started thinking about our FadD knockout. After a meeting about primer design with our new supervisor, Jay; we found the gene sequence, worked out our primers and put them to order! Later in the week we had another meeting with Andy Balmer, which once again gave us a lot to think about. We’ve had a few lightbulb moments and we’re pretty excited to get stuck in! Back in the lab we found out that we didn’t have any supplies, but after a quick shopping trip we ended up with plenty of supplies...ok a LOT of supplies (Not sure if we’re going to get through "

After a Master of Advanced Studies in Biochemistry and a PhD in Chemistry and Science and Techniques of waste, now I teach Chemistry classes and also a class dealing with radioactive waste management in the Energy Engineering and Environment department.
My research work at the Laboratory of Civil engineering and Environmental engineering (LGCIE) is currently aimed at the study of biophysicochemical interactions of pollutants in various compounds (soils, sediments, municipal solid waste) using molecular biology tools. I am very excited to take part in the iGEM 2012 project which leads to the development of a synergy, already launched, between the Biosciences department and Environmental sciences.
Corinne Dorel
My teaching activities in the Microbial Genetics mainly take place within the Biosciences department at INSA Lyon, but also at the Ecole Normale Supérieur de Lyon and at the University Claude Bernard Lyon 1.
My research work is based on the understanding of genetic mechanisms involved in the formation of biofilms and the contamination of materials. Being the Communications officer for the Biosciences department, my participation in iGEM 2012 is part of a strategy to promote and share knowledge in the field of research in genetic engineering and more generally in Biological Sciences.
