sequ-into
Quality Control - Third Generation Sequencing Style
Phactory gives an alternative method to produce bacteriophages for therapytic usage, which meets                     the good manufactering pratice.                     A critacal point is the quallity of the bacteriophage DNA, which we could drastically improve up to                     96%.                     This was only possible through iterative engineering                     cycles and many parts of our project fitting seamlessly together.
With that said, any protocol optimization can only be as sophisticated as the quality control and                     feedback loop is fine.                     Furthermore, manufacturing at a certain quality standard can only ever be sustainable with the                     corresponding quality controls in place. Allowing effortless testing, with clear results at the                     earliest instant of time.
To achieve that, we implemented sequ-into.
Sequ-into, in the context of our project, detects contaminations in third generation sequencing                     data in a highly sensitive manner. Our app brings wetlab sequencing experiments in close proximity                     to                     drylab analysis and is therefore the ideal feedback tool for the crucial quality control in                     Phactory.

About sequ-into
Sequ-into is a cross-platform desktop application with a straightforward user experience, created                     by the fusion of an intuitive                     graphical interface with state-of-the-art long-read alignment software.
Reads originating from unwanted sources are detected and summarized by a comprehensive statistical                     overview,                     but can also be filtered and exported in standardized FASTQ-format to facilitate custom evaluation                     of experimental findings.                     Additionally, it might be unclear whether a sequencing experiment produced reads of the intended                     target. Therefore the filtering                     we implemented also allows for a positive selection.
Why is sequ-into an notable addition to your third                             generation sequencing routine?
Third generation sequencing techniques rapidly evolved as a common practice in molecular                             biology. Great advances have been made in terms of feasibility, cost, throughput, and                             read-length. However, sample contamination still poses a big issue: it complicates correct,                             high-quality downstream analysis of sequencing data and usage in medical applications.

The production of PCBs has been banned in the United States because of possible impact on animal and human health, yet the harmful molecules still contaminate our waters today.  Our project involves transferring genes responsible for producing PCB-dechlorinating enzymes from the anaerobic D. mccartyi bacterium, in which they're naturally found, into E.coli, an easier-to-work-with bacterium.
We will be transferring three different genetic variants of the PCB dechlorinating enzyme and will face many challenges in producing the working enzymes.  The enzymes probably use norpseudo-B12 as a cofactor, a compound E. coli doesn't naturally create.  We are currently researching ways to introduce this into the environment of the E.coli expressing the proteins.  The working enzymes also contain iron-sulfer clusters, which will be destroyed upon exposure to oxygen, as the original organism is anaerobic.  We are currently looking into different and easy ways to grow E.coli anaerobically and ways to combat this issue.  D. mccartyi's membrane is also archea-like and dissimilar to E.coli's membrane, which may cause complications with expression and localization.  The enzymes are also transmembrane proteins, which may pose problems.
We will be contacting other labs with higher biosafety levels due to the toxicity of PCBs, to test out our system.  We are currently working in lab to transfer our synthesized genetic circuits to E.coli bacteria while we research ways to solve the potential problems listed above.  We have also included His tags in our genetic circuits and have partnered with the Baker Lab at the University of Washington to analyze our PCB dechlorinating enzymes in the future.

1.Nanjing-China binding protein, PbrR
This year we are cooperating with team SJTU-BioX-Shanghai. We come up with an idea of combining the two projects to achieve a win-win goal, which is to desalinate sea water with a high concentration of heavy metal. They are engineering with blue algea which can desalinate sea water while we work with engineered B. subtilis which can adsorb lead, gold and uranyl selectively. We also sent them our cell adhesion materials in case they need to separate blue algea from sea water.
Fig 1. Cell adhesion materials. 1. First generation plastic pellet 2. Second generation plastic pellet 3. Cyclic fiberfill 4. Chain-like fiberfill
Firstly, as is known, different organisms live under diverse conditions. Therefore the first problem that we meet with is related to the living conditions of our chassis. Can our engineered B. subtilis survive in sea water? Can their blue algea survive in aquatic environment with high solution of heavy metal? Only if we solve the two obstacles can we cooperate with each other smoothly. So we decided to do some tests to confirm whether they can survive simultaneously in sea water with heavy metal. We planned to select microorganisms that meet the collaboration requirement. Unfortunately, the microorganisms used in our project were both chosen. It could be unpredictable if we had tried to modify them. Thus we had to change our plan.
After many rounds of discussion, we found that places such as estuaries could provide the two organisms with required environment. So we finally decided to desalinate polluted sea water step by step. Sea water with high concentration of heavy metal go through our purification device first so that heavy metal contaminants can be adsorbed. Next, blue algea functions to desalinate the sea water. The advantage of our idea is that we only need to make sure that our engineered B. subtilis can survive in sea water while the low efficiency problem is also inevitable.
We have been collaborating with each other since early July and the collaboration is still going on. We sincerely hope that our win-win goal can be achieved some day. Because we have found that almost all desalination technologies encounter the problem of sediments which contained a variety of heavy metal such as lead. The combination of our two teams not only identified the significance of"

Standard BioBrick Assembly
The Standard Assembly of BioBricks was first developed by Tom Knight, and has subsequently been modified by other scientist to overcome some of the hurdles of the Standard Assembly. Only two parts larger than 200 bp can be assembled by the Standard assembly in each cycle. Furthermore, the parts should preferably be either 500 bp smaller or larger from each other as well as the backbone. The system is based on one of the parts to be assembled in the destination vector from the beginning. The assembly can be performed with either suffix insertion (insertion of the added part behind the existing part), or a prefix insertion (insertion of the added part in front of the existing part).
The way it's done
The Standard assembly makes use of the restriction recognition sites of four restriction enzymes; EcoRI and XbaI should be located upstream of the BioBrick and SpeI and Pst"

First evaluation of the growing Community Lab Scene
Pre-discussion with the iGEM Team Darmstadt
iGEM Team Darmstadt in Aachen
Beyond literature research, we wanted to get more inside information about Community Labs. Luckily, Fabian, a member of the iGEM Team Darmstadt is currently involved in the establishment of a BioHackerSpace!
On the 12th of June, Team Darmstadt was visiting us in Aachen. We, therefore, took the chance to have a general discusson about the potential and perception of the growing number of Communitly Labs in Germany and Europe. This discussion helped us to sharpen our knowledge and gave us some new aspects about this recent trend. It was particularly interesting, to get to know more about the intrinstic motivation of joining a BioHackerSpace and to hear the most prominent concerns that these labs have to face.

Discussions and Interviews at an interdisciplinary Symposium
In June, we were invited to a symposium called Synthetic Biology - Opportunities for interdisciplinary Research from Biology to Engineering. We gladly accepted and presented our project to a broad spectrum of scientists. The following discussions lead to a huge amount of feedback on our bioreactor as well as our biological project.
“
It's going to be very hard to keep people from getting access [...]. They're doing it in their garages now. We have to think about how we train people and how we talk about it.

availibility of DIY Biology?<
Interviewing Jay Keasling during the symposium
In addition, we were extremely lucky to not only discuss our project, but also get an interview with the keynote speaker of this conference, Jay Keasling . Subsequently, we recorded several conversations with other speakers as well as guests of the symposium. On the one hand, these interviews touched some general questions about the progress and perception of synthetic biology. On the other hand, the main topic was the risks and benefits of community labs. As a result, we gathered a wide spectrum of opinions, which contributed to and influenced our human practices project.
To sum up, by covering a variety of aspects concerning Community Labs we had now aquired enough background knowledge to meet a real Community lab. Fortunately, we already made friends with some members of the ""Technik Garage"

Education and Public Outreach
Following in the footsteps of iGEM Aachen 2014, we are building custom made hardware for custom made biology. Since there was no suitable design in any DIY platform (e.g. Hackteria.org, DIYBIO.ORG, Appropedia.org) we started to build our bioreactor system right from scratch. While demonstrating our first prototype at the MakerFaire in Hannover, we were fascinated by the exhibited DIY Biology projects. Inspired by the creativity and commitment of the ""Makers"", we decided take a deeper look into the European Community Lab scene.
Since not only iGEM teams but also Community Labs shared our problems with the organization of samples in the fridge, we developed tubefront , an organisation software for biological samples. Speaking of software, the use of software on computers, smartphones or tablets increases in laboratories all around the world. But is it safe to bring in these? In collaboration with iGEM Team Slovenia, we considered respective biosafety aspects by analyzing how many microbes live on the surfaces of such devices.
During the course of our project, we had the pleasure to meet and collaborate with a great number of passionate and creative partners inside and outside of the iGEM community. At our ""Collaborations"" page, we tell you about our active collaborations and more!

U2: M/S14/X/11/12/13/14/15/16/17.
Results:
If there is any thaumatin in the supernatant, the silver staining may not be sensitive enough.
Large scale expression (1l) 4
Investigator: Saskia, Kathrin
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the expression of the three caffein genes CaDXMT1, CaMXMT1 and CaXMT1 in selective SC-U 2% galactose expression medium for having enough crude extract for further analysis.
Operational sequence:
The cells didn't grow, because the OD600nm was still 0.4 as we started the day before. Thus we centrifuged the cells, discarded the supernatant and resuspended the cells in selective SC-U 2% glucose medium and grew the cells again in 200 ml of SC-U 2% glucose medium to get enough cells for repetition of the expression. The cells were incubated at 30°C over night.
Toxicity Assay: effect of caffeine, thaumatin and limonene on yeast growth
Investigator: Mary
Aim of the experiment: To check whether caffeine, thaumatin and limonene have a toxic effect on different yeast strains.
One over-night culture of INVSc were inoculated and the OD(600) measured at the next day.
The OD(600) was adjusted to 0,5 in different media and the growth rate were measured after about 2-3 hours.
Caffeine: concentrations of 100mM to 1µM were used, but caffeine did not resolve completely, so the experiment did not show any effect and was repeated the next day.
Thaumatin: a concentration of 1mg/ml was used, by adding 10mg of thaumatin to 10ml YPD medium. The growth rate was measured four times.
Results:
Evaluation of the Toxicity Assay for Thaumatin.
Limonene: following concentrations were used: 100mM, 10mM, 1mM, 100µM, 10µM, 1µM and the growth rate was measured five times.
Results:
Evaluation of the Toxicity Assay for Limonene.
As the negative control (without any substance in the medium) the INVSc strain of the growth experiment was used.

Band Aid as a Final application
The focus of our project is to engineer E. coli that can detect MRSA in order to locally produce and deliver antimicrobial peptides.This project may have implications to society, especially if the mechanism is put into a real application.  Therefore, we thought of a possible application of our project and we came out with the band aid idea.
By using the band aid, the safety of the real application can be ensured in several ways. First of all, the complete system is enclosed by the band aid and in that way it can be located on the wound without having the E. coli in direct contact with the patient which could lead to the E. coli also becoming a source of infection.  To research this band aid application we selected several membranes that can be used to enclose E. coli and allow passing through of AIPs and peptides. The important parameters in selecting a membrane are the pore size and the material. The pore size is set to a diameter of <= 0.2 μm, which is big enough to allow passing through of the petides and AIPS, but small enough to make it improbable for the E. coli to escape. Moreover, the material is chosen not to break easily in order to avoid the infection of patient in case that something goes wrong [1] . Last but not least, the band aids were selected in such a way so as not to be toxic or become toxic for E. coli. Because if that is the case, then the complete system will fail and the patient will also be infected.
The membranes that were chosen to satisfy the above mentioned criteria are:

Always satisfied to be a menial reseacher(Not exactly).
Yi is a sophomore majoring in physics in UCAS.
During a couple of months spent on IGEM competition. She came across many outstanding teammates, from whom she harvested many new pieces of knowledge and experience. Though she may not continue the research work in the biological field, the precious experience thought she what ""scientific research"" really is.
Her summer vacation was spent in the laboratory where she served as an assistant. Out of lab she also did some paperwork such as translation and collecting some materials. She did some trivial works in HP and Hardware.
Although most of the time she acted as a ""manual worker"", she is willing to contribute to the team.

HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," RNAs can be translated into proteins. These processes sometimes can be regulated by some molecules like transcription factors or non-coding RNAs. The interactions among them can be understood by chemical reactions. We use one chemical reaction to depict the interaction between transcription factor $TF$ and inducible promoter $Pro$. We don't separate the polymerisation process and the binding process for simplicity
The equilibrium dissociation constant $K_D$ for the reaction can be calculated.  \begin{equation} K_D=\frac{k_{-1}}{k_1}=\frac{[TF]^n\cdot [Pro]}{[Pro']}. \end{equation}
We assume that the DNA copy number is a constant n,  \begin{equation} [Pro]+[Pro']=n. \end{equation} Then the $Pro'$ proportion depends on the concentration of $TF$, and this proportion can also be regarded as the probability of the binding events. \begin{equation} P(\text{binding})=\frac{[Pro']}{n}=\frac{[TF]^n}{K_D+[TF]^n} \end{equation}
If the transcription factor is an activator, the gene is transcribed at the maximal transcription rate $\beta_1$ when the promoter is bound by the transcription factor. If the transcription factor is a repressor, the gene is transcribed at the maximal transcription rate $\beta_1$ when the promoter is free from the transcription factor.
In deterministic model, we use Hill function to describe the rate of production, which is $\beta_1$ times its occurring probability.
For transcription activation, the maximal transcription rate will occur if the activator binds to the promoter, so the Hill function is \begin{equation} f(x)=\beta_1\frac{[TF]^n}{K^n+[TF]^n}. \end{equation}
For transcription repression, the maximal transcription rate will occur if the repressor doesn't bind to the promoter, so the Hill function is \begin{equation} f(x)=\beta_1\frac{K^n}{K^n+[TF]^n}. \end{equation} $K$ is activation coefficient or repression coefficient, which equals $\sqrt[n]{K_D}$.
In addition, many genes have a non-zero minimal expression level, namely basal expression level. It can be described by adding a term $\beta_0$. And some genes that have a constitutive promoter cannot be described by Hill function. We just set their production rate to be a constant.

SEM of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Picture by Janice Haney Carr.
Are we soon going to be dying of pneumonia again? It is almost unimaginable, but the danger that our antibiotics will soon fail against plagues thought to be conquered a long time ago, is eminent. In fact, the situation has grown very acute. The all-purpose weapon antibiotic is on the verge of losing its vigor since many pathogens, such as the pneumonia causing bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa , have become resistant. Experts of the World Health Organization (WHO) have already raised a loud alarm: In their recently published first global resistance report , they are drawing a rather apocalyptic picture. If nothing is done, doctors soon might not be able to do anything but stand helplessly next to their patients while they are dying from nowadays easily curable diseases or even smallest wound infections.

Peking,2015,Team:Peking#Project#CRISPR_-_-_TEXT.html," single-guide RNA (sgRNA); they form a complex and can be easily programmed to recognize any target sequence [3]; in previous studies it was engineered to be catalytically dead (dCas9), thus to form a programmable DNA binding complex [4]. But how can we convert the invisible sequence information into easily measurable signal?
Split luciferase
Split enzymes [5] were selected as the candidates to convert the presence of target DNA sequence into measureable signal. Each protein fragment by itself is inactive; when the fragments are reassembled, the enzymatic activity of the original protein would be reconstituted, thus providing easily measurable readout through enzymatic reaction. Among diverse split enzymes, we chose split luciferase which produces bioluminescence signal (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Illustration of the working mechanism of split luciferase. A functional luciferase is split into two inactive fragments (Nluc, orange and Cluc, yellow).  Each fragment is fused to an interacting domain (gray) that tends to dimerize. The interacting domains cause non-covalent complementation of Nluc and Cluc to reconstitute the enzymatic activity, thus to emit measurable bioluminescence.
Design
We combined dCas9 and split luciferase to obtain a paired dCas9 (PC) reporter system that can not only extract the sequence information of target DNA, but also quantitatively visualize its abundance through bioluminescence emission. As shown in the schematic diagram (Figure 2), when N-luciferase-dCas9:sgRNA complex and C-luciferase-dCas9:sgRNA complex simultaneously bind to adjacent sites on a target DNA, the two fragments of luciferase are brought into proximity and the subsequent complementation brings measurable bioluminescence signal.
Figure 2. Schematic of the paired dCas9 (PC) reporter system. dCas9 was fused with fragments of split luciferase (N-luc and C-luc), respectively, to form two kinds of split luciferase-dCas9:sgRNA complexes. In the presence of target DNA, the complexes, respectively, bind to two adjacent recognition sites, bringing N-luc and C-luc into proximity to produce bioluminescence signal.
Results
Validating the functional reconstitution of split luciferase
We began by examining whether our split luciferase could be really functionally reconstituted by protein fragment-assisted complementation (PFAC) [7,8]. For the complementation-assisting partners, we chose"
TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Conjugation Overview_-_-_TEXT.html,"id to be transmitted between cells containing conjugation helper plasmids (modified R751). In nature this does occur but at very low levels, due to the presence of entry exclusion proteins [ 5 ]. These membrane-bound proteins block incoming transfers from cells containing the conjugative plasmid. Note that in order for the transfer to be blocked their presence is required only in the recipient. These entry exclusion proteins are present for two primary reasons:
to prevent redundant transfer of the conjugative plasmid among a population of cells
to prevent lethal zygosis [ 6 ].
In R751 the gene trbK encodes for the entry exclusion protein [ 7 . Its presence is not required for conjugation to occur [ 8 ]. Some papers have reported that knocking out the trbK genes in other plasmids did not affect the conjugation frequency: ""transfer of the trbK mutant occurred at near-wild-type frequencies""[ 9 ]. Given this information, we proposed to knockout the trbK gene from R751. In the fully integrated signal plasmid, the expression of trbK would prevent the signal from propagating backwards. With this in mind it was decided to also synthesize and characterize the trbK gene.
Preventing the Transfer of the Helper Plasmid
In our system, we would like only the small signal plasmid to be conjugated not the large helper plasmid. Methods to acheive this have previously been demonstrated at iGEM by teams including Berkeley '06 and Peking '07 . By removing the origin of transfer region from R751 and placing it on the signal plasmid, the signal plasmid will be transmitted during the conjugation while R751 ΔoriTR will not. Since no R751 ΔoriTR plasmid was available in the registry we added the oriTR region to the list of knockouts needed.
Lethal Zygosis
What is lethal zygosis? Essentially this is a problem caused when cells attempt to conjugate too much leading to damage in their membrane.
""We find that diaminopimelic acid in the recipient membrane is released into the medium during bacterial matings, indicating that membrane damage was inflicted on the recipient by the donor, probably for forming a channel for DNA transfer. When the damage is extensive, as in matings with an excess of Hfr bacteria, the F- bacteria are killed (lethal zygosis). The transfer of a large amount of DNA in Hfr matings appears to enhance the killing."" [ 6 ]

We have improved the characterization of the Calgary 2013 Team's BioBricks; Bba_K1189010 and Bba_K1189011 .
We also used Heidelberg's intein BioBrick for our own purposes, improving upon its design by adding a T7 promoter to our BioBrick, allowing for direct expression of the protein without any subcloning.
We also integrated the theme of education throughout our Human Practices Project; we organized a workshop for SHAD valley students, gave a public seminar on the applications our project, and participated in course development work. Take a look at our Human Practices page!"

He checked Dam and EmrR plates from the mutation rate assay that were plated on Thursday once again for growth and recorded down counts. Transformed various Quikchanges and ligations from earlier in the week we had been stalling an transforming (we wanted to transform a whole bunch of things at once to make things more efficient). Finally, made overnight cultures of the colony PCRs from Friday that looked good for EmrR and DamR that had been ligated into the ARM construct.
Week 14 9/15 - 9/19
Summary
Running out of time/last final stretch: Everything’s coming together, but we still have a ton of work to do.
Sunday
Ryan S counted colonies on the nonselective XL1B plates and checked all the plates from yesterday. None of the transformation have large colonies so they were put for an additional day.  Miniprepped the overnight cultures of Dam and EmrR that actually grew. We have one of each! UmuD’C and PolB from the selective plates were innoculated and cultured in selective media.  Made glycerol stocks of the 4 mutators we have, and performed mutation rate analysis. Made a mastermix in LB, rif and IPTG at the right cell dilution and aliquotted out for overnight cultures. They’re now in the incubator and ready for tomorrow’s plating!
Monday
Checked all the transformation plates but none of them seems to have growth :( Good news is, the overnight cultures of the mutators for mutation rate analysis (EmrR, MutS, MutH, Dam) have growth, so they were plated on LB plates and Rif plates when the right OD is reached.  DinB and UmuD’C were digested and ligated onto IPTG+GFP. PolB and UmuD’C were miniprepped and glycerol stocks were made. The miniprep sample concentration was really high - they were around 500 ng/ul!
Tuesday
UmuD’C and linearized amp backbone. Digested the UmuD’C, DinB and Dam and ligated them into IPTG+GFP with a 3:1 vector-insert ratio. AREmrR was sent in for sequencing and overnight cultures for ARDam was made for miniprepping.  Transformation plates from yesterday and the day before looked bad. The non"
RHIT,2013,Team:RHIT#Parts.html_-_-_TEXT.html," yeast is dependent upon E. coli for its survival, but in order for our system to work, we need the E. coli to be dependent upon the yeast as well. We did this by hooking up an essential gene for E. coli to a promoter that is only turned on by exposure to lactate, a chemical we’ve made the yeast secrete. This means that the only way the E. coli can survive, is if the E. coli is close to the yeast to absorb the lactate the yeast is secreting.
His3 Protein
Just like with the yeast, the essential gene we are using as a selective pressure is a gene in the histidine pathway. This gene is very similar to the gene we used in the yeast, but has been optimized to work in E. coli.
E. coli Terminator
As explained above with the yeast terminator, just like the promoters act as green lights, terminators act as red lights. However, different species have different terminator preferences, so we selected one that is optimized for E. coli.

Also, streaked out pSB1AK3 from glycerol stock onto a plate.  This vector will be used to carry the results from our PCR.
Mixed up PCR concentrations.  Some sources indicated that it was necessary for there to be 1 ng of DNA in the entire mix, so we diluted the plasmid DNA to 0.5 ng/uL in all cases and added 2 uL of each to its respective reaction to serve as the template.  These were also suspended in 10 mM tris HCl.
Ran PCR according to the following program:
1. 95°C for 40 sec
2. 95°C for 15 sec
3. 50°C for 30 sec
4. 72°C for 2:30 min

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," publicity with scientific research to cross boundaries and open hypothetical lab doors.
Language barrier
Over the course of creating our Evobody generating system we experienced extreme difficulties explaining topics              like ""directed evolution"" or ""two hybrid system"" to a non-scientific auditorium. Our first presentation on our project              was in April when we discussed the generation of Evobodies with staff of Bielefeld University.             Already in this early stage, we experienced major issues when explaining the complex structure of our high speed evolution. From here on we were eager to improve our presentation skills and connect with our audience to raise the overall comprehensibility.
Due to these difficulties, we established dialogue with the cultural anthropologist Florian Helfer from Frankfurt, Germany.              After a video conference,             we were sure that the language barrier between regular language and scientific terminology is THE major issue when communicating scientific topics. That is why             we started several follow-up projects to breach this barrier:
Because scientific language seems to non-scientific people like a foreign language,     we created a dictionary on synthetic biology to translate scientific language and especially everything about Evobodies into regular English phrasing.             We collected about 500 terms associated with our project or synthetic biology in general.              This tool should support non scientific people to understand science related media and give scientists the chance to find              simple words when explaining their research to a public audience.
Another highlight of our summer was the 5th annual CeBiTec students academy . Every year 20                  ambitious high school students stay for one week at the CeBiTec to learn about recent research and collect                 practical experience what it means to work in a molecular biology laboratory. We instructed                 experiments in the field of synthetic biology and organized a barbecue for recreation in the evening.                 Once again we learned the difficulties to summarize our complex evolution system in a few sentences and learned a lot about communicating                  scientific methods and techniques. Furthermore we adopted measures to improve our presentation skills.
We transported the idea of directed evolution to human practice and started a series of presentations at high schools. After each session, we reflected on our presentation style and comprehensibility of certain parts              in our construction. The results were quite surprising but gradually we were able to improve our presentation to enhance the             general understanding of Evobodies without prior scientific knowledge.
To involve the public in our fundraising campaign we started a crowdfunding project on Startnext.de.                 The videoclip we created received very positive feedback via social media and guaranteed the success of the campaign. Furthermore it explained                 in a very graphical way how our system works and where it can be applied."

Goettingen,2018,Team:Goettingen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"B). In addition to the deletion affecting the yhfE, yhfF and gltT genes, the strains iGEM7 and iGEM13 had replaced a single nucleotide and deleted 11 nucleotides, respectively, in the gltP gene. The yhfE gene encodes a putative aminopeptidase and the function of the yhfF gene is unknown ( SubtiWiki ; 6). The gltT and gltP genes code for the high-affinity sodium-coupled glutamate/aspartate symporter GltT and for the low-affinity proton/glutamate symporter GltP, respectively (7,8). The fact that all strains had acquired mutations in genes encoding transporters that are involved in glutamate and aspartate uptake suggests that the proteins also transport glyphosate (Figure 5B). The 1240 bp- and 11 bp-long deletions in the gltT and gltP genes truncate the encoded proteins after 282 and 214 amino acids, respectively (Figure 5C). The G232A mutation in the gltP gene results in a replacement of a glutamate residue by a lysine residue at position 78, which is adjacent to the second transmembrane helix of the GltP transporter (Figure 5C). While the deletions certainly destroy the amino acid transporters, the E78K replacement probably reduces the transport of glyphosate via GltP. This idea is in line with the observation that the strain iGEM7 carrying the G232A mutation in the gltP gene did not grow as good as the strain iGEM13 with the deletion in gltP on plates with high amounts of glyphosate (Figure 5C). A structural comparison revealed that glutamate and glyphosate resemble each other because the molecules contain negatively charged groups encompassing positively charged groups (Figure 5D). Thus, both, GltT and GltP could be involved in glyphosate uptake. To conclude, B. subtilis rapidly adapts to toxic glyphosate concentrations by inactivating the gltT and gltP genes!
1.4. Glyphosate-resistant mutants preferentially inactivate the gltT gene
Previously, it has been shown that bacteria like Salmonella typhimurium can develop glyphosate resistance due to the acquisition of mutations in the promoter region and in the coding region of the aroA gene, elevating the EPSP synthase levels and rendering the encoded enzyme insensitive to glyphosate, respectively (9-11"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP."

1) Organizing a symposium about synthetic biology for the pubilc
On Oct 1st, we held an open symposium for middle school and high school students. We planned and managed the event and as guests, we invited three experts from microbiology (Prof. Oshima), synthetic biology (Prof. Kiga) and bioethics (Dr. Nudeshima).
The main content of the symposium was a panel discussion by the guests (plus our PI, Dr. Tagawa) and the theme was ""What is life? What is a living organism?"" As the audiences expected, the panelists held heated debates. We felt we were watching cutting edge discussion on synthetic biology and they gave us new perspectives.
In total, about ten middle school and high school students participated in this event and also, undergraduate students from iGEM Team KAIT JAPAN also joined it.
In the Q&A session, from the public to students with life science major, the audiences from various backgrounds asked questions and the panelists were eager to answer them.

On September 2nd, we visited two high schools in Saitama Prefecture. We gave lectures and organized groupwork activities at both schools.
At the lecture, we explained about gene modification and synthetic biology. As for gene modification, we took specific examples in a real society. We emphasized that it's necessary to distinguish the merits and demerits and take an advantage of the former.
After the lecture, the students moved on to groupwork activity. In this activity, we assigned a famous animation character to each group and asked the students to think and discuss how to make the character, introducing gene modification into a real animal. It was a great opportunity for them to enter the"

Frequently asked questions:
Q: How can you control the regulation range of pH?
A: The regulation range of pH is decided by three factors, the responsive range of pH-induced promoters, the efficiency of recombinase system and the strength of functional acid and alkali. The responsive range of pH-induced promoters is a rough range. Different efficiency of recombinase system combined with the responsive range of pH-induced promoters can result in various expression level of functional genes and thus we can get different amount of acid or alkali. Different functional acid has different pKa value. Considering all these three factors, we can control the regulation range of pH.
Q: Will the system function influence the bacteria normal division?
A: The gene in our system is harmless to our engineering bacteria. And most of our regulation products are endogenous, such as lactate, GABA and others. There may be another question that the acid we employed is from the citric acid cycle, so it might influence the growth of bacteria. But according to our experiment and some references, it has less effect on the cell division.
Q: Temperature regulation is also an important step in fermentation, have you ever considered the bad effects of heat which generated by neutralization if you use acid and alkali to regulate the pH?
A: Firstly, the neutralization process is not quick or violent here, especially the functional acid and alkali we used are medium. Therefore the heat generated by this process will dissipate quickly. Second, the growth of strains will also higher the temperature of fermentation liquor. Companies now already developed modern technology to keep the fermenter at a proper temperature. Last but not least, our project in 2013 is Intelligent Heat Regulation Engine which successfully solved the problems caused by heat. We can integrate this engine with pH Controller.
Q: How long does pH Controller takes to react with the environmental pH changes?
A: The reaction time mainly depends on the pH-responsive promoters. The reaction time of two promoters used in our basic circuits is half an hour, according to our experiments. More importantly, by error-prone PCR, we selected"
Valencia_UPV,2017,Team:Valencia UPV#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," a step-by-step workflow, known as a pilot project, the adoption of ChatterPlant was proposed.
WHAT HAVE WE DONE?
In order to squeeze the whole potencial of our project, we have ordered our Integrated Human Practices in the following actions:
A social analysis of ChatterPlant skateholders necessities
An adaptation study through ChatterPlant evolution accordingly to obtained conclusion from previous analysis
An in-depth pilot project strategy to implement our project in current society
SOCIAL ANALYSIS
In order to transform the principal ideas of  ChatterPlant into a practical, tangible SynBio solution, the necessities of stakeholders were taken into account thus modeling the project off of their requirements. As a result of such inquiries we were able to create a more convincing, more effective product tailored to the concerns of stakeholders.
On the right graphic,  the adoption evolution of an innovative technology was represented. As seen, early adopters lead to a normalization of the new techonology to the rest of society.Initial ideas of ChatterPlant drived our social analysis through the following groups, based on an adoption study.
Greenhouses, as current adopters of new technology in plant production processes.
Michelin-starred restaurants,  as early adopters in innovative food technologies.
General public, as final adopters of our technology.
The legal framework revolving around ChatterPlant we also also studied and evaluated.
GREENHOUSES ANALYSIS
Fruit and vegetables are considered the basis of staple diets in almost every gastronomic culture. For this reason, greenhouse production is being advanced to become a better alternative to regular farming, ensuring current and future food security. Consequently, the analysis of greenhouse necessities was mandatory to transform ChatterPlant’s main objectives to reality.
EVALUATION OF LOCAL GREENHOUSES
The first place of investigation was at La Unió de Perelló greenhouse near Valencia, Spain. Another place of investigation was at the Iberflora exhibition, an annual fair of plants and gardening in Valencia. Furthermore, we interviewed Ángeles Calatayud , a researcher at the “Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias” (IVIA) research center.
EVALUATION OF INTERNATIONAL GREENHOUSES
The Netherlands is one of the leading countries in greenhouse flower production with some of the best plant-production technology in Europe. An interview with Marta Vázquez, a post-doctoral researcher of Wageningen university, reinforced the notion that controlling the growing conditions of a plant increase the overall plant production. In Vázquez’s professional opinion, there is should not be any problem in the application of  high-tech tools given that the"

ECUST iGEM 2017
   We get in touch with team Light Harvester in June through our instructor. Even though we've gone through the High School student handbook, we’re still lacking some biotechnology lab skill. And since our lab is specifically established for the iGEM project in this year, we are lacking equipment resources. As a result, we learned extraction and transformation of plasmids, standardized aseptic manipulation, the extraction and purification of DNA, and how to operate various instruments and so on. With all the knowledge, we needed for completing the Lnterlab, our team starts the Interlab in August. We finished our final measurement of Interlab with their assistants about plate reader and their help upon the cultivation of final. In the first week, we dilute the fluorescein and measure the fluorescein solution’s standard curve. In the week after that, we measured OD600 Reference point and fluorescein fluorescence standard curve using protocols. Other than communicating about the experimental design between two groups, our team help them to check English grammar usage.

SJTU SJTU Software iGEM 2017
As an attempt to strengthen communication between collegiate teams in China, our team answered the survey questions made by team form Shanghai Jiao Tong University so that they could gain more information about existing high school teams in China. We discussed and brainstormed the future tendency on high school level’s development of biotechnology also what we expected to create in order to establish a more harmonious science community in biotechnology field. As two distinct points of view which are standing from college and high school, we exchanged our ideas about the long-range outlook of iGEM, and generally we could conclude these into one key point: one was that the most serious problem that most high school teams faced is lacking experience of doing practical bioengineering and necessary professional scientific knowledge. Therefore, we expected to build a well-spread and influential network among high school teams, then all the teams could meet as a conference every year and attain help from each other. It also could create a big platform for collaboration among teams and provide opportunities for colligate teams to contact high school teams even offer certain help. What’s more, we also planned to produce a book for high school students for pedagogical meaning with Shanghai Jiao Tong University about synthetic biology, which might be more"

Oxford,2017,Team:Oxford#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," in his work.  However, since our project involves the detection of the protease activity of cruzipain, the usual problems of a low antigenic specificity and sensitivity when using cruzipain as a biomarker are overcome for the protease activity of cruzipain is specific. Nonetheless, the insight provided by Dr. Vicco on the uncertainty of the concentration of cruzipain in the blood further reinforced the modelling results to indicate the need for an integrated amplification system in our biosensor.
Professor Emilio Malchiodi
Professor Malchiodi is a researcher at the University of Buenos Aires developing vaccines for Leishmania and Trypanosoma cruzi. Our discussion with him highlighted the issue of variable cruzipain concentration in the acute phase with the lower range likely only resolvable by sensitive techniques such as Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). Since we lacked the resources for SPR and did not have access to parasite cultures, due to safety reasons, it also emphasized the need for amplification in system to allow detection of the lowest possible concentrations of cruzipain. In the future, we hope our diagnostic test can be trialled in mouse models with naturally variable levels of cruzipain to confirm the viability of the amplification system in detecting the lowest levels of parasitemia in the acute phase of Chagas disease from one or less than one parasite in the sample.

Dr Scott L Diamond
Dr Diamond of Penn University is an expert in blood systems biology and protease proteomics, who we contacted for advice on the accuracy of parameters used in our blood clotting model. He informed us that 10 nM thrombin is necessary for blood clotting, allowing us to improve our models by increasing their accuracy. More accurate models consequently enabled us to determine the properties of our DNA and protein-based circuitry with a greater precision, and refine their design to optimise the detection of cruzipain and lower the chance of false positives and false negatives in our test.
Professor Mike Laffan
Professor Mike Laffan, professor of Haemostasis and Thrombosis at Imperial, advised us on the kinetics of blood clotting. He brought to our attention that the release of hirudin during the blood clotting cascade successful output results in a race between the two unpredictable processes. Therefore, he recommended the use of citrate anticoagulant to delay blood clotting, giving sufficient time for hirudin release, before addition of calcium ions and a coagulation trigger such as a tissue factor. We consequently decided to add these parameters to our model and adapt our"

We will produce Flavorator in the world. It is our dream. Our dream complete that public people use Flavorator. We need to get various advises (improve point, safety, cost, and cognition.etc) from difference worker. (Farmer, Economist, Family, and engineer .etc) We inform our activity to people by many approaches. This activity could also know iGEM and Flavorator to public. It is important to talk with people. You can gossip your friend about project. Your friend can gossip others about project. Oh? Innovative tool is Human!? Let’s Human Practice!
○Public Engagement~Public Outreach&Dialogue~
For the dialog with the public we contacted various media and explained them about our project and about synthetic biology in general.  We chose to contact the public events and Internet, because it is an efficient way to reach as many people with as many different backgrounds as possible.  Explaining our ideas we learned a lot, because we really had to focus on a general, more marketing-like view about our project, instead of only concentrating on the scientific, technical aspects.
Crowd funding
In general, to the public audience or expert sectors, we explain our project, iGEM activities, and the topics of synthetic biology.  After explanation, we discussed with all participants and often did a survey by questionnaire. Other team often uses the questionnaire, too. Our innovation is quite unique. The idea was to set “Crowd funding”."

Definition of system specifications
Goal
Determine the target specifications of our bacterial system regarding the detection levels and azurin production levels
Overview
In order to tune our bacteria so that it would behave correctly in vivo, we had to define precise, quantitative criteria that had to be met. This means that we first need to define the operating points that our system will encounter (in other words, the different environmental conditions our bacteria will meet: tumoral or healthy tissues for instance). We will then need to determine the relative level of toxin production in our bacteria that we are willing to tolerate in area where there is no need for treatment. As a result, we will get objective quantitative criteria, which will help us build upon it a strategy to optimize the performance of our system, thanks to further modeling.
Determining operating points
To know how to tune our system, we need to define the detection thresholds in term of bacterial cells density and lactate concentration for our AND gate. We will here establish for both variables a low value (in situations of healthy environment) and a high value(in situations of tumor environment).
Lactate concentration
A high local lactate concentration is a fairly reliable indicator of a tumorous environment. Tumorous cell exhibit indeed an erratic metabolic behavior leading to a lactate production way over the levels of healthy cells (this is part of the so called ""Warburg effect"" [1] ). Basal concentration of lactate in healthy tissues has been found to be below 1 mM, whereas it was found to be larger than 4 mM and up to 40 mM in tumors. [2]
To build our model, we will take as reference value a lower lactate concentration of 1 mM for healthy tissues, and a higher one of 5 mM for tumors. As the activation of the synthesis of azurin is monotonous in regards to lactate concentration (the more lactate there is, the more it is activated), we believe that measuring the performance of our circuit with these two wisely chosen values will be suitable for a good assessment of its specificity"

The concentrations of three samples, were taken on a nano drop. The two unmodified biobricks from this year, L1 and E1, did not have a reliable measurement on the nano drop. However, the successful plasmid from this year, CE 5, did have a good nano drop concentration reading. Because of this, we decided to only run the cell free kit on the CE 5 plasmid.

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

Introduction
Besides the integration of unnatural bases into the genetic code of E.coli and the usage of non-canonical amino acids (ncAA) for advanced protein design, the creation and selection of new aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) is a fundamental part of our project. To determine the most effective and specific aaRS for the incorporation of the desired ncAAs, an evaluation system of the synthetases is essential. Literature review revealed a synthetase test system “pFRY” (a Reporter Plasmid for measuring ncAA Incorporation, BBa_K1416004 ) of the iGEM-Team Austin, Texas, 2014 which was also used by the team Aachen 2016 ( BBa_K2020040 ).
The pFRY plasmid consists of an mRFP CDS which is connected to an sfGFP  CDS by a linker sequence containing an amber stop codon. The expression of the plasmid results either in red fluorescence, or - if the ncAA is incorporated at the amber stop codon within the linker site - in both: red and"

Human practices
When deciding what our human practices would entail, we faced the dilemma of what issues  concerning the society are most urgent to address and by which criteria they should be chosen. At  the end, we settled on focusing on four main goals: connecting to the professionals, reaching out to  public, engaging the youth, and addressing the ethics of both synthetic biology in general and our  project specifically.
CONNECING TO THE PROFESSIONALS
We decided to present our people to the professionals with experience in research and the industry  of biofuel and waste elimination, as well as to the other teams who are competing in iGEM in 2015.  With this spirit we have written several articles about ourselves, our project and the status of  synthetic biology in our country for the Newsletter of iGEM Amoy University team.  We held a video conference with Aalto Helsinki iGEM team, which is also working on the biofuel  problematic. We discussed our respective approaches to the problem and the mechanism of our  solutions. We also presented the project to researchers at the National Chemistry Institute in Ljubljana.
CONNECTING TO THE PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY
Our project concerning turning organic waste into biofuel is one with a great potential for  development and for eventual industrial stage. With that in mind we have realized that we would  have to visit a real life company that already does something similar, so that we can better imagine  the scale and equipment with which our project would eventually work. There are no cleaning plants  using bacteria yet in Slovenia and our project is unique in that respect, so we have decided to visit a  somewhat similar company. We  went to an algae water cleaning plant AlgEn, built within the  European project AlgaeBioGas, which aims to clean the liquid part of the digestate sediment from  nearby gasworks (dealing with processing slaughterhouse waste) to such extent that the water will  be able to flow directly to local communal water distribution system. This is the only outside  installation of this size in Europe.  They explained their work and research to us and showed us around the plant, carefully explaining  the purpose of equipment on"

iGEM-Team Yale
We wrote an advertisement for the Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 strain. The team of the university of yale connected to us and we had a skype video conference in which we talked about our projects and our teams. After the video conference they sent us the Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 agar stab agars for our project. Unfortunately, the samples didn´t arrive at the expected time (before Wikifreeze) and so we were not able to use the samples, because of the shipping process. The Yale iGEM team informed us that shipping living cells can lead to a delivery delay.
For future teams, team Yale and our team strongly recommend, not to underestimate the importance of time management. We would like to thank team Yale for the collaboration!

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html,"cent ratiometric construct for standardizing promoter output BBa_K911009
Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and meaningful data. This part not only furthers the development of ratiometric measurements in molecular biology but due to the choice of promoters and terminators it can be used to characterize the difference in activity between E. coli and B. Subtilis
Fast Germination (B. subtilis) BBa_K911008
This part is entirely novel for the registry and fully utilizes the recombination machinery inherent in the Bacillus chassis. Have spores that can germinate at a faster rate is certainly a worthy achievement and could help with experiments with B. Subtilis that any future iGEM teams may wish to perform.

Hailing from Tennessee, with a subtle Southern drawl, Saie appears to be cute and collected, but beware: even though she may be slightly on the short side, she’s full of spunk. At night, she lives a double life, staying up until 3AM befriending often clueless high schoolers as a residential advisor and sending cool emails with lots of random pictures off the internet. By day, you can find her snapchatting in wet lab, jamming out to the best of the best (aka High School Musical and the Jonas Brothers. No shame. You can admit that you like them too; she won’t judge.), all while casually inserting genes into plasmids with success. She co-leads the policy and practices subteam as well, determined to save every salmon in upstate New York. So how does she do it all? She may be busy, but don’t fear. She’ll always be there to comfort you with Netflix on those days where you want to stay in bed for 10 hours.

2.2 Gene Doping Model
First, we modeled the transit of the injected gene doping viral vectors from the injection site to the target cells. Both, intramuscular (IM) and intravenous (IV) injection methods were considered.

Detailed Compartment Model
Our model starts from the point of injection, which is either intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV). The advantage of intravenous injections is that the viral vectors immediately enter blood circulation. The means that more vectors reach the target kidney cells before they are degraded. However, intravenous injections require a qualified doctor to administer and can lead to vein damage such as phlebitis. Intramuscular injection does not have these issues. On top of this, they can supply relatively large volumes of the gene doping DNA as the muscles have larger uptake capacity than"

It is very exciting to learn what students from other country think and learn sciences and technology. Our generation not only needs to learn advanced scientific knowledge, but also requires a global mindset to promote human health and environmental sustainability.
Taipei High School Science Fair
Taipei high school science fair is held annually to facilitate high school students who are in the Science Program and Honor Math Program to exchange their science projects and innovations.
The Science Fair brought a group of young scientists together……
Through the oral presentation and poster session, we found that students from different schools have different ideas for our project. And we also think of their insight to be a valuable opportunity to learn or conceive questions we have not thought of. We seize this chance to learn how to teach people without standard knowledge of synthetic biology, and try to convey the slightest concept of biology rapid scanning.
iGEMer Community
iGEMer- we met, exchanged, shared, and learned from each other.
What have we learned?
Through various breakout sessions and discussion, we learn different projects from individual teams across Asia, ranging from treating contaminated water to diagnosing diabetes. Every team has its own unique way of designing circuits and perceptions to deal with current situations. We also learn a lot of new techniques we have never heard of in our high school times, for example, Crisper Cas9, prions, and tons of diverse RNAs. What we find is the most interesting is the Q and A time, when keen students raise critical questions, some of which we have never thought of. Between presentations, we seize the chance to promote our project to other students, or we cluster around posters asking questions that pop in our minds. What is notable is that a team (NCTU) invented a card game relevant to synthetic biology. We think the game to be amusing and assume it to become a great material in human practice. Also, we get to catch a glimpse of the progress and concoct of other teams through experience workshops. We discuss how we brainstormed our topic, how we recruit members, and what difficulties have we experienced so far. As for round table session, we consulted experts in biology marketing. This experience might come in handy especially if we want to carry out a product to all citizens."

Metabolite Exchange Reactions
We wanted to determine if the addition of any one metabolite to cell media could help promote model growth or activity. We specifically looked into the effects on maximum biomass, ATP, and reduced flavodoxin. From a Max Biomass vs. Max ATP scatter plot we generated with our data, we were able to narrow our set of metabolites to 6 sugars, including maltotriose, maltotetraose, maltose, maltopentaose, maltohexaose, and maltoheptaose.

Based on our results, we believe that the addition of any one of these metabolites to lab media can aid cell activity by providing an additional source of energy.

We are still waiting to receive the plasmid containing the zwf gene.  Apparently there are delays in the postal service.  Since we suspect that the DNA will break down, we have hired a messenger service to bring it to us early next week.
Planned activity verification experiments for when we have our clones.  We will do preliminary experiments using fluorescence, which will indicate total NADPH and NADH levels.  Since the overexpressed zwf gene should produce NADPH alone, the difference between the strains with the      insert and without the insert should indicate the increased production of NADPH in the cells.

Project Description
In Software Track’s requirements of Gold Medal, we noticed that we should address a problem that we would like to co-develop with a wet-lab team. That’s to say, this should be a collaboration where the wet-lab team posts a problem they are having and we should address the issue by creating an online software solution.
This year, 2015 USTC team selected Hardware Track. In their project, they try to send their knights composed of CACCI, SPRING and ROSE to detect those molecules which mean many antibiotic substances emitted directly into environment and endangered in human being’s health. (You could get more information about their project from here .) In detail, SPRING, as a partner of CACCI, is responsible for taking photos by Michelson Interferometer and analyzing the data from the photos, especially getting the physical quantity from the fringes produced by the interferometer.
Achievement
When the wet-lab team provides a picture took by CCD based on Michelson Interferometer, we could analyze fringes number and distance between two points selected by user, in the meanwhile, we also could assure the fringe series of the initial point.
Website for our software tool: fringe.herokuapp.com. How to use: here .
Techniques
Image Processing
Denoise the grayscale:
Choose an appropriate Gauss radius, and use Gauss filter to remove high-frequency noise.
Strengthen the fringes. Pixels of fringes are black, other pixels are white.
Remove more noise by the connectivity of pixels. We examine the 8 pixels surrounding a pixel, and we change this pixel into black if 4 or more of 8 are black. In this way, we can reduce black noise and avoid errors in calculation.
Fringe Counting
Get the line’s function by the coordinates of starting pixel and ending pixel.
List all pixels that the line crosses.
Set fringe threshold and non-fringe threshold and read the coordinates of pixels in 2.We regard it as a fringe if the number of continuous black pixels is larger than threshold and not a fringe if else. Each change from black to white represents a fringe.
Hence, we get the fringe number.

Sent email to Fikrig laboratory at the Yale School of Medicine requesting use of a plasmid. This lab recently identified and cloned a novel antifreeze glycoprotein in Ixodes scapularis and showed that it enhanced survival in the cold. Perhaps they will let us use it.
The plan is to do a proper characterization, for the first time, of the Tokyo Tech plasmid (flourescence, SDS/western, ice recrystallization activity/morphology, etc). But because we are not totally confident with how the Tokyo Tech plasmid was assembled, we may look into purchasing an AFP sequence (not from the same organism) and do some parallel experiments. Plan to meet with our advisor on West Campus  for suggestions as to what sequences we should put on the AFP.

The following eight parts in the Spring 2011 registry may be needed for our experiments: BBa_B0015, BBa_J32015, BBa_I712074, BBa_K103006, BBa_K12550, BBa_K093012, BBa_B0030, and BBa_I746200. We identified the plate and well location of all of these parts, as well as the resistance, and did a bacterial transformation in DH5-alpha cells.
Competent DH5-alpha cells were thawed on ice, and the transformation tubes were also chilled on ice. 10 microlitres of autoclaved H2O was added to each well containing the DNA that we were planning to transform. 50 microlitres of cells were added to the pre-chilled 15mL culture tubes. 1 micro-litre of the DNA+H2O was added to the cells and mixed by pipetting. Tubes were left on ice for thirty minutes. Tubes were then heat-pulsed in a 42C water bath for 45 seconds, then incubated on ice for 2 minutes. Finally, 450 microlitres of LB was added to"

Results and discussion
The measured power conversion efficiencies of the solar cell and the solar cell with various coatings is shown in figure 2.
Figure 2: Power conversion efficiencies of the solar cell, the solar cell covered with a glass slide and the solar cell covered with various biolens coatings and controls measured in real-world conditions under a solar simulator.
In figure 2, we see that the uncoated solar cell has a power conversion efficiency of around 15%. Since our cells were affixed on a glass slide, we first had to measure the impact of placing a glass slide on the solar cell, so we can distinguish the effect that our biolenses have on the efficiency from the effect that the glass slide might have. We see that placing a glass slide, the substrate, on the solar cell reduced the efficiency of the solar cell by around 1%. Once we measure the power conversion efficiency with our cells on a glass substrate, we see that the efficiency is not different from the efficiency of the solar cell covered with solely the glass substrate. The efficiency has dropped about 1% compared to the uncovered solar cell, but this is most likely due to the fact that we placed the cells on a glass substrate.                                              From this we cannot conclude that adding our cells onto the solar cells has a measurable effect on the efficiency of the solar cells.
So why do the microlenses described in literature cause a 20% increase in the efficiency and our cells do not? We think this is most likely due to our experimental setup. When conventional microlenses are placed onto a solar cell, the cells are not placed directly onto the solar cell, but there is a short distance (an ‘optical spacer’) between the microlens and the solar cell (Dal Zilio et al., 2008) . This optical spacer is at the distance of the focal point of the microlens, allowing the microlens to focus the light on the solar cell. We however, have directly placed our microlenses onto a glass slide, which was immediately placed on the solar cell. Modeling of our biolenses has shown that our biolenses have a focal point at around 1 µm behind the cell. This means that if we are able to implement an optical spacer of 1 µm, we could focus the light on the surface of the solar cells. We now put the microlenses directly on the surface of the glass slide, which has its own optical properties, therefore we did not focus the light on the solar cell, as shown in figure 3.

It is obvious that the PCR reaction failed in all cases except for reaction number 4, where a small amount of product was generated. Interestingly, amplification between the primers – as evidenced by the bands slightly above 200bp in lanes 5 to 8 – nevertheless took place in the double mutant setup.
Unfortunately only one of the eight mutagenensis expriments by PCR had worked by end of the Wiki deadline. However, since all mutants had shown considerable repressor strength in the previous genetic experiments, we assumed it safe to continue experimentation on this particular construct.
In addition, since all assembly intermediates are potentially useful BioBricks for genetic circuit engineering, we decided to subject both, the lacI gene by itself (as contained in BioBrick C0012 ) and the, as it later turned out, promoterless Biobrick I763026 to site-directed mutagenesis to produce a set of useful LacI IS mutants.

Corrosive and Noxious Reagent Safety
Reagents that have corrosive and/or noxious fumes (e.g. bleach solutions and phenol-chloroform) are kept within a chemical fume hood to prevent inhalation and physical contact.
Device Testing
To be applicable to the field, our biosensor project design requires testing with pathogenic organisms. To resolve this issue, the team developed solutions to determine the accuracy and precision of each type of biosensor without endangering the research team:
The DNA biosensor, instead of targeting a DNA sequence of pathogenic bacteria, is targeting a sequence of green fluorescent protein as a proof-of-concept.
The cell surface biosensor, which is specific to a pathogenic strain of E. coli (O157:H7), was tested using heat-killed E. coli O157:H7 cells, supported by previous research as an effective target to determine biosensor accuracy [5] . Originally, expressing the O157:H7 antigen on nonpathogenic strains of bacteria was considered, but the pathogenic nature of the antigen restricted that method of testing.
In the future, to test the biosensor's accuracy and precision in detecting real pathogens, Biosafety Level 2 safety rules will need to be implemented in the laboratory as the research group will be working with pathogenic bacteria.
None of the BioBricks produced by the 2012 Arizona State iGEM team raise any safety concerns.
Public Safety
There is minimal risk associated with the release of the aforementioned organisms. The recombinant DNA (rDNA) experiments conducted in the laboratory provide ampicillin, kanamycin and/or chloramphenicol resistance to E.coli BL21(DE3) and E.coli NEB-10 Beta to select for plasmids. Under the circumstances that any of these genetically altered organisms were released they would have minimal potential for pathogenesis. In accordance with Arizona State University’s Environmental Health & Safety policy, “Nothing in the trash, nothing down the drain”, we autoclave and bleach sterilize all waste from recombinant DNA experiments. This reduces the likelihood of accidental release.
Under the circumstances of “designed” release, the organisms and all rDNA products present no possibility of harming the outside population and ecosystem. Our iGEM team, faculty mentors, and department lab safety manager, find no foreseeable public health threat associated with the organisms and recombinant DNA project utilized by our team."

For fermentation
The first device we build is for the fermentation; we want to execute any escaped engineered bacteria from the fermenter, whether the escape happened accidentally or intentionally. We used two environment factors to monitor the bacteria’s situation: temperature and population density, thet are both high and tunable in the fermenter, so our device will initiate when temperature and density are both low. We used thermal sensitive regulator (NUS iGEM2017)(Piraner et al.) and quorum sensing regulator (MIT iGEM2004) (Canton et al.)as our sensor, with sRNA(Storz et al.) and tetR family repressor PhlF(Glasgow iGEM2015)(Stanton et al.) as the signal inverter. We added an integrase (Peking iGEM2017) controlled by the thermal sensitive regulator which will enable the promoter of a lethal gene to potentially express when temperature rise in the fermenter so that bacteria can survive at the very beginning. Also, we built a model to stimulate the minimum autoinducer required at the beginning of the fermentation, same as the purpose of integrase. This model is for keeping bacteria alive at the very beginning of fermentation. Together they form a NOR gate that will lead to cell death through genome degradation when both temperature and density decrease.
For Therapy
The second device we build is for therapeutic bacteria. The device can carry out noninvasive tracing through ultrasound imaging of the gas vesicle(Shapiro et al.), release the drug (from SHSBNU 2017) controlled by a thermosensitive regulator at nidus by ultrasound tissue heating, and heat to a higher temperature to release nuclease and kill the bacteria after it finishes its mission.
For Metabolic Stress
We applied capacity monitor (Ceroni et al.) to quantify the expression burden of all our systems, and to reduce the metabolic stress, we designed another device for fermentation which used a LuxR repressive promoter (Peking iGEM2011) and cold-regulated 5’UTR region (Ionis Paris 2017). This device only involves one transcriptional regulator, which will be less energy consuming.

Activity
Before carrying out the activity give a brief overview of the system. The circuit (Figure​ ​3​) works by taking an input of light to a light detector, the output of which controls the activity of a colour generator to produce a colour output, therefore allowing the bacterial population to reproduce an image taped to the petri dish by changing colour in the dark regions masked by the image.
Figure​ ​2:​ DNA circuit for genetic toggle switch
Figure​ ​3​: Bacterial photography circuit (a) inputs and outputs and (b) complete circuitry
Students will be given a set of proteins and DNA and challenged piece them together to construct the circuit. This exercise can be used to distinguish key biochemical processes and DNA modules (defined above).
After building the basic circuit extend the exercise with the following discussion points:
The natural function of the receptor in E coli is to respond to extracellular salt concentration (osmoregulation). How could this receptor be modified to be light responsive?
The receptor sequence is modified to contain the sequence from a light receptor from the photosynthetic single celled organism cyanobacterium to encode a recombinant receptor protein with the extracellular region from the cyanobacterium of the protein is light responsive, but the intracellular region from the E. coli receptor conserved to activate its cognate transcription factor.
In this model the proteins are already present in the cell. How is this simplification from the real cell system and why is this simplification valid?
The proteins need to be expressed by the cell so the genes would be present. These would be on plasmids expressed all the time (constitutively). Only the Beta galactosidase gene is regulated in this system therefore it is only relevant to include its DNA to interpret the circuit.
The transcription factor is phosphorylated. What do you think is the function of this modification and how does it occur?
Phosphorylation is the covalent addition of a phosphate group to an -OH containing amino acid on the protein. This changes the binding surface and/or structure of the transcription factor allowing it to make new protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions that can change the outcome of a cell signalling pathway, allowing it to act as a switch in cell signalling. Phosphorylation is by enzymes (kinases) using the phosphate from ATP. Dephosphorylation is by separate enzymes (phosphatases). The relative activity of these enzymes can in turn be regulated to fine tune activity of a cell signalling pathway.
How could you modify the circuit"
DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Trivial Trap as the line between “wrong” and “no harm, no foul” may blur out leaving the susceptible students prone to “the ends justify the means” in order to gain the respect from their supervisors. A transparency must be kept in the knowledge transition from teacher to student if utilitarianism is the prevailing mindset. This highlights the importance of open discussions on the particular topic as an integrated part of the teaching procedure and an encouragement for the students, that no question or concern is too little to be addressed.
 
Conclusion
The Synthesizer-project has many elements, which have been assessed ethically. In this context of synthetic biology, we have briefly touched upon ethics in relation to safety and teaching. The tool does have the potential to compromise safety, and in terms of ethical conduct of research, our team is aware of possible usage not intended by us designers. We have also addressed ethical elements in our teaching and highlighted preventive measures. As the project is fairly young, we expect additional ethic problems to surface and as a consequence, we are prepared to continually assess the project for ethic dilemmas.
Safety Concerns
Initial thoughts of project safety 
When experimenting in synthetic biology, we should be aware of the consequences, our actions can have. It is our responsibility to ensure the safety of the environment and the health of involved parties. A direct consequence is the need to assess potential risks, our project could inflict. Elements of relevance could be handling of chemicals and organisms, laboratory techniques, waste collection, shipping methods and even the level of expertise of individual iGEM team members.
Our team has been in close contact with safety officers management representative: Jan Martinussen and work environmental representative: Marzanna Pulka-Amin. They gave us the compulsory guided safety tour at the Center for Systems Microbiology. Highlights were the guidelines on conducting research with genetically modified organisms (GMO) and handling of hazardous materials. In complement, this section elaborates insights and suggestions of safety in project design, safety in the lab and the projects possible influence on society.
 
Safety in Project Design  - One should consider safety from the beginning!
At the initial stage of the project brainstorm, one should consider potential risks related to involved organism. The choice of organism largely affects the potential risk along with the type of protocols. Also, science departments are usually limited in their ability to house unfamiliar organisms. Lastly and important, the iGEM rules prohibit organisms from Risk"

Could this signify contamination of all ZaZar cells that were used in the transformation, such that some of the cells already had the ability to grow in the triple dropout environment without successful transformation?  This more than anything points to the necessity of verifying that we have what we expected.  We need to run colony PCR to do this.

They have to follow the rules, otherwise we have to terminate the fun experiment. One more detail is to ask them to clean their table before we handed the solution             to them, in case of they accidentally tipped the solution, nothing will get wet or broken.
Speed Up! Solution experiment, the students are trying so hard to dissolve all the salt and win. During the game, some of them questioned about the amount of salt, they are saying the salt is too much, we will never dissolve them. But             we just told them to believe the magic of the water. They are super excited when they finally dissolve all the salt. However, the losing team then saying something like our salt is more than theirs, it is not fair. After all, they are still             kids who only want to win.
WEEK TWO highlight is the purple cabbage experiment! They are amazed by the color changed of the purple cabbage experiment. But after the color changed, they become too hyped, they tried to throw everything into the liquid, for example,             glue, ink and etc. Then, they add all of them together. They are just too curios about everything.
WEEK THREE 05/18/2017

Biosolution-Reduce the Production Cost
Currently, the average time for nitrite to be reduced naturally in pickled vegetables is about 50 days. According to our model of time prediction, the time to decrease the nitrite concentration to meet Chinese FDA’s standard can be reduced to three days. Although the experiment and research cost are relatively high, it is outweighed by the cost saved during the production process which contains expense on labor, energy, water and so on.
Supply-demand Analysis
According to the above analysis, we predict that the demand of safe pickle is going to increase, therefore the demand curve moves from D1 to D2. If we could reduce the production cost and shorten the production period, the supply curve is going to shift from S1 to S2. As a result, the equilibrium goes from E1 to E4. The average price of pickle may drop slightly, bringing benefits for consumers.

Preparing materials and solutions
1. 100 mL of sodium alginate stock for bioink
Stirr 1 g of sodium alginate in 100 mL of sterile Milli-Q in an autoclaved 400 mL bottle over 5 hours at 50 degrees Celsius until a homogeneous, white mixture is obtained. Place the bottle into a microwave and pasteurized by heating to boiling point for 30 seconds at 800W. Cool it down to room temperature quickly by using a water bath. Add the corresponding antibiotic required for your specific cells in the appropriate amount and keep the bioink in the fridge until usage.
Grow your cells overnight in LB+antibiotic. If you intend to connect the cells with CsgA nanowires: please look at our model here to identify the required OD600 of your bioink.
To print without crosslinking: Spin down the cells of a 5 mL bacterial over night culture, resuspend the pellet in 100 µL of sterile LB and mix with 900 µL of previously prepared pasteurized sodium alginate by pipetting up and down and final vortexing.
1 mL of bioink can be used to print medium sized patterns on three agar plates.
Note: the solutions 2,3,4 need to be autoclaved, this can be done together
2. Sterile CaCl2 (0.1M)
Dissolve 1.11 g of calcium chloride (anhydrous) or 1.47 g (dihydrate) in 100 mL Milli-Q and autoclave the obtained solution.
3. Sterile sodium citrate (0.1M)
Dissolve 2.14 g of sodium citrate (monobasic) or 2.94 g sodium citrate dihydrate in 100 mL Milli-Q and autoclave the obtained solution.
4. LB agar plates as print surface
Dissolve 14.24 g LB agar (obtained from Sigma Aldrich) in 400 mL Milli-Q water. Autoclave.
Reheat the autoclaved LB agar in the microwave carefully until boiling point, cool down until you can hold it with your hands and add the antibiotic matching the resistance of your cells in the required amount. Make plates under sterile conditions using roughly 10 to 20 mL. Store them in the fridge upside down until usage.
Before printing, plate 500 µL of calcium chloride"

Official Profile
Welcome!  This is the official wiki of the Purdue Biomakers, Purdue’s official iGEM team since 2006.  The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is the premiere undergraduate Synthetic Biology competition. iGEM began in January of 2003 with a month-long course at MIT during their Independent Activities Period (IAP). The students designed biological systems to make cells blink. This design course grew to a summer competition, which has then evolved over the past ten years to include over 250 teams from all over the world. Student teams are given a kit of biological parts at the beginning of the summer from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells. This project design and competition format is an exceptionally motivating and effective teaching method. In 2011 iGEM expanded to include a High School Division and an Entrepreneurship Division in 2012.
2006 was the first year that Purdue participated, entering the competition with seven undergraduate members and three advisers. Purdue continued to compete for the next four years, earning bronze medals almost every year but never anything more. Due to lack of interest, financial support, and time, Purdue did not field a team in the 2011 iGEM competition. Fortunately, the team was revived with enough interest and support to not only field a team in 2012, but receive a gold medal and advance to the international competition at MIT for the first time in the team’s history.
Now the Purdue Biomakers are back again, better than ever. With more members, funding, and a focus on reaching out to the Purdue community, you can expect the 2013 iGEM team to do better than ever in the iGEM competition!

Alternatively, to Trimmomatic, Ginga also supports the use of BBmap tools. Using the Decontamination Using Kmers (BBDuk) package it is possible to search the library for the most common kmer adapters and perform trimming automatically.                   The file containing the list of adapters used can be found in Ginga’s GitHub. BBDuk standard settings were used (ktrim=r k=23 mink=11 hdist=1). Adapters based on pair overlap were also trimmed. The results showed that the algorithm was                   able to successfully trim 307 reads (0.00%) and 521667 bases (0.01%) for sample ERR2683866, which closely matches the output of trimmomatic.
Reference Alignment, Sort and Indexing - BWA and Samtools
All the samples were aligned with the hg19 human reference genome using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner, BWA (v.0.7.17) mem command . Although, the new updated GRCh38 reference sequence is available, some of the current tools of the pipeline do                   not support this reference genome. This new genome annotated reference genome will be supported in future versions of Ginga. hg19 is based on the b37 version, with some different updated patches and nomenclature (Auwera). The reference                   genome was obtained from the Broad Institute FTP Server (McKenna et al. 1297-1303). The alignment was performed using standard conditions, including no clipping and discard options. The output of BWA is a SAM file containing the aligned                   sequence.
Once the sequences were aligned the output SAM files were sorted using Samtools (v 1.7) sort(Li et al. 2078-2079).The sequences were sorted with no compression level and by default coordinates in                   the"
