We have managed to maintain the workflow as preceding flowchart mentioned in methods. Transformation of recombinant plasmids is done into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for pQE80L and TOP10 for pSB1C3, respectively. BL21(DE3) was chosen rather than TOP10 for assays, as it maintains anti-protease activity which would enable DT proteins undegraded intracellularly. In addition, BL21(DE3) is also a strain compatible for expression under T7 promoter (which is present in HT gBlock). Electrophoresis of colony PCR in the chamber utilized agarose 1% m/v soaked with TAE 1X, powered within 100 V for 30 minutes. Figure 3 and 4 shows the process of how we selected the colonies with recombinant plasmids, while Figure 5 and 6 were the final results of DT colony PCR confirmation.

Figure 4. Ultraviolet (UV) illumination of E. coli transformed with pSB1C3-DT. Red-white screening could be utilized since our team used pSB1C3-mRFP as initial backbone vector.
Figure 5. Gel analysis of colony PCR on pQE80L-DT transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3).  PCR colony primer would amplify ~250 bp bands that located inside the DT BioBrick, indicating that the DT fragment was successfully cloned into pQE80L.
Figure 6. Gel analysis of PCR colonies on pSB1C3-DT transformed E. coli TOP10. Universal flanked primers of VF2 and VR in pSB1C3 would amplify ~600 bp bands that were found in several following colonies, indicating that the DT fragment was successfully cloned into pSB1C3.
From these results, we concluded that DT BioBrick was successfully inserted into pSB1C3 and pQE80L backbone.
Confirmation Insertion of HB-EGF/Tar (HT) into pQE80L and pSB1C3
The methods for inserting HT complete fragment were quite challenging, since it must be linearly ligated in the first place prior to recombination into plasmid vector. Linear ligation of HT-1 and HT-2 fragments were conducted by using SalI restriction enzyme,"

Previously, Peking University 2015 created a PC report system by connecting a split luciferase with a dCas9 protein.{N-luc-dCas9(BBa_K1689010) and C-luc-dCas9(BBa_K1689009) }
Figure 1. Schematic of the paired dCas9 (PC) Reporter system of Peking University. A complex is formed by dCas9, split luciferase(Nluc or Cluc) and sgRNA. In the presence of target DNA, each of the complexes will bind to the specific sites indicated by sgRNA. When they approach to each other, the split luciferase will reassemble and generate bioluminescence signal.
This year, we improve this PC report system by substituting the split luciferase with split T7 RNA polymerase.{N-t7-dCas9(BBa_K2371000) and C-t7-dCas9(BBa_K2371001)} Our design has two major advantages over Peking University’s project. First, we made various types of output possible. Because the reassembled protein is an RNA polymerase, it can convert ctDNA into different types of signals, including GFP, RFP, luciferase or LacZ. Besides, with the presence of Target sequence, reunion T7 polymerase can transcribe DNA into mRNA which will be further translated into protein consistently. Therefore, the signal can be magnified over time even if the initial ctDNA concentration is undesirable.
Figure 2. The schematic illustration of paired dCas9 system(2). With the presence of target DNA, each complex will bind with pre-designed sgRNA-binding site on the sequence. When the split T7 polymerase approach each other close enough, they will become active and start transcription by adding report gene with T7 promotor in cell free system. After transcription, the mRNA will be translated into report protein like GFP and RFP which generate signal output.
Also we create two report gene pT7-eforRed(BBa_K2371011) and pT7"

Discussion
Vesicle formation
We observed vesicle formation induced in pLQ and pLQB transformants. Only few vesicle-like structures were detected in negative control cells, suggesting that mamL and mamQ are the positive determinant that induce the magnetosome-like vesicles in E. coli.
In some previous studies, it was shown that E. coli can produce vesicle-like structures without specific machinery. [8] These vesicle-like structures are called ""inclusion bodies"". When misfolded or too abundant proteins are produced in E. coli, E. coli make inclusion bodies to depredate the harmful aggregation of the proteins. We carefully compared the inclusion bodies and our vesicles. Inclusion bodies are protein aggregates so they are found as black spots (200nm~ 500nm) when examined by TEM. These are distinct from what we observed in pLQB or pLQ transformants. All of the induced vesicles contain no electron-dense materials and we could not find any black spots whose size are 200nm~500nm.
So far, we have no further evidence than the TEM images for the induction of the magnetosome-like vesicle formation. Clearly, we need more detailed characterization of these vesicles, such as the subcellular fractionation and biochemical analyses of the vesicles. The localization of mamL, mamQ and E. coli membrane proteins by immuno-electron microscope technology will also reveal the detailed structure of the vesicles.
mamB is not essential for the magnetosome-like lipid vesicle formation in E. coli
In previous studies, mamB was considered to be an essential gene for the vesicle formation of magnetosome, since magnetosome was not formed when mamB was knocked out from magnetotactic bacteria. However, in our experiments presented here, only two factors, mamL and mamQ, were sufficient for the formation of the magntetosome-like vesicles in E. coli. As mentioned above, E. coli has a mamB homolog, fieF. This protein is a metal binding factor of the cation diffusion facilitators (CDF) involved in the ferrous iron efflux. It is reasonable to assume that this protein plays an equivalent role for mamB complexed with mamL and mamQ. No clear homologs for mamL and mamQ are found in the genome of E. coli.
It is still unclear whether mamL is really required for the vesicle formation in E. coli. As we showed in Fig. 7 , we could not detect any expression of mamL by the immunoblotting"
Edinburgh,2010,Team:Edinburgh#Bacterial#Core repressilator_-_-_TEXT.html," begin to fall, the concentration of red luciferase and LacI in the system would increase in tandem.
The expression of the light luciferase, which to the observer would produce light of a visible and distinguishable colour, would inhibit the following promoter through the action of the associated light sensor. The promoter thus inhibited would repress both the following light luciferase and the following promoter, similar to its functionality in the standard repressilator.
The light sensors would act in different ways according to the peculiarities of their associated pathways. The red light sensor would absorb red photons and repress the phosphorylation of OmpR, thus inhibiting the fusion between the OmpR-dependent ompC promoter and the tetR coding sequence. The green light sensor would work in a similar manner upon the PhoR pathway and the lacI coding sequence, whilst the blue light sensor would modify the α-helical domain linker of LovTAP as a conduit for an allosteric signal upon the lambda-CI coding sequence.
The significance of our design would be in the addition of the outer network (the light repressilator), thus theoretically introducing the light signal into the cell community and realising multicellular communication. Eventually, we hoped to be able to demonstrate synchronous behaviour across populations of bacteria that communicate via light to maintain the same state in unison.
Strategy: Communication via light
The response of light receptors Cph8, LovTAP and our green light receptor to different wavelengths of light have not been fully characterised. The absorbance spectra of the light sensitive proteins ( Figure 4 ) might not exactly mirror their response to light, but should give us a good idea of their properties until this is possible.
In LovTAP, the light sensitive domain of the protein is the Lov2 domain from the Avena sativa blue light receptor phototropin. This binds flavin mononucleotide (FMN) which is its co-factor. Schüttrigkeit et al. (2003) measured the absorbance of the wildtype Lov2 bound to FMN. Since this is the active part of LovTAP, we expect our blue light receptor to have a similar response in vivo. The red light absorbing form of Cph1 is what responds to red light in Cph8. The absorbance of Cph1 was measured by Gambetta and Lagarias (2001) . Similarly, the absorbance of the green light absorbing form of CcaS, which we are planning on using in our green light receptor, was measured by Hirose et al. (2008) .

Joseph Fridman
The year was 1989. Even as the Cold War raged on, the USSR and the ideology it represented were in their death throes. In an act of desperation, the Politburo sought to develop a new propaganda apparatus, hoping that by effectively spreading pro-Soviet sentiment worldwide support for the enfeebled superpower would increase, and the tides would turn. To that end, Joseph Fridman was created. With a disarming kindness and an extraordinary intellect, he was capable of convincing anyone whom he spoke to that the path to prosperity was painted red. After a battery of evaluations, Fridman was sent to America with the goal of neutralizing it as an adversary to communism. However, upon arrival in the US, he was staggered by the wealth and majesty of the republic. After thinking it through, he decided to defect to the capitalist West. Without his assistance"

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"ehives are treated year-round with combinations of formic acid, oxalic acid and thymol. Each of these compounds has its own disadvantages: formic acid has a very small margin between concentrations that get rid of Varroa and concentrations that are harmful to bees. Oxalic acid treatment is only effective in the fall and winter. Lastly, thymol has a narrow temperature range and contaminates the honey with an unpleasant taste. Moreover, apparently these methods have failed to protect honey bees 1 . It can be concluded that our approach has to be more effective and easy to use  than current methods. Furthermore, it should not contaminate the honey, an important product for beekeepers.
Additionally, we have spoken to Bob Mulder, an expert in strategic communication at Wageningen UR. He introduced us to the ‘don’t change the consumer, change the technology’ principle. This principle dictates that for a technology to be adopted, it should require little or no adaptation from the consumer. He also agreed to become official advisor of our team.
This is BeeT's triforce. It visualizes the three most important requirements for BeeT: more effective than current Varroa treatments, easy to use for beekeepers, and not contaminating the honey.
Specificity, Regulation and Biocontainment
Based on these requirements, we decided to focus on three key aspects: specificity, regulation and biocontainment. Below, we discuss how those topic were incorporated in the final design.
Specificity
Specificity focuses on how we can make an effective treatment to Varroa that leaves bees and humans unharmed. There are many chemicals that can be used to kill mites, but most are also harmful to honey bees to some extent. Therefore, our approaches aimed for a toxin that would truly be a better alternative. When testing of the toxins, we encountered a major hurdle: Varroa mites are extremely vulnerable in laboratory settings and often die irrespectively of the treatment. To overcome this, we developed an in vitro assay for determining Varroa toxicity.
Regulation
Our regulation focused on two aspects: minimizing background toxin presence in the beehive and ensuring that misapplication of BeeT would not result in damage to beehives or beekeepers. Initially, we intended for our toxin to be present in the beehive at all times. If it is not harmful to bees or humans, what would it matter? We thought of it as a preventative measure. However, we were told by Tjeerd Blaquiere that resistance of Varroa is a recurring problem. Literature 2 told "
Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Product Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"ase enzyme from the polypore mushroom Trametes versicolor, immobilized on magnetic beads. In more detail, our mutant laccase, approximately 55 kDA in size and improved for degrading SMX, differs from the wild type laccase by three amino acids. The bulky, volatile Phe162, Phe332 and Phe337 amino acids were replaced by isoleucine residues. These modifications were suggested by the results of rational design analysis. The core of the beads, which is approximately 200 nm in size, consists of magnetite (Fe3O4) giving ferromagnetic properties to the final product. On these magnetic properties is based the recovery from the water and re-use of Biotic Blue, as it is illustrated in Figure 4.
Figure 4. The immobilization process of mutant enzymes on the magnetic bead.
The magnetite core is coated by a layer of polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) which in turn is covered by Chitosan (Chi). PSS is an ionomer and mediates the adherence of Chi to the magnetic core, since Chi cannot be adsorbed or form covalent bonds directly with the magnetite. Chi, a polysaccharide, offers suitable surface to the bead for forming covalent bonds. Although part of the Chi surface may be covered by adsorbed or covalently bind enzymes, the largest surface area is covered by Glutaraldehyde (GA), an agent used for the cross-linking of the enzymes. Cross-linking increases the capacity of each bead in regards to the number of enzymes that can bear, improving vastly its efficiency. Macroscopically, Biotic Blue has the form of black powder and can be effortlessly discerned from clean water. The powder form enables uncomplicated integration of Biotic Blue in every wastewater treatment process system and makes its operation fairly handy. As Christian Baresel voiced: “Every plant is unique, thus, it is important to have a tailor-made solution for each one. The treatment technology is based on dosing, motion, etc., and therefore the tailor-made solution makes the most impact. For example, some hospitals have infection departments, and some don’t, which requires different treatment of the waste” (Personal Communication C Baresel 20 Jun 2018).
... in the wastewater treatment process
The implementation site of Biotic Blue is the WWTP. Although the wastewater treatment process is not the same in every WWTP, in general three stages can be distinguished: the mechanical, the biological and the chemical as it is illustrated in Figure 5"

Our nickel biosensor consists of parts of the rcn-operon from E. coli, which encodes a nickel- and cobalt-efflux system. This system is highly sensitive to nickel. In absence of nickel or cobalt RcnR binds to the operator and inhibits the nickel responsive promoter. With Ni2+-ions present the repression of the promoter prcnA will be reversed, because the repressor RcnR binds Ni2+-ions and cannot attach to the DNA. For our biosensor we construct the part BBa_K1758353 by using the basic construction shown in figure 2. For this part we used the repressor RcnR under control of a constitutive promoter ( BBa_K1758350 ) and the nickel specific promoter PrcnA with a 5’UTR  in front of sfGFP ( BBa_K1758352 ) as reporter protein.

An untranslated region in front of the sfGFP, which is used for detection, enhances its expression ( BBa_K1758352 )

We tested our nickel sensor with sfGFP as reporter gene, to test the functionality of the system. Moreover we tested different concentrations. The kinetic of our sensors response to different nickel concentrations is shown in figure 3. The first five hours show a strong decrease in fluorescence. After that there is a slight increase in fluorescence. Starting levels of fluorescence are not reached. For better visualization the kinetics of figure 3 are represented as bars in figure 4.

This ideal organization of enzymes is hard to achieve with traditional linear synthetic scaffolds. However, Membrane Scaffold is two dimensional, so we can organize corresponding enzymes in desired two dimensional pattern. This again shows the superiority of Membrane Scaffold.
We are trying to organize DszA, DszB, DszC and DszD according to the pattern shown in Fig4. Due to decreased distance between those enzymes and optimized organization, the proceeding speed of Biodesulfurization pathway should increase sharply.

Literature has shown that dications (Ca 2+, and Mg 2+ ions) are effective at agglomerating PHB (Resch et al., 1998). We plan to use an iron cathode (which would release Fe 2+ ions) and a steel anode for our first electrocoagulation experiment. As a first step, we will test this electrocoagulation method using a suspension of PHB-co-HV in water. As a next step, we will use synthetic feces supernatant with no PHB as a negative control and a suspension of PHB-co-HV in synthetic feces supernatant.
PHB extraction experiments so far were carried out with microscale PHB-co-HV particles, while secreted PHB was expected to be in nanoscale. Next week, we will continue experimenting with different sonication techniques such as water bath sonicator and two-step sonications.
This week, synthesis sub-group conducted PHB production experiments in different nutrient conditions. During these experiments, no bacterial growth and plastic production was observed when PHB-producing bacteria was inoculated and fermented in water with VFA, which would be the output from torrefaction in a Mars process. This was likely due to low pH of the resulting solution and lack of required nutrients. As a result, we concluded that the torrefaction process cannot be used to extract VFA on Mars. However, it can be used to treat the by-product to recover additional water. We will revisit VFA extraction methods to find a more suitable solution.
Media for the PHB producing bacteria fermentation:
PHB production results
Synthetic Poop supernatant
PHB produced
Minimal media supplemented with VFAs (representative of the torrefaction process liquid output stream)
No PHB produced
PHB fermentation update
We also looked into bioreactor designs for the PHB fermentation step. The following types of bioreactors were considered:
Stirred tank bioreactor (CSTR) with an external cell separator
External membrance bioreacror (EMBR)
Immersed membrane bioreactor (IMBR)
Flat sheet bioreactor
Hollow fiber bioreactor

Electrocoagulation and Sonication experiments updates:
This week we tested a number of different sonication protocols including using a water bath sonicator, trying a four-step process and trying different sonication energies; the four involved removing the top phase of a previously sonicated sample"

Glasgow,2016,Team:Glasgow#beta-carotene_-_-_TEXT.html," a maximum level of 37 μg/g of carotenoids of which 25 μg/g was β-carotene. However, the actual range varied widely, from 9 to 37 μg/g [6] .  Assuming 25 μg of β-carotene per gram of rice, this would mean ingesting around 200g of rice would result in the recommended intake of β-carotene (4.8mg)
Initially Golden Rice seemed like a solution the problem of Vitamin A deficiency, however there are many doubts about the speed of degradation of pro-vitamin A after harvesting the rice and the amount of pro-vitamin A left after cooking [7] . Many environmental concerns have also been raised, as rice is a very water intensive crop [8] . Researchers believe that the traditional breeding methods have not been successful in producing rice with a high enough quantity of vitamin A, and critics have concerns around “genetic pollution”, i.e. large-scale cultivation of GM crops expressing bacterial genes that are released into the environment [9] . To avoid many of these issues, our team focused on making an alternative strategy for vitamin A supplementation that was more accessible and less environmentally demanding.
We decided to focus our efforts on producing a yogurt enriched with β-carotene, avoiding some of the issues previous projects encountered, such as large scale cultivation, degradation of pro-vitamin A through cooking and high levels of toxicity in vitamin A supplementation.  To this end we introduced 3 genes from Pantoea ananatis to produce β-carotene in the lactic acid bacteria Streptococcus thermophilus, which is used in natural yogurt production.  In parallel to this, we worked to further characterise S. thermophilus to further its use in synthetic biology and future iGEM projects, as well as designing a “self-inactivating mechanism” (SIM) to ensure modified bacteria do not survive in the human GI tract.  Finally, we created a piece of accessible hardware designed specifically to enable people in countries most affected by vitamin A deficiency to produce their own yogurt.

Sinorhizobium Selects
Biofilm formation on surfaces is an issue in the medical field, naval industry, and other areas. We developed an anti-fouling peptide with two modular components: a mussel adhesion protein (MAP) anchor and LL-37, an antimicrobial peptide. MAPs can selectively attach to metal and organic surfaces via L-3,5-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), a nonstandard amino acid that was incorporated using a genetically recoded organism (GRO). Because this peptide is toxic to the GRO in which it is produced, we designed a better controlled inducible system that limits basal expression. This was achieved through a novel T7 riboregulation system that controls expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels.

We had the chance to: 1) discuss our vision and project goals; 2) learn from their expertise and use that knowledge to further develop our project; 3) share ideas; and 4) make contacts for potential future collaborations. These encounterswere valuable (or precious) to us and helped make our project better. All these meetings have allowed us to think about integrating the investigated issues into the design and execution of our project. We want to thank all the professionals with whom we exchanged and especially thank the Rathenau Institute for all their help. During the summer, we worked with Mrs. Zoe ROBAEY from the Ratheneau institut, who was a great help for the development of our application scenarios and the techno moral scenario. If you want know more about this collaboration click the fixed menu on the left.
The application scenario
Vector-borne diseases are a major global health burden. One of the most dangerous vectors is the mosquito, which is responsible for more than one million deaths annually. After taking a blood meal on an infected individual, the mosquito carrying the pathogenic agent can transmit the pathogen to another host during a new bite. Despite intense research, vaccines and/or treatments are still needed, thus, the fight against these deadly diseases relies mostly on vector control. One of the primary sources for wide spread vector control are the usage of insecticides. However, the over spraying of insecticides impacts the environment and leads to the selection of insecticide resistance mosquitoes. Therefore, we developed a novel diagnostic device, Mos(kit)o. This kit includes a fixed or mobile mosquito trap and a biosilica cellulose composite patch, produced by silica, which was the result of using genetically, modified E. coli. It was our intent to create a device that not only classified the vector-borne viruses circulating within specific regions but also provided a tool for local agencies to identify hot spots. This would allow for better targeting of insecticide spraying and it could help address public and environmental health concerns.

Guide on high school
Tsinghua-A team 2013 have done some promotion of iGEM HS in China with the help of ITCCC (International Teenager Competition and Communication Center), a Chinese organization devoted to the promotion of science and technology competitions for young people. We went to Haidian foreign language experimental school and had a lecture about synthetic biology and iGEM, which had attracted nearly 300 students, and through this lecture we got some helpful and beneficial communication and interaction with those students. After that, we give some guidance towards their iGEM HS team’s experiment, project and competition. And in the iGEM HS 2013 competition the Haidian Foreign Language Experimental School team got an Individual Awards.
Experience sharing
Our team member Lei Wei participate the Synthetic Biology and IGEM Exchanging Meet, held by Nanjing University, on April 26th, 2013. As our team leader in the last year, he shared his experience in doing research of synthetic biology and his feelings about participating the iGEM competition. Also, as a non-biotechnology-major student, whose major is Automation, he shared his experience and feelings standing on the Automation field, which would give students attending the meet some different inspirations. We also collaborate with Nanjing-china team. As a team coming from Department of Biology, they were not so good at building model and coding, so they asked for our help to build model and code for them. They sent their circuit to us, and through our hardworking we finally sent the equations and codes back to them. They did some more work basing on our code and got the result meeting expects.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,". Of the remaining 111 projects, 18 projects were deemed not eligible for further analysis. This was either due to a lack of information regarding biosensor mechanism provided by the team or their project was irrelevant. Three projects were excluded as the sensing component of their project was unchanged from a previous project, to prevent the overrepresentation of biosensors in our database. Therefore, a total of 93 biosensors were used for analysis in our systematic review (Figure 3 and Table 1). The systematic review revealed that all biosensors could be split into four components: 1) Detector: The part responsible for detection of the target molecules. For example, riboswitches and transcription factors. 2) Processing: Adds downstream processing to a signal, which enables response turning. For example, logic gates, signal amplification and sensitivity tuning. 3) Reporter or output: Produces a response to the target. For example, fluorescent proteins and beta-galactosidase. Additionally, some biosensors may produce outputs which interact with the target molecule once it has been sensed, such as the production of degradation enzymes in bioremediation projects. We have termed these outputs as “effectors”. 4) Adaptors: If the molecule is hard to detect, adaptor components can be placed before the detector unit, to convert the target molecules to something able to be sensed by the detector component. For example, for target that degrades into an easily detectable molecule, a biochemical conversion adaptor could be placed before the detector component which enzymatically degrades the target molecule into the molecule detected by the detector module.
Figure 3: Frequency of projects based on biosensors development in iGEM.
Table 1: Percentages of biosensors components used in iGEM.
We propose that splitting these modular biosensor components into different cells, as shown below, and co-culturing the cells together, will greatly reduce the complexity of biosensor circuit development.
Implementation
To prove that our concept of splitting biosensors across multiple cells would work, we designed an IPTG sensor. The design of this system can be found in Figure 4. In this system, LacI is constitutively expressed in the detector cell and represses the production of LasI. When IPTG is added, it binds LacI, preventing repression. Therefore, in the presence of IPTG, LasI will produce C12, our first connector molecule. To determine that our system would work, it was first tested in silico. Details on the model of this system can be found on our Modelling page .

Looks like triple digest will be unlikely.  Will thus consider quadruple digest:  EcoRI has 100% activity in buffer H.  SpeI has 100% activity in buffer B.  Thus, will try to locate two enzymes that have 100% activity in either buffer, that are unique to the unwanted portion of Z0842, that will cut in a location to allow distinguishing between the strands on a gel, and that are also not present at all on pRS306.  Buffer B candidates: HaeII, NciI (cuts in 3 places on Z0842 according to constraints), XmnI.  Buffer H candidates:  none.  Best option would be NciI.  Unfortunately, all three restriction sites can be found in pRS306.  One must wonder if it is possible to run the Buffer B reaction first with EcoRI and NciI, then run it through a column to change the buffer to Buffer H and run a second restriction digest using just SpeI.  One could then run the results on a gel and ligate to pRS306.  Would this work?

The Gender Study - A Future Project
Paris Bettencourt in 2013 provided a detailed study of gender distribution in synthetic biology and iGEM. They found that women were not as represented as men within iGEM and equally there were fewer female supervisors of iGEM teams. They provided data to suggest that there is a significantly higher proportion of women to men in teams that win prizes compared with teams that don’t. They concluded their study with suggestions of how to improve the gender distribution within synthetic biology and iGEM, proposing that bonus points could given to teams with female supervisors, and iGEM should promote larger teams with more female judges, in the hope that this would improve the gender distribution within teams.
Our aim was to conduct a follow up study, looking at the distribution of male to female students and supervisors in iGEM teams in 2016. We wanted to compare the statistics to those gathered in 2013 to determine whether Paris Bettencourt’s Gender Study was successful in improving equality within iGEM. Then, if our study showed that there was a significant balancing of the distribution then it could indicate that small, impactful studies, like Paris Bettencourt’s, could be the key to improving gender distribution and diversity within the field and thus more teams should take up the mantle and work to improve equality and diversity. If, however, there was no significant improvement, then we would have to question whether this is due to a lack of follow on studies compounding the data, or if small scale studies, performed by iGEM teams, can ever be enough to make a significant change in the field.
Due to time restraints, we will be unable to undertake this follow-up gender study, however we challenge future iGEM teams, who struggle with Human Practices, to look at the impact they could make locally and nationally in equality and diversity, and perform a follow up study to Paris Bettencourt’s from 2013. We believe that iGEM teams have a fantastic opportunity to make a significant difference in this area by highlighting the work of academics and researchers at their university working to achieve greater equality, diversity and inclusivity in their field of science, or in science as a whole. We also challenge iGEM to look more at ways of improving and encouraging greater diversity, so that synthetic biology can be recognised as a positive, progressive field of science and one that acts as a representative to the individual core subjects that make it up.

During the CurLy'on project, we undertook to assist other teams and participate in meetups to spread and share the iGEM spirit!
Collaboration with Paris Saclay
One of our main collaborations was to create a 3D printed Lemon mould. We had some difficulties because it was a new technology and we weren’t familiar with it, so we had to contact a mechanics teacher to help us make the design. We also had a basic training in 3D printing in order to learn how to use the scanner and the printer.
The mould creation involved two main steps.
First, we had to calibrate a scanner in order to digitalize the lemon structure.
Figure 1 : Lemon 3D scanning
Then, we designed the mould with the coordinates given by the scanner.
Figure 2 : Lemon mould design
And finally, we printed it with a 3D printer and sent it to the Paris Saclay team in Paris.
Figure 3 : 3D printed lemon mould
With the mould, the Paris Saclay team could give the shape to their bio-lemon and they got pretty good results!

In return, they distributed our biology perceptions surveys in French schools.

Though the microdoses are smaller, the copies of DNA stay above our detection limit (40,000 to 50,000 fragments per mL) due to IM injections occuring every 20 days. While the athlete would bypass detection through the biological passport, they would be detected by our gene doping detection method.
Supplementary Results: Effect of Steady State EPO concentration on Steady State Red Blood Cell Count
To determine the quantity of EPO gene plasmids to be injected, the effect of the steady state concentration of EPO on the steady state red blood cell count is determined. This is achieved by removing the feedback loop that causes the red blood cell count to have an effect on EPO production. EPO concentration can then be set at a desired level and the PDEs used to model the system can be reduced to solvable interconnected ODEs. The resulting equations are shown below, where \(EPO_{SS}\) is the set steady state EPO concentration in the blood.

Safety questions:
 
     1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
 
     Researches could raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety or environmental safety, but we take our efforts to minimize such risks.
     First, the major part of our project is in silico simulation, which will cause little researcher safety, public safety or environmental safety issues.
     Second, during our wet-lab experiment, we took several trainings on laboratory safety issues, which include standard experimental operation, emergency management and biosafety instructions.  Such trainings will guarantee researcher safety, public safety and environmental safety.
     Third, the E.Colistrain and plasmid used in our wet-lab experiment is highly commercialized which is bought from bioengineering company.  Genes used in our wet-lab experiment are got from iGEM competition or bought from bioengineering companies.  Highly commercialized and widely used issues usually have little safety risks.  So, the strains, plasmids and genes we used will raise little researcher safety, public safety and environmental safety problems.
 
     2. Do any of the          new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
 
     None of the parts we constructed this year raise any particular safety issues that we can foresee.  Biobrick are made based on standard parts got from iGEM competition and commercialized parts got from companies.  So, there is little potential risk in raising any          biological safety issue.
 
     3. Is there a          local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
 
     Yes.  The biosafety issue of our project is          under the supervision Department of life Science, Tsinghua University.  Our protocols are submitted to the supervisors and advisors to evaluate if there is potential biological hazard.  We also had several trainings on laboratory safety issues given by the lab manager during our project.
 
     4. Do you have any          other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts,          devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
 
     When it comes to the issue of biosafety, instructions are necessary.  For the iGEM competition,"
Aalto-Helsinki,2015,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," wonderful guide Sarah from the Stockholm team also kindly gave us a tour around the Royal Institute of Technology and Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm.
Both of our teams recognized a need for better collaboration tools for iGEM teams. This led us to working on a collaboration platform, the HumHub, which team Stockholm put up. Together with them, we wrote a report on this platform, how we used it, what it could be and what we felt were its pros and cons. The whole report can be read on our HumHub report page .

Nordic iGEM Conference
Presenting at Nordic iGEM Conference 2015
The Nordic iGEM Conference (NiC) was held in Uppsala 24-26.7 Hosted by Uppsala and Stockholm iGEM teams, it was a really superb event, strengthening the Nordic iGEM community. It was really cool to meet and get to know seven other iGEM teams from across the Nordic region and hear about their projects. Besides the hosting teams and us, participants included teams Linköping , Chalmers-Gothenburg , UI Oslo , Copenhagen and SDU Denmark .The NiC also gave us a great chance to practice for the Giant Jamboree, as we held a 12-minute presentation on our project, followed by questions from the audience and the jury, formed by members from each participating team. The Uppsala and Stockholm teams had also prepared interesting workshops for the event, as well as great evening events, including a dinner and a welcoming BBQ, where our team also got to organize a get-to-know-each-other activity for participants.

Cooperation with other teams
While Stockholm was perhaps the team closest to us not only geographically, we also had contacts to many other iGEM teams.
In the beginning of the summer, we skyped with team Pasteur from Paris, exchanging thoughts on fundraising and talking about our project ideas, among other things.
Early on but with our idea picked, we also contacted Scottish teams from Dundee and Edinburgh, presenting our projects to each other. We especially discussed the approaches and issues our teams had in modeling.
The HS Slovenia team had a biofuel project just like us, and we emailed each other a lot, as well as had a Skype session to discuss our projects and whether we could find"

Using the products from their plants, GW pharma is selling a drug called Sativex (which contains an approximate 1:1 ratio of THC and CBD in an alcoholic solution) to help combat spasticity in multiple sclerosis sufferers; this drug has been legalised in several countries including the UK, Spain, Germany, Denmark, Canada, and Italy. Sativex is also being trialled for use in the alleviation of nausea in patients undergoing chemotherapy, and has proved very successful so far.
So GW pharmaceuticals could be on to something, and for more information on the biochemistry of the cannabis biosynthesis pathway, check out the footnote at the end of this article. However, perhaps a more exciting prospect for cannabinoid synthesis is being studied by the research group Hyasynth Bio. They are attempting to engineer yeast that can make any one of the dozens of cannabinoids found in the natural plant. They believe this platform could be used to supply cannabinoid compounds for pharmaceutical applications faster, cheaper, and more safely than through pharming methods!
So, it appears that Cannabis can have several uses away from the recreational scene, and may prove extremely beneficial to sufferers of diseases such as cancer and multiple sclerosis. If you want to read more synthetic biology articles, check out the rest of our WordPress site - you can find out what the Oxford iGEM 2015 Team have been up to!
The Biosynthesis of Cannabis - a little more detail
In Fig. 1 you will have seen the names and acronyms of a number of compunds, which probably say nothing about the actual pathway! So I'll try to decribe it more clearly here.
As shown in Fig. 1, there are two compounds whose expression (the amount of them that is produced in the leaf) is controlled by a specific area of the Cannabis plant genome called locus A. These two compounds acts as the ""core"" upon which other things are added, later on in the pathway. Divarinic acid is identical to olivetolic acid, except for a hydrocarbon chain coming off the phenolic ring, which in the latter is slightly longer:
As the carboxyl group (-COOH) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) are found on neighbouring carbons, decarboxylation can occur upon heating in the absence of enzyme. Therefore, the pathway shown in Fig. 1 assumes that decarboxylation occurs before the addition of geranyl pyrophosphate. Fig. 3 shows one of the routes through the pathway, using the skeletal structures of the compounds involved:

Human Practices
iGEM’s parts registry is the only current database that holds information     and DNA for over 3000 standard parts for the use of synthetic biology     community. BioGUIDE is the first designed software that organizes the     parts in iGEM spring 2010 distribution as possible atomics parts to     build new biological device and systems for specific input and outputs     based on graph theory. We are the first group who has applied a novel     algorithm to search for input/output relations between the parts to     reveal possible construct assemblies. This new approach will chance     how the parts registry is used by the scientific community. And the     availability of software implementing our algorithm with a very user     friendly graphical user"

GFP based fusaric acid biosensor
This part includes constitutive production of the phlF repressor. The repressive ability of this regulator is stabilized by fusaric acid and salicylate. The PhlF protein inhibits the immediately downstream promoter which regulates the transcription of GFP. A decrease in GFP production should therefore accompanies the presence of fusaric acid/salicylate.

Gel Extraction Protocol
The desired DNA fragment was excised from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.
The gel slice was transferred into a microcentrifuge tube. 700 µl of Buffer QG was added.
The gel slice was incubated in a water bath at 50°C for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). The tube was vortexed every 2–3 min to help dissolve gel.
After the gel slice had been dissolved completely, the color of the mixture was checked that it was yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose). If the color of the mixture was orange or violet, 10 μl 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0 would be added, and mixed. The color of the mixture would turn yellow.
230 µl of isopropanol was added to the sample and mixed.
A QIAquick spin column was placed in a 2 ml collection tube. The sample was applied to the QIAquick spin column and centrifuged for 1 minute. The flow-through was discarded.
500 µl of QG buffer was added to the QIAquick spin column and centrifuged for 1 minute. The flow-through was discarded.
750 µl of Buffer PE was added to the QIAquick spin column and centrifuged for 1 minute. The flow-through was discarded.
The QIAprep spin column was spun for an additional minute to remove residual wash buffer.
The QIAprep spin column was placed in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge and the DNA eluted by adding 30 µl of H2O to the QIAprep spin column and centrifuging for 1 minute.

Rock Ridge iGEM Human Practices in Education and Public Engagement
In order to encourage the youth in the Northern Virginia area to consider pursuing STEM careers, our team will be visiting local schools of all levels.  At these events, we will present our projects as well as demonstrate different experiments that are related to synthetic biology.  We will also lead the discussion on the benefits and problems with this technology, while also organizing a science exhibition for students that live in our area, which will be used as an opportunity to explain our project.  Through this, we hope to gather support from the community. At this event, students will able to make their own take-home science projects, play around with advanced technology, and participate in many more fun and engaging activities.  Our plan is also to visit different high schools in our area and surrounding counties, through which we hope to instill a passion of iGEM in order to entice them to join in the near future.  If they do, we will help them with our knowledge, equipment and experience for the competition.
May 1st: Brambleton Presentation:
We got to talk with our community officials and spread awareness about our project, our first steps towards human outreach.

TEAM NTU-SINGAPORE: WETLAB CHARACTERIZATIONS
With Team NTU just being next door in sunny Singapore, how could we not collaborate with them? Both teams first met in our SG iGEM Meetup, and we subsequently met up several times to finalise our collaboration plans.
Team NTU made a trip down to the BioMakerSpace for discussion!
NUSGEM helped Team NTU in 2 ways. Firstly, we gave them some CoE1 plasmids. Secondly, we validated their Adenine Base Editing project. We co-transformed 2 plasmids into the strain, sgRNA Kan* plasmid and ABE-dCas9 plasmid, and validated the constructs under 4 different inducer conditions: No inducer, IPTG, Arabinose, IPTG+Arabinose. Their system has the following proposed working mechanism: sgRNA Kan*, induced by IPTG, is a construct with a mutated kanamycin gene attached to sgRNA, while ABE-dCas9, induced by arabinose, is capable of editing and correcting the mutation on Kan* to restore the plasmid’s antibiotic (kanamycin) resistance.
The editor system is only supposed to work when both IPTG and Arabinose are present, as both SgRNA and dCas9 must be induced. SgRNA provides a guide sequence to direct dCas9 to target its plasmid, to perform adenine editing on sgRNA Kan*. To demonstrate this, we plated the cells from each condition into 2 types of agar plates with different antibiotics composition, one with kanamycin+gentamycin+chloramphenicol, and the other with gentamycin+chloramphenicol.
Results of our characterisation experiment
Top row: Agar plates with gentamycin+chloramphenicol (control)
Bottom row: kanamycin+gentamycin+chloramphenicol
Left to right: No inducer, IPTG only, Arabinose only, IPTG + Arabinose
We verified that their system works as proposed. As shown in the picture above, only the system induced by both inducers had colonies growing on the agar plate with kanamycin+gentamycin+chloramphenicol, while no colonies were observed for the other 3 induction conditions.
As our labs lack the necessary equipment to conduct RT-qPCR, we were unable to study the level of mRNA expression of our constructs. Fortunately for us, Team NTU is well-versed in this technique, having provided"

Week 22 (September 24 - September 28)
This week, we were successful in building a construct with J13002 downstream of the PetroBrick genes. First a ligation was performed, which was then transformed into competent E.coli cells. After obtaining several colonies, we performed a PCR that had bands at 2466 bp, indicating the combined PetroBrick + J13002 part, and showing that J13002 had inserted successfully! We then made overnight colonies, minipreps, and performed a restriction digest with EcoRI. After running the gel, we saw that our bands indicated successful insertion of JI3002, with bands at 2466 bp and 2070 bp. Next week, we will try to ligate NPT downstream of this promotor, so that we can eventually ligate CAR in as well and perform assays. Sadly, we still did not have any sucess in inserting OleT into a BioBrick.
Week 23 (October 1 - October 5)
We did not manage to do any significant lab work this week, as it was the wiki freeze and we spent all of our time inputting data!
Week 24 (October 8 - October 12)
This week, we managed to ligate NPT downstream of our PetroBrick that had the J13002 part we inserted. This process was very similar to that of week 22. We cut our PetroBrick and NPT BioBrick with restriction enzymes so that we could ligate NPT downstream of the rest of our construction. We then transformed this on Chlor plates, performed PCR on our colonies, getting 3135 bp that indicated successful insertion, made overnight colonies, miniprepped these colonies, and cut with EcorI to see if our insert ligated properly (yielding two successful bands of 3135 bp and 2070bp). This did not succeed on the first try, but after a few attempts over the week, we were finally able to have success. OleT still has not been successfully inserted into a PET vector. However, we now have a BioBrick vector containing the PetroBrick genes, and J13002 with NPT downstream. If we can ligate CAR into this as well, then we can start to perform assays and see how effective our construction is a decarboxylating naphthenic acids.

However, one of the primers necessary to amplify the plasmid itself, which would be necessary to incorporate the proper homologous sequence for Gibson assembly, did not arrive. Additionally, the PCR to amplify the MetA gene did not work the first time, but has been repeated. The arabinose promoter was successfully PCR'd out of the E. coli genome for both cases.  For the plasmid with YFP, the BBa_I13973, we wanted to put rhamnose inducible TrpA or TyrA after the YFP gene. We received all the primers necessary for this, but the PCR for the plasmid backbone gave several bands and was repeated at a higher annealing temperature. The results are not yet known. The rhamnose promoter was successfully PCR'd out of the genome, as was the TrpA gene. However, we lacked one of the promoters for the TyrA gene. Since there were several bands for the YFP plasmid, we did not do a Gibson assembly. Additionally, it is possible that the primers were designed for the pSB1C3 rather than the pSB1A2, but that should have little effect due to the similarities on the ends of the two plasmids. A simple digest and ligation should be able to move the part from the one plasmid to the other. We also wanted to put a IPTG inducible (BBa_K091111, LacIQ) metA gene after a GFP. The PCR for the MetA gene and the GFP plasmid were successful (although the GFP plasmid appeared as a fairly weak band on the gel), but the PCR for the LacIQ promoter failed. The initial DNA for this PCR was added directly from the parts distribution kit, and as such the composition and concentration of exactly what was added was unknown. The PCR was repeated as a cPCR on the genome, so as to at least get a usable part with the right overhang.
The final primers for the gibson assembly of the kill switch primer also arrived. There are four parts to this plasmid: the plasmid backbone, the lacI promoter, the constitutively expressed lacI gene, and the constitutively expressed RFP for easy selection. The plasmid backbone, the promoter, and the constitutively expressed RFP PCR products has been ready for several weeks, but we lacked the primers for the constituvely expressed lacI gene until now.

TALKING ABOUT OUR PROJECT
GROUP PHOTO IN NAU
With Nanjing Agricultural University
The iGEM team of Nanjing Agricultural University is extremely excellent. We were honored to have visited the beautiful campus and have organized an exchange meeting with their team. We introduce ourselves and the developmental history of our school and our team, and also presented the background, inspiration source and brief introduction of our project.
You can read about our interview script HERE!
To Wuwei Middle School
We talked with the leaders in the school meeting room and briefly introduced iGEM competition and its impact to them. They showed great interest in the competition and sought professional help from us. We proposed to help them in building teams and following up the project next year and to provide them with laboratory and teacher assistance.
We visited the creative classroom of Wuwei Middle School. The headmaster introduced the outstanding creations of the students and the patent awards to us, and highlighted the content of one of the students ' international awards.
We gave the lecture to the freshmen of Wuwei Middle School in their assembly hall. Before the lecture, we distributed questionnaires and played the relevant videos to the students. And then Professor Xiangrong Xu introduced what is iGEM, what is synthetic biology and our school’s projects in last few years and the outstanding projects of high School group. Our team members introduced this year's project to the students and finally, our leader introduced the American tour to the students. After the lecture, the students asked members about the details of the project. Some students asked Professor Xu for his autograph.
iGEM Questionnaire Survey:
We had a slight understanding on the biological knowledge level of students from Wuwei Middle School. Before we gave the senior students questionnaires, then after the talk, we recycled these questionnaires and made the statistical summary as follows:
1. How much do you know about biology?
A I don’t know anything about it.
B I know a little bit, at least I know what it is.
C I know a lot about what it is.
D I know exactly what it has to do.
 
Conclusion: Most high school students can be seen to have some understanding of biology, including plants such as algae plants, ferns, human aspects such as human respiratory system, digestive system, as well as the ecological system, the food chain, the knowledge of nature reserves, etc.

Research Approach
In examining the reporting practices, social scientists apply sufficiency and understandability to make the research a qualitative one [1] [2] .
Sufficiency is the most important part of science communication, no statement can be made without sufficient information, and only by presenting adequate information     to the audience is the audience able to make rational decision and choice. On the other hand, article with low sufficiency of information is not what     scientists, journalist and those engaged in science communication hope to compose. Science news often focus on latest research, and put less attention on     presenting multiple viewpoints [3] which may resulting in impartial reports leading audience     astray. In addition, attribution of responsibility is also important for helping the audience recognize and conceive an issue with     different aspects, while many correspondents tend to display only one attribution. Though it may give the audience with quick access to an issue, it would     help less to build the basis for further science communication. And as additional reading is given, those who are interested can search     for more information right away, decreasing the difficulty and time consumption in out reaching. In the part of sufficiency, we would consider if multiple     viewpoints and attribution of responsibility are presented and whether additional reading material is offered.
Understandability determines whether or not the encoding information can be decoding, that is, whether is in a form that they can comprehend. [4] [5] High understandability allows educated layman and     non-experts to access to information and knowledge transferred. Definition and explanation of technical term is strongly recommended by     National Cancer Institute [6] . Moreover, since today’s reader is not tomorrow’s reader, we can’t expect the     audience of carry-on learning. [7] The assistance of illustration or infographics can enhance     the audience’s comprehension of an issue7. For Newspaper and Journals in Taiwan, examination of technical terms translation can be important.

When we can actually pare down the models we have to a bare minimum. There's a whole lot of bugs and gray area still in our models and other work. I think the minimal cell projects are coming from the other end; starting blank and adding systems until it fulfills all definitions of a cell. Our work is very important, as the next step after minimal construction will be to direct modification towards a specific purpose. That will proceed much faster if the networks have already been deconstructed. - Jalvin 16:33, 4 June 2009 (UTC)
Why is DNA synthesis technology so important to the development of synthetic biology? Or is it at all?  - GMcArthurIV 00:12, 4 June 2009 (UTC)
I think improvements in DNA synthesis technology are very important to the development of synthetic biology.  With these improvements comes the ability to generate DNA code faster and at a lower cost.  Since the building blocks of synthetic biology are comprised of this DNA code, improvements in the synthesis technology go hand in hand with the development of synthetic biology. - Albergca 14:20, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

Cellular devices developed for a standard strain seem to be advantageous for many reasons.  For instance, if the devices are interchangeable with other strains and potentially other organisms, time and money can be saved by not having to redevelop the devices.  A standardized stripped down device also lends itself to the idea of abstraction and decoupling.  These minimal devices can be built up and combined into more complex devices or systems capable of achieving more complicated goals. - Albergca 14:54, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

Optogenetical AND-Gate
To achieve bacterial constructed three-dimensional structures by using light induced gene expression it was necessary to come up with a precise regulation mechanism. Our most convincing approach was to design a logical AND-gate which converts two inputs in one output. In our case, it has been suitable to use two different wavelengths as inputs to induce our output - gene expression. Only when a bacterium is hit by both wavelengths it expresses a protein, e.g. a coloured molecule, to generate a three-dimensional picture inside the gel block. Our AND-Gate is built upon light sensor systems developed and optimized by Edinburgh's iGEM-Team from 2010 and on recent results of the Voigt lab at UCSF [ 4 ].
This logical gate developed at UCSF is based on an amber stop-codon suppression through the non-canonical tRNA supD. A light-sensitive promoter induces the expression of mRNA with a stop-codon suppression coding for a T7-polymerase, which can only be translated by ribosomes, if the correct amber tRNA is present. The tRNA is expressed by a second light-sensitive promoter susceptible to another wavelength. Only if both signals are present, the expression of a protein under the control of a T7-promoter takes place. We chose blue and red light promoter because their wavelengths differ significantly from each other. Because of this construction we should be able to induce expression at desired spots only.
Light Sensory Domains
We chose the promoter that is regulated by the YcgF/E system as blue light sensor. As red light sensor we used the Cph8/phycobilin domains with the OmpR promotor. In the beginning, we also thought about using ccaR/ccaS as green-light sensor (instead of either YcgF/E or Cph8). The reason we decided to use a combination of the red and blue light sensor systems, is the great difference between the absorbtion maxima of the light sensory domains. We expect that this assembly will be the one with the lowest amount of unspecific gene expression which could occur due to overlapping of the absorption spectrums of the sensory domains.
Blue light Sensor
The domains YcgE and YcgF are endogenously present in Escherichia coli. The domains are thought to regulate the biofilm formation when E.coli is exposed in an aquatic environment. Blue light induces the dimerization of YcgF that then directly bind to the repressor YcgE and releases the repressor from the operator. The expression of YcgE and Ycg"

The great advantage that comes with these template pages is that it is much easier to maintain the wiki afterwards. Any member of your team can edit the wiki page without bothering about HTML and the layout of the page. Just let your team members know, that they always have to leave the first and the last line of code on every wiki page since these lines import the templates. Furthermore, with very little effort, the navigation can be changed by editing the page "".../Templates/Navigation"".
The extensive use of templates is not only an advangtage to the every day usage, but also in the process of building the wiki. For example, if you want to add a new banner, you just have insert an <img src=""...""> tag in the corresponding template and after saving the templates all your wiki pages will contain this new banner.
Another application for templates is the easy integration of special elements such as a ""Read more"" section. On our wiki we use this technique to give the user a better overview of the page and to find the desired content faster.

Part:BBa_K1315005 (clp)
This is the coding sequence for the cAMP receptor-like protein (Clp). This is a transcriptional activator that is normally inhibited by cyclic di-GMP. Inhibition is alleviated by the RpfG regulator (BBa_K1315003) of the RpfC-RpfG two-component system.
Usage and Biology
Quorum sensing and bacterial cell signalling are mechanisms known to be utilised by bacteria to regulate their virulence. The RpfC-RpfG sensory system has been found to activate the production of virulence factors like extracellular enzymes and polysaccharides in Xanthomonas campestris. It has been also suggested that this system is involved in linking environmental stimuli, including DSF, with pathogenicity in Xanthomonas campestris. DSF is a cis-unsaturated fatty acid from the DSF family. The RpfC-RpfG two-component system is the most well understood one and is present in all Xanthomonads. When RpfC (BBa_K1315003) picks up DSF, it eventually signals RpfG (BBa_K1315003) to degrade cyclic di-GMP. This stops the inhibition of Clp and the transcriptional activator can activate genes.

Our Project
What is MicroBeagle I hear you cry?
Well, MicroBeagle is an E.coli cell that has been modified so that it can help “hunt down” pathogens. Just like a Beagle, the hunting dog, searches for, finds, and indicates the presence of rabbits and hares, our MircoBeagle finds and points to pathogens, detecting them through physical binding, and lighting up to indicate their presence! By utilising the Cpx pathway, which responds to membrane stress (which we hypothesize would be induced by the binding event) and GFP (as a reporter) we hope to create a new biosensor that ultimately will give diagnostic results that can be seen with the naked eye.
Our MicroBeagle project is laying groundwork towards the development of a modular, general platform for pathogen detection. What makes Leeds iGEM's MicroBeagle distinctive to previous strategies used for analyte detection within iGEM is that we use physical binding as our detection mode, versus sensing of soluble analytes as has been explored in previous iGEM projects. A physical binding detection mode should be well suited to assaying for a wide range of pathogen targets, as tailored target-binding proteins or peptides can be displayed from the cell surface, allowing specific binding to the pathogen of interest.
Why is the MircoBeagle a useful device?
There could be many different possible uses for our device, as the pathogen detection mechanism we are"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Practices#DualUse_-_-_TEXT.html," need for institutional oversight is still  stated. Different points of view from experts are discussed in detail in our report. Among them is the point of view of Constantin Teetzmann, constitutional lawyer. He promotesa self regulation process involving expert advisory. Prof. Kathryn Nixdorff points out the importance of oversight and education. Prof. Alfons Bora explains the idea of reaching out to everyone conducting research and education. In addition, several advisory boards promote institutional oversight and international regulation.
Responsibility of publishing institutions
Editors are the ones making final decisions about the publication of research result. They collaborate with reviewers in the process of publication. Therefore those persons in charge should be guided by further educational courses on dual use issues and the incorporation of their needs in biosecurity guidelines. Nevertheless, this establishment can only be a part of the progress of responsible oversight.
“To try to prevent misuse at the publication level serves no purpose, this is too late. By then, detailed knowledge about the contents of the publication is already known to collaborators, and the work has in most cases been presented at meetings. (…) The point of oversight and application of mitigating measures must begin at the planning stage and continue throughout the experimentation process until the work has been completed. This is why the risk assessment your Bielefeld-Team proposes is so important. Identify risks at the very beginning and find ways to mitigate those risks before any risk-laden methods become public knowledge.”
Prof. em. Kathryn Nixdorff (Department of Microbiology and Genetics, Darmstadt University of Technology)
Responsibility of the researchers
Because up to now no legal restrictions apply, the researcher himself is making the decision in collaboration with ethic councils, whether the benefits of the research outweigh the risks, whether there are ethical or moral reasons not to investigate the question of concern and whether the results can be (partly) published. The decision is made at the planning stage. This moral reasons need to consider the consequences of science – such as application in pharmacy, medicine and other fields ( DFG/Leopoldina, 2014 ).
Conclusions
While we were unable to include a deep ethical analysis in a report of this size, the summary of ethical questions points out the necessity for the implementation of the dual use issue in research at the very beginning. The education and advisory of young researchers is a key step towards this goal. Only if the awareness of the dual use issue is implemented in education, researachers can participate in an ethical discussion. To ensure these progresses, advisory institutions, such as ethical commissions, need to be established. While the optimal solution would be international"

Dialogues with law expert, Ms. Fang Ruan
We want to have a better understanding about law and regulation actuality in China. Meanwhile, We have great interest and also are concerned what will happen if synthetic biology is applied to human being. Sooner or later, based on the development of gene therapy, the technique used to modified human being will come true. However, what should we do to guarantee the safety? And is there any law about gene technology? Based on our concern, we have a talk with Ms. Fang Ruan, a judge from the People's Court of Jinjiang, China. She has great experience in judicial work in Intellectual Property Law. In the conversation between Jilin_China and Ms. Fang Ruan, she provided us with a full-scale perspective of gene technology law in China.
The following 4 questions are answered based on our conversation.
1. In China, what are the existing laws concerning gene technology?
The legal aspects of gene technology in our country, embodied in science and technology law，which is an important part of our legal system. Science and technology law refers to the state of science and technology activities arising from the various social relations to adjust the legal norms.
China has developed a number of technical and legal norms on encouraging innovation, safeguarding inventions and patent rights. In the Constitution, we mentioned that science and technology are part of the productive forces, in addition, the state has also formulated the "" Science and Technology Progress Law of the People's Republic of China"", "" Patent Law of the People's Republic of China "" and so on, all of these have a great impact on gene science and technology.
""Science and Technology Progress Law of the People's Republic of China"" is the basic law of our country, however, there are the protection of intellectual property rights and scientific and technological achievements reward of the laws and regulations related to gene technology,, such as "" Patent Law"", the legislation of scientific and technological research institutions and the management of science and technology associations, such as the ""Natural Science Research Institutions to establish, adjust and approve the pilot scheme"", there are also some international scientific and technological exchanges provisions, international treaties and agreements.
2. How popular is the law on gene science and technology nowadays? Whether it is necessary to increase the publicity？
The concept of scientific and technological law is first proposed by the Chinese people. But our development is extremely slow. In recent years, the United States has established more than 100 research centers of various types of technology, published dozens of specialized magazines, nearly a thousand kinds of monographs. Taiwan in recent years has also set up seven"

Mathematical Formulation
The activities of a gene are regulated by other genes through the interactions between them, i.e., the transcription and translation factors. Here, we assume that this system follows Hill kinetic law.
<math>\begin{align} \frac{dm_{i}}{dt} &=-a_{i}m_{i}+\sum\limits_{j}b_{ij}\frac{p_{j}^{H_{ij}}}{K_{ij}+p_{j}^{H_{ij}}}+l_{i}, \\ \frac{dp_{i}}{dt} &=-c_{i}p_{i}+d_{i}m_{i},  (i=1,2,...,n) \end{align}\,\!</math>
where <math>m_{i}(t), p_{i}(t)\in {\mathbb{R}}</math> are concentrations of mRNA and protein of the <math>i</math>th node at time <math>t</math>, respectively, <math>a_{i}</math> and <math>c_{i}</math> are the degradation rates of the mRNA and protein, <math>d_{i}</math> is the translation rate. Term (1) describes the transcription process and term (2) describes the translation process. Negative and positive signs of <math>b_{ij}</math> indicates the mutual interaction relationship that could be attributed to negative or positive feedback. The values describe the strength of promoters which is tunable by inserting different promoters in gene circuits. <math>H_{ij}</math> is Hill coefficient describing cooperativity. <math>K_{ij}</math> is the apparent dissociation constant derived from the law of mass action (equilibrium constant for dissociation). We can write <math>K_{ij}=\left( \hat{K}_{ij}\right) ^{n}</math> where <math>\hat{K}</math> is ligand concentration producing half occupation (ligand concentration occupying half of the binding sites), that is also the microscopic dissociation constant"

D. degree in molecular and cell biology at the Dartmouth College, school of medicine. During his Ph. D. training, he made a systematic study of hematopoietic differentiation, GATA 1 transcription factor and leukemia, and published many research articles at high-impact journals, such as Nature Genetics, Blood, Cancer Cell and Genes Dev. In 2009, he became an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and continued his research at the differentiation of hematopoietic system and the molecular mechanism of leukemia and cancer biology. He has established a variety of animal models, made outstanding contributions at the pathogenesis of cancer research and treatment, and he has received many national funds in the United States, so that his research has been well funded.
Professor Li introduced the current research trends of tumor prevention and treatment, made in-depth discussions for cancer stem cells, tumor biomarker, the relationships between the tumor and inflammation. In addition, professor Li also talked about his expectations for good students, which are “motivation”, “detail”, and “attitude”. Professor Li is an excellent scientist, and we would like to follow his path and make our contribution to the scientific research.
2.Law & Regulation
Law & Regulation about gene science and technology
For this project, we modified some genes using techniques of synthetic biology and constructed a recombinant plasmid. The Bifidobacterium transformed with this plasmid can settle in the tumor regions, and secret the apoptin protein, and kill tumor cells. This could potentially be developed into a novel therapy method for the treatment of tumors. To a certain extent, gene modification is gene therapy, and our project is about gene therapy to tumor cells, imperceptibly we may put ourselves in the center storm of ethical and juristical issues. Therefore, to have a deeper perspective about the ethical and juristical issues in China, as well as to better understand the potential biosafety issues of our project, we discussed some questions with two experts in law, Ms. Fang Ruan, a judge from the People's Court of Jinjiang, China, and Professor Zhipeng He, Jilin University School of Law. They shared with us their insights and a great critical thinking of moral and ethical issues. Thanks for their generous help and assistance; we get a complete result in the Human Practice.

Functionalized biotinylated and biotin-binding membrane proteins
Our membrane proteins (also referred to as 'receptors') enable the polymerization of cells into three-dimensional cellular matrices during bioprinting. Therefore, our receptors present biotin or biotin-binding proteins on their surfaces, and - being co-injected with a biotinylated linker peptide into streptavidin solution - immediately 'glue' to each other by the means of synthetic biology, allowing printing of defined three-dimensional cellular structures.
Figure 1: A) Schematic depiction of the modular structure of the created genetic receptor constructs.  B) Schematic depiction of the modular structure of the membrane receptors for cross-linking of cells via biotin-streptavidin interactions.
The following extracellular domains were constructed and tested:
1) A biotinylated receptor containing an extracellular biotin acceptor peptide that is endogenously biotinylated by a coexpressed biotin ligase (BirA) and thus presents biotin groups at the cell surface.
The biotin acceptor peptide (BAP) is a 15 amino acid peptide sequence originating from E. coli. [1] Being biotinylated by the biotin ligase BirA at a lysine residue within the recognition sequence, it mediates the functionality of the receptor by presenting biotin, allowing the interaction of the cell surface with streptavidin in the reservoir solution.  The biotin ligase BirA is therefore encoded by the same vector as the receptor, with an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) allowing translation of two open reading frames (ORFs) from a single bicistronic mRNA. BirA is targeted to the ER via an Igκ signal peptide and trapped via an ER retention signal (C-terminal KDEL-sequence), allowing it to efficiently biotinyl"

Figure 3. Comparison between the fluorescence expression levels of phlFp with and without TetR transcription unit Negative control represents BBa_E0240. This result was obtained by combining 3 characterization data obtained in 3 different days. Error bar present SD from 3 biological replicates.
Our results showed that there was no significant differences between the fluorescence activity of phlFp with and without the LacI transcription unit. Therefore, it is likely that the crosstalk between LacI and phlfp in our system is very low. As for crosstalk between TetR and phlfp, we were unable to draw any reliable inference from our results due to a great variation in measurement . Due to time constraint, we did not repeat the characterization.

where $\phi(r, t)$ is the density of the diffusing material at location r and time t, and $D(\phi, r)$ is the collective diffusion coefficient for density $\phi$ at location $r$; and $\nabla$ represents the vector differential operator.
If the diffusion coefficient does not depend on the density then the equation is linear and $D$ is constant. Thus, the equation reduces to the linear differential equation: $$\frac{\partial \phi (r,t) }{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 \phi(r,t)$$
also called the heat equation. Making use of this equation we can write the pheromones chemicals diffusion equation with no wind effect consideration as:
$$\frac{\partial c }{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 C = D \Delta c$$
where c is the pheromone concentration,  $\Delta$ is the Laplacian operator, and $D$ is the pheromone diffusion constant in the air.
If we consider the wind, we face a diffusion system with drift, and an advection term is added to the equation above.
$$\frac{\partial c }{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 c - \nabla \cdot (\vec{v} c )$$
where $\vec{v}$ is the average velocity. Thus, $\vec{v}$ would be the velocity of the air flow in or case.
For simplicity, we are not going to consider the third dimension. In $2D$ the equation would be:
$$\frac{\partial c }{\partial t} = D \left(\frac{\partial^2 c }{\partial^2 x} + \frac{\partial^2 c }{\partial^2 y}\right) – \left(v_{x} \cdot \frac{\partial c }{\partial x} + v_{y} \cdot \frac{\partial c }{\partial y} \right) = D \left( c_{xx} + c_{yy}\right) - \left(v_{x} \cdot c_{x} + v_{y} \cdot c_{y}\right) $$
In order to determine a numeric solution for this partial differential equation, the so-called finite difference methods are used.  With finite difference methods, partial differential equations are replaced by its approximations as finite differences, resulting in a system of  algebraic equations. This is solved at each node $(x_i,y"

When defrosted, 9 microlitres of the plasmid DNA was transferred to new Eppendorf tubes. 1 microlitre of dye was then added to the new Eppendorf tubes. The tubes were then lightly centrifuged to make sure the dye and the plasmid DNA had mixed at the bottom of the tube.
An Eppendorf tube containing the standard DNA ladder and dye was added to the rack, in the first entry of the row with the 'DNA + dye' tubes following afterwards (in order of 1-10). This was then taken over to the gel electrophoresis tray.

The simulation results indicated S had two values which represent the two stable steady states. In our design, the initial state for toggle switch depends on the phase of oscillation when the DNA sequence is inverted. We found that the oscillation with a fixed point attractor that is far from the separatrix of toggle switch was more likely to result in one steady state when the fluctuation of gene expression becomes weaker and weaker and that the oscillation with a limit cycle attractor that crosses the separatrix was more likely to form bistability in population level (Fig. 7). In deterministic model, the steady state of a single cell in design 1 depends on the time when the site-specific recombination happened (Fig. 8). And the stochastic simulation predicts similar behaviors, however it is not always consistent with the deterministic simulation, especially for those cases that oscillations stop at a phase near the separatrix of toggle switch (Fig. 9).
Figure 7. Coupling in design 1. The red trajectory represents the gene expression dynamic in the phase space (lacI, cI). The dash line is a separatrix. The toggle switch with initial state above the separatrix will settle to one stable steady state, whereas a toggle starting below the separatrix will settle to another stable steady state. The left figure shows the situation with $\beta_1=(30,15,20)$. The right figure reveals the situation with $\beta_1=(60,30,40)$.

4.3 Design 2
In design 2, we also paid attention to some characteristics of parts. The pluxR promoter gives weak basal expression independent to the present of AHL. Such a leakage contributes to the formation of positive feedback. The weaker the basal expression of LuxI is, the longer the delay of positive feedback is. If the basal expressive of LuxI is too weak, AHL cannot accumulate in the cells leading to a very low steady state (Fig. 10). The delay may result in bistability when we observe the cells in population level.

The residual volume calculated was 61.35 microL, what corresponds approximately to 9,2% of the initial volume on reagent chamber. The percentage of flow to this chamber from the Virkon chamber must be nearly to the percentage obtained to the residual volume. Calculating the volumetric flow using the same viscosity and channel section area as before, but with a tube lenght of 18,4 mm, we obtained approximately 42 microL per second, what is 7,7% of the volume flow to the reagent chamber. Since this percentage is near enough to the volume percentage lasting on the reagent chamber, we consider the connection between these reagent chambers appropriate to sanitize those compartments.
Fabrication and Tests
We are currently fabricating the device using PDMS photolithography technique for the thin layers and PDMS molding for the thicker ones. The molds are made from teflon structures with metal cylinders, like on the figure below:

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"ic acid is also added as it can be used as a source of folinate for the synthesis of f-Met; the amino acid required for initiation of translation in E. coli. Magnesium and potassium ions are also added as supplements. Both ions are ubiquitous in cells with many functions in protein synthesis, namely aiding translation by associating with ribosome subunits and stabilising RNA (Nierhaus, 2014; Pyle, 2002). While magnesium ions are essential for protein synthesis, at high concentrations they can cause inhibition of ribosome translocation and hence inhibit protein synthesis (Borg & Ehrenberg, 2015).
Previous research has shown that the concentration of some components of the supplement solution are crucial for efficient protein synthesis, and that for each batch of extract produced the optimal concentration may need to be found (Yang, et al., 2012). Studies which have explored this have only focused on, at most, a few components at a time (Garamella, et al., 2016; Kelwick, et al., 2016), which means that important interactions between the components may have been missed.
Multifactorial Design of Experiments
Traditionally, biologists tend to use One Factor At a Time (OFAT) approaches to determine the effect and importance of factors on a system. This method can sometimes be a poor choice. By only determining the effect that a single factor has on a system at a time, important interactions can be missed. For example, removing only factor A may have no effect, and removing only factor B may also have no effect, but removing both may cause an adverse effect. Therefore, it is important to take a multifactorial approach when investigating the importance of conditions or components of a system, or when trying to optimise a system. An issue with this approach is that a large number of experiments may be required to fully investigate all factors. By using statistical methods, a Design of Experiments (DoE) can be determined which has the minimum number of experiments required to explore questions such as the importance of factors in a system. This approach also allows for robustness testing or determining batch-batch variation (Anderson & Whitcomb, 2010). As mentioned previously, CFPS systems can be plagued with issues rising from variation, so this approach offers a method to investigate the causes. There are several different types of DoE designs. One of these is the screening design (SD), which is used to create experimental designs to determine the factors with the highest effect on a system. Another design is the surface response design (SRD), which makes experimental"

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

In Vivo Sensors
Surveillance of key physiology factors is indispensable for a good understanding and optimization of metabolic processes in compartments. In comparison to in vitro measurements, in vivo sensors have major advantages in terms of measure relevant physiological properties in living systems. Former methods required destructive assays, expensive and time consuming preprocessing of cells or compartments to determining fluxes inside cells Frommeret al. (2010) . This leads to inexact measurements with poor spacial and temporal resolution. The usage of in vivo sensors tackles all of these problems at once. They allow detecting fluxes inside the cell and compartments in real time and supersede difficult and time consuming cell and organelle extraction.
Sensors
To enrich our toolbox we decided to measure four essential physiological factors: ATP, NADPH, Glutathione and the pH.
ATP/ADP conversion is used as an energy currency in many cellular processes like translocation of proteins and metabolites or anabolic and catabolic turnovers. It is assumed that ANT1P an ATP/AMP antiporter is located in the peroxisomal membrane. Further the shuttle mechanism of the peroxisomal protein import machinery is ATP dependent (Palmieri L. et al., 2001) . NADPH plays an important role in anabolic pathways and is also indispensable to our desired pathways of nootkatone and violacein. Glutathione is an antioxidant and redox buffer which is also found in yeast peroxisomes. It is used as cofactor by at least two types of peroxisomal proteins the glutathione peroxidases and glutathione transferases, which reduce lipid- and hydrogen peroxides or transfer glutathione to lipid peroxides for the purpose of detoxification (Horiguchi H. et al., 2001) . Furthermore, it partly represents the redox state of the peroxisome. Knowing the pH of a compartment is important to predict the activities of almost all enzymatic processes inside and to follow up acidification and basification upon conversion of metabolites.
We finally chose two ratiometric sensors to perform measurements with. The pH sensitive and glutathione redox state reporting green fluorescent proteins pHLuorin2 (Mahon M. J. et al., "

Schematic presentation of the plasmid purification. By coating the top of a chip with biotin (triangle), we can bind zinc-fingers coupled to streptavidin from cell extracts. The zinc fingers in turn can specidfically bind to plasmids carrying the zinc finger target sequence.
Plasmid Purification
As described below, the plasmid purification depends on zinc-fingers which bind to special sequences on the DNA. By using fusion proteins of zinc fingers with streptavidin, we can pull out the desired plasmid bound to the zinc finger on biotin-covered surfaces.
We selected three zinc fingers which are reported to bind strongly to their respective binding sequences.
We decided to use the following zinc finger proteins to bind our plasmids, since they were reported to work well and have a strong binding affinity:
C7C7 (source: mouse transcription factor, Liu et al., 1997)
K230R (source: de-novo design against human CCR2 / CCr7, Lee et al., 2010)
ZFN-L (source: de-novo design against human CCR5, paper: Lombardo et al., 2007)
We integrated the respective binding site for each zinc-finger-streptavidin fusion protein (from now on referred to only as zinc-finger) behind the promoter of the respective zinc-finger, so that binding of the protein will partially inhibit its own transcription. This will prevent over-production of the zinc-fingers in the bacterium, as we only need as many copies of the protein as there are the plasmids that contain them.
