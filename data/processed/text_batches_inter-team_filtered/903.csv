Today, we had a short discussion about some of the points discussed on 16.03.16 with our iGEM advisors to decide which were viable routes to pursue, and which would likely not work or take far too long.
We also had a tour around the main biology lab, and were introduced to the equipment and machinery we will be using.

Today we discussed the medal criteria and outreach ideas.
These ideas include talking with experts in the field, holding introductory workshops in schools to introduce children to synthetic biology and running stalls at science fairs.
Potential ideas:
Synthesizing a microportha virus
Kill switches evolutionary stability, potential to oscillate a kill switch (genetic clocks)
Synthesizing PAF with E.Coli and combating fungal diseases in plants

We mostly focused on how to develop a good grounding for our human practises. We want to educate people about synthetic biology. We also set up a YouTube channel to allow us to start uploading videos.

We have decided to do daily vlog to recap our progress throughout the day.
We discussed the kill switch idea more in depth, looking at the possibility of using a lab grown amino acid to trigger the kill switch.
Above an idea relating PAF and repressilators can be seen.
We identified resources that we could offer for our collaborations. Our main specialties include: modelling and data processing, some specialised equipment and mentoring new teams.
We also began to identify key academics and companies we can establish connections with to better inform our project, and develop a deeper understanding of the synthetic biology involved in kill switches, antifungal proteins and repressilators.
At this point in time, we have been in contact with teams based in: Leiden, Newcastle, Cardiff and Costa Rica. We are hoping to set up Skype meeting with them in the near future.

Today we looked at Astro Synbio, an educational web series about synthetic biology and space, and developed the idea of creating an episode of our own that could include developing rocket fuel, terraforming, soil purification (allowing a collaboration with Leiden), water purification, crop growth and food in space. For the rest of the day we started creating the iGEM wiki and learning basic HTML.

3' UTR Format
These are taken verbatim from available databases and laboratories after checking for cut sites. Mutagenesis of these sites typically has few ramifications. See the article on 3' UTRs for more information on why.
Future Project Ideas
We realize that the idea of working with an organism other than the familiar E. coli chassis is probably an challenging prospect for a lot of teams, especially when it comes to the design phase. We came up with a lot of ideas that only seemed apparent after we had done a great deal of research on the worm; many of them are foundational advances that are analogous to things that can be done currently in bacteria, and would be crucial to making C. elegans a fully-viable system. We've put the most lucid bunch of these ideas here, with the hope that it would help jump-start other teams and make their work less daunting.
""Backward compatibility"" with E. coli
Exosymbiosis. Attaching the bacteria to the outside of the worm (using lectins?) on a surface-disrupted mutant. This may require bacteria that don't emit the usual nutritive signal. The BactoBlood team went to some length to try and perfect such a bacterium, and since we're not talking about putting things in people, their work may be applicable here. An extension of this might be found in enabling the bacteria to attach or detach from the worms under certain circumstances, creating a bacteria distribution and relocation mechanism. Such a project would need to look out for the potential of covering the amphid or mouth, which some bacteria do naturally as a means of killing worms.
Enterosymbiosis. There are cases in nature where nematodes and bacteria have learned to work more or less together, in which the bacteria reside in the worm's gut. Studying Xenorhabdus nematophilia, Photorhabdus luminescens, and the Heterorhabditidae worms and trying to create something similar between E. coli and C. elegans; also look into bus mutants.
Messaging in the worm
Inter-worm signalling. The C. elegans excretory gland normally produces some pheromones that are used for communication between worms; so do anus and vulva. Could we engineer these organs to produce and excrete some new molecule? The potential secondary applications are extensive. We haven't been able to find much literature on these topics, but the prospect is alluring.
Hormones. The pseudocoelom bathes most tissues, and it's believed that the worm has a number of hormones"

Figure 1. Effects of microcystin-LR in eukaryotic cells.
Stress Promoters
Various articles [4,5] indicated that oxidative stress increases the activity of certain transcription factors in S. cerevisiae cells. Two transcription factors activated by oxidative stress are  Skn7p and Yap1p. These transcription factors have specific binding sites in the promoter areas of genes that respond to oxidative stress. Skn7p binds to OSRE (oxidative stress response element) and Yap1p binds to YRE (Yap1p response element). Some of the best characterized promoter regions that these transcription factors bind to are those for the genes tsa1 (thioredoxin peroxidase) and ccp1 (mitochondrial cytochrome-c peroxidase) [5]. The gene that was reported to have highest response against microcystin was ctt1 (cytosolic catalase T) [2]. We chose to look into these three promoters more deeply, and this led us to the idea of creating a sensor by fusing one of these promoter areas with fluorescent protein production and implementing this in S. cerevisiae.
This sensor would produce a fluorescent signal when the activation of the transcription factors Skn7p and Yap1p has been induced â€“ in other words, when the S. cerevisiae cells encounter stress. As microcystin is a rather effective stress-generating factor, and as most sources of oxidative stress (such as xenobiotics and heavy metals) are rare in nature [6], we can assume that it is the main stress producing factor found in Finnish lakes. This leads to our hypothesis: fluorescent colour produced by our engineered S. cerevisiae is proportional to microcystin concentration in measured water samples.
Transporter
An important prerequisite for the function of the stress promoters is that the toxin must be imported into the cell. Microcystin-LR doesnâ€™t pass the cell membrane without the help of specific transporter proteins. In human liver cells, the membrane bound OATP transporter (organic anion transport peptide) was identified to imports MCs into the cell. OATPs belong to the superfamily of solute carriers and mediate the uptake of endogenous compounds such as hormones or bile salts but also a variety of xenobiotics. [7] In yeast, the QDR2 transporter has a similar function. [8] It has a broad substrate specificity and can transport many mono- and divalent cations as well as a variety or drugs. [9]. "

Thursday
Two deliveries today, one from our Yale contact and one from Starlabs . On the one hand, enough fluoride related bacillus to make us a couple of biobricks, on the other, enough tips to last us a lifetime. Thanks, you two!
Not all the day was so joy filled though. After growing up our streaked out bacillus, they have turned out to be e.coli. This makes our assessment that our original assessment was to hasty itself too hasty, which, while gratifyingly meta, is none the less frustrating. We're now going to try and debug our Gibson and PCR, and will probably try to rerun the vector fragments that only seemed to partially work.
Furthermore, the plates that we made for our (hopefully) transformed e.coli have nothing growing on them, meaning we probably will have to start from the beginning.
The PCR from yesterday has, however, worked! Having everything in place to perform a Gibson transformation to produce our fluorescent construct, we performed said reaction and transformed it into some TOP10. I will reserve judgement on this until next week.
Friday
It would appear that our isothermal reaction buffer was not correctly mixed, meaning all our Gibson assembly reactions had no chance of success. Having remixed the buffer, we now hope that the Gibson should work properly.
Unfortunately, we have now wasted all our TOP10 e.coli on non-functional Gibson assemblies, so now we have to create many more competent e.coli. Consequently, Jolyon got onto ordering all the materials we will need for electroporation, TOP10 being prohibitively expensive for a puny undergraduate research project.
We have also discovered that the primers for mOrange and luciferase vector (pSB1C3) have been mixed up due to incorrect labelling- that has probably caused all our problems with amplifying up the two over the past week. Nonetheless our new mOrange reversed primer has arrived, so with the corrected labelling and revised primer the mOrange has been amplified up successfully.
So the faint bands we had on Tuesday for the luciferase vector were probably not our desired product afterall, but learning our lesson from attempting to PCR pSJ150 backbone, Tom has designed split primers for the luciferase backbone and they should be delivered on Monday. With those and the correctly labelled primers hopefully we will obtain the right product"

GFP-Sporobead Evaluation
For creating fusion proteins for the Sporobeads, the genes gfp, cotZ and cgeA were amplified and brought into Freiburg Standard. The restriction site NgoMIV was inserted just after the start codon of the genes of the spore crust proteins. Since this restriction site adds six additional base pairs, the resulting genes are two amino acids longer ( CotZ , CgeA). Since there is no way of knowing if this insertion has any effect on protein expression, we created an additional truncated version. The deletion of the six base pairs downstream of the restriction site resulted in fusion proteins that were two amino acids shorter than the constructs above (derivatives of CotZ-2aa and CgeA-2aa).
Afterwards, we first fused both versions of cotZ to its two native promoters, PcotV and PcotYZ, and to PcgeA. For the two cgeA variants, we only used the native promoter PcgeA, and PcotYZ, the stronger one of the two promoters of the cotVWXYZ (for more details see crust promotor evaluation ). In addition gfp was ligated to the terminator B0014 . After sequence confirmation, we fused the cgeA/cotZ- and gfp-constructs together, applying the Freiburg standard to create in-frame fusion proteins. This way, we created C-terminal gfp fusion to both spore crust proteins flanked by the promoters and terminator above.
Since we want to display the fusion proteins on the surface of B. subtilis"

Presentations and ideas concerning potential topics can be collected in a dokuwiki . This might also be useful for the organization of your project.
To handle the huge amount of work, you should split up to smaller teams of specialists.
Tasks which should be assigned to the team members are:
- Finances
- Sponsoring
- Safety issues
- Human practice
-overview of formalities and time.
The whole team should meet every week to exchange news of the smaller teams of specialists.
Here you can find useful information: Synbioreview and lecture videos.
On this website iGEM gathered a lot of helpful advices.
Before sponsorship money can be raised, you need a banking account at your university. Arrange enough time for bureaucracy procedures!
Contracts for different types of sponsoring and donations have to be prepared.
As the bureaucracy is elaborate (we had 5 different banking accounts for different types of money) the support of an office assistant is essential.
As creating an own wiki isn't as easy as it may look like at first glance, you should start working on it a least one or two months before the wiki is frozen. Also you should look out for a person or another iGEM team that introduces you to html code.
Flights should be booked in time since the prices will raise from August on. If you don't have enough money, book the number of flights that you are able to pay. Later, if you might have received more money, you can book flights for more team members. Be aware that flight tickets have to be personalized.
Keep also in mind that you need a valid pass port. In Germany the processing time may take up to 4 weeks.
The ESTA has to be requensted 72 hours before your flight.

WORKSHOP
We hosted an ethics workshop for the Danish iGEM teams on the 21st of August. We thank Nanna Kongsholm, Andreas  Christensen and Sune Holm for making some great presentations embracking the topic of ethics and synthetic biology down to a level for someone not experienced in ethics and for giving us some tools for how to write an ethical essay. The workshop was really succesful and all the teams got to start discussing their ethics profile.
You can finde the program and abstracts for the presentations below.
Program:
9-9.10: Introduction: Brief presentations of iGEM projects
9.10-10: Philosophical approaches to ethical issues concerning new biotechnologies (Nanna Kongsholm)
10.10-11: Safety, risk and precaution (Andreas Christensen)
11.10-12: Writing an essay on ethical and societal issues in syntetic biology (Sune Holm)
12-13: Lunch
13-15: Group work for the iGEM competition with Nanna, Andreas, and Sune
Abstracts:
Philosophical approaches to ethical issues concerning new biotechnologies (Nanna Kongsholm)
How do we decide whether a new biotechnology is  morally ’right’ or ’wrong’? Can a new biotechnology be ’right’ in one respect, and ’wrong’ in another? This talk will present three classical theories in moral philosophy, and show how they may be applied to the ethical discussion and evaluation of emerging biotechnologies.
Safety, risk and precaution (Andreas Christensen)
""Is it safe?"" is possibly the most common question people ask about new technologies. The aim of this talk is to provide a better understanding of one important aspect of safety, namely uncertainty - the phenomenon that we do not know what will happen if we develop a technology or if we apply it in this"

We would also like to thank Dr. Maurice LING from AdvanceSyn, who helped us perform sensitivity analysis using the AdvanceSyn Toolkit, a suite of open-sourced tools for model development and model analysis with an emphasis on systems biology, synthetic biology, and metabolic engineering.
PART 6: COLLABORATIONS
Collaborations have undeniably opened up more possibilities for our project.  This year, we are very grateful to build meaningful collaborations with 4 teams: Team CUHK 2018 , Team NTU 2018 , Team Toulouse-INSA-UPS 2018 , and Team ULaval 2018 .
During the initial stages of our project, the use of RNA aptamers was one of our research focus. Unfortunately, we have been unsuccessful in our constructions. The wet-lab team from CUHK helped us to redesign our constructs involving aptamers,  as well as the primers for these constructions, which eventually led to successful constructions.
We would like to sincerely thank Team NTU for helping us to characterise our new biobrick parts: BBa_K2819000 and BBa_K2819206 .  Their expertise in real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was extremely useful in helping our team generate quality characterization data for several of our biobricks.
Team Toulouse and Team ULaval helped us develop a comprehensive coverage in our education and engagement activities.  The three teams worked closely together to produce a handy and engaging booklet which comprehensively summarizes the pertinent issues surrounding synthetic biology  - Team Toulouse authored a section on ethical concerns in synthetic biology, Team ULaval authored another section on the cultural and social aspects of synthetic biology.
PART 7: EDUCATION AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
Our education and public engagement events would not have been possible without the support of the NUS Biomedical Engineering Club, NUS Tembusu College, and NUS Ridge View Residential College. They provided us with an invaluable platform to anchor our education and engagement events.  We would like to thank the researchers who have taken time off from their busy schedules to speak at our events,  and the staff of the pre-university institutions in Singapore for being so forthcoming in sharing details of our events with their students.
In particular, we would like to thank Assistant Professor Raye Yeow, the advisor to the NUS Biomedical Engineering Club,  as well as the chairperson of the Bi"

Moreover, we re-acknowledged the use of our system in wastewater treatment plants; although Lethbridge’s wastewater treatment plant would not require our system based on our tour, physical wastewater treatment plants used to clean the wastewater from industries discard large amounts of metals. Our system would definitely be purposeful there, in addition to places with metal contaminated water, such as Flint, Michigan.

Concept
Summary of the Project
The end goal of our project is to create spatial color patterns using bacteria, such as a color wheel and a rainbow. Not only would this give an attractive end result, it would also demonstrate a fine level of control over gene expression, as it requires spatial control over several colors simultaneously. The project entails designing self-contained circuits that respond to the changing concentration ratios of two chemical inducers (IPTG and ATC)  through spatial gradients where a given ratio at a given position on the plate is interpreted as a colour. To gain experience, we began with a conventional approach using established red, yellow, and blue proteins as outputs, that were regulated by the LacI and TetR repressors.  The dynamic colour range produced in these attempts were disappointing so we developed a means of adjusting gene expression through plasmid copy number control, achieved by placing the RNA II gene in the pMB1 replication origin under TetR and LacI inducible control. At low levels of inducer, copy number increases with inducer, as greater RNA II expression leads to increased plasmid replication. We show that this method can produce a spatially striking distinction between ON and OFF. Note that this mechanism can make plasmid replication dependent on the presence of inducer effectively creating a new safety switch for genetically engineered organisms which might enter the environment. It also has potentially useful applications related to molecular biology.

For these specific parts, we grew them in 50 mL centrifuge tubes with the caps slightly loosened in 30 mL of LB.  The reasoning for this is that we are going to attempt a massive miniprep of these cultures to accrue a lot of DNA, thus ensuring that we will not have to do another miniprep for these parts.  These larger tubes were also affixed at a slant in the shaking incubator as we usually do for the 16 mL culture tubes in order to increase the amount of aeration.  Shaking at 210 rpm.
Important note:  We observed that there were (two) colonies on a YPD plate that we had left on the table at room temperature and also (three) colonies on a YPD plate that we had streaked with YPD media and left in the 30 degree C incubator as a negative control when we had streaked out the yeast strains from glycerol stocks.  Both plates were made on 6/20.  This is bad.  It means that our YPD agar mix was probably contaminated or that our plates were subject to contamination when we made them.  It may also implicate our YPD media as contaminated.  Indeed, a check right now confirmed that there were small pieces of cloudy substance within the YPD media, indicating its contamination.  Our yeast plates are thus no good and we should make more of them tomorrow.  We should also make some more YPD media.  Then we will need to restreak our yeast strains from glycerol stocks.  One will also note at this point that the MHY501 glycerol stock may be contaminated from before.  Thus, one should primarily focus with using MHY500 or MHY606.  It would be idea if we could simply acquire fresh strains of all three seeing as their purity is somewhat questionable.
For future reference:

Mix 121.1 g of Tris base with 800 mL dH2O. Add 42 mL cHCl. pH is temperature dependent: ~0.03 pH units per 1oC increase. Make sure it is at RT before making final pH adjustments. Add dH2O to 1 L (Autoclave)

//1. PAM criteria 3.0
If in the 21st position of the sequence GXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXGGX a C is found, 60 points will be given and 1 PAM score point, half of the points will be given if instead of a C is a T and if it is an G, 20 for the global score and 0,5 for the PAM score. In the case of A, only 10 points will be assigned in the global score and no points in the PAM score.
So the order remains the following:
G-19N-CGG > G-19N-TGG > G-19N-GGG > G-19N-AGG
//2. Structural criteria 1.0
In this criteria we measure the amount of G an Cs in the target, if that amount is between 7 an 12 bases, 10 points are assigned in the global score and 1 point for the concentration, if the concentration is below 7 or more than 18, a penalty of -180 points is applied and 0 in concentation. Concentration between 12 an 18 the value by default is 0.5
//2. Structural criteria 2.0
Another criteria involves the possible fold in the DNA strand by base complementation; if we have a palindromic complementary strand, there is a chance of unwanted fold, so it needs to be penalized. -10 points are assigned to the ones that show complementarity and when we finish the process, we punctuate the symmetry between 0 and 1
One of the criteria which has not be taken into account are the possible off targets and the complete analysis of the genome. Initially we developed a web service which found all possible off targets of a genome given its sequence. We finally discarded it because of the following reasons:
In order to find all the off targets of a gene, it is necessary to endow the database with the plants’ genomes. These documents have a huge size and will increase exponentially the weight of the database.
The designed algorithm needed around three hours to find every possible off targets because the computing level of a free online server is very small.
We tried to outsource the off target search service by using known computer centers such as NCBI and its API to perform Blast alignments, but the computing time was still high and this library does not"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help"

refer to pages 10-12 for Mini Kit protocol. Some special notes:
All optional steps were carried out except equilibration step.
After centrifugation in step 2, the tubes were pulsed before the excess supernatant was removed through pipetting.
After addition of solution I/RNAse, vortexing/vigorous shaking of the tubes should be avoided to prevent shearing of nucleus and undesirable accidental extraction of chromosomal DNA.
After addition of solution I/RNAse, resuspension of pellet can be done by dragging the tube along an eppendorf rack.
Steps 6 and 7 (involving solutions II and III need to be carried out in quick succession (adhering to the short incubation time) to ensure good results. It is advisable to do these two steps in pairs as in step 6 the tubes need to be tightly capped once solution II is added.
After addition of solution II, the waiting time before proceeding to the next step should not be more than 5 minutes.
The precipitate formed in following addition of solution III does not pellet well after centrifugation in step 8, and hence the suspension needs to be removed immediately to prevent resuspension.
The inversion in step 6 needs to be done gently so that genomic DNA of the bacteria are not extracted along with the desired plasmid DNA.

All the parts of ANY should also be counted as a functional group, though they don’t have functions in this reaction. Any pair of species which partially contain pTetR DNA and TetR protein dimer respectively would bind according to the description of this reaction template. Modeling with templates allows users to define species and reactions only once for one certain family without rewriting them again in database.

A Standard Language
MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models. We will discuss a few relevant topics in the following sections.
Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language
With plenty of information for automatic modeling needs to be stored, we design our database, and develop a standard language of describing the database. We call the language: MoDeL.
MoDeL (Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language) is a database representation format for synthetic biology automatic modeling. This project of MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models on a number of topics, including cell signaling pathways, metabolic pathways, biochemical reactions, gene regulations, and so on.
MoDeL is developed as a machine-readable format in XML fashion, programming languages with XML library API (such as libxml2 for C++) are strongly recommended for reading MoDeL database. USTC_Software has been devoted to the standardization of MoDeL. Documents can be found here . Example of database written in MoDeL can be downloaded on our GitHub page .
MoDeL is an attempt to define a universal database markup language for synthetic biology automatic modeling. It supports descriptions of a wide variety of different parts, including biobrick, compound, compartment, substituent, and so on. It can also describe the species constructed by these parts, and reactions happen with the species, such as binding of species, dilution of species, degradation of proteins, amplification of cells, multi-compartment reactions, and so on.
Many traditional methods fail to consider structure of species when trying to markup reactions with only reactants, modifiers, products and kinetic laws. The best part of MoDeL is that it can preserve detailed structure in species and reactions using Chain-Node"

July 11 - Meeting with Ron Weiss and Linda Griffith
Linda Griffith is a professor of Biomedical and Mechanical Engineering at MIT and the director of the MIT Center for Gynepathology Research. She advised our team throughout the summer and fall as we made crucial decisions about our circuit and experimental design.  Professor Griffith gave us insight to the clinical situation most endometriosis patients are in. Most likely, a symptomatic women who has seen a doctor is already taking some type of hormone regulator, whether it be an IUD or pill. Therefore, the patient is not cyclic like we assumed in our original circuit design and would be in a constant high-progestin state (except for endometriotic lesions, since they are progesterone resistant). To further complicate the challenge of hormone sensing universally across diseased and healthy cells in the reproductive system, endometriotic lesions are consistently producing their own estrogen due to upregulated factors that cause the chemical reaction to occur. Instead, we abandoned the original circuit entirely that assumes all cells go through a normal estrogen and progesterone high phase, and instead decided to sense for: 1) abnormally high levels of estrogen and 2) progesterone resistance during a relative estrogen low phase.
July 21 - Kevin Osteen
Kevin Osteen is a Professor of Obsetrics and Gynecology at Vanderbilt University’s School of Medicine. In the field of endometriosis, his work contributed to major break-throughs that characterized the role of inflammation in disease epidemiology (Bruner-Tran, et al. 2013). After presenting our experimental plan, he helped us develop a schema for testing the efficacy of our system down the line. This was a large challenge that we faced early on since it is impractical to consider demonstrating the efficacy of our diagnostic circuit in primary endometrial biopsy samples from healthy patients and from patients with endometriosis. This is because it is difficult to get authorization and to develop culture protocols for working with primary cells.  Instead, he suggested we use the tert-immortalized human endometrial stromal cells cultured with hormone as our “healthy control.” The endometriotic comparison would be those same cells cultured with inflammatory cues, which his work has found causes healthy cells to mimic the diseased phenotype (Bruner-Tran, et al. 2008).

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,", at the 30th of August. This short pitch focussed on the challenges we face in using synthetic biology. Topsector Chemie is an organization with the goal to find solutions to big social challenges. These are the so-called Grand Societal Challenges by the Horizon 2020 program of the European Commission. Topsector Chemie approaches these challenges from a chemical point of view, collaborating with other top sectors wherever possible.
SynCity
The SynCity event was organized by the Laboratory of Systems & Synthetic Biology at Wageningen University & Research. The event was a film and art festival held on the 5th and 6th of October about synthetic biology to involve the general public in this field. Here, both citizens, scientists and students could discover the field of synthetic biology and how it can be used for many purposes. This is done from an artistic point of view. Via art, synthetic biology is depicted, for example with a series of short movies. Together with iGEM Wageningen 2014 , we presented our view and projects.
Moreover, as follow-up of the SynCity days two dialogue evenings were organised in which synthetic biology issues were discussed. These evenings were set up as workshops and were open to the general public. This was a nice opportunity for us to discover the different interpretations of synthetic biology and the chances or pitfalls it offers for society according to the general public.         This also included a discussion on the role of implication analysis and risk evaluation in science. Staff members mentioned that in their daily work, not much attention was paid to thinking about the societal implications of their studies, although it becomes a more and more important part of acquiring funding or approval of research proposals. A consensus was reached that discussions such as these are important for both scientists and the general public to exchange their visions and expectations of synthetic biology and its implications. This way, the field of synthetic biology will become both highly innovative while being publicly accepted. This shows again that public engagement is an important part of projects such as iGEM, and science in general.

From left to right, transformed bacteria with mass ratio target:detector 0:100, 6:100, 13:100, 25:100, 50:100, 100:100. Bottom line is a zoom of the top one. B. Counting of colonies from photo A.
Sensitivity can be appreciated by the following observations :
no test with target showed a lower number of CFU than control with 0ng target. Hence, there is a notable difference in the number of colonies between the presence and the absence of the target.
notable difference is observed with a low DNA target quantity (6ng), which is promising in the kit’s conditions, since the extraction part is quite limiting in terms of quantity of DNA. The high amount of bacillus in patient stools is an advantage (106 to 108 bacillus/mL) and 6ng is a reachable amount.
Specificity
Another limitation driven by the kit is the purity of the sample. Indeed, if it seems possible to detect 6ng of target with 100 ng of detector, how the detection occurs when the target is melt with a lot of foreign DNAs is unknown.
To estimate specificity, i.e. the ability of the detector to identify the positive as such, the detector has been tested with “false target sequences”, more or less homologous to the original targets. To do so, an algorithm was made to give random sequences with 5%, 15%, 25% and 50% randomly modified pairs of nucleotides (length is kept at 39bp).
Figure 18: Algorithm of the “Generator of aleatory sequences”, used for the design of the false sequences more or less homologous to the target, for the testing of the specificity of the detector.
These 50%, 75%, 85%, 95% homologous sequences to the target were tested 7 times. Unfortunately, results were too heterogenous to bring any statistically relevant conclusions. Firstly about the heterogenous number of false positive colonies (there is a possibility that the detector was badly digested and was consequently transformed), secondly because of the number of colonies that was expected to be increasing, and that was not. Indeed, transformation includes a lot of steps with specific parameters, varying a little between each experiment and may explain the lack of reproducibility.

There is no valid proof that GM food is harmful to human health. Our team realized that this misconceptions and bias can be an important barrier to the advancement of synthetic biology, so we had tried to educate or event participants further throughout our project introduction and posted articles on synthetic biology on local science FaceBook page.
We also got feedbacks asking opinions about our project, which some parents were interested and spent time discussing with us at our booth.
From this feedbacks, we were able to draft out an idea how our future project would look like. We sought to interview with Prof. Terrence Lau who is knowledgeable about current GMOs situation in Hong Kong. It is also a surprise that GMO papaya is actually very common in Hong Kong,  while our survey conveys that people know GMOs in a broad sense, but not the GMOs that surround them.
Throughout the interview, we sparked another similar idea that we can also tackle, which is the Genetic Containment Strategy, where we also care about preventing accidental release of the genetically engineered organisms, and we sought more in-depth detail about how to improve our construct to Prof. Matthew Bennett

Abstract
Overloading of phosphorus and nitrogen are the most important causes of red tide. So it is necessary to construct corresponding sensors able to respond effectively and accurately. Once our design is finished, it could be integrated into our information-processing devices, a comparator or ratio sensor. We have investigated a lot about the endogenous phosphate sensor and nitrate sensor in prokaryotes. Even though we successfully screened some candidates for further modification, it is still frustrating that few mechanisms match perfectly with the corresponding phosphate and nitrate concentration when red tide probably occurs.
So fine-tuning of nitrate and phosphate sensor is somewhat difficult but necessary.   Given the limited time, we have focused more on the promoter test platform construction and characterization. Since a variety of sensors rely on the two-component system(TCS) to function, we also conceive a whole set of design ideas for TCS modifications, thereby enable other teams to fine-tune their sensors to respond desirably. In addition，in order to not only construct corresponding sensors to predict the red tide, but also prevent it from exploding, we did job in searching biological phosphate accumulation.
Background
Overview of two-component system
To adapt and survive in different microenvironments, bacteria must sense and respond to extracellular signals. The adaptive response to environmental stimuli can be transduced by two-component regulatory systems, which are involved in the regulation of chemotaxis, osmoregulation, metabolism and transport. A typical TCS is comprised of a membrane-bound histidine kinase (HK) and a partner response regulator (RR). Specific environmental signals lead to activation (autophosphorylation) of the HK, which in turn acts as a phosphoryl donor for activation (autophosphorylation) of the partner RR. Phosphate and nitrate sensors[1].

NEW SAFETY APPROACH!
Multidrug resistance on microorganism has already changed from nightmare to reality. Horizontal gene transfer is one of the ways for bacteria to obtain exogenous genetic material. The previous proposal on biosafety of synthetic biology by other iGEM teams have led to achievements on different approach, such as incorporating active inhibition of horizontal gene transfer (Imperial 2011), using antibiotic-free selection to reduce potential multidrug resistance on antibiotic, and labeling spec sheet information on engineered bacteria for identity (CUHK 2010).
It is well-known that DNA molecule can be long lasting for thousands years. Therefore, even the engineered bacteria was killed after experiments, the artificial genetic material such as synthetic DNA can still present in the environment. Other bacteria can uptake these genetic information and possibly incorporate into their genome. The active uptake mechanism of DNA from the environment to bacteria can be known as “natural genetic transformation”. Thus, this intelligent design can bypass the previous proposed biosafety measures.
Herein, our proposed system allows a selective cleavage of the target gene, such as antibiotic gene and biobrick gene, by activating an exonuclease to recognize the specific region and undergo digestion. This approach allows regulation of the engineered microorganism down from DNA level.

ETH_Zurich,2017,Team:ETH Zurich#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," immunosuppressed and nutrient-rich microenvironment necessary for bacterial growth. However, bacterial colonization in healthy tissues (off-target) is still a possibility, even though literature data support that any off-target colonization is cleared-out by the immune system. {2} In order to address this potential safety risk, intracellular accumulation of the Anti-Cancer Toxin azurin and the  production of an MRI Contrast Agent bacterioferritin is activated only once the bacterial population threshold is reached and lactate, a tumor marker, is present ( see Tumor Sensor ). Additionally, azurin is being released only if the physician confirms the co-localization of the bacteria (via MRI) and the tumor. This release is taking place via a thermo-inducible Cell Lysis , activated by focused ultrasounds (see Heat Sensor ) during MRI imaging.
Risk of horizontal gene transfer
As long as our engineered microbes are accumulating into immunosuppressed areas (tumor environment), other bacteria might also reside in these areas. In that way, horizontal gene transfer could potentially generate antibiotic resistant bacteria that can further lead to patient infection. In order to minimize such a risk, we would have to clone our system into a chromosome to eliminate the need for antibiotic resistance. Another option would be to use metabolic complementation instead of antibiotic selection for plasmid maintenance.
Risk of the release in the environment
After the treatment, the remainings of our bacteria are going to be cleared out from the patient’s system. In that way, the patient’s secretions might still contain some DNA fragments, or even living bacteria.
One way to approach this problem is to use a procedure in the clinics similar to what is routinely done in nuclear medicine, where patients treated with radioactive substances remain in the treatment facility for an appropriate amount of time needed to completely clear out the dangerous substances from their body. During this time, all secretions, even items that the patients come in contact with, are carefully collected and disposed of according to regulations. [6]
On the other hand, a knock-out strain could be created which would rely on a metabolite that cannot be found freely in the environment, but would be supplemented during the treatment.

Background
All of the 2018 iGEM teams are invited and encouraged to participate in the Fifth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study in synthetic biology. Our team took part in this study which aimed to improve the measurement tools available to both the iGEM community and the synthetic biology community as a whole.  The main task is to make sure if normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFU) can reduce lab-to lab variability in fluorescence measurements.  Sally, Celina and Mark have done the experiments in the institute of physics of Peking University using Plate Reader. All members participate in processing data.

Calibration
Since all instruments are different, we have to make sure we know what the standard value in our own apparatus is by making three sets of unit calibration measurements: an OD600 reference point, a particle standard curve, and a fluorescein standard curve. The result we got in shown in the following part.
We use plate reader to measure the following dates.

BNU-China,2016,Team:BNU-China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," reflects the variance in a certain level and this random difference is due to the selected sample’s random. For example, the measured length of the microtubule will be different when we add taxol into the test tube.
On the basis of the theory, our F test statistics is:
$$ F = \frac{SSA/(n-k)}{SSE/(k-1)} \sim F(n-k, k-1) \tag{4}$$
The numerator of the equation is a part of the dependent variable which can be explained by the change of the independent variable, while the denominator of the equation can be explained by other random elements except the change of the independent variable. The proportion of the change of independent variable in all change of the dependent variable becomes bigger, in other words, F has a higher value, independent variable influence dependent variable more.
4.0 - The F-test on the data
Our F-test’s null hypothesis is:
$$ H_0:μ_1=μ_2=⋯=μ_k   \quad  vs  \quad  H_1=\quad not \quad H_0 \tag{5}$$
\(H_0\) stands for that different values of the independent variable（the added taxol‘s concentration) make no difference to the mean value of the dependent variable(the light absorption value OD350), in other words, the independent is not important to the dependent variable. Then we use R software to conduct F-test, the outcome is shown below:
Fig.5 Outcome of the F-test about the data
From the outcome, \(F’s\) value is 1.337,  nearly 1. Apart from that, the significance is 0.27, bigger than 0.05. Therefore, we can't think the independent variable make distinct influence on the dependent variable.
Differential Equation Model
For studying the dynamic progress of tubulin assembling under the influence of Taxol, we build the differential equations to describe such progress numerically.
First we have to consider what happened in the tubulin solution. Protein filaments will assemble into the tubulins automatically by arranging dimers. Specifically, the GTP-cap can aggregate or disaggregate at one side of the protein filament. Besides, there are chances that the GTP can hydrolysis to GDP, which can no longer combine the new GTP. In this process, the length and amount of the tubulin are in the dynamic equilibrium or changing.
We know that the differential equations can describe the numerical relationships and patterns between related promoters. Based on these studies, we can make"

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer1_-_-_TEXT.html," site between DAMP and Pexiganan, TEV protease is chosen to serve this purpose. TEV protease is the common name for the 27 kDa catalytic domain of the Nuclear Inclusion a (NIa) protein encoded by the tobacco etch virus (TEV). Because its sequence specificity, TEV protease is a very useful reagent for cleaving fusion proteins. It is also relatively easy to overproduce and purify large quantities of the enzyme. (Macromollecular Crystallography Laboratory, Protein Engineering Section, David Waugh)
Design
The project's main goal on this part is producing the inactive form of the pexiganan which have antimicrobial effects; DAMP-Pexiganan and producing TEV Protease which will activate DAMP-Pexiganan. For producing this proteins abundantly we use T7 promoter ,which has extremely strong transcription rate, while we designing our parts. We also decided to have Lac Operator site (that LacI protein can bind) between our gene sequences and T7 promoters to make protein expressions controllable. We researched for the expression vector that satisfy these requirements, and we found we could use the pet45-b expression vector provides the conditions we want. While we genes to order we added RFC10 prefix domain to the 3 'end of DAMP-Pexiganan and TEV Protease and we also added BamHI restriction enzyme recognition sequence for clonning inside to Pet45-b vector. We added RFC10 Suffix domain to the 5’ end of the same gene sequences, same way we added XhoI restriction enzyme recognition sequence for cloning inside to Pet45-b plasmid. In line with our ultimate goal we aim producing of  these two proteins in the same bacteria. To make this happen we need to ligate these two gene sequences with two plasmids these have different types of origin(Origin incompatibility).  Therefore, we have designed Damp PEX gene sequence in this manner so that at the same time we can ligate it with pColA vector. pColA plasmit do not include promoter in itself beceuse of that we added T7 promoter to 5' end of DAMP-Pexiganan gene sequence.
As stated above, we planned clonning  ordered DAMP-Pexiganan and TEV Protease genes in Pet45-b vector with BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes. When this clonning performed; T7 promoter-Lac operator (LacO)- HisTag- DAMP-pexiganan/TEV protease"

TEAM SAFETY
All team members involved in lab procedures were required to adhere to certain lab guidelines as outlined by our advisors. The lab safety rules include but are not limited to:
Wash in, wash out
Protect eyes, mucous membranes, open cuts and wounds from contact with biohazard material
Do not eat or drink when in the lab area
Use gloves, goggles masks as necessary
Tie back loose hair
Disinfect all surfaces with 70% ethanol prior to working
Disinfect all disposable tips, glassware, tubes by soaking in 10% bleach solution for 20 minutes and then disposing in normal waste
Dispose of growth plates by disposing into a biohazard container which get autoclaved
Check all equipment for good working order, no chips, torn cords, cracks.  Report any issues to an instructor immediately.
When pipetting don’t touch tip to side of container
Don’t lay caps of tubes upside down.  Use masking tape to hold to bottom of cabinets
Clean work area with 70% ethanol after working
Clean up all glassware and lab ware before leaving lab
Place all backpacks and stools to the side of the lab to keep walkways clear
Always know the correct procedure for disposal of lab materials
PUBLIC SAFETY
We took certain measures to ensure that our project did not pose a threat to public safety. All organisms handled were non-pathogenic, and are unlikely to survive in the wild even if released. All biomaterials were disposed of properly and all relevant lab equipment was autoclaved after use. Team members were not allowed outside of the lab while wearing gloves and refrained from touching doorknobs or any surfaces that would come in contact with the public. We cleaned all lab surfaces after use to ensure that others did not come in contact with our biomaterials.
ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
To ensure that our project did not propose a hazard to the environment, we used only transformation strains that were purchased through New England Biolabs.  Our project aim is to produce a cell line of E. coli that can be used to convert chitin from shrimp shell waste to chitosan.  This process currently is completed via strong Acids and Bases.  Our cells would be contained in bioreactors, much like a water treatment plant.  We plan to engineer them with a kill switch designed by 2013 Carnegie-Mellon, Killer Red.  This switch would kill the cells when they were"

SILVER
Several of our BioBricks work as expected. For example, Bbaxxxxxx， and they had been submitted as required.
We have mentored a high school team (HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou)and we designed a special linker for their core proteins and constructed the plasmid for them. We also helped them standardized this part.
We visited China National Tobacco Corporation(CNTC) to investigate the damage caused by tobacco black shank which inspired us to come up with the idea of Trichoderma，the guardian. And the staff of CNTC gaved us lots of helpful suggestions.
We invited Prof.Chulong Zhang as our instructor, who has focused on Trichoderma for tens of years. He recommended Trichoderma atroviride for us as the chasis which is safe and environment-friendly. We also consulted him how to prevent our engineered Trichoderma from horizontal gene transfer.
GOLD
We engaged with stakeholders as well as experts,and did field study etc., which as a whole helped us to design and modify our project.
We have induced several site-mutation in the sequence of T7 promoter and in this way，we created a series of promoters with different strength. We believe that these promoters will provide the researcher with more freedom to select the promoter with a proper strength. It can be a great improvement for T7 promoter.
Through logistic regression analysis of the VOC released from healthy or infected tobacco，we constructed a model to tell the physiological state of tob"
William_and_Mary,2018,Team:William and Mary#Human Practices#Camp Launch_-_-_TEXT.html," few funny comics and a video that connected to our learning objectives. We also had a problem solving challenge at the beginning of the session which energized the students. There were candy prizes for students who answered questions or who successfully completed the problem solving challenge.
Reflect & Record
The lab visits utilizing the activities booklet went very well and were a good fit for the age group, ability level and time allotted. Students were excited and engaged by the material, they responded well to the questions and brainstorming prompts.
The presentation content was a good fit for the students, however, the opening problem solving activity was more challenging than anticipated and made for a rough transition into the formal presentation.
During the formal presentation we introduced a few of the components of the NASA project we were completing for Virginia teachers. We intended to just present our current materials but were pleasantly surprised by how invested the students were in the long-term space travel problem provided. Not only did this confirm that the course would be well received by Virginia students after its completion, we were inspired to expand the project to include a few ideas not originally in our outline. For example, several students had heard there was water on Mars, they wanted to explore the potential of creating ice houses made from the frozen water - we looked into this idea and it has actually been explored already! Many of them had also seen the film The Martian and were very interested in closed system farming, the prospect of farming with human waste was very exciting. Many of the students wanted to hear more about why we weren't using some of the techniques proposed for space travel here on Earth. The students also pointed out that many of the systems used in space could help reduce waste on Earth and that we should include comments about adapting space projects for Earth applications. These comments are reflected in our final NASA project.
We are excited about partnering again next year with this group and we will be improving upon our presentation to make it smoother for next year.

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Safety in iGEM
Please visit the main Safety page to find this year's safety requirements & deadlines, and to learn about safe & responsible research in iGEM.
On this page of your wiki, you should write about how you are addressing any safety issues in your project. The wiki is a place where you can go beyond the questions on the safety forms, and write about whatever safety topics are most interesting in your project. (You do not need to copy your safety forms onto this wiki page.)
Safe Project Design
Does your project include any safety features? Have you made certain decisions about the design to reduce risks? Write about them here! For example:
Choosing a non-pathogenic chassis
Choosing parts that will not harm humans / animals / plants
Substituting safer materials for dangerous materials in a proof-of-concept experiment
Including an ""induced lethality"" or ""kill-switch"" device
Safe Lab Work
What safety procedures do you use every day in the lab? Did you perform any unusual experiments, or face any unusual safety issues? Write about them here!
Safe Shipment
Did you face any safety problems in sending your DNA parts to the Registry? How did you solve those problems?"

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," OD600 of approximately 0.05, with LB medium + CAM (antibiotic, chloramphenicol). To achieve an end volume of 4 mL we took 67 µl of the overnight culture and 3933 µl of LB + CAM. We let the cells in the new sample  grow for 1.5 hour at 37°C to reach the exponential phase (OD between 0.35-0.60). After the cells reached the exponential phase, we induced 1 mL of the culture with 1% rhamnose (250 µl from our 5% rhamnose stock) and also took 1 mL sample of the uninduced culture. We incubated both samples overnight at room temperature to allow the production of nanowires. Finally, the samples were directly added to the grid and the following TEM pictures were taken.
Results
Figure 8: Pictures taken with TEM (magnification 7300 x). The left picture shows the situation without induction (0% rhamnose) and the right one shows the situation with induction (1% rhamnose).
In Figure 8, both the situation, pictured with TEM, without induction (the left one) and with induction (the right one) are shown with a magnification of 7300 x. The situation in which there was no induction with rhamnose, the bacteria did not show any curli formation. The opposite was true for the case in which the cells were induced with rhamnose. As the TEM picture clearly shows, nanowires are present after induction.
Microtiter Plate Assay for Ring-Shaped, curli dependent biofilm detection
Background
The bacteria that we engineered for the project are capable of producing curli proteins after induction with L-rhamnose. However, the goal of our project is the printing of biofilms and not the sole overexpression of these proteins. In order to assess whether our CsgA-producing bacteria can make a biofilm or just remains planktonic, our team adapted the protocol from Zhou et al. (2013) that employs crystal violet (methyl violet 10B) for dying the biofilm-making bacteria that attach to surfaces.
According to the source article (Zhou et al., 2013), a deficient mutant of Escherichia coli is unable to produce a biofilm. By performing this experiment, we want to go further in characterizing our curli proteins; we want to answer this question: are we really making biofilms?

Bernardo Cervantes
Bernardo Cervantes is a final year Bioengineering major enticed by the sheer comfort and joy of being in lab for unspeakable hours. His work revolved around finding many of the  GTs we tested by building cDNA libraries from plants and he has since mastered all flavors of PCR. He was also involved with putting together our presentation. He is perhaps most remembered as the napkin fairy, keeping everyone of us perfectly stocked with paper towels.
Hojae Lee
Hojae Lee is a 3rd year bioengineering major with previous experience working with nanodevices and biomedicine. She decided to pursue iGEM for the immersive experience - which she definitely received. Her wetlab work consisted of manipulating yeast systems for further application of our indigo pathway. Most importantly, Hojae did the most work on our economic and environmental analysis, deciphering the art of chemical process design. Hojae was the mastermind behind this wiki as well as the illustrator expert in our group, and given the location of her bench secluded from the rest of ours, she was best remembered for not always being remembered.
Roy Park
Roy Park began his 2nd year in the Bioengineering major this year. He performed almost all the experiments relating to quantifying our indigo production and also worked on characterizing the kinetic parameters of the enzymes we used in our indigo biosynthesis pathway. He was also quickest to help any of our team whenever we needed help (as long as it didn't involve sonication in the cold room). Though current evidence suggests Roy is a sophomore, he will remain a freshman forever in our hearts.

BrownTwo,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"  W303 is auxotrophic for leu2, trp1, his2, ura3, and (possibly) ade.  He also gave us pRS303 (1-7-3), a yeast shuttle vector that complements the auxotrophy for the his2 gene.
Another key issue that he helped us resolve was with regard to Test #2, which would test competative binding of an activator and a repressor for the same binding site.  He indicated that the PGAL1 promoter that drives expression of our synthetic activators does not have a very tunable response.  Thus, he suggested that we switch this promoter with PMET25 and replace the promoter in front of each repressor with a constitutive promoter.  This actually is closer to what we would have in our final device, so it makes sense to simply incorporate this redesign of Test#2 into the cloning strategy for the final device.   For this problem of ours, he provided a set of constitutive promoters called 'Funk promoters', in reference to the researcher who tested them (I think).  The promoters provided to us are p413_PCYC (V1-60), p414_PADH (V1-55), p413_PTEF (V1-45), and p413_PGPD (V1-37).  The reference for these promoters is Mumberg et al.  Gene (1995) 156:119.

Sorbonne_U_Paris,2018,Team:Sorbonne U Paris#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html,"2) With that in mind, their main strategy was: (I) to generate site specific re-integration in order to make sure to replace the original gene variant and to maintain single copy status for optimal selection ; (II) to do so, their system requires a reverse transcriptase in trans rather than within the retro-element, thus eliminating the risk of inactivating the enzyme by mutation.
BOKUM 2017 Vienna team hoped to complete their project by “hope for a lucky shot” approach. They did not have time to complete their experimentation. One of the main drawback of their strategy is the “all or nothing” result.  When we started working on the project, creating a design that has a value and is a result by itself was a must do. This strategy led us to improve their project, mainly by using a standardized and modular design.
II- Improving D.I.V.E.R.T and Crook’s synthetic retrotransposons by using Moclo
A- Standardize synthetic retrotransposons for directed evolution
An element essential for synthetic biology is the ability to physically assemble complex DNA molecules containing large numbers of natural or artificial genetic elements. Modular Cloning (MoClo) is a hierarchical modular cloning system that allows the creation at will and with high efficiency of any eukaryotic multigenes construct.
To spread the use of directed evolution mediated by retrotransposons, we need to standardized its design to be readily use for any target CARGO without the need to reconstruct the whole system every time. By adapting the synthetic retrotransposons to a MoClo standard, it will be quick and easy for a user to change promoter, RBS, and CDS of the CARGO, and thus adapting regulatory elements. In order to do that, we removed all illegal restriction sites (BsaI and BbsI) from the retrotransposons Osser for Phytobrick MoClo assembly while we ordered the gene synthesis. As explained in the design part of the Wiki, we had to change the wild type Osser retrotranspons to make it compatible with Golden Gate assembly.
To go further, we want our design to be portable between different metabolic chassis (yeast, microalgae, plants, bacteria). It is easy to create a library of L0 parts with different retrotransposons parts adapted to the host. Our system will allows everyone to re-use our design and if they order the parts from iGEM registry it will be useable without the need to sequence the retrotransposons again.
Last but not least, this system can"

Introduction
Through our interviews with health specialists and oncology experts (more information in Integrated human practices ) we assessed the necessity to have a non-invasive treatment companion to determine our vaccine efficacy. Here, we want to provide a proof-of-concept that would allow us to monitor the patient’s response by using the same set of identified neoantigens used for our vaccine. We also believe that it is important to be able to detect relapses in early melanoma stages, as the survival rates for patients dramatically drop to 20% in stage IV compared to 99% survival rate in stage I and II ( Siegel et al., 2018 ).
To answer these needs, we envision a new generation of diagnostic tools by which a liquid peripheral blood draw could give an accurate prognosis regarding the elimination of the tumor cells and, by targeting specific biomarkers, be a good predictor of relapse. This requires a detection system that is both highly sensitive and specific since single base pair polymorphisms, barely detectable in the blood, can lead to tumorigenesis.
Our idea is to develop a Cas12a detection system coupled to an amplification step. This detection system is rapid, sensitive and specific enough to reliably detect these biomarkers.

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

Offering Biobricks to RDFZ-China
Biobricks to an iGEM project is like bricks to a skyscraper, without which a project cannot even start. This is why when RDFZ-China asked us for some essential biobricks, we offered without hesitation. This year, RDFZ-China is paying attention to helping solve the petroleum leakage issue in the soil. Rather awesome!

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

""What is 'bio'? A lot of people prefer products that are labeled with 'bio' – without asking themselves how 'bio' it really is. Is the 'bio' tomato that grew 800 kilometers away really 'better' than the 'normal' tomato that grew in the next village?  Balcony Menu takes this paradox to extremes. Food that I nurture on my balcony has to be 100 % 'bio', it makes a good conscious and a feeling of safety – but which process has the plant gone through until it was in this state to sustain various fruits and vegetables?  And still – wouldn't it be great to have that product at home? This product doesn't aim a judgement but wants to stimulate the awareness of what we eat and our perception of 'bio'.""

Product Description
One plant for it all!
A high quality selection of various vegetables, fruits and herbs that grow on one plant. It provides everything that is needed for a delicious three-course meal composed by star chef Anton Gonzo. His list of ingredients form the basis for the plants, which are then designed by agricultural and nutritional scientists together with SynBio engineers. After growing, the plant is harvested in one piece and provides you with all the organic ingredients needed for starter, main course and dessert.
Balcony Menu is available in three tantalizing themes: “Provencal”; “Nordic Nights” and “Italian Dreams” and may be ordered in three different sizes: single, romantic (2 people) and family (4 or more people).
Technical instructions:
1 plant the balcony menu in a common flower box.
2 water it every second day.
3 harvest it after approximately three weeks and enjoy your meal!

Arabidopsis thaliana: Growth Conditions and Plant Material
Six weeks old A. thaliana plants, ecotype Columbia 0 (wildtype), have been gratefully offered by Patrick Treffon and Thorsten Seidel. They have been cultivated under normal day conditions (14 hours light [100 µmol ⁄ quanta m-2s-1] at 21°C, 10 hours darkness at 18°C). For induction of the formation of siliques the plants were shifted into long day conditions (16 hours light [100 µmol ⁄ quanta m-2s-1] at 21°C, 18 hours darkness at 18°C). After two weeks in long day conditions the plants have developed 2 cm long siliques. The siliques were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen for further use.
Arabidopsis thaliana: Total RNA Isolation
The frozen plant material has to be grinded in a precooled mortar in liquid nitrogen. About 120 mg of pulverized plant material are transfered into a precooled 2 ml Eppendorf tube and kept frozen until the following steps:
Add 0.5 ml lysis buffer and immediately homogenize through rough shaking.
Add 0.5 ml of saturated phenol and mix strongly.
Add 0.5 ml of chloroform isoamyl alcohol (24:1) and vortex again at high speed for at least 30 seconds.
Centrifugate for 5 min at 13,000 rpm.
The lower phase contains now lipids and lipophilic compounds. The upper phase contains nucleic acids (~ 550 µl) and has to be carefully transferred into a new 2 ml Eppendorf tube. This tube has to be filled with 0.5 ml saturated phenol and 0.5 ml chloroform isoamyl alcohol (24:1). Mix immediately.
Centrifugate at 13,000 rpm for 3 minutes.

Project Details
One major shortcoming however of using the bacterial arsenic-sensitive promoter (pArs) to control a biosensor device is that pArs has a very low threshold of activation. For example transformants of the Gronigen pArs part K190015 in the Endy lab expression vector J61002 are universally red without any added arsenic.
Reporters for bacterial biosensor devices created with E.coli pArs thus must measure an analog (or digital) output of signal to register the amount of arsenic present.  We think that this will add unnecessary technical sophistication to what should be a simple  device.
If then there was someway to raise the threshold of the bacterial arsenic promoter ""genetically"" this could form the basis of a simple binary device.  This device would have then only two states: off =safe on=danger thus simplifying is use and maximizing its utility in the developing world.
We took this as the engineering goal for our project and entertained a number of approaches
A very leaky arsenic sensitive promoter possibly evolved to protect a cell from the danger of this metaloid and the basis of this is perhaps the affinity of the ArsR for the control region.
One approach that we entertained was to duplicate the promoter binding site for ArsR and to create a series of ArsR binding sites between the promoter and reporter. We discounted this idea because even in a free state, a series of control regions between the promoter and reporter might not be structurally conducive to RNA scanning to initiate transcription.
Another approach we entertained was to perhaps increase the expression of ArsR within the cell.  We reasoned that this would have two non-mutually exclusive effects:  1. to increase the amount of bound ArsR through shifting the equilibrium to the right or, more likely,  2. to increase the binding of arsenic entering the cell (create an arsenic sink).
Thanks to the Edinburgh Team a composite part, J33201, had been created for us to test this idea!
The Edinburgh team assembled the following favorite device: pArs-ArsR-[open reading frame]
We therefore compared the sensitivity of J33201 to the Gronigen Team’s K190015 pArs site using the Endy Lab’s expression vector J61002.  We loaded J33201"

Sensitivity analysis
To get a better result, which means more genes in state ‘B’ int the end, we analyze on some key parameters to find how to improve our system.
Analysis of  K3-
is the rate constant that AraC-arabinose complexes separate from araI site. If we change it from the original 1 to 0.01, we can get the following result. The concentration of Cre ：
The concentration of Cre-Loxp ：
The number of genes in different state:
The result shows that when
is very small which means that the rate that AraC-arabinose complexes binds to araI site (
) is much bigger than that it separates from aral site (
), there will be fluctuations before Cre degrade to zero.
Analysis of the rate of flip
We use
to denote the rate that genes in state ‘C’ change to state ‘B’, as well as the rate that genes in state ‘D’ change to state ‘A’. Then we change
from 100 to 1, we can get the following result.
The result, especially the bottom of the number of genes in state ‘A’, shows clearly that genes in state ‘A’ first change to state ‘C’ before they become state ‘B’. The following figure can give us more details about the affection of
.
Analysis of  d(pcre)
is the degradation constant of Cre protein. If we change
from 0.14/min to 1.4/min, we can get the following result. The concentration of Cre ：
The concentration of Cre-Loxp ：
The number of the genes in different states (green line for original state and red line for state after inversion): 1 trajectory:
10 trajectories:
100 trajectories:
1000 trajectories:
From the above results , we can see that if the rate of the degradation of Cre protein increases so that the Cre declines to zero faster and the time when Cre exists decreases , the number of times of flip will be smaller"

Hi iGEMers, this is Zhengya Liu from School of Life Science, Nanjing University. I am currently in my senior year and major in Biological Science. This is my second year participating iGEM and I am eager to share our ideas with brilliant young minds from the globe. My major research interest lies in neuroscience especially the neural circuits for metabolism and other physiological functions and responses. In my spare time, watching TV series is one of my favorite ways to relax. Homeland and Breaking Bad are the two at the top of my list so I highly recommend everyone to watch.

We purified the protein and draw the standard curve successfully in our group A experiment. (See protocols for purified and measurement experiment details).
Fig.1 For eGFP purification, we chose His-tag as the proteintag and BL21(DE3) as the expression strain. After bacterial lysis, centrifugation and affinity chromatography we got eGFP shown on the figure. You can see the details of protein purification from the protocol.
Fig.2 Trying to make sure the accuracy of our standard curve, we decided to purify eGFP ulteriorly to enhance the purity of eGFP. So we chose to utilize molecular sieve chromatography and we got eGFP we wanted. What the peak of this figure shows is our eGFP during the process of molecular sieve chromatography.
Fig.3 SDS-PAGE was applied after the purified protein was sieved by molecular sieve chromatography. The 29kDa protein which had a high purity was enhanced green fluorescence protein, eGFP.
Group A: Fluorescence curve of eGFP protein purified. Samples were added twice in each experiment to measure in this group. The experiment has been repeated for 5 times.
The result of group A experiment shows good repeatability, so we coordinated all the data of Group A and drew the fluorescence curve. Data shown yellow are abandoned. Statistical results show that the similarity index of fluorescence curve each experiment is 0.84403025081. You can see the details in the modeling.
Fig.4 The overall experiment result of Group A.
However, it’s known that the fluorescence of eGFP may quenching after exaction, e.g. it may degrade when stored. And the measurement error may also influence the curve, which may introduce error to the quantitative experiment. To make our experiment more reliable and highly repeatable, we did the Group B experiment. We stored our samples and measured the same sample every 4 days to check the quenching.
Group B: fluorescence curve of eGFP purified at the same time, at an interval of four days.
In a short time, the fluorescence curve showed no significant change if the protein are stored properly. Statistical results show that the similarity index of fluorescence curve at the same time, at an interval of four days is 0.88848598263493528. You can see the details in the modeling. To summarize, the experiment data shows good repeatability and time change"

To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

I will freely admit that I have always been a bit of a science geek. Initially physics was the dream, I wanted to go to space (and preferably build the rocket myself), but sometime during my high school studies, my interest in planets and black holes was diminished and the workings of the cell became the focus of my affection.
So what better way to go than studying Biotechnology? That was where I met what has become my other academic interest: statistics and data analysis. Fortunately modern biology is full of data and there is plenty of room for people who want to spend hours in front of the computer, analyzing the latest high-throughput genome sequencing experiment.

Believe it or not, my dream is to become artist or writer. The reason why I choose Biotechnology as my major is that I also interested in science and want to solve problems such as energy, environment and human health with this technology in the future. Fortunately, I can take part in IGEM and it is a very special experience for me to know a lot of friends and learn knowledge at the same time.

As a naive highscholer I wanted to save the world, to make the world a better place. I wanted to save millions of lives by being the one inventing the AIDS vaccine, finding the cure for Alzheimer or eliminating malaria. Full of hope I started at uni, just to experience that the simple “DNA” and “protein” appeared to be much more complex and I slowly started to realize that saving the world is not something you just do after studying biology for half a year. This realization was combined with frustrating, but time passed, good things happened and suddenly I found myself in the middle of a fascinating iGEM project. It will not save the world tomorrow, but it might be one of the many small steps which in the future will lead to groundbreaking scientific discoveries.

UCL,2013,Team:UCLA#Project#ProjectDesign_-_-_TEXT.html,", which may facilitate formation of tertiary structures. Following ligation, RNA samples should be run on a gel by electrophoresis to separate the fully ligated RNA-splint-linker species from the smaller splint and linker fragments. The size difference between the unligated and ligated RNA may be too small to resolve separately on a gel. However, they can be isolated by using oligo-dT columns. The splint and linker provide the ligated RNA with a poly-A tail which can bind onto the column.
The sample can then be translated in vitro using commercial kits. It is important to translate the RNA after purifying the sample through oligo-dT columns, since keeping unligated RNA will reduce translation efficiency. High salt concentrations used during oligo-dT column purification could also disrupt the conjugated proteins. The protein-RNA samples can then be separated from untranslated RNA by pulling down the translated FLAG tag using antibodies or affinity columns. Finally, purified protein-RNA samples can be reverse transcribed into protein-DNA samples. While converting RNA to DNA earlier may decrease the chance of allowing RNase or harsh experimental conditions to degrade RNA, the order described provides the greatest efficiency of reverse transcription by removing competing incomplete samples. Steps following translation should all be done with as few freeze/thaw cycles in between. Completing the remaining procedures in one shot is preferred.
Screening the sample
Side (left) and bottom (right) views of Mtd trimer complex in green with variable repeat region highlighted in purple.
We plan on using the final protein-DNA library to screen for Mtd variants that can bind to proteins expressed on the surface of E. coli. If successful, our results would highlight the remarkable structural properties of the Mtd, and provide evidence that the DiversiPhage system could potentially be used to generate antibody-like proteins that can bind to specified targets. We are not immediately concerned about what protein the Mtd will specifically bind to, since binding to any surface protein on E. coli will demonstrate a change in specificity from its natural target. As a negative control, we will use the wild-type Mtd in the same screen against E. coli. 3D images of Mtd-target interactions suggest that the Mtd forms into a trimer through interactions at the static scaffold region. The mutagenic islands only modify the variable binding region. Since it is possible that each of the three associated monomers has a unique variable region, the possible permutations of complexes may enable binding to an even greater range of targets.

Encapsulation Procedure
To make a silica matrix surrounding a cell, we needed a supply of silica nanoparticles and a reactive cross-linker capable of
covalently bonding reagents into a unified volume. Two solutions were prepared: one was a combination of TM-40 (colloidal
silica) and diluting components (ultrapure water and polyethylene glycol). The second solution was tetramethyl orthosilicate
(TMOS) cross-linker. In slightly acidic conditions, methyl groups of TMOS are hydrolyzed, producing methanol and the silica
cross-linker. Resuspended and washed cells are then added to the relatively innocuous colloidal solution. Upon combining
these two mixtures, a rapid polymerization linking colloidal silica together occured. In order to achieve proper bead
sphericity, we combined all of these components in an hydrophobic solution and let them set. After some experimentation, we
were able to produce beads with a consistent size. To purify the mixture, we phase-separated the silica beads by adding
water to solution, which forced them into the aqueous phase. These were then recovered to assess viability.
The Biochemical Network
In this project, systems of mathematical equations are used to model the biochemical network of methylmercury conversion in E. coli and to determine the effects of changing methylmercury concentration on the conversion rate. A combination of enzyme kinetics and protein expression equations was in the model. The reactions below shows the four-step reaction network for the conversion of methylmercury to volatile mercury using the mer operon in E. coli. This network involves the transport of methylmercury into the cell, its subsequent conversion into ionic and volatile mercury, and the transport of volatile mercury to the extracellular space. This simplified network follows the proposed mechanism of the mer operon and it captures the primary steps of methylmercury breakdown in E. coli. Furthermore, a system of ordinary differential equations was used to model the biochemical reactions taken place at each step of the conversion process. The cofactors were not included in the equations because at sufficient concentrations, they do not"

Improve the tolerance to high levels of ROS
Overview:
To block the response of yeast to ROS, we knocked out the yeast-derived yca1 gene. Because Yca1                         is the only known yeast metacaspase, to demonstrate genetically that Ndi1 functions                         independently of Yca1, we overexpressed Ndi1 in yca1 mutant background. Consistently,Ndi1                         overexpression exacerbated cell death in the absence of Yca1

Based on the result, we determined that there was no mistake in the process of knocking out yca1 gene and that the yca1 gene was knocked out indeed.
verify whether knocking out gene yca1 can increase yeast tolerance to H2O2
If the growth of Δyca1 and yno1-Δyca1 was better than that of WT and yno1, it                         can be concluded that knocking out yca1 gene can improve yeast tolerance to H2O2.                         We diluted seed liquid to OD600 at 2, which was Saccharomyces Cerevisiae of overexpressing yno1                         gene and lacking the yca1 gene (yno1-Δyca1) and strains of overexpressing yno1                         gene (yno1) as control group. And then adjust the concentration of H2O2 in the seed                         liquid to 0 mM, 1 mM, and 2 mM respectively. The yeasts were cultured for 16h. Take samples                         every 2-4h. Its OD600 was measured by the ultraviolet spectrophotometer. OD600 reflected a                         growth of yeasts which can judge whether yca1 knockout can improve yeast tolerance to                         H2O2. The results are shown as follow:
