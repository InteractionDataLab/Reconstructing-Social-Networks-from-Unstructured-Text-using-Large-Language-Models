I just earned my Bachelor's degree of Biological Sciences at the University of Bonn where I majored in Microbiology and Biotechnology. I am currently attending the Master's program Microbiology and Biochemistry at the University of Göttingen specializing in Molecular Genetics, Microbial Cell Biology and Biochemistry. This will be my first iGEM participation and I am eagerly looking forward to working on our project. It will be an opportunity to work independently and on our own responsibility and to learn a lot about lab work in general. I am looking forward to take part in the international competition to gain valuable experiences that will broaden my horizon.
Anna Maria Köhler
Hello my name is Anna and I'm a student of the Microbiology and Biochemistry Master in Göttingen as well. When I was in school, we had a practical week with a professor from an university. Since this laboratory experience, I decided to study biology and to become a scientist! I did my bachelor thesis in structural biochemistry in Göttingen, where I became a fan of proteins. Participating the iGEM Team means very much to me, because I'm looking forward to work independently and I"
BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Notebook#Cholera - Enzyme#March-April#Period1#Dailylog_-_-_TEXT.html," and forms a mucoid biofilm. The major component of the biofilm is alginate.
Alginate is a copolymer of (1,4)-linked beta-D-mannuronic acid and alpha-L-guluronic acid.
Two alginate lyases were studied: A1-III and AlgL.
When tested individually, each showed slight biofilm degradation (25-30%) degradation. However, when either was used in conjunction with tobramycin there was 100% biofilm degradation.
This was tested on forms of the bacteria that both do and don't create alginate, thus the biofilm degradation was not linked to the alginate lyase function specifically.
The same results occurred whether or not they used the intact lyase protein, an inactive mutant, or the individual amino acids.
They postulate that the lyase enzyme is used as a food source, the presence of which induces a natural partial breakdown of the biofilm as bacteria spread to grow. This spreading raises the efficiency of the tobramycin and allows for 100% biofilm degradation.
I wonder if we could produce the environmental triggers that cause cholera biofilms to break apart in the intestines, we might be able to do something similar
Molobela, I.; Cloete, T.; Beukes, M. Protease and Amylase Enzymes for Biofilm Removal and Degradation of Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS) Produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens Bacteria. Afr. J. Microbiol. Res. 2010, 4, 1515-1524.
One major problem of degrading biofilms is that the effectiveness of an enzyme to degrade a biofilm depends upon the specific composition of the biofilm and its extracellular polymeric substance.
Synthetic polysaccharides have been used in the past to degrade the biofilms of several bacteria, but are not effective with all biofilms.
They grew Pseudomonas fluorescens biofilms, then extracted the EPS to determine its carbohydrate and protein composition.
A series of commercial enzymes were tested  with the proteases Savinase and Everlase the most effective in reducing protein concentration within the EPS.
They postulate that proteases will be most effective against EPS with a higher protein concentration and amylase enzymes will be most effective against EPS with a higher carbohydrate concentration.
However, they also believe that the relative concentrations of proteins and carbohydrates depends upon the growth environment of the biofilm and can change from location to location, even for the same species of bacteria.

As usual, the height                                         of the microalgae culture pond cannot exceed 0.5 m. In other words, we have to                                         build a 7 m diameter culture pond with the volume of 19000L. In constrast,                                         engineered E. coli is not limited by light. The bioreactor of E. coli can be built with any height in the indoor or outdoor. To scale up the                                         bioreactor, a 5.8 m diameted with 1.9 m height equals to 51000 L which has                                         lower floor area required.
As a result,the bioreactor of engineered E. coli can                                         save more than 30% floor area compared with micoralgae culture pond. Take the                                         floor area of Taiwan as an example, we can build 94 billions of microalgae                                         culture pond to uilize 10% of annual emission with 12 operation hours. However,                                         1 over 3 of floor area will be save if we replace them with E. coli bioreactor. E. coli bioreactor is more flexible on spacing using, and is                                         less sensitive to weather effect.
Cost
The most expensive source in the medium of our engineered E. coli is xylose.                                     1 mole of xylose will capture 0.17 mole of CO2.                                     Therefore, we need 20.0535 kg of xylose while 1 kg of xylose costs 2 USD.                                     The total cost for our engineered E. coli requires 40.107 USD for capture 1                                     ton of CO2.                                     In contrast, microalgae needs 1000 liter to capture 250 g of CO2,                                     so it needs 4000 liter (about 4 tons) water while 1 ton costs 9.78 USD.                                     The total cost for microalgae is 39.13 USD.

A colony of BL21DE3+pACYCdxCas9Tn5lacZgRNA was used for inoculation of 60mL liquid starter culture (Luria Broth, complemented with chloramphenicol) following the Liquid Starter Culture Protocol.
The idea was to inoculate a white phenotype colony (BL21DE3 + pACYCTn5 + MEpKantME, plated on LB+Xgal+IPTG+Cam+Kan, 15/9/2018). But the phenotype has changed over two days to form a red colony.

They introduced many common insect-capturing tools to us, such as adhesive tool for catching moths and flies, also Full-net pheromone insect-capturing tools, etc. In addition, they also provided many treasured comments and advices for us to improve our project and device. This led a deeper consideration of our future testings and the problems  we might encounter with the potential use of our device.
We appreciate Sunnymorning organic farm with huge gratitude, for they are willing to help us out on testing our device, along with capturing our target female moths, which is a very critical portion of our project, and also letting us evaluate the number of female moths needed in order to test the basic effects of our PBAN. We gained a lot afte cooperation with Sunnymorning. First of all, we began overwhelming with our project and with the process during capture. Second, we were got the advices and enthusiasm from farmer. Most importantly, we took a great leap forward and had accomplished some of the most significant progress in our project!

Experience Sharing of Capturing Bloodsucking Flies in The Farm:
Dr. Tzeng told us livestock farmers used to borrow insect light traps from them to capture Bloodsucking Flies. To our surprise, light traps can capture even thousands of insects in just one night. Additionally, they also had some cooperation program with livestock farmers. At that time, they used many interesting approaches, such as altering light's color and intensity, to test the behavior of Bloodsucking Flies. This experience sharing provided us with some basic methods in testing insect behavior.

Discussion about Ecological Equilibrium Problem of Our Project：
Since ecological equilibrium might become the main issue that we will face in our project, Dr. Tzeng mentioned a fundamental question of why human kept on farming. Dr. Tzeng highlighted the importance of human survival, which is a special view point. Although farming is harmful to our environment, we should not regard the destruction of environment as a problem. Instead, we have to keep planting crop in order to produce enough food to survive.

Fig.0.2 The working principle of our protein
Because the protein sequences we targeted are from human breast cell, which may have some rare codons. These rare codons may lead to the abnormal expression of tubulin in prokaryote. In order to solve this problem, we use E.coli Rossatta(DE3) as our expression strain [2] [3] .
Our PART-design can be divided into three groups:
α-tubulin, β-tubulin expression parts.
FLC-based fusion protein expression parts.
BiFC-based fusion protein expression parts.
As a control group of our project, we extract microtubule from porcine brain to explore the conditions of tubulin aggregation in vitro, which also provide important experimental data to our modeling part. Click to see.
Project
1. Expression of α-tubulin, β-tubulin
Taxol plays an important role in mammalian tubulin aggregation, the mainly interaction sites are K19, V23, D26, H227, F270 on β-tubulin [4] . After analyzing the sequence from human breast cancer cell, we determine that tubulin-taxol interactions exist theoretically. Thus we design and synthesize primers based on the sequence of human β-tubulin, adding Hind III and Xho I restrictive sites to the 5' and 3' flanked sites respectively. We extract mRNA from Mcf7(human breast cancer cell line), obtain cDNAs via reverse transcription and use these as PCR templates to get a-tubulin, β-tubulin respectively.
We ligate α-tubulin, β-tubulin to pET30a(+) vector. The target genes were on the up stream of his-tag and down stream of T7 promoter, and transform the constructed vectors into E.coli TransB(DE3) to express our protein [12] [13] [14] . After expression, a-tubulin and β-tubulin aggregate spontaneously in vitro [6] .
We collaborate with FAFU-CHINA. They help us to verify whether our constructed vectors can express active tubulin monomers in prokaryotic system.
Their team plan to use Co-Immunoprecipitation(CoIP) to confirm their interaction. Since pET30a(+) has His protein tag, they plan"

These results clearly indicate that it is highly beneficial for higher cell densities and better growth to cultivate in larger well plates. Furthermore, shaking at higher frequencies can improve the growth, as show in the validation of microcultivations .    The graphical determination of the maximum specific growth rates is shown in Figure 8.
Figure 8: Graphical determination of the maximum specific growth rates for the cultivations carried out in 96 well plates by the iGEM team UNIFI .
Graphical determination of the specific growth rates and the minimum doubling times revealed substantially weaker growth of the cultures in 96 well plates compared to 12 well plates or shake flasks. E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2(66-575) reached the highest specific growth rate with 0,11 ± 0,002 h-1. E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2 showed much weaker growth with a maximum specific growth rate of 0,041 ± 0,004 h-1.

Compared to the shake flask cultivations and the micro cultivations in 12 well plates, far lower maximum specific growth rates and much higher minimum doubling times were reached.
Verification of the Function of PtNTT2
To verify that PtNTT2 fulfills its desired function, a simple experiment was designed. Usually, the function of nucleotide transporters is determined using radioactively labeled nucleotides. Given that we did not want to work with radioactively labeled nucleotides and that not every lab and iGEM team has access to suitable equipment, we focused on verifying the function using a less dangerous and better accesible method.
Under phosphate starvation, E. coli secretes phosphatases to utilize the phosphates from nucleotides as phosphate source. On the other hand, cells expressing PtNTT2 and integrating it into the inner membrane should be able to take up nucleoside triph"

Tec-Monterrey,2018,Team:Tec-Monterrey#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," requires adequate approaching to the problem.
Monitoring data from pesticides and heavy metals can represent a big problem especially in developing countries, due to the cost of analysis and the need to sample at important times of the year. People often have difficulty carrying out analysis due to impure reagents, inappropriate facilities and financial barriers. It is imperative to find new techniques to reduce costs and increase reliability of the procedures. We’ll briefly describe the activities, meetings, and experiences that built the foundation of our Human Practices.
Developing the Action Plan
Chiapas and Tabasco are homes to the largest indigenous populations in Mexico. These communities have economies primarily based on the cultivation of corn, coffee, mangos, and beans.  A member of our team had been reading Chiapas’ local newspaper for a while and told us something which concerned us all. Hydrological pollution has been present in Southern Mexico due to the incorrect management of urban, industrial, and agrochemical waste. These carelessness for the environment has led to the death of fish, birds and manatees, all within a very short period of time. Furthermore, at least 200 people have been reported to have lacerations and wounds on their skin due to exposure of lead and cadmium.
After discussing and pondering the effects of the environmental problematic, we decided to approach stakeholders and the communities affected. A member of our team, Sofía, lived in Chiapas for a very long period of time. She had the first contact with governmental and non-governmental organizations, she travelled to Chiapas with one purpose; to develop the action plan to assess the severity of the problem.
Meeting with the Citizen Council of Tuxtla Gutiérrez
Sofía attended a meeting with people from Cecropia, an organization that takes care of global problems at a local scale, Concretos Modernos del Sur, a cement factory and the Environmental and Public Spaces Commission. After discussing the severity of the problem, Cecropia gladly agreed provide coordinates of locations reported to have dangerous concentrations of hazardous compounds such as heavy metals, nitrates, and phosphates.

CASE 3: Biomass using wheat stillage and sugar beet molasses - mass production
There is much established work in the area of mass-producing bacteria for medical purposes, primarily focused on probiotics. The large-scale growth of lactic acid bacteria is commonplace, which provides established protocols that we can follow to produce our IL-2 secreting lactobacilli. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) like lactobacilli require a large amount of nutrients for growth, and sourcing high-quality growth medium is very expensive. This problem can be overcome by utilizing effluent waste products from agricultural processes as growth media for our lactobacili. This approach involves obtaining waste produced as a byproduct of corn, wheat, and other grain processing and using it as growth media, as it is rich in the sugars, proteins, and other macronutrients important for bacterial growth. A study showed that using effluent waste results in bacterial yields equal to those obtained through traditional growth medium, demonstrating the efficacy of this technique.1 This approach would be a cost-effective solution to producing our bacteria, and consequently would reduce the downstream drug costs to patients, hospitals, and other healthcare stakeholders (i.e. the Government of Ontario subsidizing healthcare costs). This makes our treatment more likely to be a cost-efficient alternative to current cancer treatment methods.

CASE 4: IL-2 therapy: Safety and risk evaluations
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine signaling molecule within the immune system. It is responsible for regulating the activity of leukocytes. This keeps the immune system protected against microbial infections by distinguishing between foreign and resident cells. It allows for the prevention of autoimmune diseases by promoting the differentiation of immature T cells into regulatory cells. This allows for the body to fight off infections. Due to this, it is marketed as a protein therapeutic, Proleukin, for the treatment of cancer. High-dose interleukin-2 in fact resulted in objective clinical regression of metastatic cancer in 15% to 17% of patients.1
This was the cornerstone around which the research of McMaster iGEM’s (mGEM) wet lab focused on. mGEM’s research is for a non invasive and highly selective method for treating gastrointestinal tumour cells"

I divided these by the respective concentrations, giving 7.7uL and 10.7uL respectively. However, I want to do a 10uL reaction so I divided 7.7uL and 10.7uL by 2 to keep the ratio. This gave me 3uL for the vector and 5 uL for the insert. I ran the ligation in the PCR machine at 16C overnight.

Since the transformation results had a significant different between the control and variable, I did a colony PCR on 10 random colonies from the 100uL plate. After PCR, I ran a gel which had 8 successful clones. 1,3-5, 7-10. The RcsA insert was 624bp and the LacI promoter is 75bp, which is a total of 699bp. The successful clones hand one band around between the 600 and 700 region on the ladder. So it is most likely a clone with the RcsA insert and sequencing needs to be done to confirm it.  See gel below. File:IGEM 2010-07-01 LacI+RcsA Colony PCR gel.jpg

How?
From the literature review, two different genetic circuit configurations were contemplated: A synthetic transcriptional cascade approach, which has been showed to perform time-delay behavior in previous studies [ 4 ] and an approach based on post-transcriptional regulation which we termed biosynthetic AND gate .
As the conjugation system will have two plasmids (signal and helper plasmids), the approach followed in this sub-project was to split the construction of the time-delay genetic circuit in two independent plasmids which in theory should be present in a single cell in order to initialize the time-delay. This can be achieved given two different selection markers and the application of the two different selection pressures.
Due to the expected long delay time needed, an optimistic approach will be the combination of both approaches, synthetic transcriptional cascade and biosynthetic AND gate in order to gain a desire phenotype.
Figure 3. Time-delay genetic circuit approach. Two approaches have been considered: 1) (Blue circle) Synthetic transcriptional cascade, the delay is due to a sequential expression of genes, and 2) (Green circle) Biosynthetic AND gate, the delay is due to the need of the presence of two different events and post-transcriptional control. In order to achieve a long delay both approaches could be ultimately combined.

Student Education
Cornell Adult University Youth Program
Cornell Adult University (CAU) Youth Program offers young students a taste of what college life is like. Teenagers between 13 and 15 years old are led by counselors through a week of varied camp activities, field trips, and educational sessions. Once every week for three weeks, we taught a science sampler class to a group of 20 students. We discussed the basics of synthetic biology and biotechnology, asked them about their thoughts on genetically modified organisms, and conducted fun science activities. The highlight of this course was teaching them to extract DNA from a strawberry using simple household chemicals. Overall, this outreach program was a fun and educational experience for the teens - having gooey Strawberry DNA to play with was certainly a plus!
Splash! at Cornell
Splash! at Cornell is a one-day educational program that offers secondary school students in the 7th-12th grades the chance to take classes in any subject, taught entirely by undergraduate and graduate students. Founded by two of our iGEM team members, this program had its pilot event in Fall 2014 and invited over 75 students to our campus for an innovative educational program in collaboration with the Cornell Public Service Center, the Cornell Institute for Biology Teachers, and the national non-profit Learning Unlimited.
iGEM team members taught a course about the principles of synthetic biology, incorporating demos, humor, and an overview about our project this year. Splash! was such a great opportunity for us to shed light on the iGEM experience to young minds as well as potential future participants. Interestingly enough, it should only be fitting that it was through a similar course at MIT Splash! several years ago that the pioneering Cornell iGEM team members first learned about iGEM and synthetic biology. Ultimately, this was a great opportunity and we were overjoyed to have had the opportunity to return the favor and spark interest in the next generation of scientists.

Founded in the  winter of 2007, Hong Kong, the iHKU team has  been enjoying its adventure in the world of synthetic biology in the past 10  months. Though we iHKU members come together with different backgrounds, it  never becomes a problem for us to concentrate and contribute to our project.  Instead, we overcame uncountable difficulties we have encountered with the help  of our knowledge from different fields. As we know that the only way to build a  successful synthetic biology project is to try it out, great effort has been  made to serve the very purpose. With great passion and creativity, we are  confident to deliver the most brilliant project this year.

        There are three main types of lithic relics in Hangzhou; they are stone sculptures, stone towers also known as Dhavaja, and stone inscriptions. The stone sculptures are primarily represented by Feilai Peak (飞来峰), Ciyun Ridge (慈云岭), and Statue of Mahakala in Baocheng Temple (宝成寺麻曷葛剌). Stone Towers are primarily represented by White Tower (白塔). Stone inscriptions are primarily represented by Hetingwuhe Fubei on Lonely Mountain (孤山放鹤亭舞鹤赋碑).
        Plus, Feilai Peak and White Tower are National Key Historical Relics.      Most lithic relics encounter physical, chemical and biological interaction, resulting in weathering corrosion, pulverisation lesion, cracking, contamination, and colour mottling. Those phenomena jeopardise the value of lithic relics and even lithic relics themselves, and the lithic relics in Hangzhou are not of exceptions.
        In 2002, some of the classic lithic relics were inspected and it was found that the surface of Feilai Peak Sculpture was greatly ruined (Figure 1), and there is leaking on Ciyun Ridge Sculpture (Figure 2)..
    Meanwhile, Cultural Relics Department of China has been trying to maintain and recover the lithic relics. Since 2002, Cultural Relics Department of China mainly has been removing surface deposit, depleting pounding, strengthening crag, and changing flora; the government washed Feilai Peak Sculpture for many times (Figure 3).Government built a top above the Ciyun Peak Sculpture, this relic no longer had to expose to sun and rain henceforward (Figure 4).
    White Tower was comprehensively cleaned and strengthened by silicone by Zhejiang University of Technology (Figure 5).
     The power plants and railways were removed. During the washing, the staff intentionally left part of this tower intact, and made an contrast for further research of anti-contamination and anti-weathering (Figure 5-3, 5-4)
    However, 2015 field research shows most external lithic murals, statue, and towers still suffer from damage. Some even"

The question then becomes at which timestep the        density field should be sampled to provide the source term in the PDEs.       If only the density field at one particular timestep is chosen to       represent the density field during the entire interval $[t;t+\Delta t]$,       it is clear that a lot of information is lost because type A       cells produce molecules continuously as they move       trough space.
Therefore we record the density fields at all timesteps and       since the last PDE evaluation and average of them. That way       we avoid skewing the results of the PDE solver       too much when the time step of the agents is reduced.       In the videoplayer below we illustrate this using a simple system       involving a single agent moving along a quasi-1-dimensional domain       with a smaller timestep than the PDE solver. When the density       is not averaged, the production of AHL and leucine appear to be spiked       at regular intervals. However, when our averaging method is used       the production shows a more uniform profile, which is closer to       the ideal case of continuous production.

Bandwidth Tuning
As we scaled up our model to realistic dimensions we found that the    discretization of the PDE grid had to grow very large relative to    the size of bacteria. Therefore, if we kept the bandwidth constant    while scaling up the grid size, it would become possible for    the grid to ""miss"" the bacteria. Indeed, as the reach of the kernel functions    stays constant and the distance between adjacent grid points becomes    larger than the diameter of kernel functions, agents will    inevitably start falling off the radar. In the extreme case of small    bandwidth and large grid spacing, no agents will be picked up by    density calculations at all and their contribution to AHL and leucine    production will be completely lost.
Therefore, as the PDE grid is scaled up, the bandwidth needs to be increased    accordingly.     However this       inflation of the bandwidth can lead to a situation where the kernel function       covers significantly more area than what the actual    bacterium physically occupies. In this case the interpretation    the kernel function can be altered to represent       a probability function for    a cell's position.    We were able to avoid increasing the bandwidth to unrealistic proportions    while scaling up the PDE grid dimensions by        running our simulations at the        Flemish Supercomputer Center (VSC).

First Stage Assembly
Design
Several strategies are designed for the first stage assembly, the assembly includes three different parts that we constructed. One of them is the AND Gate Module (without output), the second is the Bistable module that we inherited from iGEM 2007 Team Peking, and the third part T7promoter CI acts as a bridge which is both the output of the AND Gate and the input to the bistable module.
fig1. AND Gate part
fig2. Bistable part
fig3. T7promoter CI part
Considering the size of the plasmid and replication origin compatibility of the plasmids, we draw up the following methods to assembly the system by making combinations among the available plasmids and those parts. What we wanted to do is to pick out a result that most approaches our need. And then further carry out mutation on the ribosome binding site for fine tuning if necessary.
The bistable switch is inherited from iGEM Team Peking 2007, it is constructed to have two reporter genes on CI and CI434 side, the CI434 side is GFP gene, and the CI side is RFP gene. We kept the two reporter genes to direct our assembly. The signal is given through the AND Gate, and test whether the fluoresence state is changed.
First Strategy: This strategy is picked because in this way the AND Gate is intact with its input and output on one plasmid. And that the bistable switch is on an independent plasmid so that it has no influence on other modules and vice versa. T7 promoter-CI is placed both upstream and downstream of the AND Gate, for the reason that they are different in their mutual influence.

Law and Regulation
Overview
The legal frameworks surrounding synthetic biology are critically important because they determine what type of research can be undertaken, by selecting for research that is legally allowable, available and has potential commercial implications. However, scientists often fail to effectively lobby for frameworks that support their research needs whilst the current law remains inadequate
1
.
Our UNSW team discovered, as part of our foray into commercialisation and due diligence on our scaffold elements, that biotechnological patent law is difficult to comprehend from the scientific perspective. In Australia particularly, the legal test for patents is long and convoluted, and requires a thorough understanding of previous cases
1
. However, our team successfully interpreted the law to conclude that our scaffold was not patentable (reinforcing our modular ‘Foundational Advance’ technology approach) and that we could use our preferred protein-protein bonding mechanism.
Considering this context, the UNSW team has come up with a creative solution – we have created a scientist’s guide to writing a policy proposal for government change, and written an example submission. We have also documented our discussions with various stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry, intellectual property academics, the UNSW Law Society, and the 2018 Pasteur Paris iGEM team.
Figure 1: Flowchart diagram of the legal processes undertaken by UNSW iGEM and the outcomes.
Relevance
The legal sphere may seem divorced from the practice of science in the laboratory, but in reality, they are closely intertwined, with three key points of intersection.
Commercialisation
The law can grant protection over ‘inventions’ made by scientists
3
. The protection the law grants can then allow the invention to be commercialised, and incentivises companies to invest in research to get a competitive advantage in the market – without fear of unmitigated copying. The law aims to encourage and assist innovation, instead of stifling it, by allowing market forces (and individual scientists) to capitalise on invention.
It also means that the research with the most funding is typically the research which is"

Construction of Controllers in GR286
We chose an engineered bacteria GR286 (a simplified strain of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3) as the chassis of our controllers. In order to ensure the efficiency of our Consumer, we first knocked out the luxS gene in the GR286 with a markerless gene replacement method.
After that, the luxS gene was overexpressed in GR286 to construct AI-2 Supplier and the lsrACDB, lsrFG, lsrK genes were overexpressed in GR286 in which luxS gene has been knocked out to construct AI-2 consumer.
May 16- Jul 31
Functional Test of Controllers
The growth curves were measured to explore the function of Controllers. The growth states of Controllers were similar to that of the GR286 strain, which was not in line with our expectations.
Then the cultured media of Supplier was tested for the presence of AI-2 by inducing luminescence of Vibrio harveyi reporter strain BB170. The result showed that the Supplier failed to produce more AI-2.
Aug 01-Aug 14
Construction of Controllers in Escherichia coli
Since the controllers we constructed with GR286 did not demonstrate positive results, we decided to substitute GR286 with Escherichia coli whose AI-2 metabolic pathway had been elucidated as the chassis of our controller.
To construct the Supplier, luxS gene was overexpressed alone in E. coli, and the luxS, mtn genes were overexpressed jointly in another type of Supplier. As for the Consumer, pLsrACDB, pLsrACDBFG, pLsrACDBK and pLsrACDBFGK were constructed respectively in E. coli.
Aug 15- Sep 11
Functional Test of Controllers
We firstly detected the expression of several overexpressed genes at the mRNA and protein levels by RT-PCR and SDS-PAGE and obtained positive results. Then, cultured media of controllers were tested for the presence of AI-2 by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). AI-2 output and uptake profiles of controllers were drawn according to the HPLC results. The results"

Testing for the Effect of Fluoride on CHOP on E. coli Growth at Different Concentrations of Chloramphenicol
June 23rd, 2017
In order to test for the concentration of Chloramphenicol that yielded the highest dynamic range for the switch CHOP, CHOP (with grown overnight in the presence of fluoride), and ∆crcB were plated on different concentrations of Chloramphenicol. They were then incubated for several days.
For 5ug/mL of chloramphenicol, both CHOP and delta-crcB grew, while for 125 ug/mL, none of them grew for all three days. However, on 35ug/mL, there was differential growth of CHOP on plates with and without fluoride. This allowed us to determine 35ug/mL as a reasonable concentration of chloramphenicol for future experiments.
Characterizing the Growth of ΔcrcB at Various Levels of Fluoride in the Presence and Absence of the Wild Type E. coli
July 22nd, 2017
Wild type and ∆crcB were grown directly next to each other at varying levels of fluoride. As described in literature, ∆crcB should not grow when exposed to fluoride levels over 500µM. Unexpectedly, ∆crcB did grow on high levels of fluoride when placed on the same plates as wild type E. coli. Without wild type E. coli, no growth of ∆crcB was seen on 1mM and 2mM fluoride.
In order to figure out the cause of the unexpected growth, we reached out to Dr. Randy Stockbridge at University of Michigan for possible explanations. Dr. Stockbridge informed us that fluoride can only cross the membrane in acidic conditions as hydrofluoric acid. Therefore, we hypothesized that the wild type altered the pH of the agar to a more basic level, facilitating the growth of ∆crcB.
Testing for the Wild Type’s Effect on pH of LB Agar with Buffers
July 22nd, 2017
In order to test the hypothesis that the Wild Type E. coli changes the pH of the agar to allow growth of ΔcrcB, we plated WT and ΔcrcB together, and one without WT. All plates had either no buffer"
TAS_Taipei,2016,Team:TAS Taipei#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,", a change in the amount of crystallin does not impact crystallin damage, as H2O2 only degrades a small portion of crystallin that causes blurred lens. (Cui X.L 1993)
The crystallin in humans is similar in function as crystallin in fish. This allows us to use experimental data on fish into this model.
When the experiments diluted the cataract lens protein, the amount of crystallin is diluted. However, the final absorbance of degraded crystallin is also diluted, so we assume any errors in absorbance is canceled out.
In the fish used, we assume there is there is no GSR. GSR decreases the amount of H2O2 in the fish, but since we could not find the amount of GSR in the fish, we must make this assumption.
Data Analysis
Using Experimental Data for Model
In each trial (see Data Documentation), we added H2O2 of a known concentration to fish lens, and allowed crystallin to degrade for some set time.  With all four assumptions, we can calculate the theoretical crystallin damage that occurred. Meanwhile, experimentally we found the absorbance of the degraded crystallin. We find a link between crystallin damage and absorbance.
Figure 4.A: Absorbance vs. Crystallin Damage. This is experimental data, comparing observations (absorbance) with the theoretical crystallin damage. With this graph, we can find the equivalence between absorbance and crystallin damage.
Model Adjustment
When determining the relationship between absorbance and crystallin, in Figure 4.A the best fit line has a x – intercept that is nonzero. However, when converting each absorbance rating to equivalent crystallin damage in Table 1, we ignore the constant term. When doing the experiments, the fish lens may have contained GSH that is still active, so the fact that the crystallin is exposed to H2O2, the degradation reaction does not happen until all GSH is depleted, and crystallin damage begins to form. We subtract around 1 unit of crystallin damage from all values, as shown in Figure 4.B.
Figure 4.B: Model Adjustment. Theoretically, this should be a direct relation, so we assume that the remaining GSH inside the fish lens is being used in the first unit of crystallin damage, so no increase in absorbance is found at this range.
Discussion
Error Analysis
There are some limitations of the model that arise from our assumptions. We assume that fish and human lens contain similar crystallin proteins that are degraded in the similar manner."

TAL (transcription activator-like) effectors are proteins secreted by Xanthomonas bacteria via their type III secretion system when they infect various plant species. These proteins are able to bind promoter sequences in the host plant and to activate the expression of plant genes that aid bacterial infection.[1]
What can TAL effectors do and how do they function?
There appears to be a one-to-one correspondence between the identity of two critical amino acids in each repeat and each DNA base in the target sequence. [2]As a result, TAL effectors have attracted great interest as DNA targeting tools.
Their targeting specificity is determined by a central domain of tandem, 33–35 amino acid repeats, followed by a single truncated repeat of 20 amino acids. The majority of naturally occurring TAL effectors examined have between 12 and 27 full repeats. A polymorphic pair of adjacent residues at positions 12 and 13 in each repeat, the ‘repeat-variable di-residue’ (RVD), specifies the target, one RVD to one nucleotide, with the four most common RVDs each preferentially associating with one of the four bases.[3][4]
Figure 1. Structure of a naturally occurring TAL effector[5]
What’s the weakness of TAL effector?
This simple code between amino acids in TAL effectors and DNA bases in their target sites might be useful for protein engineering applications. Numerous groups have designed artificial TAL effectors capable of recognizing new DNA sequences in a variety of experimental systems. It has been reported that TAL effectors target genes efficiently in many eukaryocytic cells like mammalian cells and yeasts. However, the former experiments with E. coli indicate that TAL effectors don’t work well in E. coli cells.
What are we doing?
We attempt to construct a marvelous TALEs system which can efficiently work in prokaryotic organisms. By optimizing the TALEs coding sequence with modeling methods （Genetic Algorithm） and testing it by Golden Gate Assembly and Report System, we hope we can have"

Divya Tankasala
I'm a freshman at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and I'm majoring in Bioengineering, with an intended track focus on biomechanics. I learned about iGEM through another organization I'm involved in - the Society of Women Engineers. I decided to apply for iGEM because I found it to be very unique when compared to normal undergraduate research work. As a bioengineer, I'm really excited to be part of a student-run research competition associated with synthetic biology and genetic engineering! In my free time, I blog (tumblr), read just about any random article I find lying around, blast an eclectic variety music through my noise-cancelling headphones, handle various alumni relations as a member of SWE and Engineering Student Ambassadors, eat like a machine, and work until obscene hours of the night. Go iGEM!

Then we designed this question based on our project and the aim is to know how people think about saline-alkali land. The data we collected is shown below.
The result shows three fourth people only have basic acknowledge about saline-alkali land. They just know the harm of it but they don’t know how it comes out. It shows that saline-alkali land doesn’t draw people’s attention enough.
Q6:If there’s a bacteria transformed to ease the saline-alkali land and is rich around root level, are you willing to eat the crops growing on this soil?
This question is designed to get aware of people’s attitude about biology.
The data shows that over a half people are uncertain about the crops growing with artificial transformed bacteria. The survey shows there’re still many people have understanding deviation of synthetic biology. So we expect that synthetic biology can be spread wilder and promote people’s life actively.
Q7:If you joined iGEM, which track will you choose to be your project?
At last we surveyed about the hot point about iGEM. In these choices, most people choose “food and nutrition”. “Gene diagnosis” and “environment” are flat. Only a little people choose “energy” and “information”. This is a little different from what we guess."

Cambridge-JIC,2016,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," and Sap1). This plasmid could not be submitted to the registry due to lack of standard parts. The genes inserted were: VFP (verde fluorescent protein) and smGFP (green fluorescent protein), both codon-optimized for expression in the chloroplast.
Below in the images we can see growth of the colonies on the kanamycin and spectinomycin plates.
(a) Algae biolistically transformed plated only on TAP medium
(b) Algae biolistically transformed with aphA6 cassette conferring resistance to kanamycin
(c) Algae biolistically transformed with aadA cassette conferring resistance to spectinomycin.
Although this seems highly promising, some colonies were also seen to grow on the positive control plates. Our initial consideration was that a layer of algae had died and thus new colonies were forming on these and so avoiding contact with the antibiotic in the medium. This was disproved by replating colonies from each plate onto a new antibiotic+TAP media plate and growth was seen newly. If un-transformed we would have expected to see death of the re-streaked colonies. In addition to this, these antibiotic genes are not used in the department we are based in so we believe contamination is highly unlikely. Although this is only empirical evidence and molecular studies are needed to fully verify, we consider that the cause of growth on the negative control plates might have been due to lack of complete aseptic technique on our behalf.
A set of diagnostic colony PCR were conducted but were inconclusive. The first round was used by directly picking a colony and restreaking on a new plate. The primers were designed to anneal to the backbone and the inserted gene of interest, as this was indicative of both the presence  of the backbone as well as the gene of interest. The gel showed a smear which we thought was due to an excess of genetic material. The PCR was repeated with the same conditions, but this time the picked colony was diluted into 10 μL of water before adding 1 μL to the PCR reaction mix. Further, a positive control for the backbones was included. Yet, still the results were inconclusive and needed more work trouble-shooting.
This first intent shows to a certain degree, the potential of parts to make modular constructs to transform chloroplasts in plant organisms, widening the scope of the iGEM competition for new and exciting ideas. Requiring optimization the protocol can be further improved by subsequent teams, as plant synthetic biology grows within iGEM. Future work also involves the use of the DIY open-source biolistics gene"
Cornell_NY,2016,Team:Cornell NY#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," a small dairy farm with 90 cows about an hour away from campus. The owner of the farm showed us the milking process and told us that the most intensive part of bovine mastitis was disease prevention. Ensuring the cows and their environment were clean is time consuming, but crucial to prevent mastitis. Due to Snofarm's size, antibiotics were a last resort for the owners, and they preferred helping the cow heal on its own.

Vet Dairy Teaching Barn
Ithaca, NY
Shortly after, we visited Cornell's Vet Dairy Teaching Barn. Located close to campus, the Vet Dairy Teaching barn supplies milk and is often used for educational purposes and outreach events. We met with Charles, who showed us the milking process. He informed us about the methods that he uses to prevent and treat bovine mastitis, and showed us the instruments used to inject antibiotics into a cow. After our talk with Charles, we decided that mastitis prevention efforts were more important during the milking period than during the dry period. We saw that during milking, the first bit of milk from the teat is squirted onto the floor as a visual test for bovine mastitis, and decided to create a more sophisticated method for bovine mastitis detection.

Ithaca, NY
Dr. Daryl Nydam is the reigning milk quality expert in New York State. He works at the Quality Milk Production Services (QMPS) located on Cornell’s campus, which serves all of New York. The QMPS is world-renowned for its diagnostic services, mastitis prevention programs, and educational assistance. Dr. Nydam gave us information about different types of bovine mastitis-causing pathogens and the bacteriocins that target them. Rare species are worth targeting because a single outbreak can quickly become detrimental. Infection by Gram-negative pathogens is common because they are found in abundance in the milking environment. Gram-positive pathogens are the most virulent and traditionally must be treated with antibiotics. Our wet lab team decided to target a few species"
USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html,") tools, such as TinkerCell and Synbioss, have been developed to model and simulate biological systems and give the system behaviors as guides. However, they all need users to provide details of the system network, such as the activation and repression of transcription and translation reactions in genetic regulatory network. It is so difficult for even professionals to construct a detailed network of a complex system depending only on their minds. In this sense, modeling through CAD tools will not reduce the work of modeling: users are actually required to model manually and input their model in details.
However, since our software is developed for non-biological background users, it is unrealistic to expect them to model their design manually. To solve this problem, the USTC_Software 2010 team attempts to take synthetic biology modeling one step further by introducing new methods for automatic modeling of biological systems. Just as the word automation implies, users are only required to submit their assembling of parts, and the generation of biological model is automatically done by our program. Being the first-ever team trying to develop a synthetic biology automatic modeling tool, we focus on genetic regulatory network for the first year and develop our software tool, iGaME, which will assist the design of genetic function modules for biological systems in synthetic biology. We believe this will greatly relieve users from handling complex interactions of species in biological system.
Many novel and revolutionary concepts are proposed during our development. The first is our Chain-Node model for complex structure with multiple chains bound together. It is necessary for automation since behaviors of species (such as how it react with other species) must be determined by their structures instead of their names: it is impossible to construct a universal name-based reaction database applying for different systems. The next is Template . A species with a certain structure is a template species, and a reaction occurring between several template species is a template reaction. The introduction of Template makes it possible to describe a group of reactions with same structure-determined reaction mechanism. Finally, based on our Chain-Node and Template concept, we propose an XML-based Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language (MoDeL for abbreviation) to fully characterize Species and Reaction in templates with clear definitions of elements and attributes in XML fashion. It is a database language for next generation when automatic modeling is widely used throughout the world. To know more, users are suggested to read this One-Minute Introduction to have an intuitive idea of our modeling system.
Though we have no enough time to achieve our ultimate goal completely, we have successfully developed a MoDeL-based, automatic modeling and simulation software. Our program falls into 3 major components. The first component"

Journal Club
  
  For most of us weren't familiar with Synthetic Biology, we held a journal club. Everyone had a task of reading a paper, then all of us shared what we learned in the format of presentation. Here is a partial summary of all the members' presentation (including some classmates who were interested in iGEM but didn't join us at last).
  For more information and slides, please click here .
  
  Chen Yao: talked about bistability, which is a fundamental phenomenon in nature indicating a system consisting of two stable states. Bistability is very important in biology, especially in bacteriophage. A typical example is the lytic and lysogenic states of bacteriophage’s life circle.
  Pan Yidan: made a detailed tutorial on how to edit wiki. She gave an on-the-spot demo including creating, editing, formatting and adding links/images/files/reference on sandbox. Besides, she was responsible for loading all slides on wiki.
  Guo Jingyao: introduced two dimensional pattern formation which is about a hallmark of cooridinated cell behavior in both single and multicelluar organisms, typically involving cell to cell communication and intrcellular single processing. It might has wide application in biomaterial engineering and biosensing.
  Wang Jiale: gave an introduction to one of the primary term of synthetic biology, the biobricks. Biobricks, the standard biological parts are DNA sequences of defined structure and functions which share a common interface and are designed to be composed and incorporated into living cells such as E.coli to construct new biological systems.
  Wu Zishan: focused on the safety issues of synthetic biology. In her presentation, efforts were devoted to talking about the way to prevent potential terrorist from attacking with biological agents or toxins. She also talked about how to reduce or eliminate exposure of individuals to underlying hazardous agents.

Every read that is assigned wrong will prevent the algorithm performing the linear discriminant analysis from finding liner coefficients that effectively diverge the groups from each other. Unfortunately, Nanopore sequencing has the disadvantage that samples are sequenced one after the other. Even though a washing step is performed between consecutive sequencing runs, parts of the previous libraries remain inside the flow cell and will procude reads. According to Oxford Nanopore technologies, the portion of contaminating reads from previous runs is up to 10 % when washing with the Flow Cell Wash kit EXP-WSH002, depending on the number of previously loaded libraries (see  EXP-WSH002 ). In our experiments, we found the degree of contamination to be even higher for some samples.
Fig. 5: Effect of removing most deviating reads on the normalized signal traces.With an increasing portion of reads that are removed due to their deviation from the median signal at the position of interest, the normalized signals traces become more and more focused to the mean signal of the group being analyzed. Contaminations of previous sequencing libraries are effectively removed.
To face this challenge and to improve the overall quality of the statistical models created with iCG, we implemented an additional filtering algorithm into iCG model that recursively removes reads that are deviating the most from the median signal in the neighboring sequence context of the position of interest. This filtering step is performed on every set of reference reads individually. For deciding which reads are removed, the positions from -2 to +2 bases in relation to the position of interest are evaluated. By setting the parameter --quantiles_to_remove accordingly, the influence of this filtering process can be observed by taking a look at the plots of the signal traces, which are automatically produced and saved by iCG. Due to the recursive nature of the function, which calculates new median values after every single read that has been removed, the algorithm is hardly influencing the reads that truly belong to the reference sample being sequenced, as long as the contamination is lower than 50 %. Figure 5 illustrates the effect of this filtering step on the signal traces of a sequencing run with relatively high contamination. Figure 6 gives an example of the effect on the linear discriminant analysis.

Collaborations
For this year's competition we collaborated with Stanford-Brown, Yale University, and Santa Clara University. For all of the schools we completed surveys that they were distributing.
Stanford-Brown iGEM:
The Stanford-Brown iGEM team was looking into bacterial transformations. Their survey involved having us answer questions regarding our transformation efficiency, and the problems that occurred over the summer. By working with them to complete the survey we are helping Stanford-Brown create a novel method of transformations. If their transformation protocol indeed increases efficiency, then their technique will help future iGEM teams save time and allow them to get further into their projects over the course of the summer.
Yale iGEM:
The main chassis for iGEM tends to be E.Coli, as well as S. Cerevisiae for the eukaryote model. As iGEM continues to expand, more and more teams are beginning to use non-model strains in their work. Both Yale and our team were using non-model strains during this summer. Our work revolved around cyanobacteria, as did Yale's. By working with them to complete their survey, they are building a catalog to help future iGEMers be able to have more materials going into a summer with a non-model organism. Expanding the catalogs available will give more opportunity for iGEM teams to have novel ideas in new organisms that may have desirable characteristics.
Santa Clara iGEM:
Santa Clara University's iGEM team focused on a survey outside of the lab. They were getting in contact with teams to see if they were able to use their school's resources, or off campus resources, to help complete their project. We worked with a few departments on campus to help our project get off the ground, and so sharing our experiences can help guide other iGEM teams. Every iGEM team should have some sort of outside resource to help them compete their project, whether it involves math modeling or website design. Without the help of others to build the project many problems will arise, and we believe Santa Clara University is doing their best to showcase the benefits of using outside resources during the summer.

Sydnee
Hello, I’m Sydnee! Once upon a time I thought I was going to be a psychologist, but then I decided science was a lot more fun. This is my second year being involved with iGEM and I am enjoying my time working on human practices.
Kieran
Hello, my name is Kieran McCormack. I am currently finished my second year of Biochemistry at the University of Lethbridge, which allows for a nice contrast between the normal science world and the more defined synthetic biology world. I enjoy doing new activities and have found great joy from being an adviser on the team; whether that be through new friendships, communications or spread of knowledge. I have enjoyed learning about myself throughout this year, and hopefully I can continue to do so into the future.
Brian
I am a Structural Biochemist and new to Synthetic Biology and iGEM. I love the idea of being able to make whatever I want in the lab. Previously I have used NMR and X-ray crystallography to look at protein-protein interactions. My wife is a Biochemist also, which makes dinner conversation interesting (for us anyways).
HJ
Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.

UT-Tokyo-Software,2012,Team:UT-Tokyo-Software#Project#BioBrickSearch_-_-_TEXT.html,"3. User-Experience
In designing the BioBrick Search software, we saw to it that users can intuitively and comfortably use this tool. We took advantage of the latest technologies of dynamic web applications and realized a smooth workflow without page transitions.
Results
We submitted a community post regarding this tool in the iGEM 2012 community page ( https://2012.igem.org/Community ) in August, after we finished developing this tool. After we made this tool publicly available, we got 357 accesses from 16 different countries and users, who in general gave us favorable responses. One of the feedbacks we received said they took into account the ""reliability"" score to determine which BioBrick part to use.
Future Works
iOS / Android support
Due to the incompatibility with a library we utilized, BioBrick Search cannot currently be used on iOS / Android devices. As the library's source code is published, it might be possible to work around this issue by modifying the code.
Synchronization of data with partsregistry.org
To achieve a realistic response time, BioBrick Search uses off-line data downloaded from the partsregistry.org at a specific time. On partsregistry.org, new parts are added and the existing data is updated every year. The current approach requires us to re-obtain the updated parts in order to keep up with the latest partsregistry.org database. Direct access to the partsregistry.org database or a new API that enables users to retrieve information added since the last download is desired.

You can also download it for your local server at https://github.com/ia2c/aptamers , but you need to download Rosetta separately from rosettacommons.org. (see installation instructions)
What did we create?  What did we take from others? Is it open-source?
The code we typed is an automatisation of a long, complex and hard command-line procedure with several different softwares[3]. Our code is only some Python script that runs Rosetta and ViennaRNA for you correctly. It makes the modelisation easy for you.
Our code is freely distributed, freely modifiable for any improvements, under the MIT licence ( https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT ).
ViennaRNA and Rosetta are both softwares distributed with their source-codes, modifiable, but only for non-commercial purpose (see links below). https://github.com/ViennaRNA/ViennaRNA/blob/master/COPYING https://els.comotion.uw.edu/licenses/86
How does it work?
Start with your primary DNA or RNA sequence as an input.
Step 1 (only if the input is a DNA sequence): Transcription to RNA
Our procedure was designed for RNA sequences. Therefore, if your input is a DNA sequence, we need to transcript it into a RNA sequence first. Prediction of the structure of the nucleic acid shows minor differences whether the input sequence is DNA or RNA[4]. Corrections can be implemented further in the process.                                   Tech: We use the Biopython package to do so.
Step 2: Prediction of the secondary structure
If you did not provide the secondary structure of the sequence to the tool, we can compute it with the RNAFold algorithm from ViennaRNA, a dynamic algorithm of structure prediction.                                   If the secondary structure of your RNA was described in an article, you should rely on it. This step is the most uncertain part of the procedure, because it is highly dependant on the environmental conditions: ionic concentrations, temperature, etc…
Fig. Example of a RNA secondary structure
Important remark: we are currently unable to predict pseudoknots or G-quadruplexes, which may be frequent in aptamers. Giving your own secondary structure may be a way to explicit those structures.
Step 3: Computation of the 3D structure from the 2D
We use Rosetta’s rna_denovo tool on the given 2D data, with flags -ignore_zero_occupancy and -no_minimize, and let it run for 20000 cycles (by default).

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," to reach out to a greater community. Our goal was to increase the knowledge about iGEM Stockholm in general, to make it easier for future teams to establish a better relation with the universities in Stockholm. We thought the ambassador program to be a win-win situation - people interested in the project get a greater insight in what it means to be an iGEMer, while we build a greater foundation and platform for the iGEM Stockholm teams to build on. We got great inputs from the iGEM ambassadors, which proved to be very helpful when building our presentation and the children's book.
Blog (blog.igem.se)
Our project does not have any boundaries, and we intend to keep it that way through inviting people to read about our project, as well as interesting meetings with people. The blog was a great way of reaching out to the greater community. Research is done for the benefit of all individuals, and therefore it is important for us to show what we are doing and thinking. To integrate people’s opinions and views we adapt our project to fit all of us. However, it is still important to know that we all do not have to think and feel the same - that’s the beauty with a heterogeneous society, which sometimes can be hard to adapt to in a Human Practices point of view.  Examples of topics that the blog touched upon is whether we as iGEM teams are as open as we want to be, and the importance to agreeing to disagree.
BBQ with Uppsala
It is important to connect with other teams, not only to see your project from a new and different perspectives, but also to learn how to work together. Research is an interdisciplinary field, where collaboration with other teams around the world is essential. It strengthens the importance of your research through increasing your network of peers. Therefore, we had two BBQ’s with the Uppsala iGEM team during the summer. It was especially valuable to keep good contact with the iGEM Uppsala team, since they shared many similarities to us. They are also a big team, and were therefore also sharing some common problems. This was valuable since we could discuss our difficulties in the lab, but also within team management.

Marketing/Sales Business models. To gain clarity and structure how a product is marketed and sold, sales models can be used. In addition, comparison with sales models of successful companies can be helpful. After deciding               on the model, a graphical scheme can be used to illustrate the entire supply chain. This shows where the new business comes into play in the chain.
Industrial trends and market niches. Choosing where to sell is a prerequisite for production, as each industry has different trends and market segments to sell into. Trends can help forecast what to sell, and identifying untapped               market niches suggest where to sell.
Inter and intra-organizational structure. Depending on the company goals, products, industry and market, there are several organizational structures that can be chosen to better support the business model. Structures range                 from mechanistic to organic with various combinations between them (Burns & Stalker, 1961).
Science communication. Often there is a communication gap between scientists and managers or public. Science communication involves relaying specialized knowledge to non-specialists and is key to mutual understanding between               different background people.
Innovation management. As iGEM promotes creativity and innovation, considering how they can be included in the business plan is essential. Innovation patterns and concepts applied on a project help understand how innovation               pushes an idea to a marketable application. For example, Henderson and Clark identify four types of innovation depending on its impact on existing competencies and their linkages - Incremental, Radical, Modular or Architectural Innovation               (Henderson & Clark, 1990).
Identify and fulfill audience expectations
The business plan should align with, and support the entire project. Readers will be confused if too much new information is added, or if the information is not consistent with other sections of the project. We propose taking in account the               following key points:
Direction The business plan helps delineate a strategic direction, clarifying project goals and progress to both iGEM team members and audience. On the long run, a strategic direction aids in keeping the project on track and observing if adjustments are needed.
Integration When doing research for the business plan, new knowledge and arguments come into play. Sometimes it is easy to deviate and include concepts irrelevant for your project. Make sure that new insights stay on subject by always relating them to your project. If they don’t relate, focus on only a few concepts that can be strongly tied to the project.
Validity Prove that assumptions and analysis are valid. Validity can be enhanced by supporting assumptions with interviews, questionnaires (or other data collection methods) and"

Gert Jan Euverink is the University of Groningen representative in the CaDOS project. Toilet paper in sewage material contains roughly 80% cellulose. In the CaDOS project, this cellulose material is used to drain water from the sludge, which improves the purification process. Furthermore, Euverink advises companies on the implementation of their technical ideas. His expertise has been helpful to previous iGEM teams, since he was a supervisor of the winning team of Groningen in 2012!

Prof. Dr. Katja Loos (5th July 2018)
Biodegradable plastics, like PLA, are technically biodegradable but only under controlled      conditions. In nature they still take a long time to degrade on their own, only a bit faster than      for example polystyrene. However, PLA being “biodegradable” sends a message that it is      okay to throw it away anywhere because if its “biodegradability”, only adding to the problem.      Just recently, the EU has moved to ban single use plastics. Therefore, what we should do is      look into non-single use plastics. While polystyrene has numerous non-single use applications, the      stigma of it being used as disposable packaging material is not easily erased. Some     polymers that are nearly always single use include:
Nylons
Polyurethanes
Polyamides
PLA is only adding to the problem!
Prof. Dr. Francesco Picchioni (3rd Oktober 2018)
We went to Francesco Picchioni, an expert in the field of polymers, to ask his view on styrene and our project design. Did he see the benefits, or would he think it was an unrealistic design? He explained to us that styrene is a very good material for various reasons. The first is its transparency, which is why it is easily colored with other chemicals. Styrene furthermore contains an aromatic ring and pi-pi stackings of these rings. This leads to the fact that styrene-based plastics have a high TG (Glass Transition Temperature). These connections are way stronger compared to the ester bonds in PET and PLA. No other plastics have these special characteristics, and therefore styrene is irreplaceable. Right now, styrene is not recycled to a high extent, as the price of newly produced styrene is lower. However, because styrene is a thermoplastic, it is"

Sun Protection Factor
Introduction
Sun Protection Factor (SPF) is a measure of the effectiveness of sunscreen. As an extremely simplified rule of thumb, the SPF gives you the time in minutes how much more time you can expose yourself to the sun. The higher the SPF, the better the protection against UV radiation. The measurement is tuned to represent the protection from sunburn, which is caused largely by UVB radiation. This is actually in conflict to the need for cancer prevention, because melanomas are thought to be caused by UVA and UVB radiation. However, to get an idea of the potential of E.colipse we used the wide-spread SPF. To learn more about the SPF, please read here .
Model
The formal definition of the SPF is the fraction of the weighted incoming radiation and the weighted transmitted radiation. Finally, this will yield the factor by which the total radiation is reduced.
E is the irradiaton, A is the weighting factor and MPF the monochromatic protection factor, i.e. the proportion by which the radiation is reduced for a specifc wavelength. The weighting factor A is the so called erythemal action spectrum [Vainio2001]. As mentioned it focuses on UVB radiation that causes sunburn.
Figure 1: Erythemal Action Spectrum. Approx. 99 % of the weight is assigned to UVB radiation, which causes sunburn.
As indicated by the formula above, the SPF is defined as a function of the transmittance at different wavelengths. Therefore we use the absorbance defined by the Lambert-Beer"

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.       There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.

In order to get a sense for how to optimally assemble our reporter and detector molecules for integration with the prototype, we used Autodesk Maya to build and analyze potential capture protein fusions in silico. In contemplating the prototype design of capture TALE detectors in the nitrocellulose lateral flow strip prototype, the wetlab team conceived the following protein fusion designs:
Figure 1. Possible versions of capture TALE protein genes fusions which could be integrated into the prototype. Figure 1A shows the TALE in isolation whereas Figure 1B shows the protein scaffolded from ferritin.
We were concerned about how the interaction of TALE detectors with the nitrocellulose substrate might reduce their sensitivity. The wetlab asked the modelling team who proposed simulating the capture proteins and nitrocellulose in Maya to answer this question. In order to determine potential for steric hinderance issues with DNA binding, we needed to know how DNA and TALEs bind together. The steps in this interaction have not been previously documented, so we animated a putative interaction in Maya. See Figure 2 below.
Figure 2. Shows a putative mechanism for TALE-DNA binding which we built using Maya. Contortions and shifting of the TALE are required for it to envelop the DNA.
The interaction between the TALE and DNA appears to require intricate contortions of the TALE and space around the periphery of the protein. The next step was to use Maya to show how the interaction of DNA with the TALE is influenced by association of the TALE with a surface such as nit"

We added 1 ml of chloroform to the 100µl reaction batches, mixed a few seconds and stored the tubes for about 30 min at room temperature, to get a proper phase- separation. Afterwards, the lower phase (chloroform) was pipetted in tubes (glass tubes would have been better than plastic tubes) (1ml) and incubated for about 60 min at 60°C (=drying) until total chloroform removal.
The tubes were then stored at -80°C over night until further usage (LCMS)

Canditect
The last step of our iGEM journey is to put all the elements together in a kit. Taking inspiration from other similar test kits, we worked together with experienced 3D printer Arnab Sarkar to design a prototype of the Canditect kit.
After sending in rough sketches of our design, Sarkar converted the sketch into a 3D model and assisted us in printing and assembling the prototype. In the end, we were able to print a prototype test kit that met our standards.

Procedure: Degrading the July 14 Biofilms
The biofilms created on July 14 grew successfully. The solutions used to degrade the biofilms were Mr. Clean, Lysol, Fantistik, Tilex, and GreenWorks cleaner. Water was used as a control. 3200 μL of solution was added to each well and Petri dish. 30 mins after the solutions were added, they were disposed of in the biohazard waste.
Procedure: Reculturing July 14 Biofilms
To reculture the biofilms from yesterday, 200 μL of LB media was added to one well for each Petri dish that had been degraded with cleaner. The media was moved around the rim to where the biofilm had formed. Then the media was pipette back into the 5 mL tube of LB media. 5 μL of KAN was added to the 5 mL tube of LB media.
This process was repeated for each of the cleaners and the control listed above in the procedure for degradation of the biofilms.
The Petri dishes were left to air out on a sheet of paper towel.
Procedure: Creating Biofilms.
Biofilms were made in 5 35x10 mm Petri dishes by putting 14.85 mL of LB media, 15 μL of KAN, and 150 μL of RFP into a 15 mL falcon tube. 3 mL of this solution was then pipetted into each Petri dish.
These were left in the 37 ˚C incubator for 24 hours so that they could grow.

Results of the Reculturing of July 14 Biofilms
Names: Sydnee Calhoun, Anileen Pageni and Kieran McCormack
From the overnight cultures of the July 14 biofilms, the ones recultured after the use of water and Tilex were red confirming we had recultured the two cultures. The one recultured from GreenWorks was also successful. Although not very red, it had an orange tinge indicating the presence of RFP. The Lysol reculture was more yellow in culture colour but might have been successful. The same results as previous for Fantastik showed no culture growth.

Calgary_Ethics,2008,Team:Calgary Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," single individual at the same time. So where they stand is in a maze of confusion. The literatures in scientific terms is  not easy for a non-biologist and a non-engineer to understand and many times it's the fear that ""am I getting enough information of possible side-effects, other effect in molecular level in our body or environment?"" We need to find an approach to eliminate this gap - either by going and talking to them in a way that's plausible, or listen to their concern in their language and give feedback in the same terms.
The Project:
Our team has written and sent out two online surveys (one written for high school students, another written for adults. We had to go through a process of receiving ethical approval to disseminate our survey online. The purpose of this study was to better understand the level of knowledge the participants have about the emerging field of synthetic biology, what they feel the future of synthetic biology holds, what implications of advances in synthetic biology may be and what the framework of governance for synthetic biology should be. To start somewhere, we sent the link to our survey to 130 different people in the beginning, who were asked to send the link through their networks. We hoped that in this way we would reach a diverse group of people who are linked to government agencies, industries, Universities, NGO's and are from the general public. By doing so, we have received a broad spectrum of responses rich in diversity and perspectives. We also sent out a link specific for iGEM participants hoping that we can showcase what the thoughts of iGEM participants are.
Our survey analysis compares to some extent the differences of answers of synthetic biology practitioners (iGEM participants) and that of the general public. Through that analysis we highlighted significant difference in responses of synthetic biology's governance policy and biosafety concerns.
The survey for high-school participants takes in account of their level of knowledge and background in biology, technology, ethics and society. The high school survey contains more examples of current products and applications of synthetic biology at present. However, in doing so, we put much attention in making sure that the examples do not bias the understanding and thus the answers to our survey.
Presentations:
As an extension to our survey, our team also met with the group of high school students after they took our survey to provide answers to any further questions they had regarding our project, survey or the synthetic biology field itself. We also had a PowerPoint presentation that gave them a thorough overview of the field and encouraged a debate on its implications.( media:High_school_presentation.pdf‎ )

Mingdao,2015,Team:Mingdao#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," we collected protein sequence data from Uniprot database and ranked with highest contents of serine (phosphoserine) and/or arginine (the highest nitrogen percentage among 20 amino acids). We chose a possible candidate (SR protein) in the top list of highest contents of both serine and arginine. Next, we built biobricks (pSB1C3) carrying SR gene and SRPK kinase gene which encodes proteins to phosphorylate SR protein, followed by putting the genes on the exprssion vectors of pGEX-2T and pET-29b. Then, we transformed and cultured bacteria (E. coli BL21) carrying the expression vectors. Finally, we analyzed the protein expression and performed flame test on cloth and cotton soaked with the bacteria.
Flow chart of finding and testing novel proteins with fire retardant properties
 
In order to obtain a novel bio-material with the best fire-retarding effect, we’re searching a protein with the highest nitrogen and phosphorus contents through data mining approach.
 
We performed four steps to find the fire retardant protein.
*
*
As mentioned earlier, phosphorous and nitrogen play important roles to stop fire propagation. We analyzed the contents of phosphorus and nitrogen among amino acids (AAs).
 
Phosphorus exists as the form of phosphate. Phosphate group was only added on the AA by phosphorylation through a post-translational modification (PTM). Among all 20 AAs, only serine, threonine and tyrosine could be phosphorylated. Phosphoserine is the most common modification in phosphorylated proteins. Serine was chosen as the major source of phosphorus in proteins.
 
Nitrogen content analysis showed that arginine contains the highest nitrogen rate of 33% by weight among AAs. ( American Journal of Plant Sciences, 2011, 2, 287-296 )
Thus, we chose it as the major source of nitrogen in proteins.

In order to find protein candidates with fire retardant properties, C programming was written for data mining. (For collaboration with NCTU-Formosa and the code programming data, see here )
 
We collected protein sequences from UniProt  and downloaded data as fasta format on February 13, 2015.
 
In the process, the sequence of a protein was read and the amount of each AA was added up, after that the AA amount was calculated into the rate of each AA by “ AA rate = ("

Research started today, so a majority of the day was dedicated to administrative details about the program. Otherwise, Veronica and I were assigned to research more about semantic search--what it was, its benefits, and whether or not it would be worthwhile to pursue this field in the context of synthetic biology. We will be presenting our findings near the beginning of June.
Day 2: May 30, 2012
For the majority of the day, I was learning how to code with C# on a Windows 8 Surface. It was easy to get lost on the more technical side and details of the coding, especially because the instructions seemed to assume you knew about the basic commands in C#. Other than that, it was easier to delve into the code without blindly copying down if it had been my first time. There were a couple of times where getting stuck and being unable to figure out the problem because of my lack of knowledge got frustrating, but because it was my first experience creating code to manipulate objects on a touch screen, I found the learning experience to be pretty amazing overall. Otherwise, I’ve been doing more reading on synthetic biology. It took me a while to read them since I hadn’t taken up Biology since the ninth grade, but I found the idea of engineering a new biological function interesting so I managed to complete most of the reading.

What's more, simulation time slot is necessary as well to give concentration-time figures of the inputs and outputs of a given gene circuit. You are free to see the concentration-time evolution of every substance in designed gene circuits individually.
Details:
There are two formalisms for mathematically describing the time behavior of a spatially homogeneous chemical system.
The first one is the deterministic approach which regards the time evolution as a continuous and wholly predictable process governed by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations (the ""reaction-rate equations"").
The other one is the stochastic approach which regards the time evolution as a kind of random-walk process governed by a single differential-difference equation (the ""master equation"").
Some simple arguments in kinetic theory show that the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics has a firmer physical basis than the deterministic formulation. Unfortunately, the stochastic master equation is mathematically intractable in the most cases.
There is, however, a way to make exact numerical calculations within the framework of the stochastic formulation without having to deal with the master equation directly. It is a relatively simple digital computer algorithm, which uses a rigorously derived Monte Carlo procedure to numerically simulate the time evolution of a given chemical system. Like the master equation, this ""stochastic simulation algorithm"" can correctly explain the inherent fluctuations and correlations that are unfortunately ignored in the deterministic formulation.
4.Analysis: Get robustness and sensitivity analysis
Function:
While offering various functions, BioBLESS also serves as an analysis tool for designed gene circuits. Having designed a gene circuit, you can click the ¡°Analysis¡± button to reset parameters of initial concentrations and reaction rates. Meanwhile, BioBLESS will set simulation slots and carry the simulation task automatically. According to the perturbation ratio you input, such as 20% or 30%, the concentration-time curves of inputs and outputs will be shown together to shed light on the robustness of a designed gene circuit. Moreover, data processing and demonstration will help users to better understand the robustness of designed gene circuits.
Details:
Robustness and sensitivity can measure the property of being strong and healthy or not in constitution. They refer to the ability of tolerating perturbations that might affect the system¡¯s functional body. When perturbations to the inputs of a system are small in magnitude, we hope to measure whether the concentration of outputs will change sharply or in extreme cases, even destroy the input-output logic embodied in truth tables. The most intractable problem we confront is the overload on our server to complete the simulation task. After literature reviewing, we choose some factors, for"
