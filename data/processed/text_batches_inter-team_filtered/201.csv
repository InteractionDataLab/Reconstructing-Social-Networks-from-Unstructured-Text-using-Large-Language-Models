BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Collaborations#Blog1_-_-_TEXT.html,"Before we jump into intellectual property, we should define the idea of property rights. Property rights grant a property owner exclusive authority to determine how a resource is used, essentially giving total power over the resource (within governmental regulations) to the owner. Property rights as a concept blankets everything from real property (land) to intangible property (ideas). One key subset of property and property rights is intellectual property, which is what we will concern ourselves with for the remainder of this post. Now with a clear understanding of property rights, here is the Google definition of intellectual property:
in·tel·lec·tu·al prop·er·ty
noun
LAW
a work or invention that is the result of creativity, such as a manuscript or a design, to which one has rights and for which one may apply for a patent, copyright, trademark, etc.
Gee willikers, what an irritatingly long and overly-complicated definition; let’s break it down.  In the case of synthetic biology, intellectual property is any work done by a researcher that qualifies as property and for which they can apply a patent or copyright. (You might be asking right now, “wait, why isn’t trademark in your definition when it was a part of the formal definition?”  Our response would be, “you actually read the whole definition?!” A trademark is a word or string of words that is legally registered to represent a legal entity.  Most scientists don’t trademark their names or the names of their products so this was excluded from the definition of intellectual property applied to synthetic biology.)  Unfortunately, the definition of intellectual property directly references two other terms that are important to understand for the purpose of our discussion (copyright and patent), so here are their definitions followed by our analysis:
cop·y·right
noun
the exclusive legal right, given to an originator or an assignee to print, publish, perform, film, or record literary, artistic, or musical material, and to authorize others to do the same.
“he issued a writ for breach of copyright”
pat·ent
noun
a government authority or license conferring a right or title for a set period, especially the sole right to exclude others from making, using, or selling an invention.
“he took out a patent for an improved steam hammer”
Right now you’re probably thinking, “holy smoke, that was a lot of definitions taken straight from Google! Why am I reading this then?” You’re right, we definitely copied those definitions from the internet, but this post hopefully adds value to your internet-definition-reading-experience by providing a more in"

Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was"

WHO’s sixteenth global report on tuberculosis reported that there was between 1.3 and 1.5 million associated deaths and most of these were in developing countries. More people in the developing world contract tuberculosis largely due to high rates of HIV infection and the corresponding development of AIDS.  Donnchadh was in constant communication with our iGEM team regarding the lab facilities available and the potential use and application of our DNA detection system. We decided to extensively research the requirements for and applications of an easy to use, low cost and reliable TB detector for use in third world hospital labs. Donnchadh’s feedback was very helpful but see what the lab technicians had to say below!
Our proposed Bacterial-DNA Detection System
We constructed a survey for the laboratory staff which explained our project, the detection system and its      potential applications. We investigated what knowledge the laboratory staff had regarding synthetic biology      and whether they thought that our detection system could be implemented in their laboratory. Click here to see the survey.
The feedback we received was very positive. As an initial impression it was felt that our project may ‘result      in the development or use of highly sensitive and specific methods for detecting pathogens.. The method may also      be time efficient’ and ‘It might help us to run tests quickly so our patients have results on time.
Knowledge regarding synthetic biology was diverse. Some saying that it is “using bacteria to make vaccines and drugs”      and others explaining that they ‘don’t know anything about synthetic biology’.
There were no concerns regarding the use of synthetic biology except one lab assistant worrying about costs because      ‘the use of technology is expensive; especially in developing countries’.
Everyone surveyed at Nkhoma Hosptial laboratory answered that they would like to use our new DNA detection system and      that they felt there was potential for its implementation. Our detection system was seen as helpful because it’s      ‘very fast, easy to use, cost efficient’... ’and people will be helped in getting treatment on time’.
The laboratory staff at Nkhoma Hospital.
Challenges
The Laboratory Manager pointed out potential barriers as he felt ‘it will be difficult to sustain the service’.      He felt there would be ‘problems in terms of who to order the reagents’ and for the ’training of personnel on      when to order and in what condition’ and also that ‘since it will be a new test, stigma will crop in"

We are really glad to see Merry Lin and Yaobin Ouyang who have a better understanding about jurisprudence and philosophy. And we had communication with them too. There is not doubt that without their help, there won’t be any thing about the critical thinking of law related to gene technology as we will mention below.
Dialogue with experts in biology
In order to have a more clear understanding about how China government regulate drug development, we have an interview with Doctor Huang, a teacher who has medical science background and specialize in biology. According to the conversation with Doctor Huang, we know that the review conducted by the official organization puts more emphases on the formal procedure. The review procedure is so comprehensive that it always takes a longer time than some developed countries to permit the new medicine to come to market.
And Doctor Huang also told us that only if we can make any progress in reducing drug toxicity, lowering drug price, and identifying therapeutic targets, then we succeed. However, she also mentioned that gene therapy is a technique full with dangerousness and controversy. Up until now, there are not brand safe and effective means in delivering the therapeutic gene in clinical trials because each method has its shortage. For instance, adeno-associated viruses don’t integrate DNA into the chromosome while the lentivirus do, which was spoken highly of for its efficiency and was censured for its possibility causing inserted oncogenous mutation.
Finally she encourages us just to do it and don’t worry too much about its application limited by disadvantage compared to existing chemicals, because elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of myocardial ischemic using synthetic biology alerting signal transduction pathway is something remarkable. As you find the way you alter signal transduction pathway work, you can try to alter many other pathways, most of which lead to lesion of our body like the rheumatism, based on the bio-bricks you made.
Dialogues with law experts
In order to have a better understanding about law and regulation actuality in China, we have an long talk with Shiwen Zhou, professor of South China University of Technology, who has written a book called strategic studies in the patent protection of gene and gene resources, is good at teaching and scientific research of Civil and Commercial Law and Intellectual Property Law.

The pT181 Antisense gene express pT181 Antisense, and pT181 Antisense binds the pT181 Sense Target, thus represses the expression of GFP gene.

UFlorida,2018,Team:UFlorida#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,", we discovered through HPLC that fumarate was still being produced at higher concentrations than what was predicted by our metabolic model. We went back to the sequence and discovered that frdA is present in two copies in the E. coli Nissle genome. Although the gel showed the gene to be deleted, we had not known that a duplication existed.The second operon existed internally to the primers we used to screen and the homologous regions we made to delete with, so is was neither deleted nor detected. Two deletions would have been necessary to channel the carbon flow away from fumarate.
We decided not to go forward with that option as our model showed that other genes would have more carbon flux impact if deleted.
Next to be deleted was ldhA which fortunately does not have a gene copy.  This was validated by confirmation of fragment bands on a gel and lack of lactate production seen by HPLC measurements.
(Left) One colony had the 1.5kb kan-frt cassette integrated into its genome at the ldha location.  Out of the 58 colonies screened for ldhA deletions, we found one that had it. Subsequent flipping out and loss of kanamycin resistance was successful.
Butyrate Assembly
Team members optimized the five gene sequences for E. coli Nissle 1917 for butyrate upregulation. The gene pathway was too long (5 kb) to be synthesized in one string so it was ordered as a gblock composed as two fragments. Synthesis was chosen over ordering the parts in a plasmid for cost efficiency. Butyrate fragment (BF) #1 contained atoB, hbd, and crt and BF #2 had ter and tesB. The ordered sequences were delivered with unintentional alterations that had extra copies of the Xbol digestion sites. This made it impossible to properly digest and ligate our gene fragments together, which is the typical way to assemble. A variety of other molecular techniques were attempted: (1) Overlap extension (2) Blunt Ligation of fragments #1 and #2.
The two fragments had regions that were similar to each other (overlapping) of about 40 bases each.Theoretically, if run through enough cycles of PCR the two fragments would become one due to elongation over the overlapping region (overlap extension). Even though a 5.3 kb band was visible after 12 cycles of overlap extension PCR, it was not possible to amplify this fragment to concentrations high enough to successfully assemble the part via Circular Polymerization Extension Cloning or restriction digestion into ps"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Degradation_-_-_TEXT.html," bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

Our team members and instructors gave a lecture on synthetic biology in Xiamen University, mainly focusing on biosafety issues. We took part in the 2011 iGEM China Meetup at USTC, Hefei.
OPEN LAB DAY FOR KIDS
At the beginning of the 2011 autumn semester, we invited students from Yanwu Elementary and their parents to our Lab. We first visited a class of Grade 3 in this school and sent out our invitation cards. The Open Lab Day information was also released on the internet. This activity was greatly supported by the president of Yanwu Elementary and many kids and their parents showed great interest. After all, in China, opportunity for primary school students going into the lab is so rare that they regarded it a really worth thing to do. 15 kids and their parents joined us in the Open Lab Day on Sept. 25. They were first showed quite a lot pictures of insects and microorganisms in an exhibition prepared by our team members in the Ground Hall. Most of the pictures were taken by our team member Zhizhen Zhao in the Dinghushan National Nature Reserve in August, giving kids a general understanding of lives from the Biggest to the Smallest. Then we gave the kids and their parents a short lecture on life science and synthetic biology. Many parents showed both interest and concerns about synthetic biology, and almost all of them never heard of this subject before. We discussed the practical application of synthetic biology as well as the safety threat it might bring about.  Finally after being given safety instructions, kids were led into the lab doing some interesting experiments and playing some games with the help of our iGEM team members. They learned some basic organelles inside a cell and watched different types of cell samples using microscope. They were also taught how to use pipette. Many parents told us that they thought their children had learned a lot in this activity.
THE BIOSAFETY LECTURE
Our instructor Zhaoshou Wang and team member Xin Wu gave a public lecture on biosafety issues in Xiamen University in September. This lecture was to awake the public awareness of biosafety and start their discussions about the definition of synthetic biology in their views. This public lecture was so popular that students from various majors took part in the discussion.

Overview
As an active member of iGEM community, Team Tsinghua has always valued collaborations with other iGEM teams. Together with high school teams and undergrads, we have exchanged ideas, provided each other with inspirations and resources. Working together was both fun and productive. It was an experience everyone had enjoyed.
Working With High School Teams
This year we welcomed two high school teams on our campus, RDFZ_China and SHSBNU_China. Tsinghua University provided these teams with lab space and some necessary equipments. We worked closely (physically side by side) all summer, and it was remarkably prolific. Team Tsinghua and instructors from Bluepha have educated the high school teams about lab safety and helped them to find their ways around the lab. Furthermore, being physically no more than five meters away allowed us to be able to bounce ideas off each other at all times. When we were tuning the IPTG induction devices in our NEON system, RDFZ_China provided us with their own IPTG assay with Ptac which actually played an important part in our final design. On October 4th, we were invited to the Northern China High school iGEM Meetup and the safety conference afterwards to share our idea how iGEMers can contribute to the safety awareness in the community.
Working With Fellow Undergrads
Meetups are where teams meet each other and share their ideas, plans and troubles. In September we attended the 5th CCiC, where 25 teams helped us with our questionnaire in HP . Our friends from Peking University provided us with a new transformation technique. We also provided TUST with water samples to test the tetracycline concentration for their project.
We have worked with Tsinghua-A on multiple occasions, helping with each other’s projects and troubleshooting the experiments. They instructed us on the flow cytometer and we shared our experience on IPTG induction. Together we have held an exhibition on synthetic biology in China Science and Technology Museum (CSTM).

Gel Electrophoresis
Materials
You will need:
Agarose
1X TAE
Loading Dye
2-log or 100bp Ladder
Safestain
Extra Notes
Be sure that the well size is large enough (but not too large) to accommodate the amount of DNA you will be loading.
Be sure to aware of what concentration your gel is. The difference between a 1% and a 2% agarose gel is significant.
Procedure
Creating a 1% gel stock
Dissolve 5g agarose in 500mL 1X TAE
Creating a 2% gel stock
Dissolve 10g agarose in 500mL 1X TAE
When gel is ready to use
Have gel trays ready with the gel comb (used to create the wells) in place.
Microwave the gel stock. Be sure it is all melted and dissolved.
Pour 50mL into one 50mL centrifuge tube. If gel is bigger, pour 100mL into two 50mL centrifuge tubes.
When gel solution is lukewarm, pipette 5μL safestain into gel
Pour immediately and slowly into gel trays to reduce chunks and bubbles in gel.
Wait until gel completely solidifies.
Loading DNA into gel
Pipette a 1:5 volume of loading dye to DNA template. (Eg. 1μL loading dye into a 5μL DNA template to be loaded.)
Pipette 5μL of ladder into the very first well.
Carefully pipette each DNA template to each well.
Running the gel
Run electric current between 90V-120V through gel until bands have separated enough.
Purpose
Although gel electrophoresis has many purposes, we use them to separate out DNA fragments.  This is done so that we can gel extract wanted DNA parts or simply as a diagnostic to see whether or not we have gotten the right pieces together.

The idea and design of the project, the wiki, the presentation and the poster, as well as all of the conducted experiments were performed by the members of the team under the supervision of the advisor K. Kummer, instructor N. Lübke and the secondary PI S.Weick.
Special tasks during the project were performed by the following team members:
• The PCR study to differentiate plants by their DNA was performed by Viviane and Leon
• The human practice efforts were led by Elisa and Jil
• Ben and Simon carried out the pectin assay and investigated the possibility of a cellulose assay
• Leon set up the wiki template and style CSS
• The InterLab study was conducted by Fynn, Elisa, Jil and Leon
The cloning work was done by the whole team in different small subgroups, with Fynn dealing with the Bacillus subtilis pel B, Ben and Simon working on the xanthomonas campestris  pel B, Leon working on yesZ. Elisa and Jil were working on the plasmid backbones and transformations.
Around New Year the final team composition was announced and during weekly meetings, we discussed project ideas in spring.
In the Easter vacation, we started working in the lab of the university for 2 weeks learning general lab procedures. The actual work on our project was accomplished during 4 weeks of our summer vacation. Lastly, the wiki texts were written at home and during further meetings in Bielefeld and at our school.

Our major experiments are manipulated by team members in Tianjin 2011iGEM. Most of them are undergraduates from discipline of Biological Engineering and Chemical Engineering. While some professors and post-graduates in School of Chemical Engineering and Technology have provided significant support from the very beginning of the project design. Besides, we got help on art design and website creation from undergraduate in School of Software, and some friends not in our university. Some of them didn’t even meet us before. Our achievement won’t exist without all the support. Best regards and undying gratitude to every one of you!

SynthetINK's advantage in the global marketplace is its sustainability. Our method of pigment production will have little to no byproducts which will allow us to appeal to the environmentally friendly consumer base. The only byproducts of our pigment production will be carbon dioxide from the bacteria growing, and the cellular debris from the filtration of the pigments. Specifically, our product will have the advantage over carbon black and other inorganic pigments in that we do not require the burning of petroleum or other harmful processes for the production of the colorant.
Shift towards renewable energy
In recent times the world has been shifting away from practices that are harmful to the environment and investing in more renewable sources of energy (this is shown in Figure 1). This change towards renewable energy will result in a reduction in the amount of petroleum being burned for energy. The decrease in the use of petroleum will result in a reduction of the carbon black available for use in its associated industries. This is where SynthetINK will fit into the global landscape. Our environmentally friendly practices will allow us to fulfill the need for pigments within the evolved green energy society.

Our previous ligation did not work, it had grown no colonies when we got into lab this morning and we did not make a negative plate.
Today, we redid the test cuts for pRECs 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 203 and 207
Today we are also going to send DNA for sequencing, based on gel results, we have decided to send pREC 193 (2), 194 (1,3), 202 (1,2), 206 (2,3)
Digested the backbones. Instructions from Ben’s ABA and rapamyacin backbones in order to get the inserts we want to send for sequencing
Abha and Jeff redid the ligation for pREC 200, 201, 204, 205, 208.
Abha and Jeff did the transformation by smearing 50 microliters of this mixture: 50 microliters Top 10 Cells, 50 microliters KCM, 10 microliters ligation; placed in incubator at noon
After digesting Ben’s Inserts, we are going to run a gel and purify the bands that correlate to the insert
The results of my test cuts turned out pretty much the same as the June 5th gel so we are not going to send any additional pRECs for sequencing.
Ben’s inserts digested really well and we now we are going to ligase the purified bands (inserts) into the backbones
June 12th 2015
Today we checked Abha and Jeff transformations. We found no growth on the plates except for the negatives, which had quite a bit. This means that most likely we did not digest the backbones properly or we did not perform the ligation correctly.
Shaheer’s plates with Ben’s inserts and the iGEM team’s backbones did yeild positive results. Additionally, Shaheer’s negative controls did not grow any colonies, so we can be confident that the colonies obtained are transformed colonies.
Shaheer harvested the colonies from his transformed plates, as described by the Deep Well Miniprep procedure.
We got back the results"

If the costs of recurrence, as estimated by Cancer Research UK were taken into account - £16000 for stage 1 and £17000 as the average cost of other stages [19] - the cost per QALY would still only be £8300, and at 39% sensitivity would be £19900 per QALY.
Our modeling therefore proves that our sensor would be cost effective in reducing mortality rates from NSCLC. The same principle on which this model is based could be applied to any cancer to screen those with sufficiently high risk using miRNA biomarkers.

Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.

Single Cell ODE Model for the Time Control Module
1 Overview
The second module in our construct is the Time Control module. The purpose of this module is to produce a time delay in responding to the AHL signal inside the cell and to control the translation of two repressors downstream the sensing promoter in order to turn on the expression of Cre recombinase, which is necessary for the recombination reactions in the Recombination module. In transducing the signal through the Time Control module instead of directly passing it to the Recombination module, we seek to allow the Sensing module sufficient time to amplify the AHL signal with its positive feedback loop which would allow for more effective quorum sensing when the AHL diffuses into surrounding cells. Here, we will model the delay produced by the module.
In this module, the most important species considered are AHL, cI, PhlF, and Cre. To recap, AHL and LuxR are integral to the function of the module, both being required to induce the promoter pLuxR. Specifically, a (LuxR_AHL)2 molecule induces pLuxR by binding to a region in front of it on the plasmid. Because we are simulating only the Time Control module in this simulation, we will assume AHL has a constant concentration, being constitutively produced by the Sensing module. Thus, we can treat pLuxR as operating at the full transcription rate.
The promoter pLuxR is involved in the transcription of mRNA, which in turn is needed for the translation of cI.
The promoter pcI is the next promoter in the stream and it is repressed by cI2 and is needed for the translation of PhlF molecules. On pcI, there are two binding sites for cI2 with cooperativity. This means that a cI2 already bound to one site will increase the rate at which cI2 binds to the other site. It will only produce PhlF when both sites are not bound"
SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2010,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#result_-_-_TEXT.html," expected: under hypoxia, the efficiency of this promoter was much higher than that under the condition of 20% oxygen at the same OD600. (One thing that needs to be noticed is that at 0.4 OD600, the bacteria are in log phase and the PfdhF begins to work.)
Then we wanted to know the difference of PfdhF activity under these two conditions. So, we plotted another figure with OD600 as x axis and the ratio of PfdhF activity under hypoxia to that under normal oxygen pressure as y axis. This curve showed that, during and after the log phase (OD600>0.4), the activity of PfdhF is over 1.5 times more under hypoxia than under normal 20% oxygen pressure. Particularly, this ratio is over 3 when OD600>0.5. Furthermore, in the normal 20% oxygen group, as the OD600 increases, the oxygen supplies may be insufficient for E. coli which may lead to the increase of PfdhF activity. In this case, the activity of PfdhF under normal condition is probably overestimated. With all these data and analysis, it is evident that PfdhF is a rather good hypoxia-inducible promoter with much higher activity under hypoxia than under 20% oxygen pressure.

Ligation reaction
The assembly of DNA fragments, commonly referred to                         as Golden Gate assembly, is an efficient technique                         where multiple inserts could be assembled into a vector                         backbone. The net result is the ordered and seamless                         assembly of DNA fragments in only one reaction. The                         ligations have a total volume of 10 μL so all of                         sequences that form part of the constructions are mixed                         up in an Eppendorf of 0.2mL.

The function that sorts linkers out, if the angles don't fit was introduced. All the paths were generated, first tests about the runtimes were performed and first sorting steps were made. The decision for the brute-forcing method was made.
The function that sorts the linkers out if they pass through the protein was included.
First complete run of the software was made. The protein can now be shown correctly and all sorting steps run in principle.
The function that sorts the linkers out if they pass through the protein was included.
First complete run of the software was made. The protein can now be shown correctly and all sorting steps run in principle.
The last sort-out step of the last linkers (second to thirdpoints) was made to be running. This was difficult as it is just a huge amount of data. It needed to be stored on the harddisk using h5py module in Python. Also the weighting of the distance from the protein was introduced.
Also the variables were now sliced in shapes so that the calculations would fit into the RAM.
In this week we mainly searched for a screening protein. In the end of the week we decided to take GFP and lambda-phage lysozyme as targets. So there was lots of literature-work done concerning lysozyme. It was tried to get substrates for the screenings. We came up with the plan to use the light-cycler for screening of GFP.
Softwarewise the recognition of PDBs was refined. Now the user can choose many more different things concerning the PDB, for example if he wants to ignore whole subunits or just single residues. Also it was allowed to have missing parts in the PDB and flexible ends at the linkers.
We also met Prof. Wade who gave us valuable council on structure predicting software and emphasized that the linker shouldn't become too rigid. She also came up with the idea of helix-turn-helix motifs.
Wet lab:
In order to screen linkers generated by our software, we need an easy way to circularize several proteins with different linkers. The circularization construct that is already beeing used for GFP causes some scars due to cloning. Since it would be hard for the software to precisely deal with scars, we had to invent a new circularization construct. Split NpuDnaE seems to work fine, so we chose to use only this intein. The main difference compared to our old circularization construct is that the BsaI overhangs are now in the inteins.

AMPersand: An Anti-Microbial Peptide Coating
The Problem
A biofilm is a community of bacteria attached to a surface that exhibits high resistance to antibiotics and human immunity. Biofilm formation poses a serious threat to the medical and shipping industries in the following ways:
Medical Industry
Protein adsorption, cell-adhesion, and subsequent biofilm formation have been found to lead to failure of medical implants and infection in patients.1
Shipping Industry
Government and industry spend upwards of $5.7 billion annually in the control of marine biofouling. High levels of biofouling result in increased drag and the subsequent loss of hydrodynamic performance.2
Figure 1. (A) Biofilm formation leads to failure of implanted cardiac devices and heart valve infection. (B) Biofilm formation on the hulls of ships leads to loss of optimal hydrodynamic performance and structural failures.
Our Solution
To address this issue, we aimed to develop an anti-microbial adhesive peptide composed of two components. We envision these domains can be modulated to suit a variety of functional adhesive applications:
Component 1: Adhesive Domain
Because biofilm formation affects both organic and inorganic substrates, the anti-biofilm coating should show strong adhesion to a variety of surfaces. Mussel adhesive proteins (MAPs), which are secreted by the mussel to help it anchor and survive in the harsh conditions of the intertidal zone, would be ideal for this application. MAP adhesion has been well-characterized and has been investigated in biomimetic adhesive applications in the past. We intend to broaden the scope of their application by looking at their inclusion in the first anti-biofilm adhesive recombinant protein.3 The functional residue in MAPs is L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), which is generated by post-translational modification of tyrosine with tyrosinase. Since L-DOPA is a non-standard amino acid, it cannot be incorporated by standard translation systems. However, we intend to be the first group to use a genetically recoded organism (GRO) to incorporate L-DOPA in-situ, eliminating the need for any"

Modelling
The main objective of the experimental part of our project was to develop a method for determining promoter activities by measuring fluorescence from the Spinach RNA-fluorophore complex.
Fluorescence Signal is Linearly Dependent on the Concentration of Spinach-DFHBI Complex
When the fluorophore DFHBI is bound by Spinach, it fluoresces much more intensely than in its unbound form. The fluorescence of a sample can be assumed to increase linearly with the concentration of Spinach-DFHBI complex:
where the intercept b is the background fluorescence without any Spinach-DFHBI complex, and the slope a is the increase in fluorescence for each concentration unit of Spinach-DFHBI complex.
By adding known concentrations of DFHBI to an excess amount of Spinach RNA, it is possible to make a standard series describing the correlation between fluorescence and DFHBI concentration, and estimate the parameters a and b, if it is assumed that DFHBI is bound completely by the excess Spinach, i.e.:
This can be used to calculate the concentration of the Spinach-DFHBI complex given a fluorescence measurement:
If the fluorescence of a Spinach-expressing culture is measured, the standard series can thus be used to calculate the concentration of Spinach-DFHBI complex in the culture.
Calculating Total Spinach Concentration In the Culture
If the fluorescence is measured in the culture with a large excess of DFHBI it can be assumed that the concentration of Spinach-DFHBI is equal to the concentration of correctly folded Spinach, i.e.:
If it is assumed that the fraction of Spinach that is correctly folded is constant and known, the total concentration of Spinach can be calculated:
Quantification of Spinach Per Cell
The amount of Spinach per cell can be calculated if the cell density"

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#HumanPractices#IntegratedHumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," 1. Our expert discussion on the future of gene doping.
2. Inclusion
In Anticipation we discovered the topic of gene doping in the broadest sense, both scientifically as well as ethically and socially. Subsequently, we took it further as a part of the inclusion process to involve as many people as possible for optimal design requirements for everyone. Here are some of the approaches we took in involving people from science , from sports as well as the general public .
2.1 Science
Here we elaborate on science related events that have largely influenced our project. At reflection and responsiveness we elaborate on individual stakeholders that have changed our project.
Hackathon
From our surveys we knew that 98% of the public feels strongly about maintaining strict doping controls. People feel that sports is only moderately fair and 75% is afraid of gene doping becoming a big problem in sports. These figures, and the strong collective spirit that was stressed in Stirling , prompted us to involve cyber security specialists in the fight against gene doping through the design of possible gene doping sequences.
On October 5th, 2018 we therefore organized a Hackathon at the Cyber Security Week in the Fokker Terminal in The Hague. The goal: engaging the public and especially computer scientists in developing their own gene doping sequences. We developed a software tool that learns from the ever growing database our participants helped create. In this way, we improve gene doping detection together, so that we are able to detect new approaches in gene doping and to be one step ahead of the doping developers. We think that together we are stronger, inspiring each other. Many computer scientists joined our event and provided us with useful input from a different perspective.

Stirling Expert Discussion on the Future of Gene Doping
We met professor Dimeo, Associate Professor in Sport from Stirling University, at the VvBN (Dutch Society for Movement Science) conference in Utrecht on May 17. We stayed in touch and received great input from him on social aspects of doping as athlete privacy, behavior, regulation and education. This resulted in mutual interest in each other’s research activities upon which we were invited to give a seminar on our project for experts in the field of doping and genetics at the University of Stirling on August 30th 2018. After this seminar we organized a discussion on how gene doping is different from currently more conventional types of doping and on how to best react to these differences, through regulation and/or education.

Electricity generation
From salinity to electricity
A novel nano-electrode has been proposed by Fablo. et. el that electrical energy can be generated by alternating salinity difference. With the materials sponsored from companies in mainland China in surprisingly large quantities, we have reproduced a even larger electrode (in surface area) with ease. With this at hand, we can turn salinity difference from bacterial action to electrical energy we can use.
The graph above showed the voltage variation of our cell against time.
From the graph above, it is clear that the voltage generated from the cell culture cannot power up any daily electronic device.
Power accumulation
An IC manufactured by Seiko, S-882Z, is a voltage booster that accepts input voltage down to 0.3V. This IC is produced  through fully-depleted Silicon-On-Insulator technology that enables such low voltage input. The output is 1.8V/100uA; this voltage is used to charge up a super-capacitor. The supercapacitor can act as a voltage source for dc-dc converters, provide up to 5V for low-power device applications.

<contacts> <dist> <distName>Czech Republic</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[The Czech Republic’s previous estimate that clearance of the former Soviet military zone at Ralsko would be completed in 2001 had to be revised, due to the discovery of additional contaminated areas of some 3,500 hectares. The government decided to extend the clearance operations until 31 December 2003. One press account said some areas in Ralsko were so contaminated that it may take ten to 20 years before they can be returned to civilian use. However, the April 2002 Article 7 Report notes a greatly decreased level of contamination (15 items per hectare) compared with previous Article 7 Reports (500-1,000 items per hectare). The former military area is now under local authority control; clearance is carried out jointly by military explosive ordnance disposal teams and the police pyrotechnical sanitation team. By the end of 2001, a total of 52,573 items of UXO, excluding infantry ammunition, had been found and destroyed.
The Ralsko former military area (some 250 square kilometers) is sparsely populated and mostly forested. The municipality of Ralsko has about 6,000 inhabitants. There have been no serious accidents from mines and UXO in the area. The high risk areas are marked and fenced off. People living in the area are well aware of its history as a military training ground, and have been told to report any UXO found to the local police. Following government regulations for municipalities in former military areas, information posters on the risk of UXO are posted on the municipality’s information board and website. Information is also given on the regional TV news.
In other parts of the Czech Republic, there are also occasional cases of discovery of UXO left over from the Second World War. Most items of UXO are found near urban areas during construction. Clearance in these emergency cases is the responsibility of the police and the Ministry of Interior, which estimates that during 2001 some 12,000 items of UXO, excluding infantry ammunition, were found in different locations. But due to the lack of centralized statistics, this may include some of the UXO cleared by the police pyrotechnical sanitation unit at Ralsko. Since January 2002, all regional police headquarters are supposed to report all UXO findings"

As I was finally ready to do ligations I did it using our old TOP 10 competent cells and then I did a 1:3 ratio and  1:2 ratio of RFPc and Pcat.  The ligations were transformed but they did not grow the next morning.  However, Alberto's cells did grow when he used the alpha competent cells our post doc Traci had bought. There were many colonies and we were certain that this was a positive outcome.  Therefore, I did ligations of GFP with terminator and RFP with terminator.  Thankfully, the next morning most of the ligations that were made grew with many colonies. A plasmid prep and then a mini prep was done the the ligated GFP+term and RFP+term.  After doing a nanodrop, the concentrations looked amazing.

Figure 1. 200 mM standards of leucine, pro-leu, and CBZ-leu for LC-MS. A. Leucine standard eluted around 1 min and had a spike in intensity at the mass/charge ratio of 91. B. Pro-leu standard eluted around 2 mins and had spikes at m/z ratios of 227 and 455. C. CBZ-leu standard eluted around 15 mins and had spikes at m/z ratios of 156, 264, and 310.
The positive control leucine uptake condition showed a peak at 91 m/z at 1 minute (Figure 2). The pro-leu condition did not have the indicative peaks at m/z 227 and 455 around the 2 minute mark (Figure 3). At 13 mins, CBZ-leu had the identifying spikes at m/z 264 and 310, but also had a large spike at 91 and 215 (Figure 4). These data indicate that pro-leu was not uptaken by E. coli while CBZ-leu was tentatively uptaken.
❮ ❯
The second experiment was a growth test to assay whether leucine auxotrophic E. coli can survive on protected leucine. Growth indicated the organism has an intrinsic cleavage enzyme to cleave the protected leucine, and a lack of growth indicated there is no intrinsic enzyme. We wanted to avoid selecting a protecting group that can be cleaved by the cell’s own mechanisms to prevent cleavage of the protecting group prior to charging of the leucyl-tRNA. JW5807-2 leucine auxotrophic strain was grown in five different conditions:
Negative control with only minimal media
Positive control of minimal media + leucine
Minimal media + 3mM pro-leu
Minimal media + 3mM CBZ-leu
Minimal media + 8mM CBZ-leu
The cells were grown for 47 hours and the concentration of cells were measured at OD600 in a Nanodrop at 12, 18, 24, and 47 hour timepoints. The cells in the positive control with leucine all grew, but there was little to no growth in the CBZ-leu and pro-leu conditions (Figure 5).
However, after conducting the liquid growth experiments, we realized the experimental method left significant room for error because each concentration measurement was an opportunity for contamination of the culture. Furthermore, we realized at this point that pro-leu is not a good choice"
Utah_State,2008,Team:Utah State#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,". necator involves three biosynthetic enzymes. The figure below shows the structure of the PHB operon. Transcription of these genes occurs under conditions of noncarbon nutrient limitation.
Metabolic Pathway
The metabolic pathway for PHB accumulation is depicted in the figure on the left and consists of three major steps (Verlinden, 2007).
1. 3-ketothiolase (PhaA) produces acetoacetyl-CoA by joining two molecules of acetyl-CoA
2. Acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (PhaB) promotes the reduction of acetoacetyl-CoA by NADH to 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA.
3. 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA is polymerized by PHB synthase (PhaC)
Acetyl-coenzyme-A (acetyl-CoA) is a PHB precursor that is naturally produced by these bacteria.
Green Fluorescent Protein
GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) is a protein originally isolated from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria, fluorescing when exposed to ultraviolet light. GFP is used as a tag, attached to proteins as a marker. Only those cells in which the tagged gene is expressed will fluoresce. In such a way GFP acts as a positive marker of tranformation. In our laboratory, GFP is used as an expression reporter of PHB. The GFP gene primarily used in this project was GFP E0240 BioBrick supplied by iGEM.
Methods
Organisms
Two organisms were used as genetic sources for PHB: Cupriavidus necator and an Escherichia coli strain containing the PHB operon in a pBluescript vector.  The E. coli strain proved to be easier to use as a PCR template because of the ability to miniprep the plasmid DNA to use as more pure template.
Transformations
A total of 26 transformations were successfully performed to become familiarized with the transformation process and to test different promoters and reporters.  Three of these transformations were GPF plasmids with promoters of different strengths, taken from the iGEM promoter-testing kit.  Another three of these transformations were BioBrick transformations.  Top 10 competent E. coli cells were used for all transformations, excluding one transformation using a toxin-resistant strain.
Polymerase Chain Reaction
Nine sequences were targeted out of the PHB operon for amplification.  Five PCR targets were promoter sequences:  5’phaCproF/ATG R, 5’"

Thus, our device measures, computes, compares, and corrects, fulfilling each step of control theory. The device also uses machine learning to formulate empirical formulas relating the RGB value of the culture to the inducer and metabolite concentrations.

Please write up to 150 words describing the function of this Part Collection, and give the Range of Part Numbers
This parts collection is a codon-optimized set of biobricks containing pieces of the violacein metabolic pathway for use in yeast. BBa_K2165000 (VioC) and BBa_K2165001 (VioD) are improvements on parts BBa_K1161003 and BBa_K1161004 , respectively, which were originally submitted by the Alberta team in 2013. These basic parts are isolated and easy to insert into a custom violacein system.
BBa_K1161002 and BBa_K1161003 are composite parts containing VioC and VioD from the previous two parts, along with a CUP1 promoter (BBa_K1161002) and a Gal1 promoter (BBa_K1161003) . These parts also contain ADH1 terminators. The inclusion of inducible promoters in each of these constructs makes it easier to control the color output of the violacein pathway by altering the concentration of cupric ions or galactose, respectively, in the cell environment to control the level of expression in the presence of other genes in the violacein pathway.
BBa_K1161003 is an isolated CUP1 inducible promoter for yeast, which can be found in the parts registry as BBa_K945002 ; here, we optimized it and removed RFC illegal restriction sites.

Like for the shake flask cultivation, µmax was determined graphically (figure 5). Bases on the obtained values, the minimum doubling time was calculated. The results are summarized in table (4).
Figure (5): Graphical determination of the maximum specific growth rate µmax for the microcultivations.
All cultures show extended doubling times when compared to the shake flask cultivations. This is not surprising, since the oxygen transfer is much better in shake flasks compared to well plates. Nonetheless, similar final OD600 values were reached in the micro cultivations. Furthermore, the same differences in growth between the different strains can be observed, with E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2 and E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-TAT-SP-PtNTT2 growing the weakest.

Where and How to Use Our Device
According to different researches, genetically engineered bacteria can be delivered as therapy given that several bacteria, e.g. as Escherichia, Clostridium, and Salmonella, naturally target and accumulate in tumor regions when injected into the bloodstream. LeeBacTumTar Bacteria are able to invade tumors due to the hypoxic micro-environment, poor immune surveillance and increased availability of nutrients.
The most current research being done with bacteria and tumors focuses on inducing cell death within the tumor by means of a cytotoxic agent that is delivered by the bacteria. BugajNextGenTherLeeBacTumTar However there is another potential application for bacteria in what concerns tumors, which is the imaging of the latter. Bacterial-aided delivery of imaging agents has allowed tumor visualization through PET BraderAlEColiTumorDectP. Brader, J. Stritzker, C.C. Riedl, P. Zanzonico, S. Cai, E.M. Burnazi, E.R. Ghani, H.

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html,", and Ruminococcus bromii (Dae Lee et al., 2010). Short-chain fatty acids such as propionate, butyrate, and acetate are produced by Bifidobacteriu.
We also researched fermentation conditions that result in higher VFA production. The literature reported highest VFA production when the pH is controlled at 6.8 with NaOH additions (Lifschits, Wolin & Reeds, 1990). Additionally, we discussed the proposed VFA production experiment with Dan, one of our advisors. He suggested reducing the number of replicates and the number of samples we plan to take for the first experiment as our experiment might not work the first time. We also found an alternative method to measure VFA using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) instead of gas chromatography. We contacted Christine Sharp, who is a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Marc Strous’ research lab, as their lab uses HPLC to measure VFA, and they were willing to let us use their HPLC to measure VFA.
Together with our team members from other subgroups, we visited Bonnybrook wastewater treatment plan to discuss wastewater analysis conducted by City of Calgary. We were particularly interested in VFA and COD monitoring in the wastewater treatment plant. Marko Markicevic, the City of Calgary contact we met with, answered our questions about COD and VFA monitoring and suggested we submit a request form obtain COD and VFA data from the City of Calgary. Marko also mentioned a titration method that might be easier for us to use to measure VFA instead of gas chromatography or HPLC. A titration method; however, will only show the total concentration of VFA (unlike the HPLC that can show concentrations of different types of VFA).
Lastly, we contacted nanoparticle manufacturers including US Research Nanomaterials Inc., Nanostructured & Amorphous Materials Inc., Sigma-Aldrich, and NN-Labs to inquire about PHB particles in 20 - 60 nm range. We wanted to obtain PHB nanoparticles to mimic the PHB particles we expect our engineered bacteria will make, in order to start testing our extraction and purification methods.  Only NN-Labs might be able to produce PHB nanoparticles in this size range.

University of East Anglia (Norwich, England) Project
The University of East Anglia team asked for help obtaining soil and sediment samples from various locations around the world. The team wanted to use the samples to test a biosensor that they are developing for their iGEM project. Our team member, David Dinh, went to Crissy Field and Heron's Head Park in San Francisco and dug up sediment samples that were then mailed to the East Anglia iGEM team. We hope the soil samples were useful in the team's work this summer!
University of Nevada, Reno - Meet-up
We were visited by members of the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) iGEM team at the beginning of the summer and were able to talk about our preliminary project ideas. We also had a brainstorming session for our human practices projects so that we could share with the UNR team our method of coming up with and narrowing down our ideas.
NorCal iGEM Team Meet-up
This summer the UC Davis iGEM team hosted a meet-up with other local iGEM teams. We were very excited to attend and had a great time meeting the other teams and hearing about their projects. We received a lot of great feedback and also had fun bowling together after!

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Beyond Basics_-_-_TEXT.html," able to meet industrial members and scientist, but also other iGEM Teams and Randy, founder of the iGEM organization. This was an amazing experience for us and left a big impression on our members during their visit in London. Furthermore, our members were able to listen to different lectures and participate in many discussion rounds.

Biomedica
In 2016 the Biomedica trade fair took place in Aachen from the 30th to the 31st of May. So, many members of our team decided to visit this conference and look at the different topics, which were presented. Moreover, the four headwords: “Pharma, Biotech, Meditech, and Innovation” called our attention. Biomedica started in 2007, as the first Euregional conference on lifesciences. Biomedica started as a joint conference of three already existing conferences in Liege, Aachen and Maastricht. It focusses on combining business and science.
Meet ups
European iGEM Meet up
The iGEM Teams from Paris invited us to visit the European iGEM Meet up in Paris. For our members it was a great experience to participate, because they had the opportunity to get in touch with other iGEM teams, learn something about the different projects and establish a personal contact with other members. Moreover, they had the chance to include the expertise and suggestions from other teams in the planning process of our project. But of course we also had a lot of fun in this amazing city. In this context we want to thank once again the iGEM Teams in Paris for their invitation.

Creative Classroom:
We participated in a lecture of School of Art and Design of Anhui University of Technology, which is a lecture full of art and innovation. Students sat in the classroom in twos and three and designed and exchanged ideas in the large sheet of white paper. As a result, we were impressed by their creative passion. In the lecture, we introduced ourselves and learned from each other. After that, we briefly introduced our project and the synthetic biology knowledge in order to let them learn more about our it. Then we showed the logo of of the Maze, which is our theme. Finally we put forward our request of designing a poster according to the maze and our project content. During the process of designing, the team members answered their questions about the content of the project. Finally the students showed us their wonderful works. We listened to their designing ideas, put forward our suggestions, and finally accepted their suggestions and took photos together.
Social Media:
We think of social media as a way for more people to understand synthetic biology. We have created the WeChat public site of iGEM, and pushed articles on that. We also put the creative works of video and art creative class on the home page of the public number. We then uploaded security video on YOUTUBE. In this way, we not only promote the knowledge of synthetic biology to the public through social media, but also improve ourselves through interactions.

This way we will create not only a wide range of BiFC proteins of different parameters, but also provide systematic and standardized information about sensitivity and specificity of each combination. We will also measure Venus- and Cerulean-based BiFC fragments already present in the registry.
Unfortunately, vacation is over and we did not manage to fulfill our ultimate goal and measure our constructs this year. We will however continue working on the toolbox, as we feel it will prove a valuable addition to the Registry.

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," how beneficial early detection of NSCLC is, but we had not explored the clinical implementation of our sensor before talking to him. He suggested offering the test to high risk individuals for whom the pre-symptomatic diagnosis of their cancer could lead to an increase in the rate of survival: in the case of NSCLC, this could be carried out by offering the test to those with a certain smoking history. To determine which individuals had a sufficiently high risk of developing NSCLC, for our sensor to be cost effective, we have designed a cost model - take a look below.
He also proposed that if the concept of our test were to be proven and a variety of miRNAs could be detected as biomarkers for a range of cancers, then our test could be used as a screening tool for anyone over a certain age, due to the increase in cancer prevalence with age. His comments led us to research the required criteria below for our sensor to be used as a screening tool. His advice on the high sensitivity and specificity required fed into our need to create a second series of switches.
Dr Sujal Desai
We discussed the use of our sensor for high risk population screening with Dr Desai, a consultant chest radiologist. He informed us that lung cancer rarely presents before age 40, and to maximize the test’s value it should be offered to those aged 55 and above, with a smoking history - so that we would not waste money offering the test to too many people who were very unlikely to have cancer.
To integrate their advice, we worked with our our modeling team to work out who would we should screen. Tammegami et al.’s probability score is the probability of an individual getting lung cancer in the next 6 years. [2]
Using our model which combined this with the data for our project and standard NSCLC treatment, we worked out for what probabilities it would be cost effective for us to screen. The model showed that our tool could be cost effective at cost per QALY - saving lives and saving the NHS money. It shows that even if our sensitivity was lower than we expect, our sensor would be extremely cost effective.

In this manner, the cost is especially important because our kit was developed to target those in the rural location who have a higher risk of HIV. Thereby, in order for this kit to be able to reach its target audience, the cost must be competitive with other existing models. Creating a kit with an idealistic purpose, but in reality, using the kit for those that can afford it undermine both the purpose and the ethics of such a project. In an effort to keep costs low, we utilized methods to efficiently organize the materials such as aliquoting to prevent contamination and only provide the necessary quantities. Similarly, the protocols for our kit do not require expensive machinery like other tests. This helps to not only keep the overall price low but allows us to use the kit in laboratories without much equipment. Throughout our project we have kept the protocols minimalistic but efficient, with the majority of material including cellular reagents and CRISPR complexes that are combined in microcentrifuge tubes; we have devised a protocol that suits our target audience and all others involved.')   ) );"

CCiC
Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) is one of the biggest synthetic biology conferences for all iGEM teams in China. With its rapid development, nowadays CCiC has grown into a mature medium for scientific leaders to pass on advanced knowledge to the upcoming successors. This year, we were proudly to be the host of the fifth CCiC, gathering 63 iGEM teams and more than 500 participants in ShanghaiTech University.
Themed “Among us, past, present and future meet” , the fifth CCiC aimed to gather present and past iGEMer to share experience and memory about participating iGEM as well as knowledge people learned from iGEM. We were looking forward to providing a platform for iGEMer or people who are interested in iGEM and synthesis biology to communicate and exchange their mind. The conference was held from August 28th to August 31st. We were honored to invite members of iGEM headquarters, Meagan Lizarazo and Richard Johnson to attend our conference and deliver interesting lectures.
During the four-day conference, we organized team presentation and poster session for iGEM teams to present their work, providing participants with precious opportunities to improve collaboration and learn from each other. To make sure that each team could get helpful feedback for the last month’s preparation for the Giant Jamboree, we invited present iGEMers to judge each team’s presentation and poster as well as experienced past iGEMers to host panel session. Every team that participated in the fifth CCiC had chances to receive instructions and give suggestions.
Besides, according to elaborate voting for special events, we held special events such as trouble-shooting which focused on problems solving for various parts of iGEM project and After-iGEM show where teams present relevant artwork, books, software, business or academic achievements derived from iGEM. We believed that these events are meaningful to continuously spread the enthusiasm of participating iGEM.

Our model has two branches – prediction model and statistical model. The aim of both is to help further characterize our system.
We wish our Bio-pesticide project could be brought to the market one day. And when compared to the traditional pesticides, cost is an important competitive factor. So we want to know the real cost of our project under the established experiment design. If it is too much expensive, we would consider to optimize the plan for a lower cost.
DsRNA application dosage model and the cost prediction model are used to answer this question. RNAi efficiency model is to figure out which length of dsRNA is the ideal inhibitor to suppress target gene and the better way to sustain dsRNA under the normal circumstance.
These three models correlate with each other, and finally guided us to optimize our project design in crucial steps.
RNAi Effciency
Application Dosage
Cost Prediction
Motivation
Our project application depends on a vital factor: the stability and life period of dsRNA in natural surroundings where contains many adverse elements.
Through papers we knew that dsRNA can sustain for more than 2 weeks in soil (Jeffrey G. Scott, et al, 2013), but which is still too short to guarantee enough RNAi efficiency for weeding. We need set up a model of the vital factors that will influence dsRNA stability in order to take steps for prolonging dsRNA lifetime.
Meanwhile, the relationship between dsRNA length and the suppression efficiency is important for our experiments to design optimal dsRNA producing vectors.
We collected a lot of RNAi experiments data from reviews and research articles. Also, Thanks to labs dedicate to RNAi in the school of life science in Lanzhou University, providing us useful data to finish our prediction.
Methodology
1. Set up a model of the vital factors that will influence dsRNA stability.      \[ k=\frac{[n^{dsRNA}]}{[n^e]}+k^{UV}+k^h \]     \[ n^{dsRNA}=M/N_A \]

Dry Lab Overview
Our modelling team (Stefan, Pengli and Catherine) is working on a predictive model for spider silk properties and tested it with a supercomputer. Meanwhile the outreach team, including Giovanni and Jacopo G, created a informative podcast published on Loq. about biocontainment with a vocabulary suited for the general public.
Wet Lab Overview
In a joint team effort we cloned the Final Brick into all backbones through Golden Gate. In the photo below the blue-white screening can be seen. The agarose-gel electrophoresis of digested plasmids showed the Final Brick at the expected size. We picked blue colonies for sequencing and they were confirmed to be correct! This is a great success as it allows us to continue with the production of spider silk. There are various constructs we need to clone, some of which need to be assembled first.
Week 17 (August 13 - August 17)
Dry Lab Overview
After various discussions with the London iGEM teams we agreed on the following events to address the most common concerns:
1. 16th September - Troubleshoot at KCL
2. 26th September - Discussion Panel at Imperial
3. 20th October - Mini-Jamboree
The Mini-Jamboree will be a chance for us to give feedback to each other in preparation for Boston.

Peking,2010,Team:Peking#Project#Bioabsorbent#FacilitationModule_-_-_TEXT.html," the resistance to Hg (II) because mutations that affect the expression of MerC did not affect the resistance. The discovery in Thipobacillus isolated from mercury mines of operons that apparently had only merC and no merT genes forced reconsideration of the view that merC is vestigal. Cloning the Thiobacillus merC gene into E.coli revealed that its product was able to function in Hg (II) uptake, although not as effective as merT[1].
The 161-residue membrane-bound protein merC is predicted to have four transmembrane helices and is the largest protein in the mer operon. Studies concluded that merC is evolving differently than genes immediately adjacent to it in the operons where it occurs and maybe also evolving differently in different hosts. It has been proposed that merC may be needed under conditions of very high Hg (II) exposure, perhaps because merC system can uptake Hg (II) without the need of merP.
Figure 2: The summary of the function of MerT, MerP and MerC in the absorption of Hg (II) and their location within the cell. Note that the MerP binds Hg (II) in the periplasm and passes it to MerT, and then transfers it to MerA for reduction. Adapted from [1].
Since our bioabsorbent should capture Hg (II) as much as possible, aiming at this, artificial operon consisting of merP, merT, merC under the regulation of T7 promoter was constructed. T7 promoter was driven by constitutively expressed T7 polymerase. We hope that this design will endow our bioabsorbent with greater decontamination power.
Figure 3: The overall structure of the facilitation module. The constitutive expression of MerT, MerP and MerC are driven by T7 promoter. This facilitation module was expected to enable the bacteria to absorb more Hg (II) into the cytosol by facilitating the transmembrane process of Hg (II).

Hi Professor Mathews,
I hope that jury duty went well!
If we could get the PHYA cDNA in the pUC18 vector from you that would be fantastic. We would very much appreciate your help with making the PHYB and PIF3. We acquired a couple of Arabidopsis plants from a grad student in Naomi Pierce's lab yesterday and we were planning to do an RNA extraction and clone the PHYB and PIF3 out ourselves, if you think that is the best way to proceed.
If you think the phycochromobilin would work, we would also appreciate a sample of that. We did get Spirulina and are planning to attempt a PCB extraction soon.
What we are planning to do for our iGEM project is to create a cellular blackboard, using the Phy system in yeast. We want to use the PhyA and/or PhyB to turn on transcription of a green luciferase, so we can ""write"" on the blackboard using a red laser pointer. We would then ""erase"" the blackboard with far-red light to turn off luciferase transcription (although we will just have to wait for the luciferase to degrade then).
We were also thinking of engineering a system where we have two populations of yeast cells communicate with eachother using light. We would turn on production of a red luciferase in one population by shining a laser on it. The light produced by that population would then be used to turn on production of the luciferase in another population of cells.
If you have any thoughts or advice on either of these projects please let me know!
I can come by any time today or after lunch tomorrow, let me know when is most convenient for you! I actually have a couple of questions for you if you have a few minutes to talk in person in the next couple of days. Let me know what your schedule looks like!
Thanks,
Amrita
Response from Lagarias, jclagarias@ucdavis.edu
Colleagues,
I have been contacted for a related request by a Wash University iGEM Team. I told them that we would have to complete an MTA to send any plasmids (and we do not have PIF clones that we are at liberty to send; they were obtained from other labs). FYI, I have attached a protocol for PCB isolation.
Best.

Red Lab Overview
Members: Bastian, Giulia, Stael, Thue
Our Goal
Testing the selected organisms under Mars-like stress. We also try to acclimatize organisms specifically for space exploration.
Our Facilities
The Red Lab is an ingenious mix of high-tech equipment and easy practical solutions. We utilise the Jens Martin Mars Chamber of the University of Copenhagen to test for the parameters of:
Low pressure
Low temperature extremes (approx. 193K)
High CO2 concentrations
UV Radiation
To know
exactly
how this is achieved, see Experimental Concept .
Our collaboration with iGEM Leiden furthermore allows us to experiment with microgravity by virtue of their Random Positioning Machine.
Figure 1: The Jens Martin Mars Chamber at the Niels Bohr Institute used to test the behaviors of our bacteria under harsh conditions.
Data analysis takes place using the methods of haemocytometer and optical density readings. This allows for both exact counting of living organisms following the experiments, but also quantitative readings over a longer period of time to investigate subsequent growth patterns after exposure. That is to say, the long term effects after one-time exposure for varying durations.

The Importance of Space Exploration
""The Earth is the cradle of humanity, but mankind cannot stay in the cradle forever""
The words are of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, and they ring possibly even truer today than they did when he spoke them. Our project is ambitious and has the potential for far-reaching consequences in its ability to produce plastic, but our eyes are set on an even larger goal. Space exploration and more importantly colonization is an issue that we have tackled, and it's been the focus of our outreach campaign and our ethical considerations. We have formulated a vision and a list of arguments for human ambition in space as part of our Integrated Human Practices and defending them is also the responsibility of the"

In the summer, our department held a bio-camp. We spent a morning teaching them what synthetic biology is and introducing iGEM to them. In the beginning, I thought they might fall asleep during our lecture, but it was totally different to what I thought. All of them were fascinated by the idea of using enzymes and different assemblies of biobricks to create new functions, and interacted enthusiastically with us. For high school students, it is hard to imagine how scientists transfer genes into bacteria and plants. So we used some easy ways to explain how we do those jobs and we also designed some games to help them learn the basics of biobrick assembly. After this class, I think they gained a deeper understanding of synthetic biology. Hopefully through our iGEM introduction, they are inspired to become future iGEMers or even synthetic biologists.

To further understand the real practicability of our device, we visited the Green Market in NTHU this summer. We had a good time interviewing with organic agriculture farmers. Through the interview, we could assess the feasibility of future development of our project as well. What's more, we designed questionnaires for farmers in green market in NTHU. The questionnaires were to publicize how our device works and we also learn from their advice.

After we visited the green market, we knew that pest plague is surely a big problem for them, especially for those who grow fruits and vegetables.

In vitro Assay Methodology
To truly demonstrate that our mutation optimization procedure reduces the physical occurrence of DNA mutations, we had to take an in vitro approach. We needed methods for visualizing the incidence of mutagenic DNA lesions on purified samples of DNA. Ideally, these methods would be compatible with a wide variety of DNA lesions, and would have specificity to the particular lesion that we are trying to quantify.
After searching through the published literature, we were unable to find any single protocol that met all of these criteria. However, we did identify several that each had components of our ideal assay. Therefore, we decided to adapt protocols from several sources in order to develop a reliable, high-resolution method for quantifying virtually any form of DNA damage.
That starting point for our approach was a class of DNA repair enzymes. What these enzymes have in common is that they recognize certain forms of mutagenic lesions on a DNA helix, where they then hydrolyze the DNA strand's sugar-phosphate backbone (in addition to other potential activities, such as excising entire bases). These enzymes were excellently suited to give us the lesion specificity and targeting diversity that we were looking for. By selecting different repair enzymes, we could tailor the range of substrates that are targeted: for example, NEIL1 recognizes most forms of oxidized DNA bases, while FPG is restricted to 8-oxoguanine. There are enzymes for oxidation, ultraviolet radiation, alkylation, and more, which spans effectively all of the hotspots that we were interested in studying.
To visualize and quantify the enzymatically-processed DNA samples, we investigated multiple options. One of these was looking at the conversion of plasmids from their usual supercoiled confirmation to a nicked confirmation. Another utilizes alkaline denaturing electrophoresis to separate the DNA into single strands, which then can be assayed for fragmentation,"

They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.

This year our team consists of 12 enthusiastic students from different fields in the Faculty of Science and Engineering. Our different backgrounds make for different views which helped us advance our project. Besides aiming to get the best possible outcomes for our project, which you can read more about here , we spent time to go from just strangers working together on a project to a fun team of friends, as a big part of iGEM is about working as a team. To create the best possible atmosphere with our group we had weekly dinners together and organised fun activities to do together. As a team we participated in some great iGEM related events, including the European meet-up in Munich, the Hackathon in Vilnius and a trip to our friends in Bordeaux!

MSc Medical and Pharmaceutical Drug Innovation
Currently, I am in the final year of the research master Medical and Pharmaceutical Drug Innovation and about to finish the last course. After that, I will become a busy iGEM-labrat for the summer! The practical and theoretical experience I obtained during my various internships will hopefully help to make our project an all-time success story.

MSc Ecology and Evolution
Currently, I am in the final weeks of my master Ecology and Evolution during which I followed the ‘Science, Business & Policy’ track. Before I will start my working life (eventually) after this summer, I will be busy for the iGEM team of Groningen this year. The reason I joined this team is, besides that fact it looks good on your resume ofcourse, that I get to team up with a bunch of super smart, ambitious people that combine a whole lot of different expertises.

(5) Because the rate of transcription is much faster than the rate of the translation, we think the rate-limiting step is the translation.
The reaction processes of circuits are described as below:
""In-promoter"" activity:
And groups of differential equations are:
The initial values and description of variables are:
From all these we can finally get two the diagrams, the first one is about the relationship between the concentration of inhibitor protein and number of plasmids, the second one about the relationship between RFP intensity and number of plasmids
Fig. 3 The intensity of inhibitor expressed by constitutive promoter changes with different plasmid numbers.
From this curves, we can know the inhibitor protein have a positive correlation with number of plasmids. At before, we think when the concentration of inhibitor is above 24.42 units, the in-promoter will be repressed fully. And then from this curve, we can see that when the concentration of inhibitor is 23.95 units are so similar with 24.42 units, the threshold of the plasmids number we calculate is 210 copies.
Fig.3 The intensity of RFP expressed by PR promoter changes with different plasmid numbers.
From this curve, we can see that corresponding to the threshold of RFP intensity (12.05 units), we can calculate out the threshold of plasmid number 210 copies.
Here goes our conclusion: The number of the plasmids will determine the intensity of RFP. When the plasmids number is above the threshold 210 copies, rfp (stands for killer gene) will be just repressed, and the cells with enough plasmids number will be saved.
·Summary·
With these three models, we successfully prove that：
① The number of plasmids will have a positive influence on the corresponding inhibitor’s concentration.
② Since ""in-promoter"" will respond to the inhibitor with different concentrations differently, we can decide whether the killer gene express or not by changing the concentration of inhibitor.
To make a long story short, we successfully prove that the number of plasmids will affect the ""in-promoter's"" activity. By rudimentary calculation, we can say when the number of plasmid is above the threshold (210 copies), the inhibitor can just repress the expression of killer gene and the cell can survive. Once the plasmid number gets smaller, the inhibitor won’t work anymore, our P-SLACKiller time starts!

2. Primers of gBlock assembly were prepared so that the concentration became 10 uM while gBlock final concentration was 10 ng/uL.
3. PCR was performed but running gel was failed due to human error so 2 pieces of new 1% agarose gel were prepared and PCR was done again overnight.

1. To check whether GFP (27 kDa) was expressed in BBa_K577881 when the BioBrick was induced with 0.2% arabinose,
- SDS-PAGE was performed using Pageruler sm0671 as the marker → Results: a thick band of about 25 kDa after staining with Coomassie blue
- Western blot was performed using Pageruler sm0671 as the marker → Negative results
2. A new CM30 plate was streaked with BBa_K577881 in DH10B induced by 0.2% arabinose as an alternative method to check for GFP expression.
3. Running gel was performed to confirm the PCR products that gBlock 1, 3, 4 and 5 showed correct band size though gBlock 4 had some non-specific cut. gBlock 2 showed wrong band size. PCR was done again.
4. For gBlock"
