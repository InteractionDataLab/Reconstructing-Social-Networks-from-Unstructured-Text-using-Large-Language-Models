At the same time, a backbone swap to CAM for Fer/Hyd took place followed by transformation and plating up.
Hydrogen production data collection by Clark electrode continued.
HydEFG was digested (single and double digests performed on 7 separate colonies) and screened on gel. Meanwhile we await sequencing result.
As the gel was running, a team member messaged the group saying that  unfortunately the protocol used was not an updated version…
After visualising the completed gel, it appeared the digests were only successful for 3/7 samples?
No more backbone PCR amplifications took place this week.

Lanes 2, 4 and 6 show double digest of fer using Eco-RI and PstI (E+P) with bands at ~1700 bp and ~2000 bp. Lanes 8, 10 and 12 show hyd1 single digest with E (~3700bp). Lanes 9, 11 and 13 show double digest of hyd1 using E+P (~1700 bp and ~2000 bp).
Week 8 (21/8/17-25/8/17)
Dry Lab
We decided on a group name; H2ydroGEM.
We reviewed our budget with supervisor Dr Louise Brown sharing some budget number crunching. We are awaiting a final list of lab sponsors from Adrianna by the end of next week.
The Synthetic Biology Australasia (SBA) conference will allow 6 people (chosen) to attend and Bioplatforms may allow two more (awaiting confirmation). Due to SBA funding, alongside Adriana’s new sponsor, we only lost a total of $ 1K AUD.  We aim to stream our presentation at the conference live on Facebook.
The team members traveling to Boston for the jamboree will be finalised by the end of this month. We have not yet heard back from Bioplatforms (Andrew Gilbert) in regards to the sponsorship opportunity.
Australasian Conference of Undergraduate Research (ACUR) grant was approved. Flights and accommodation have been booked and finalised. Ali and India are preparing the iGEM presentation. We plan on live streaming our presentation of"

Our Kill Switch in Action
The scheme below shows what we want to see happen in the absence of arabinose.
The assumption here was that there isn’t a sufficient amount of arabinose to increase antiholin levels. We have used the value given by Team TU-Delft in 2013 where they estimated 190 molecules of holin to be lethal and assumed antiholin to have the initial value of 190 molecules. Then we forced them to form dimers with holin until there was none left which would eventually lead to a lethal amount of Holin molecules being present in the cell. The equations and parameters below were used in our model.
Holin mRNA Concentration: [Copy number]*[Strength]-([Dilution rate]*[Holin mRNA]+[Degradation rate of Holin]*[Holin mRNA])
Holin Concentration: [Translation coefficient]*[Holin mRNA]-[Dilution constant of protein]*[Holin]
Endolysin mRNA Concentration: [Copy number]*[Strength] ]-([Dilution rate]*[Endolysin mRNA]+[Degradation rate of Endolysin]*[Endolysin mRNA])
Endolysin Concentration: [Translation coefficient]*[Endolysin mRNA] ]-[Dilution constant of protein]*[Endolysin]
Dimer complex concentration: [Forward rate]*[Holin]*[Antiholin] -[Reverse rate]*[Dimer complex]
The graph below shows the change in molecule concentrations of Holin mRNA, Holin, Endolysin mRNA, Endolysin, Antiholin and dimer complexes over 10 seconds. All of our species except for Antiholin had the initial amount of 0. The decrease of Antiholin from 190 molecules as the amount of dimer complexes increases until Antiholin is completely depleted can be seen while Holin molecules increase. This means that the second part of our kill switch is functional.
Butyrate Production
Knowing that our bacteria are now able to bind to cancerous cells in theory, we moved on to the treatment section of our project.
Our main goal while making the butyrate model was to show an increase in the concentrations of both butyrate and But-CoAT. The scheme below was used the provide us with graphs.
We started off by diffusing arabinose into our cell and used the equations below. The equations and parameters for the reactions from Tfactor Concentration to PBAD formation were taken from Team UC_Davis 2013’s wiki"

An Hu Home > member
Here is a Chinese boy named An Hu, a senior student studying in Nanjing University. I dreamed of becoming a zoologist when I was little, because I am a crazy zoophile. However, I chose a different way which is to protect human instead of animals so that I will try my best to be a biochemist.  I'm proud of my dream now.  I took part in iGEM to practice myself, and I hope to make friends with you all. :)

This software allows the user to automatically track and size nanoparticles on an individual basis. The results can be displayed as frequency size distribution graphs and output to a spreadsheet file format. It is, however, worth noting that this procedure overestimates the size of particles, and so any measurements of OMV size we show on our Wiki are larger than the true size. We would like to thank EnGeneIc Pty Ltd for their expertise in the use of the LM20, and for the assistance of their staff in running our samples on the machine.
Improving a Previous Project
Previously, Paris 2009 had submitted a domain of the E. coli protein TolR to the registry as BBa_K257005. We intended to use this part, only to find that it lack a start codon, as well as a second stop codon (a common feature to better terminate translation). The big issue, then, is that for this part to be expressed it needs an external start codon, which is often fine if being cloned into an expression vector. However, commonly 3A assembly does not add a start codon, as coding parts tend to begin with an ATG. To thus make this part more usable in 3A assembly, we submitted a new construct to the registry (BBa_K2022002) with the above conditions, and went so far as to characterise it and confirm its role in the cell! All the above is also documented on Paris 2009’s part page.

Lack of organization and sufficient space looked to pose a problem early on in the class. However, by splitting the students into two groups and dividing the class between two rooms, we were able to avoid crowding in the lab space and teach a successful class on synthetic biology and its scientific and social influence.
Collaboration and Outreach
We helped out a few other universities too! We collaborated with the BU-Wellesley Software team to assist them in their goal of creating an ambient auxiliary system for the laboratory setting, by helping them bridge the designer and end-user gap. Their project, appropriately called "" Puppetshow ,"" aims to automate laboratory processes through the use of automated liquid-handling robots while preserving the sensibility and communicability of a human researcher. Wellesley students visited our lab twice and we provided them with information for the HCI (human-computer interaction) aspects of their project, including showing them the techniques used on our lab.
We also served as Beta testers for BU's software project, including providing a robot configuration for them and allowing them to install their software on our igem computer to get feedback from us. Finally, our team programmed a robot that was used to characterize parts made by the BU iGEM team.
Depicted above is the 2011 MIT iGEM team's addition to the DARPA funded robot in collaboration with BU. We programmed a user interface for the colony picker that can be found here . A video of one of our instructors using our interface to guide the robot can be found here . The scanner can also be used a 2D barcode scanner, thanks to a collaboration with Ginkgo that allowed us to port their technology to the scanner.

Introduction
In our project, we want to use Cre-Loxp recombination, a site-specific recombinase technology to carry out inversions in the DNA of cells which can change the initial ‘AND’ gate to the ‘OR’ gate. Due to the fact that the inversion is invertible, what we expect to achieve is that to a great extent the genes are transferred from initial state to the desired state.
The mathematical model of the whole process can be divided into two parts：Part 1: Construction of DDE equations to describe the process of the generation of Cre protein and Cre protein binding to Loxp sites. The result shows that the concentration of Cre protein and Cre protein binding to Loxp sites grow to a peak and then degrade to zero. Part 2: Using Gillespie algorithm to simulate the stochastic process of the reversal after Cre binds to Loxp sites. We can see from the result of this part that the inversion only happens when Cre protein binding to Loxp sites exists and about 50% of genes flip to the state we want. To analyze the property of this model, we then design the Part 3. Part 3: Sensitivity analysis of several parameters. We analyze three parameters and the third parameter –the degradation rate of Cre protein –have an obvious effect on the final percent of the genes in different state, which inspires us to introduce a feed forward to the system to increase the percent of the genes flip to the state we want, so we have the Part 4. Part 4: The addition of the feed forward part and the analysis of the new model. By introducing a feed forward to the system, we do get the desired result that more genes flip to the state we want.

Tokyo_Tech,2009,Team:Tokyo Tech#cph_-_-_TEXT.html," construct Biobrick coding cph8 and PCB-related enzymes, assay them, and characterize them. We used the strain, Ru1012 [MC4100 ara+ φ(OmpC-lacZ) 10-25 ΔenvZ::KanR], which chromosomally codes a ompC promoter fused to a lacZ reporter. That strain enables us to assay the activity of cph8 and PCB-related enzymes easily. Origin and resistance on the backbone is the most significant matter we have to consider, because we planned to transform Ru1012, putting two plasmids into it and the origins and resistances of the two plasmids should be different. Because Ru1012 codes KanR, we have to prepare two kinds of backbones. One codes AmpR, and the other codes Cm respectively.
The protocol for the lacZ assay
To quantitatively determine the performances of photo-receipting parts, we measured the amount of β-galactsidase expressed from lacZ reporter.
  1.  Diluted overnight cultures of photo-receipting strains grown at 37℃ into 1:1000 2mL LB medium containing appropriate antibiotics in        two 24-well plates
  2.  Incubated two plates at 37℃ for 5 hours, one was exposed with 660nm LED lamp  glowing at 7W, and the other was wrapped in        aluminum foil and kept in darkness
  3.  Diluted each strain into 1:100 in new wells
  4.  Incubated two plates at 37℃ for another 5 hours, one was exposed with LED lamp, and the other was wrapped in aluminum foil and kept        in darkness
  5.  Spun 2mL of the final culture at 6000 rpm for 10 minutes in a microcentrifuge and then resuspended in 2mL of Z buffer
  6.  Recorded the cell density by measuring the OD600 using spectrophotometer
  7.  Diluted 0.5mL of the resuspended cells into 1mL in Z buffer and permeabilized by the addition of 100µL of chloroform and 50µL of 0.1%        SDS
  8.  vortexed and allowed to equilibrate at 28℃ for 5"

Victoria_Australia,2009,Team:Victoria Australia#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," transfer to the environment. Furthermore, for gene production to occur most readily, the gene must go into a vector or cell containing a T7 phage polymerase enzyme to replicate, which in nature is  not commonly present. Hence a specific recombination event is most likely to be the risks associated with this chassis and naked DNA plasmids.
A fun application we promote is the use of the fluorescent system in Christmas lights. This would create specific societal concerns about the risks of young children eating the synthetically engineered lights which could look similar to a child to the confectionaries which may also decorate the tree. Using a wheat germ or other plant-based extract provides a non-toxic alternative (ie wheat in many households is consumed on a daily basis). However, using an E.Coli extract in the cell free system can be toxic if consumed due to the endotoxins present, resulting in anaphylactic shock. Gene transfer in such a scenario is a highly unlikely but conceptually feasible event.
IP and Gene Patenting
We have put forward material to advance Synthetic Biology and retained specific IP material that has arisen in the course of our project to develop ourselves. Patent protection varies from case to case. DNA is patentable when it has been isolated, purified, or modified to produce a new form not found in nature. In relation to our project, we had isolated the yellow fluorescent protein, purified it and modified it via Polymerase chain reaction to produce a new recombinant blueberry protein. However this invention is not newly discovered and therefore not patentable and judging from our research on the matter, was not a patent from due to previous disclosures as papers in the scientific literature.
Some patents have been granted for fragments of DNA. This presents a problem for someone trying to patent a larger fragment or gene that contains the already patented sequence. Awareness has been raised as to whether the user will need to obtain a license from the first inventor or whether they can obtain the patent without the first patent holder's permission. This is likely to arise in the near future and will most likely be resolved in courts designated to hear patent actions, but currently has not been ruled upon. Modified bacteria are patentable as they do not occur naturally in nature. Our research involved the use of bacteria being E.Coli, however, this was not modified beyond “as supplied” by scientific companies where they are subject to patents, hence this work is not patentable. The cell-free chassis we tested is likewise subject to patenting laws and we have manufactured our own chassis in-house based on literature which is not covered under patent law, and hence these concerns do not apply and"

Can Synthetic Biology and iGEM help?
Several laboratories across the world are trying to make an impact in the production of energy by using engineered bacteria. We decided to take a look at the contribution of iGEM in the Energy field.
In 2009, when tracks were introduced, energy was included in the track “Food and Energy” and in 2014, “Energy” was included as a separate track. Since 2006, when the competition was born, 65 groups competed in this track. We looked closely at these projects and discovered that biofuels is the preferred topic. Only 8% of the teams worked on MFC like us. Only two times a project of the Energy track reached the three finalist: Bielfied 2013 (Ecoelectricity) [15] and TU Darmstadt 2014 (The Grätzel Cell) [16] both in the overgraduate section.
iGEM energy projectsDistribution of topics of iGEM projects in the Energy track from 2006 to 2014
Do you know how much energy is needed to light up a house?
Different devices need different power Energy needed to power up small household devices compared with electricity produced by bacteria in a typical iGEM MFC which produces between 200-500 μW (data based on Bielfield 2013 and Trento 2015 results).
To understand the gap that there is between the energy needs of a house and the energy that a bacteria can make today we looked at the energy consumption of few household devices. We used as a representative example of a bacteria producing energy in the MFC built by Bielfield in 2013 versus our solarpMFC. In both cases the amount of energy produced is in the range of 200-500 μW.
Qualitative representation of household energy consumption Today’s energy usage is way too high and cannot be supplied by synthetic biology. In the future this consumption will be halved while synthetic biology research, that is constantly evolving, will be able to satisfy the future’s demand.
Obviously the gap between the energy needs and our current ability to use bacteria to produce energy needs to be decreased. We have a hope for a future where synthetic biology will develop higher energy producing systems, but all this can make a difference only if energy consumption will one day be significantly cut.

Aug. 1: Correcting MoClo Issues
Discussing the poster speeches
Our to-do list still isn't empty, so we spent our morning fixing some more problems. We threaded the data sheet and changed the appearance of parts to display their common names instead of their Parts Registry Gene ID. We also changed the primer designer of Level 0 parts so that it only shows one fusion site on each side, instead of the two we had before. Kara and I got a little stuck figuring out how to set a default fusion site for a certain part, and so we spent awhile thinking about how to restructure certain parts of the primer designer. The art sub-team had to borrow Uppy for the afternoon, so we took a break and discussed the poster speeches instead. Our team also printed our final posters in the afternoon.
Aug. 2: Last day of the summer session!
Presenting our MoClo Planner Poster at the Poster Session!
Eating dinner at the Cuban restaurant
Today's the last day of the summer session! It seems like yesterday when I first met my lab mates. It was a pretty relaxed morning - I couldn't work on Uppy because the art team was preparing to demo their application on Uppy, so I wrote an audio transcription for one of my lab mate's interviews about the electronic lab notebook. It was one of our originally brainstorming ideas, but we decided to focus on other projects instead - the interview was interesting to listen to anyways. At lunch, the entire lab got together for about two hours and practiced introducing our project and answering potential questions. After that, at 2:00 pm, we all headed down to the Wellesley Summer Research Program Poster Session - everyone who conducted research this summer was there with a poster of their project. Since we had a large team and not very much room, we took shifts. I got to go around and see what other people accomplished, and I also got to tell others about our project. It was a great experience. Afterwards, the whole lab went to a Cuban restaurant for dinner to celebrate the end of the summer session. The iGEM experience has been so much fun so far, and I can't wait to come back in 3 weeks to continue working on the MoClo Planner.

Wednesday, 14 September 2011
Nadine tried to purify the PCR products of the TetR mutants, but lost them during the process... So she re-ran the PCR and used it directly do do Gibson assemblies that she later transformed into DH5alpha cells.
She looked at the plates containing the biobrick variants and made colony PCRs on five colonies of variats 3,4 and 15. The resuklts show that we have 2 good colonies for 3 and one for 5.
Finally, the Plac promoter being correctly inserted into J61002 Plac-RFP plasmid, Nadine also ran a PCR to add biobrick extensions to the promoter.
Vdog ran a ten-hour experiment with the help of Henrike and Matt. We made two 100 mL batches LB with Kan and Amp in 1:1000 dilutions. We then took the two sets of four tubes of 5 mL liquid cultures (of C2-Lys-Ptet-RFP & C11-Lys-Ptet-RFP) and spun them down, threw away the supernatant, resuspended them in 5 mL of PBS buffer, spun them down again, resuspended once more in 5 mL of PBS buffer, and then spun them down again before resuspending one last time in 1 mL of PBS buffer. The final tube of resuspended and clean culture contained no more than 4 mL. We then took cuvettes and measured the OD of each culture in a 1:100 dilution. We then calculated the amount of liquid culture we would need to put in each flask to produce an equal starting OD for both flasks of around .4
Every hour, we took 1 mL samples from both flasks, spun them down, sterile filtered the supernatant, and stored the resulting filtered supernatant for transformations the next day. We also took OD measurements of samples from the flask. The flasks were incubated for an hour at 37 C before being taken out for measurements.
The results of the experiment indicate that not only do we have successful lysing of the relevant cells, but we also are able to recover the relevant DNA, not only as is found in the supernatant by qPCR but also by looking at the number of colonies produced by each hourly sample when transformed.

I set up an inocula of the E. coli previously transformed with the tetR-CSD plasmid and made a miniprep. At the same time, I checked the results of the PCR of  sir3 and swi6. I have just been lucky with the last one.
I have repeated the PCR to get sir3 from the plasmid, using different conditions: I modified the initial concentration of the DNA template and reduced the annealing temperature), but the result was again negative. Then, I have launched a new strategy and cut the plasmid containing sir3 gene with  restriction endonucleases to purify the entire gene and use it late as template for a new PCR. This strategy also allows me to check that the plasmid was the right one.
In the meantime, I have made sequential cuts of tetR-CSD, pPnmt1(41X) and swi6, all the components of the compaction module, apart from the slippery sir3. However, we have got some bad news. The rest of the synthesized parts that we had order will be delayed at least four weeks. Desperation!!! Let's do it old-style way, amplifying the parts with primers and assembling them with DNA ligase!
Week 4 (July, 25-29)
I began this week trying to clone into the pREP41X vector the parts of two compaction modules (tetR-CSD, tetR-Swi6). I transformed E. coli DH5α with the ligation products. The following day, I used a new method for screening recombinant clones, colony cracking, but I didn't obtain positive results. So, I tried with minipreps and digestions, but results were negatives too. I followed the same protocol, but digestions didn't work.
I changed again the PCR conditions to get sir3 and made a gradient PCR, but it didn't work either. To make sure that the template was the correct one, I made analytic cuts of it, with different restriction enzymes. After two tries, results were conclusive. What's wrong? New primers.
Apart from that, obtained Tadh1-tetOn (ADH1 terminator with a variable number of tetR operator sites repetitions). For doing that PCR conditions had to be optimized (annealing temperature, template concentration, extension time, …).

Starter culture failure
Yesterday's attempt at creating a starter culture from the 5th plating of the old transformatants did NOT grow.  We hit an OD600 of 0.004, basically negligible growth.
Created new 11mL LB supplemented with 11uL 1000x Ampicillin (final 1x concentration 50ug/uL) starter cultures with colonies picked from 1/21 platings -- Plates 1,2,4,5.
Incubated plates at 37 degrees shaking at 1415.  Will check OD of starter cultures at 1900.
1L Expression of Tamura construct
Inoculated 950 mL of LB supplemented with 1mL of 100x Carbenicillin (final concentration 100ug/uL) with 10mL starter culture grown overnight.
Shook cells in 37 degrees Celsius until an OD600 of 0.6 is reached.
Induced protein expression using 5mL of 100mM IPTG stock (final concentration 0.5mM).
Gene expression monitoring
Removed 1mL of culture before adding IPTG and at 1-hour intervals after addition of IPTG, until after 5 hours after gene expression induction.
Spun down cells for 15 minutes at 5,300 ref at 4 degrees Celsius, and decanted supernatant.
Weighed wet pellet using analytical balance.
Julian's Work
grew a 10mL starter culture by picking a colony from the plate. Grew in LB with Chlor at 1000X dilution. Grew in shaking incubator at 37C
grew well in ~12 hours
Danny and I also met with Mark Arbing:
Lysis
Using the Dnase and Lysosyme is ok. We need protease inhibitors too*
For our lysis buffer it should be high salt (100-150mM), pH balanced (around 7-8),"

ShanghaiTechChina_B,2016,Team:ShanghaiTechChina B#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," outflow through the right-hand window. The flux through that window is J′, and the rate of change of NO concentration that results is$$\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}=-\frac{J'A\mathrm{d}t}{Al\mathrm{d}t}=-\frac{J'}{l}$$
The net rate of change of NO concentration is therefore$$\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}=\frac{J-J'}{l}$$
Each flux is proportional to the NO concentration gradient at the window. So, by using Fick's first law, we can write$$J-J'=-D\frac{\partial c}{\partial x}+D\frac{\partial c'}{\partial x}=-D\frac{\partial c}{\partial x}+D\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[c+\frac{\partial c}{\partial x}l \right]=Dl\frac{{\partial}^{2}c}{\partial {x}^{2}}$$
The viscosity of water is 0.891 cP (or 8.91 × 10-4kg·m-1·-1), and the effective radius of NO approaches 0.36 nm in this case.
Diffusion Coefficient
With the constant D,which is called the diffusion coefficient, to be obtained, the formula above cannot be solved.
The following picture shows the flux of particles down a concentration gradient. Fick’s first law states that the flux of matter (the number of particles passing through an imaginary window in a given interval divided by the area of the window and the duration of the interval) is proportional to the density gradient at that point. $$J(\mathrm{matter})=-D\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathcal{N}}{\mathrm{d}z}$$
Figure 2. The flux of particles down a concentration gradient. Fick’s first law states that the flux of matter (the number of particles passing through an imaginary window in a given interval divided by the area of the window and the duration of the interval) is proportional to the density gradient at that point. (Reference: P W Atkins. Atkins’ Physical chemistry, 7th Ed., Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002, 757)
If we divide both sides of this equation by Avogadro’s constant, thereby converting numbers into amounts (numbers of moles), then Fick’s law becomes$$J=-D\frac{\mathrm{d}c}{\mathrm{d}x}"

MANUAL
As we were working in our project, we realized how many people think depression is a common situation everybody lives, and they do not realize, this is a disease that must be treated.
Depression and anxiety need to be diagnosed by a Psychologist. This manual only gives basic information like common symptoms, causes, and institutions where people with this disease or ailing can receive some help. Similarly, we seek to share situations that involve depression or anxiety, so that people who suffer from any of these disorders feel accompanied by knowing the experiences of other people and how they managed to overcome it.
This document is not intended to replace a medical professional diagnose and or opinion on the matter.
CONECTA
The purpose of our project was shared on the news portal of our school ""CONECTA"", as well as the disclosure of some events that we organized. This in order to have the participation of our student community and family or other friends.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Notebook#beehave_-_-_TEXT.html," new BeeT module 'BeeTproc' since the changing the patch was a dead end.
Week 3
Started using a local github depository since changes were getting difficult to keep track of. Added comments to all the code I added and put everything into github. Also coupled BeeT in the hive to mite mortality. Added period at which BeeT patch is present.
Week 4
Worked on getting initial results by increasing year round mite mortality, worked on understanding RNetLogo and getting some statistics for results. More background literature research as many aspects of system still unclear
September
Week 1
Had a call with a beekeeper (Johan Calis) and based on that call found articles regarding sugar water transport in the hive. Started working on alternative application method using bee bread.
Week 2
Added in degradation for BeeT in the patch and the hive. Started adding in code to handle bee bread. Unclear how to determine how much ends up at the larvae.
Week 3
Realised that consumption of pollen and sugar water is included in BEEHAVE. Proceed to couple BeeT transport in the hive to consumption patterns of bees and larvae. Fixing more bugs.
Week 4
Finish up final version of BeeT module, include reporters to make sure everything works correctly. General cleanup of code. Get access to server and start figuring out how parallel works.
October
Week 1
Find bugs in my RNetLogo code related to the server. Waste time tracking them down and fixing them. Mess up parallel so that it repeats the same code 20 times instead of breaking it up into 20 pieces. Improving R code so I can save results while parallel is running. Start running code on server.
Week 2
Start writing wiki related material. Get results from the server and start analyses. Realise my server data was not correct, rerun on the server.
Week 3
Run more in depth runs to figure out what is going on exactly. In results, we ran the simulation for figure 20B with the scaling variable for mite mortality of 2, degradation outside the hive of 0.004 and degradation inside the hive of 0.006. For figure 20C, the scaling variable for mite mortality is 6, degradation outside the hive 0.004 and degradation inside the hive 0.006. The same paramater set was used in figure 20D, only now with a starting concentration of 10,000 mites."

Demonstrated two AI-2 Supplier Devices can work under simulated conditions in the lab.
Design of modular QS elements
As illustrated in Panel A, there are mainly 2 steps involved in the processing of AI-2 production in bacteria cells. AI-2 is produced from S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) by Mtn and LuxS and accumulates extracellularly with cell density. In our project, we cloned mtn, luxS into the plasmid pTrcHisB to enable overexpression of proteins associated with these AI-2 production machanisms in E. coli. Two AI-2 Supplier Device, pLuxS and pLuxSMtn were successfully constructed using homologous recombination technology.
Scheme 1. Panel (A) depicts two AI-2 Supplier Device, pLuxS and pLuxSMtn we constructed in our project. Panel (B) depicts the AI-2 Supplier cells that are engineered through the overexpression of distinct components of AI-2 production pathway. ""Native"" indicates native production, while ""Induced"" indicates over-expression. Panel (C) illustrate how AI-2 Supplier devices work in our chassis.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#OurSensor#Linker_-_-_TEXT.html," to be easily engineered and modified, along with the interchangeability of the coiled-coil system. Thus by attaching K coils to TALEs that target alternative sequences, we can use this system as a platform for any variety of DNA sequences. In our system, we utilized two TALE proteins, TALE A and TALE B ( BBa_K1189029 , BBa_K1189030 ). These two parts were both created with the K coil, allowing us to use the same ferritin scaffold ( BBa_K1189018 , BBa_K1189037 ) to anchor our proteins. This proved to be incredibly useful in binding the TALE proteins to nitrocellulose, a process that typically requires chemical modifications and specialized proteins in order to ensure the active site of these proteins are functional. Instead, we could interchange TALE A for TALE B on the ferritin scaffold due to our coiled-coil system. The protein complex can then simply be blotted onto our nitrocellulose strip, ensuring at minimum, the upwards-facing TALEs will be able to bind DNA. Furthermore, we can expand this system towards proteins and other molecules as well by replacing the TALEs with antibodies or other binding proteins. The use of coils on the ferritin scaffold also proves useful to prevent the TALE proteins in our FerriTALE from interrupting the self-assembly of ferritin due to our large size. An experiment which can be viewed on our Prussian blue ferritin page was used to demonstrate the viability of these coils for bringing our FerriTALE together. By examining the catalytic activity of our Prussian blue ferritin we could evaluate whether the direct fusion of TALEs or the use of coils was more effective for our system. The results of this experiment showed that using coils to bind our TALEs is the most effective route.
Another aspect of the ferritin nanoparticle that can be exploited is its composition, being composed of 24 subunits, as well as its potential as a novel reporter. Ferritin is typically composed of two chains, heavy and light. In our system, each one of these subunits can be bound to a reporter, effectively amplifying our catalytic activity by 24 due to the increased number of bound reporter proteins. But this activity can be scaled down through previously reported heavy-light chain fusions (Huh and Kim, 2003). Rather than 24 subunits the nanoparticle would be reduced to 12 subunits, as in our system, and thus the number of reporter proteins would decrease accordingly. We can scale this down even"

This resource was helpful for us to better understand the barriers to effective science communication commonly faced by research institutions and public knowledge brokers. We were additionally informed around the existing work completed by hospitals in Canada, primarily Mt. Sinai in Toronto around effective hospital antimicrobial stewardship. We were additionally referred to larger action plans being developed across Canadian health institutions to support work in antimicrobial stewardship.
We also discussed the large international health-economics studies projecting the estimated international number of deaths attributable to AMR bacteria, and the estimated worldwide cost for healthcare. Such arguments were particularly useful to scope the magnitude of the AMR problem in the broader context of other items on the global health agenda, such as non-communicable diseases (diabetes, cardiovascular diseases), and infectious diseases. We further discussed the functions of the Canadian government in supporting research towards point-of-care diagnostics like our wet lab project, and the leadership of Canadian policymakers on the national and international stages in strategizing against AMR. Such discussions yielded a greater understanding of the breadth of challenges presented on the policy and financing levels in supporting AMR research- and allowed us to contextualize our project in a broader AMR movement.
Dr. Cheryl Main
— Chair, Specialty Committee of Infectious Diseases; Royal College Canada
Dr. Cheryl Main was recommended to us by one of our past interviewees, due to her experiences of running educational programs in Hamilton on bacterial infections and sex education. One of the Human Practices team’s main interests is improving the public awareness and engagement on antimicrobial stewardship. By interviewing Dr. Main, we gained valuable insights on how public campaigns succeed and fail.
During the exchange, Dr. Main provided accounts of her work on educational programs at middle-high school boards, and of the challenges she experienced. She informed us that for change to occur in the minds of the public, educational programs need sustainability and longevity. She also emphasized the importance of carefully choosing words and visual aids to target the appropriate audience. For example, when catering to clinicians and other professional staff, the material can carry some scientific language. However, when addressing the general audience with mix of students, teachers and parents, basic terminology should be used to advance ideas clearly.
Furthermore, Dr. Main has executed informational campaigns for staff at the Hamilton General Hospital. Of the projects, she found installing posters at strategic locations in the wards to be especially helpful. Hearing this, the Human Practices team brainstormed initiatives that we could attempt to inform both the public and frontline staff on antimicrobial"

Bidirectional Promoters
Scientists are frequently confounded by wayward promoters; that is, promoters which do not produce   the expected proteins. Some bidirectional promoters are known to exist, but which way they promote   and the degree of expression has not been quantified. This project will test the directionality of   several BioBrick promoters to answer these questions.

Overview | Design | Results
Palindromic Promoter Circuits
The graph above represents the relative fluorescence measured in a TECANM1000 instrument of several constructs containing various promoter inserts. The reporters indicate the directionality of each promoter sequence measured in the construct. The single biobrick ligated into the construct shows almost complete preference for the forward direction, while three palindromic sequences designed and ligated in the construct demonstrate varying amounts of bidirectionality within the DH10B E.coli cell. Bidirectional promoters are possible within the cell, and those designing promoters should be beware of palindromic sequences in their design and their potential effects on the initiation of protein within the cell.
Further Application
Further characterization of both biobrick promoters and palindromic sequences will yield more information of the prevalence of bidirectionality in promoters. To view the sequences we plan to test in this construct, please visit our parts page.

Nevada,2011,Team:Nevada#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," little success with this small fragment. Many techniques have aimed at transforming trc into pSB1C3 iGEM plasmid for submission to the registry for use by future teams and placing the promoter in front of both genes in various plasmids including pUC vectors, TOPO vectors, as well as iGEM vectors. Different techniques, enzymes, and protocols were used without success. One of the biggest challenges when using trc is that agarose gel electrophoresis is of little use for quick verification. The 100bp (promoter plus iGEM prefix and suffix) shift is nearly impossible to visualize on the gel and sequencing is often needed to confirm results which takes a few days to obtain results.  Despite the frustration that we have had using the trc promoter, we think it would be a valuable part for the registry.
Cyanobacteria
Introduction
Cyanobacteria are gram negative photosynthetic bacteria that have the unique ability to also fix atmospheric nitrogen gas into a biologically useful form. As such they are one of the few truly autotrophic organisms in regards to carbon and nitrogen nutrition. In this project we are engineering the cyanobacterium, Synechocystis PCC 6803, to provide glucose as a carbon source for a biofuel producing E. coli strain. The rationale behind this effort is that if successful we will be able to decrease the cost of growth medium and develop a self-sustaining feeder system that can be adapted to existing microbial fermentation systems that have been optimized for the production of biofuels and other high value compounds. Synechocystis PCC6803 was chosen for this project because it is widely used as a model cyanobacterial system. As such it, it has numerous resources available to the investigator including facile and established transformation protocols and a completely sequenced genome. The work being done on this project will set the foundation for basic research into microbial community interactions and also applied research with real world industrial relevance.
Goals and Specific Tasks for Cyanobacteria
The goal of this project is to engineer the cyanobacterium strain Synechocystis PCC6803 to produce and secrete hexose sugars that can be utilized by a biofuel producing E. coli strain. To achieve this goal the Cyanobacteria team has been assigned following two tasks:
1) Engineer Synechocystis to overproduce the hexose
2) Engineer Synechocystis to secrete hexose sugar to the medium

Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#humanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html,". Too much attention has been focused on IPR (intellectual property rights), and too little on alternatives, e.g. open source systems, publicly financed innovation and prizes. (2010)
In a recent paper, Claude Henry and Joseph Stiglitz (2010) argue that the open source system, which has been widely used in the IT sector, can be an alternate solution to the patent framework to promote innovation.The aim of our approach is not to precisely characterize the way the ""open source approach"" could be adapted to the synthetic biology. It is to urge the iGEM community to embark on a collective reflexion on its contribution to the development of a ""synthetic biology commonns”.
The Commons: an alternative model
The open source software's users have been in ever greater numbers for the last few years. According to a study made by Markess International in France in 2009, on 160 French companies 92% used open source software during that year. The viability of its mere founding principle explains its success : the involved software can be used freely with a license (“open source license”) authorizing it and even allowing its source code to be modified and enhanced by the licensed one. At first glance, such a model would seem to be inefficient as the software should not generate any profit : their license makes them indeed free to use. However, companies have opted for a business model involving services and proprietary software (“proprietary bricks”) that complement the open source product.
Besides, the mere nature of this emerging sector makes it very innovative : a whole community back it up by enhancing the software's source codes. This system also allows companies to make profit on a patent-free position. That is why such a successful example could serve as an inspiration for our reflexion.
From the open source software to the commons approach
The open source system functions thanks to a wide community literally owning the diverse software under license.This community defines the rights and duties attached to the use and development of this software. As a consequence, the open source can be considered as a case of commons, i.e. a resource jointly owned by a group. This vague and ancient term has covered various kinds of resources, namely natural resources (e.g. fisheries, pastures and forests) as well as the immaterial ones such as knowledge.
The commons' management has been belittled for a long time. Indeed, since the biologist Garett Hardin published his famous article entitled “The tragedy of the commons” in Science in 1968, the negative arguments he gave against the commons have tarnished it. Hardin postulates that one"

Discussion
Our analysis aims at giving a better understanding of the system behaviour.                     We achieved that by building the subsystems of the model and combining                     them, in an effort to characterize the model as best as possible. Methods                     such as sensitivity and robustness analysis helped us to analyze and see                     connections between parameters and focus on the more important aspects of                     the system. By using those, we were also able to detect problems that the                     system had.                     Finally, we gave feedback for the system design by providing the better                     option regarding the dcas9 expression site. Also, by making the system                     sgRNA optimized, after the analysis of the repressor that we made, we                     provided helpful insights regarding the relative concentrations of sgRNA                     and dcas9 that made the system work properly.

iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.

With the remaining 231 contributions, the interesting other-answers were identified and labelled for further use. 3. Then, the answers were stored in separate spreadsheets for individual assessment of the questions. 4. The scaling-questions that were most likely to show correlation were combined and tested for interrelations using equations 1 and 2 (as depicted below). The multiple choice questions were correlated by comparing the abundance of each answer individually.
Equation 1.
Equation 1 shows the general formula for calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient (also known as the sample correlation coefficient, r) between two sets of data (denoted as x and y), based on the mean values and standard deviations (s) of both data sets. Equation 2 shows the same formula but now only containing the parameters that are available in the datasets. The letter Σ denotes the sum operator. In general, if there is a series of n  measurements of X  and Y  written as xi and yi (where i = 1, 2, ..., n), then the Pearson correlation coefficient can be used to estimate the correlation of X  and Y.
Equation 2.
Equation 3.
The coefficient of determination is a statistic that will give information about the quality of fit of a model. In regression, the r2 coefficient of determination is a statistical measure of how well the regression line approximates the real data points, and is defined as the ratio of regression variance to total variance (Equation 3).

The popularity of trying to conduct clinical trials related to GM probiotics seem to be very low, considering neither the Swedish Gene Technology Advisory Board or the Swedish National Council of Medical Ethics could give a straight answer about the legislation regarding GM probiotics. Furthermore, a quick search on “Probiotika” , the swedish equivalent of “Probiotics”, on the MPA’s website yields zero results related to GMO. We hope that this will change in the future and that more people here in Sweden and around the world  will become involved in the development of new probiotics.
Alternative Methods
Meeting with Vice President of Business Development & Sales at Verasonics
We met with Mike Vega, Vice President of Business Development & Sales at Verasonics, a company that manufactures ultrasound instruments. Mike Vega also collaborated with Shapiro's lab, the lab that wrote the paper about acoustic reporter genes (Bourdeau et al., 2018). Mike Vega gave us information regarding transducers that later on guided us in our ultrasound experiments with yeast. In addition to that, he pointed out to us that our plan of using gas vesicles for non-invasive imaging might not work and told us that we might want to consider other alternatives.
Meeting with Professor in Oncology
Mef Nilbert is a professor in oncology at Lunds University and at Copenhagen University. She has worked with inheritable cancer tumors and has a deep knowledge of colon cancers and their behaviour. We first came in contact with Mef Nilbert thanks to Olle Bergman, one of the judges at the Nordic iGEM conference in Lund. Olle Bergman is a Swedish journalist that is specialized in different types of communications. He was a great asset for many of the teams participating in the Nordic iGEM conference, providing us with advice on how to communicate through text, for example in a poster, and connected teams with relevant people. Olle Bergman was kind to connect us with Mef Nilbert so that we could discuss our project and its possibilities with her.
The meeting with Mef Nilbert was very helpful. We had a chance to ask an expert all kinds of question related to colon cancer. Gladly, Mef Nilbert was overall positive to our project and our idea. She had a strong belief that there is a need for fast, easy and accurate detection and treatment for colon cancer since this type of cancer is generally diagnosed at a late stage. Mef Milbert had ideas about how we could develop our project. As an example, she suggested that the"

USTC,2018,Team:USTC#Model#Performance Analysis_-_-_TEXT.html,"ridine and identify the start time of observable GFP signal and the duration time of GFP signal and NicA2 high expression. At last, according to simulation results, we propose the end time of degradation reaction as the reference to experiment design.
GFP is the fluorescent signal which means the existence of an amount of nicotine in the medium, so we first analyze the process of GFP signal production and attenuation. Figure 7 shows that the variation of time for reaching 100 a.u. is small among different groups and the average time is shorter than 5 min. However, the time for signal complete attenuation (under detection limit) varies a lot which increases greatly with more nicotine input. About the time for reaching maximal GFP intensity, it is interesting that more nicotine input and stronger promoter 1 may lead to longer period for GFP signal maximization, because more Vppa expression means more 6-Hydroxynicotine produced initially to release hdnoR repression quickly. Then we calculate the time interval, which is set to be the time for GFP intensity above 95% GFP maximum, for measuring GFP max intensity. The time interval changes a lot among various nicotine input and the maximal timespan is about 700 min.

Figure 8 Signal stop time with s1, nicotine
Figure 9 Heat-map of signal max time
Figure 10 Signal max duration with s1, nicotine
The second signal is AHL molecule synthesized by LuxI. The lowest concentration of AHL to activate the transcription of Lux pR is about 0.1 nM, so we calculate the time in which AHL stays in a functional concentration. For nicotine input is lower than 0.1 M, the functional timespan is about 500-1000 min. With higher nicotine input, the state in functional AHL amount can last for over 2500 min.

Figure 12 Product max time vs s1, nicotine
In the last part, to collect the final product 3-Succinoyl-Pyridine in highest concentration, the time for reaching maximal concentration is calculated. From figure 12, we notice that the range of time is from 0-30 h and the change of time is strongly related to nicotine input but the impact of different promoter 1 strength seems not significant. The possible reason is that the time of GFP signal activation does not vary a lot (0-60min) as described above which means the time for signal induction does not account for a large portion in the total time for nicotine degradation.

Ariel Ragetli
Major and Year:
Major in Biochemistry (3rd Year)
Why iGEM:
I heard about iGEM from my second year Biochemistry teaching assistant who told me about past project ideas and the basic design of the program. I was intrigued by the idea of creating machines, little bacteria, that could solve complex problems.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to refine my laboratory technique and get the opportunity to work with people vastly more knowledgeable in the world of research and synthetic biology to expand my own knowledge base as well as get the chance to help create something tangible that could potentially have some impact on the world around us.
Desired Impact on the World:
I have always wanted to solve a complex problem, in the context of human diseases, and to physically see the impact of that solution on the people affected.
Hobbies:
Learning Japanese, I have been to Japan twice in my life and am intrigued by the culture and the language. I plan on spending an extended period of time in Japan at one point in my life, and I am continuously practicing and improving my conversational to that end .

Major And Year:
Microbiology and Immunology with a Minor in Biochemistry Graduated May 2014
Why iGEM:
I first heard of iGEM through a friend back in 2009. At the the time, I thought he was crazy. 'E. Coli cultures lighting up like traffic lights!?'. Two years later, in 2011, I stumbled across the openwetware wiki while doing research for a project, and this led me to the iGEM page. After seeing the kinds of incredible projects that had been attempted over the years, I was hooked, and knew that I had to join the UBC team at the next available opportunity.
Hope to gain from iGEM:
I hope to improve my understanding of engineering principals in biology and build on my modelling knowledge base, these tools will help me work towards a masters degree in chemical and biological engineering.
What Inspires you:
Everything to do with microbes, especially the application of metabolic engineering to microbes, ask my team mates about chicken sexing or electrobacter and they will tell you!
Hobbies:
My interests include growing and showing off stylish goatees, hiking, and discussing new applications for"

Results
3D Structure Prediction
Only the 3D prediction software Modeller provided us with a satisfactory structure, most likely due to its improved de novo prediction capabilities and the usage of constraints on the final model. The other two algorithms struggled to suitably resolve the position of the linkers.
Figure 3: 3D structure of Orthos obtained from Modeller. In green, CBM3a, in red, mSA2, and yellow and blue the N-terminal and C-terminal linkers respectively. This colour code is used throughout this page.
We can see that the linkers seem to tangle together quite significantly. However, our two heads keep their tertiary structure, are an adequate distance apart, and positioned so that their binding sites remain available.
This is a satisfying first step, however this prediction is not sufficient on its own due to the protein's size and complexity. Simulated annealing is a good method to confirm the conformation of the linkers and the final structure of our heads by exploring the energetic landscape of our protein in greater detail.
Simulated Annealing
This phase was conducted on the best conformation obtained from Modeller. After completing the minimisation and successive heating and cooling phases of our platform, we obtained this structure:
Figure 4: 3D structure of Orthos obtained after simulated annealing
We can see that once again, the linkers are considerably tangled, but here again the complex heads keep their structure and general positions.  We know that these peptidic linkers present a great flexibility and we should see more variability in the conformations adopted. This is important to know so as to better understand the binding possibilities of our heads, and most importantly whether the spatial disposition of our platform allows us to functionalize all of these heads simultaneously. To investigate the possible conformations further, we continued our approach with the robotics inspired methods.

On the other hand, we knocked out (KO) a gene required for tyrosine synthesis in E. coli, TyrA. A medium containing photocaged tyrosine (ortho-nitrobenzyl tyrosine) is used to grow the bacteria: this special tyrosine is sensitive to UVs, and will be only available for our KO E. coli once uncaged.

2. Com R/S
ComS is a small peptide imported into the cytoplasm by the cell. Interacting with ComR, it will form a complex acting as a gene activator.
This peptide contains a tyrosine residue. Thanks to a collaboration with Vincent Stroobant from the Institut de Duve, we synthetized a modified ComS involving a photocaged tyrosine. This new peptide shouldn't be able interact with ComR, unless its tyrosine has been uncaged by UVs.
The ComR/ComS complex will simply activate a RFP gene, creating a system responding to UVAs.

Citrobacter freundii Characterisation:
Genome sequencing
One major advantage of E. coli over C. freundii is the fact that there is a lot of sequence information available on the former, while no whole genome sequences exist for the latter. In order to get the ball rolling, the genomes of two C. freundii strains (the type strain, ATCC 8090 and another strain our lab had, called SBS 197) were sequenced in Newcastle by Drs Wendy Smith and Anil Wipat with IonTorrent Sequencing.
To the best of our knowledge, no other iGEM projects have yielded genome sequencing data before, so this is a first both for our team, Europe and iGEM in general.
While a complete assembly of the sequence reads could not be done, these sequences constitute the first step towards unraveling the genome of our proposed chassis organism and even in this form they can provide valuable information.
Since our project was concerned with making synthetic biology safer, we wanted to see whether Citrobacter freundii contains any antibiotic resistance genes in its genome. With the help of the sequencing data (Figure 1), we have found that both strains have got several beta-lactamases encoded within their genomes, which"

Additionally, nebulizers can deliver short-acting or long-acting medication therapies. For the bacteria to survive, the administered medication placed in the nebulizer will need to contain the GMO plus a medium which is required for the viability of the bacteria. The most probable scenario would be that bacteria will be in vial protected and preserved and upon administration, when it will be inserted into the nebulizer and inhaled. It should be noted that it is wise to avoid keep GMO in the nebulizer container while there is no use in order to decrease the risk of release into the environment.
Connect the compressor to an outlet.
Place the medication in the container.
Connect the tube to the compressor and the liquid container.
Attach the mouthpiece or mask.
Put the mouthpiece around the mouth and secure it over nose and mouth, leaving no gaps.
Slowly breath in and out until the medicine is gone. This may take up to 15 minutes.17
The advantage of using a nebulizer instead of a pocket inhaler is its normal breathing medicine intake rate. By this, we mean that for the inhalation of medicine through a pocket inhaler the patient needs to take deeps breaths for the medicine to reach the lungs, however, for patients with a respiratory disease, this may not be a possibility due to the narrowing of the airways during these diseases. Additionally, nebulizers can deliver short-acting or long-acting medication therapies.18
There could be other alternatives for the administration of the genetically modified bacteria, like microaspiration and dispersion of oral bacteria into the lungs. However, diseased lungs have the tendency to create niches for pathogens and neutral distribution does not affect the deposition of bacteria. Also, it would be even more difficult to assess the amount of bacteria practically reaching the lungs. So far, no models have been successful describing this neutral distribution. At last, it would be optimal if the administration minimizes the risk of any release into the environment which does not seem optimal upon oral or nasal application.
Once the bacteria reach the lungs, it would be necessary to control the dynamic process where selective pressure exists while mucociliary clearance and immune system strive to eliminate any foreign particle, for the bacteria to be able to stay long enough to release the enzyme.

Tyr A- E. coli (not transformed), and BL21 E. coli are studied as negative controls. For each cell line, 10 mL of preculture were incubated for 12h at 37°C, in liquid LB medium. Cells are then centrifuged down (10min, 3000g). The pellets are washed 3 times with 5 mL of liquid M9 (protocol available on our website) to remove any tyrosine previously found in the preculture medium. Cells are then concentrated to an OD (optical density) value of 6 with the appropriate volume of M9 medium.
In a 12-wells plate, final volume of 3mL in each well:
D-Tyr is added to the concentration of 0.05 mg/mL
ONB-Tyr is added to the concentration of 0.084 mg/mL
L-arabinose is added to the concentration of 0.1% (w/v)
Liquid M9 is added to the volume of 3 mL.
Add antibiotics as required
Four plates are filled as follows: tyr or ONB-Tyr, in the  presence or not of arabinose are filled for the 3 types of cell (BL21, TyrA-, TyrA- + BBa_K577882). The four plates were placed under a 400WLEO / S 400-94-CR light during 0, 12, 60 and 300 minutes. Besides those plates, an ONB-Tyr toxicity control has been run, with 50/50% of Tyr/ONB-Tyr concentration with TyrA- + BBa_K577882.
After exposure, 50 µL of concentrated 6 OD cell culture is added to the well. Next, plates are placed under agitation at 37°C. Fluorescence (λexcitation = 533 nm, λemission = 588 nm) and OD are measured every 2h between 15h and 21h of incubation. The fluorescence measurements are reported to the OD measure, to normalize the results.
The graph below (Figure 4) shows the evolution of RFP fluorescence with the duration of incubation for the different samples (0, 12, 60 and 300 minutes of exposure to polychromatic light).

Pittsburgh,2018,Team:Pittsburgh#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," and the parameters we found from literature during modeling, we realized the key limiting factor of editing rate was not the single nucleotide mutation catalyzed by Cytidine Deaminase, but was the release efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 system from the DNA. Moreover, we also discovered that the replication of a plasmid would help the release of dCas9, since all binding protein would be released when polymerase replicates the plasmid. Since shortening the time between dilutions will increase the replication rate of plasmids, we wanted to see if doing so could make a distinct improvement on editing rate.
Future Work
We will continue to work on co-transform the three plasmids of Oscillatory gRNA System in to Escherichia coli S1030. Once we succeed, we’ll use the on and off of  blue light to oscillate the two gRNA, and see if we could  keep track of elapsed time and mark the appearance of stimuli. Both Sanger sequencing and the designed restriction enzyme site method will be used to compare the readout. Also, we may compare the ability of base editor by  mutating from dCas9 to nCas9. In addition, since we view our system as a universal diagnostic tool, we may switch different promoters and test its ability to respond to various stimuli, such as pH and light.

TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Human Practice#Symposia_-_-_TEXT.html,", it fits well in this event day of the city of Darmstadt. It's a long way for synthetic biology to be accepted as normal technology in Germany. The iGEM team from Darmstadt played a small part in this issue but the following iGEM teams in Germany will also do so.
1. Junior
9th September 2012 Lab course with students from Highschool
To make not only the iGEM competition, but also the Synthetic Biology well known in the public awareness, the Darmstadt iGEM team decided to host a student internship. At the beginning of September came about 20 students of the Ludwig-George Highschool to the biology campus of the TU Darmstadt. In this laboratory course, students were able to transpose their theoretical knowledge of molecular biology techniques into practice. As molecular detectives their task was to analyze an unknown meat sample on its species. For this purpose, the students were allowed to purify mitochondrial DNA and perform a PCR for amplification of a specific mitochondrial gene. After a restriction digest and separation of the resulting fragments with agarosegel-electrophoresis the students were able to define the species of their samples. During the breaks, the iGEM team used the opportunity to present their project to the students and to discuss the importance of synthetic biology. The students were very receptive to the topic and immediately recognized that such issues playing no role in school and should be discussed more often. It was not only a new experience for the students, but also for the iGEM team to discuss ethic issues of Synthetic Biology and how the society could learn more about the opportunities which are given by that.
We really enjoyed the day with the iGem Team . We learned a lot of new things, but we also repeated what we already knew from school. It helped a lot that we could do the experiments on our own, because in biology it is very difficult to understand experiments if you don´t see them in front of you. If we had questions, we could ask the iGEM team and they explained it very well. They also explained us the idea of the bacterium which is able to recycle plastic and the whole group liked the idea. Altogether it was a very interesting and informative day and it should be possible for every class to take part in something like this.

The group decided to start the project on the 2nd after meeting with a supervisor to arrange lab inductions.
    Monday 2nd July 2012
The group in Leicester met with one of the supervisors to arrange lab inductions, as well as forming a plan for the following week.
    Tuesday 3rd July 2012
(14:00pm) A few members were inducted into the lab in the morning, then quickly followed by the rest. While the others were being inducted, the 1st group started making the Citizen Science Kits that were to be sent to Styropack. The order was for 200 kits.
    Wednesday 4th July 2012
Now the team currently in Leicester had been inducted, lab work could start. The team used this opportunity to begin to moving in some of the donated equipment from Heathrow Scientific, as well as clean the lab ready to start work.
    Thursday 5th July 2012
The group checked all the equipment fully worked, and set up the lab area ready for work to start over the next few days.

The group started researching methods for plating kits as well as looking for other papers that could help with the project.
(11:00 am) The group has determined the protocol after much discussion.
(14:00 pm) With the research done lab work started today. The team started to practice with unsterilised petri dishes, after getting everything needed to plate out the citizen science samples. Luria agar was collected from the store room and used to plate 5 of the citizen science experiments (CSE) in addition to a few controls using sterile polystyrene not placed in soil so to set a base line for which to compare our results with.

Additionally, to enable steady growth for our technologies market, we will be engaging with key industry players in Alberta’s oil sands production and monitoring market.  Finally, we will be actively engaged in raising capital to continue all stages of development from accelerators, corporate partners, grants, and private investment.
Year Three
By year three we see our oil sands monitoring technology expanding from the prototype stage to a fully functional product.  This will involve considerable engineering and product design to meet industry needs and to ensure reliable and robust detection in varying environments and climates. To this end we will begin the transition from prototype development to meeting the challenges of mass-manufacturing of the technology involving the assessment of manufacturing partners, development of our production facilities, and distribution components.  In tandem, we will begin initial development of sensing elements to detect other compounds in markets outside oil sands monitoring.
Within this time period we see our initial product having moved through the necessary regulatory hurdles in both Canadian and American markets.  These regulatory approvals will help act as both a competitive advantage and to hasten the development of second and third generation monitoring solutions.  At the same time we see our first demonstrations of our system in an oil sands monitoring setting which will be closely followed by our first sale to key industry players who we began engaging within year one. Finally, to continue enabling this rapid development we will have accelerated our strategy of raising capital to include engaging with angel investors, customers, and government grants.
Year Five
Moving into years four and five, we will have seen our first sensing system move into a mass-produced product following our first demonstration and sale.  Our goal will be to begin capturing a growing share of the sensing market in the oil sands monitoring market over these two years (moving toward our goal of 30% market share). With the first product entering the market we will pivot to diversifying the sensing ability of our technology.  This will involve accelerating the development of new sensing elements begun in year three.
By diversifying our technologies applicable markets with new sensing elements we aim to begin entering markets outside the oil sands industry. In deriving these new sensing elements we will apply a similar framework of patenting, trade secrets and legal agreements to protect our intellectual property. To meet our growing capital needs and our goals for growth into new markets we will leverage next stage of capital investments from venture capitalists and revenue from our initial sales.

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#News#Oilsands_-_-_TEXT.html," remaining 35% of the bitumen that SAGD technology misses will enable us to gain more output energy for a similar amount of input and thus increase the efficiency of the process.
Reclamation. Syncrude and Suncor both proudly displayed their reclaimed land and seemingly-flourishing ecosystems on earth that was once scorched. As mentioned yesterday, these efforts are admirable. I was particularly impressed by how they recruit people specifically to further their reclamation efforts. Again, however, we don’t know what the long-term effects of the former excavation site will be – say, whether tar ponds leach chemicals into the environment a generation down the road, or whether the reclaimed land better supports the survival of species that should not ordinarily flourish there, or the list goes on. Note that the latter point is not necessarily negative, but it remains unknown.
There would be great value in developing bacteria that can digest harmful residual chemicals of the well site and release waste products that will not devastate the local environment if they leach beyond their containment points in the future. Similarly, bacteria that can serve as an obvious indicator of whether or not certain chemicals are present (before plants start dying off) can warn us that something is amiss, and will allow us to react before serious problems occur in the local environment. Of course, there’s always the issue of how sensible it really is to introduce a strain of bacteria into an ecosystem where it is not naturally found, depending on what chassis is used in the final product…
Desulfonation of the tar. Suncor uses smoke stacks with limestone scrubbers to clean 95% of the sulphur out of the tar slurry and reduce the potential for acid rain down the road. Certain bacteria that are found in caves (and otherwise) can process sulfonated bodies and remove the sulphur that is present.
If we could use bacteria that self-replicate and extract more than 95% of the sulphur – in addition to or lieu of limestone in finite supply – we could lower the environmental impact of this process.
Exploiting the power of the natural environment. Although this term carries many negative connotations, it is not meant in an entirely self-serving sense – rather, if there are bacteria that naturally occur in the depths where oil sands are found, it would be useful to gain an understanding of what they are and what they can do.
This will better support our efforts in engineering an effective biological approach to improving the efficiency and lessening the environmental impact of the oil sands development projects.
We went on a perimeter walk to view the site and see the different processes in action.  We looked"

We then followed our protocol for genome DNA isolation and 16S sequencing, as described above, to confirm successful conjugation of G. oxydans. After troubleshooting our 16s procedure, we were finally able to obtain a viable sequencing result. However, all of the glowing colonies were identified as E. coli.
Figure 1: These are our potential transconjugants on a LB+DAP plates. The dark reader was used when taking this picture. The top two are G. oxydans while the bottom two are G. hansenii. Credit: Zach Martinez.
For the next round of conjugation, we used a strain of both G. oxydans and Gluconacetobacter hansenii from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).  Our procedure was identical to the one described in the previously paragraph.
We then picked isolated colonies and streaked them out onto LB+Spec plates. After using 16s sequencing on the potential transconjugants, we encountered an anomaly. Instead of amplifying the 16s gene, we received the sequence of the L,D Transpeptidase gene of E. coli.
We then decided to perform a Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) experiment in order to determine if G. oxydans is able to survive antibiotics above the standard E. coli concentration. We tested the antibiotics kanamycin, spectinomycin and carbenicillin.
Our results in Figure 2 showed that G. oxydans is resistant to at least 4x concentrations of spectinomycin (1x = 60µg/mL) and carbenicillin (1x = 100µg/mL). However, a 1x concentration of kanamycin (1x = 50µg/mL) was sufficient to inhibit growth. With this information, we then performed conjugations with E. coli donors that had a kanamycin resistance. These results are still pending through the wiki freeze.
Figure 2: These are a Minimum Inhibitory Concentration experiment that included using kanamycin, spectinomycin and carbenicillin with G. oxydans in order to observe if the strain can resist standard concentrations of antibiotics used with E. coli. The top row of cultures are G. oxydans with concentrations of carbenicillin ranging from 4x to none (1x = 100µg/mL). This set of tubes show that G. oxydans is resistant to carbenicillin, at least up to a 4x concentration"

Thus, we aim at creating a capsule that could be uptaken as a dietary complement, in order to help regulate the levels of polyamines taken up in the meals.
Cancer Risk Marker
The second objective of the Polybiome project was to be able to accomplish a fine device that could be able to detect cancer risk at home. This method is thought to be an easy friendly-user device that could be used at home as a simple urine test. Many cancers do not cause any symptons and when they are clinically detected, it is because they have achieved a considerable size and cause more harm. Our idea is to solve this problem by a simple method to detect if you are in risk or not of suffering from cancer.
The concept behind is to create a reactive strip with freeze dried modified bacteria that when in contact with urine, will produce a color that will warn the user of its risk. These modified bacteria, as the ones from the probiotic, will be polyamine auxotrphic, with the same Knock-ins but with the difference that will have a polyamine sensible promoter that will express a specific color depending on the amounts of polyamines.
The problem we found when iniating this project was that in urine there are 11 different types of polyamine-like molecules that would interfere in our analysis. We also saw that until now, the only methodes used to identify Diacetylspermine was by HPLC or Mass spectroscopy, tedious processes that need an expert hand to be performed. This is why we decided to create a way in which we could have accurate results in a much easier manner. For this reason, we will treat urine with our Reaction Mix, this mix will contain four different enzymes (mentioned above) that will degrade all the polyamine-like molecules except Diacetylspermine. This way, when our strip gets in contact with the pre-treated urine, the only molecule the auxotrophic bacteria will sense is the one we have left.
Enzymes from the reaction mix: - Polyamine Oxidase - Putrescine Oxidase - Acetylputrescine Deacetylase - Acetylspermidine Deacetylase (sent by Dr. Nicolas Porter with a pET-21b plasmid)
We first thought on purifying these enzymes, but since it was very expensive, we thought of a way to solve this problem: lyse bacteria via sonication. We would like to thank Dr. Sergi Aranda, who kindly gave us"
