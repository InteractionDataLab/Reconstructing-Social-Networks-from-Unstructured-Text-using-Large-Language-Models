Modelling
Introduction
Mathematical modelling often gives useful insights into the behaviour of complex systems. We model the synthetic gene oscillator circuit made by Stricker et al.(2008), where the protein product of the first gene (AraC) activates the expression of both the genes and the protein product of the second gene (LacI) inhibits expression of both the genes. It is expected that such a model would help test what modifications can be done in the mentioned oscillator, to couple it with other genes to achieve oscillations in their protein products, which are essential in the cell cycle.
The oscillator described by Stricker et al. (2008) comprises of two genes AraC and LacI, placed downstream of a $p_{lac/ara-1} $hybrid promoter, which is activated by the binding of AraC protein in the presence of arabinose and repressed by LacI protein in the absence of IPTG. This forms a dual feedback loop that causes the levels of these proteins to oscillate periodically.
The model
The reactions in the AraC-LacI oscillatory system are as follows-        \[P^{a/r}_{0,j} \ + \ a_2 \xrightleftharpoons{k_1} \ P^{a/r}_{1,j} \]       \[P^{a/r}_{i,0} \ + \ r_4 \xrightleftharpoons{2k_2} \ P^{a/r}_{i,1} \]       \[P^{a/r}_{i,1} \ + \ r_4 \xrightleftharpoons{0.5 k_2} \ P^{a/r}_{i,2} \]       Where $a$ is the Concentration of AraC protein, $r$ is the Concentration of LacI protein. $P^{a/r}_{i,j}$ represent the states of promoters on the (a)ctivator/(r)epressor plasmids with i number of AraC dimers $(a_"

M02W06: The One Without The Birthday Girl: (6th-13th July)
Vector: The eluted vector was treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) to prevent the prospect of self-ligation. The eluted vector was     finally stored in -20oC. The vector was finally ready for ligation!
Insert: Growth was seen on the Ampicillin plates. Straightaway, a primary culture was inoculated after which miniprep was done. The isolation of the     plasmid was confirmed by running the DNA on an agarose gel, where we observed a sharp band at 3kb length.
Also, in the middle of the week (10th July) came Nishita’s birthday! Too bad she wasn’t there with the rest of the team to celebrate. But we had cake,     anyway! Wishing you a happy birthday Nishita!
M02W07: The One With The Mixed Emotions: (14th-20th July)
Towards the business end of the Gb3 mimic cloning session, the team was working with nervous anticipation. The plasmid (pUC57) was digested with SpeI and     PstI to release the 268 bp insert, which was also visualized on an agarose gel. The insert was then eluted from the gel and a ligation reaction was set up     between the CIP-treated vector (pSB1C3 + pLuxR) and insert (Gb3 mimic) taken in 1:3 ratio.
E. coli DH5α cells were transformed with the “ligated” DNA and plated on chloramphenicol-LB agar plates. Mini-prep was done and the isolated plasmid was     digested with SpeI and PstI. After 45 long minutes of nervous excitement, the agarose gel electrophoresis was done and…and…there were two bands – one at     3kb and the other at around 250 bp!
Team IIT Madras had its first clone ready! Amidst the celebrations and sighs of relief, we obviously did not forget to make glycerol stocks of our clones!     We also submitted our clone for sequencing as a final confirmation of success.

York_UK,2013,Team:York UK#Project.html_-_-_TEXT.html," the presence of gold the transcription is induced of our synthetic operon controlled by promoter PgolT/S and production of the peptides begins. Additionally, N-therminal pelB secretion tag was introduced for the secretion to the periplasm. During the transportation process the pelB sequences is removed (14) and potentially our peptides should be released to the extracellular space.  This was shown to be the case for small antifreeze peptides (11) and we expect this to happen with our peptides. Due to small size the peptides might be degraded by various proteases in the cells, therefore we decided to fuse some of the constructs with IM9 tag. It is relatively small (~9.5 kDa), has similar pI to the peptides and was shown to stabilize the expressed proteins (15).  Due to the short length sequences for the peptides were ordered as gBlocks – linear DNA fragments. These codon-optimized genes were cloned into pSB1C3 vector for submission.

For peptide activity testing we cloned each of the peptides under the constitutive promoter (BBa_J23100) and expressed in E. coli DH5 α in LB media overnight at +20 °C (better way would expressing in BL21 strain, however at that time we had no stocks of BL21). Later on the activity was tested upon mixing supernatant (cells removed by spinning at 5k rpm) with gold salt AuCl4 solution and HEPES buffer for A3 and its fusions. For supernatant containing MIDAS-2 the same conditions were applied except the HEPES buffer. The formed nanoparticles were detected by using the method called Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) from NanoSight (12). The technique works by detecting the scattered light of moving nanoparticle and the motion is tracked. This produces data that is enough to determine the distribution of nanoparticle size.
Few words about nanosight: “NanoSight’s “Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis” (NTA) technology detects and visualises nanoparticles in liquids down to 10nm. NanoS"

Results summary
We obtained working structural models for our peptides inside their scaffolds. The following table is a summary of them. Please note that these models are not definitive, since they were obtained by homology modeling and loop refinement. Their main purpose is to give us an idea if the calculated energy profile matches our assumption that the peptide is being exposed to the exterior of the scaffold.

1.      Would the materials used in your project and/or your final product pose:
a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others in the lab?
Magnetospirillum magneticum has no known pathogenic activity and is well regarded by many scientists for its safety.
b. Risks to the safety and health of the general public if released by design or accident?
c. Risks to environmental quality if released by design or accident?
d. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups or states?
The idea of delivering our invasive magnetotactic bacteria into human brain can potentially be dangerous if handled without care. Although AMB-1, the bacteria strain that we are using, has no known pathogenic activity and is well regarded by many scientists for its safety, we cannot ensure the exact effects once the bacteria is transferred into the human brain. Still, we have established an in vitro symbiosis between our modified AMB-1 and glial cells, for reducing immune responses.
Besides, all of the experiments including cloning techniques, PCR, bacteria transformation and mammalian cell assay have been practiced under general instruction. With regard to the materials, we take careful precaution to prevent spread that our work does not pose particular researcher, public, or environmental safety concerns.
2.  If your response to any of the questions above is yes:
a. Explain how you addressed these issues in project design and while conducting laboratory work.
b. Describe and document safety, security, health and/or environmental issues as you submit your parts to the Registry.
The new BioBrick parts we made this year is mainly about using the electromagnetic oscillation control to excite wobble-complementation of helix of mms13 and CHAMP design; then to acheive our goal-twinkling magnetobac. The parts we construct in group A will less probably cause the safety issues.

Modelling with the team of Edinburgh
Optimization of the number of cells
Together with the team of Edinburgh, we implemented and ran a model created by Tobias Bollenbach (2009), Source: Bollenbach, T. et al. Non-optimal microbial response to antibiotics underlies suppressive drug interactions; Cell. 2009 November 13; 139(4): P. 707–718. (Link) using measurements done by the team of Edinburgh on their system. We’re using a whole cell model, aiming to predict an entire cell's behavior and growth. The model has to restrict itself at some point, so in our model, we include the most essential features of the metabolism of the cell; resource availability, growth rate, and intracellular protein levels. Most important is growth rate, as this allows us to test different environments and see their influence on the rate. As mentioned earlier, we simulated the system created by Edinburgh using their measurements. The resulting simulation can be found on Edinburgh’s wiki page as can the results. Though we haven’t implemented our own measurements, Edinburg's data proves the concept and demonstrates the possibility of enhancing rubber production through the whole cell model.
Figure 3 - The four main differential equations in Tobias Bollenbach's model.
So far, it has only been possible to solve the equations by solving the dynamics, even though we’re interested in the steady state. Equating the differential equations to zero (steady state) should provide a solution to the system. However, dynamics proved to be the only option that worked.
We solved the dynamics first by using a preprogrammed function"

Trouble-shooting 2.
– Different culture media replacing LB
Based on the fact that excess glucose entering bacterial cell at a time stresses the survival of E. coli, we were working in other strategies or with substitutes as energy source.
First, we tried to use agar plates made of M9 minimal salt media with a series of reducing concentration of glucose (i.e, 20mM, 10mM, 5mM, 2.5mM, 1.25mM, 0mM). The results showed that the colonies formed are either carrying CP29 promoter only or containing RBS and transporter genes without any promoters.
Secondly, we learned that MacConkey  broth replace glucose with lactose for fermentation studies. We transformed E. coli with recombinant DNAs and grew them on MacConkey agar plate. We screened dozens of colonies by PCR and luckily found one containing CP29-RBS-aeBlue-RBS-crr-RBS-ptsG/pSB1C3. The plasmids were extracted and checked with restriction enzyme, as well as further confirmed by sequencing.
Finally, we thought another carbon sources in addition to glucose and lactose. This time, M9 media with glycerol were used.  Luckily again, one colony carrying CP29-RBS-aeBlue-RBS-STM1128 was picked up by us. And we’ve check it with PCR, restriction enzyme and sequencing.

Visit to Sherman Elementary
In an effort to get younger generations interested in science, we visited the third grade classes of Sherman Elementary School. Sherman Elementary is a Tacoma public school that practices project based learning. We designed an activity to teach students about DNA and how base pairing works. We started by talking about the DNA in their bodies, as their current unit was on the human body. By making a connection to something they had learned about in class, the students were able to better understand how we used DNA to make an arsenic test. The sessions were closed with a discussion about arsenic, and the potential dangers of having arsenic in their soil. The students were all very excited to hear about our lab work, especially when we talked about growing bacteria!
Sue’s Tech Kitchen (Also Human Practices)
Sue’s Tech Kitchen, the creation of Randi Zuckerberg, is a nationwide event dedicated to getting people excited about science through food. It’s known for its’ 3D printed smores and miracle berries, but it also serves as an opportunity for local groups to share their projects and visions with the community. We held a booth at the event in Tacoma, and had a blast telling our community all about our project. We created a mockup of our project with pH strips to represent the sensor, and solutions of a known acidity to represent water samples from around Puget Sound. Kids loved the idea of putting what looked like paper, into what looked like water, and seeing the paper change colors before their eyes. Adults were more excited about the idea of getting to test their own water and get accurate results that were easy to read. On a whiteboard, we set up a magnetic puzzle of our plasmid parts. Guests got to put together the puzzle as fast as they could, and the best time of each day won a cool water bottle. We met some incredible people, including a woman who helped create the map of arsenic contamination caused by the smelter. We had many people ask to buy test strips, but since the sensor isn’t complete, they settled for signing up for the email list. The event gave us great insight on what matters to"
Bilkent-UNAMBG,2018,Team:Bilkent-UNAMBG#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"After we have consulted the society about the problem, we have focused our interest in experts and authorities in order to obtain expert opinions about the issue. Firstly we have consulted provincial directorate of health of Antalya. Here is our interview with him:
 
 
In summary, he has talked to us about governmental campaigns and policies for rational drug use. He has also talked about the situation in Turkey and how unconscious antibiotic consumption can result in insufficient curation of diseases and bacterial resistance development and also how this would affect the economy and society.
Later on, we have talked with a family health center physician who does outpatient clinic in a rural area of the city and she encounters unconscious patients everyday as she explains in this interview:
 
 
She talks about how the patients come to her and ask for antibiotics without prescription or they don’t finish their prescribed antibiotics so they come to the clinic over and over again by uncured illnesses. She also talks about inefficient campaigns. Lastly she explains how and from where antibiotics can get mixed in water resources.
After that we have consulted a medical pharmacology professor to learn about the molecular and pharmacological effects of unconscious antibiotic usage on the person. Here is the interview:
He explains to us how unconscious antibiotic usage can affect the person, economy and pharmaceutical companies; and also how it promotes bacteria to develop resistance and its consequences. On the other hand, he talks about how antibiotics can get mixed with water and he proposes ways to fix this issue.
After we have learned about the situation in Turkey about unconscious antibiotic usage and inadequate filtration of wastewater, we wanted to start our project design with the information in the hand and we wanted to focus our project on a specific antibiotic to start with. Therefore, we have done literature search to find out which antibiotic is mostly used, which one creates more harm and which one is hard to eliminate from the wastewater through regular filtration methods; in Turkey. It is found that penicillin is the one with these issues.
Penicillin is one of the most used and one of the oldest β-lactam antibiotic to be used to cure illnesses (makale linki)(Topal, 2013; Yaşar, 2013). Therefore, especially in societies with improper antibiotic usage, it has become very hard to cure infections with penicillin since many bacteria has already developed resistance against it. It is also stated that penicillin is inefficiently filtered from wastewater and low amounts of penicillin in the water prompt bacteria to develop resistance. Therefore, this creates a platform for the development of superbugs (bilim akademisi linki) which in turn holds a real threat to our"
USTC,2016,Team:USTC#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," science, gene engineering, bio-safety  and in particular, synthetic biology.
Before holding the presentation, we had done a lot of research and basically determined the theme of our project. So, besides introducing the work of Team USTC in previous years, we also introduced our result of investigation and the rough direction of our project. So the public could know what we were doing.
Experiments for Kids
Bacteria and DNA are what we commonly work with in synthetic biology. And we also frequently talk about them in our daily life. However, the public usually don't have accesses to know them closer,so we managed to make them accessible.
Attempting to attract more citizens, especially children, to know more about biology, we designed a simple experiment to extract DNA from fruits with kitchen materials.
Experiment procedures:             1. Grind the fruit(strawberry, watermelon, peach or kiwifruit) with NaCl into paste.             2. Add 5ml domestic detergent and keep stirring for 1min.             3. Filter it.             4. Add 10 ml EtOH into filtrate.           5. Nodular DNA shows.
We do hope our human practice can attract kids to think further, lead them into a new field of scientific research, or even make they become new scientists one day. It turned to be a great success. The experiment taught kids basic konwledge on synthetic biology and molecule biology. In the experiment, children have to choose the finest fruit to extract DNA. So it also stimulates their interests on the process of research.
""With this experiment we--both me and my kid--have learned a lot about biology. I have never expected that I can SEE DNA with my own eyes."" said a parent,""It's quite amzing. I'll do it again with my kid in our own kitchen!""
Plastic for Plants
The ecological stability of human settlements is part of the relationship between humans and their natural, social and built environments.Fundamental human needs such as the availability and quality of air, water, food and shelter are also linked to sustainable development. However, the pollution from plastic has become a main block of sustainable development nowadays. So we held an event called 'Plastic for Plants', aiming to recycle massive plastic from college students. And we sent out plants in return.
Environmental sustainability concerns the natural environment and how it endures and remains diverse and productive. Since natural resources are derived from the environment, the state of air, water, and the climate are of particular concern. To protect our planet, the waste of plastic, or"
BroadRun-NorthernVA,2015,Team:BroadRun-NorthernVA#Education and Public Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," already knew of the existence of our iGEM team from our school website, but became very excited when we explained to her what we had done over the summer with the Armstrong industrial waste water problem. Having more concrete information to share about our experience after having completed our iGEM project, we felt better positioned to reach out to our peers and Mrs. Rosperich, who was eager for us to share our work during her classes.
September 14 Presentation, Research Biology Class of Mrs. Rosperich, 33 Students
We had a powerpoint presentation ready to share with the students. We introduced synthetic biology, iGEM, and then got into talking about the problem we were tackling through synthetic biology. We worked hard to keep it simple, but still explain the process of engineering our yeast cells, before we shared our actual results. We set aside about 15 min for questions. Being a freshman class, we found that there were a number of students wanting to know more about our project and iGEM. They also were interested in the Jamboree and learning that there were going to be many college students. We feel we made a step forward in getting our students acquainted and perhaps more than a slight interest in getting involved with science.
September 14 Presentation, AP Environmental Science Class of Mrs. Rosperich, 32 Students
We followed the same presentation and questioning period as for the previous class. We received good feedback and answered many questions.
2. PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
A. ARMSTRONG Outreach
As mentioned elsewhere in this wiki, we reached out to several businesses, but with our sponsor Armstrong, we got the opportunity to begin a dialogue that has taken Armstrong into considering synthetic biology as a possible option to address their waste water problem. We believe, this is partnership that has grown over the course of this iGEM project, has educated us both on using science as a vital platform to explore alternative solutions, and is one of our team’s most valuable public engagement and outreach successes.
B. TELOS Outreach, August
Adriel Sumathipala, our business partnership team lead, made contact with  Telos’ VP, Lisa Kimball, and got an opportunity to talk to them about our iGEM team. He presented to Lisa Kimball, CEO John Wood, and 9 other Telos employees in the month of August. He gave a brief overview of what iGEM was accomplishing through advancing synthetic biology, about our project solving a real world problem of Armstrong's, how we travel more than an hour to do our research in Baltimore at BUGSS, and of course how"

Lane 3: pCRISPRyl digested with PstI and AvrII. Lane 5-8: pIW357 digested with PstI and AvrII (4 unique transformants/plasmids). As pIW357 was digested solely by PstI and not by AvrII, it was concluded that the Gibson assembly had been successful and the protospacer had been correctly inserted.
×
DESCRIPTION
Next, we tested pIW357 in the Y. lipolytica PO1fΔKu70 strain. In order to account for Cas9 activity of pIW357, we also transformed the pCRISPRyl as a positive control. The results of these transformations are depicted in Figure 13. With an intact NHEJ repair pathway and/or a template for HR, the induced DSB should easily be repaired. However, as this is the PO1fΔKu70 strain and as there is no HR donor template available, the induced DSB should be lethal. Based on the difference in transformant counts between the pIW357 and pCRISPRyl transformations, pIW357 is functioning properly. The observed residual growth in the pIW357 transformation can be attributed to either mutations in pIW357 (for example in Cas9 or in the the sgRNA/tRNA promoter) or to possible repair by the Microhomology-Mediated End-Joining (MMEJ) pathway 14 .

DESCRIPTION
With a functioning pIW357, we then co-transformed pIW357 and pIW501 (linearized) into the Y. lipolytica PO1fΔKu70 strain (Figure 14). The observation of growth on SC-ura media indicates that the URA3 gene had been successfully integrated. Growth was also observed when solely the linearized pIW501 was transformed into Y. lipolytica PO1fΔKu70. In addition, transformants from the co-transformation of pIW357 and pIW501 were screened for URA3 integration"

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  For today, colony PCR primers will be designed in order to use them to verify that the correct plasmid and gene is inside our clones.  The protocol will be laid out to do the procedure when reagents our moved to the Boelter lab.  Preparation will also be made for protein expression this week.
Colony PCR primers:
The file “pET-22b with PCquad Optimized” was created by using a RE digestion and ligation reaction on Benchling.  Primers were designed to overlap part of the PCquad gene and the vector.  The primers designed were the following.  Note PCquad gene was inserted reading right to left.
Forward:  5’-GAAGGTGTCATAATCGTATCCAGTCG-3’
Reverse:  5’- GGTGATGTCGGCGATATAGGC-3’
Notes:  For reverse primer, a self-dimer with delta G = -5.19 kcal/mol formed, while the max delta G = -41.97 kcal/mol.  A heterodimer forms with -6.66 kcal/mol while the max delta G is -45.9 kcal/mol.  All other parameters are ok.
The colony PCR primer forward seems to anneal to the “PCquad original” everywhere except 3 base pairs. The order was placed from IDT.
Conclusions:  Most of today was used in preparation for protein expression of the cage.  It may be nice to give a presentation on the techniques involved for characterizing the protein cage, as well as to become acquainted with the theory.  If possible, tomorrow will be used to do colony PCR to verify that the Yeates strain contains the proper plasmid and gene."

Unlike water has a strong nature balance itself, heavy-metal’s nature circulation is much slower. We need to use man power to turn every waste kind into resource. In this concept, seawater desalination combing heavy-metal recycling will be the key to build the heavy metal’s balance.
The origin of heavy metal comes from the river, therefore, it is hard to control from the origin. Most of the study dealing with heavy metal in seawater focus on recovery and has to work in an open condition. The efficiency of absorption largely depends on the mobility of seawater. IT also brings some safety concern by introducing new species to original ecosystem.
For example, the main recovery method focuses on mangrove in China. Mangrove is salt-torrent and absorb heavy-metal naturally. However, because it is plant, the study and application of mangrove will be relatively slow.
Seawater desalination is one of the few seawater alternating technology that pumps in the seawater. It also has complicated process, and part of it could be replaced by Nanjing’s project. Thus, we should look at two projects’ combination as environmental restoration and seawater alternation using the same artificial water flow.Back to circular economy, this will increase the force that heavy-metal waste change into resource with a low cost adding.

Synthetic biology, which iGEM largely bases on, is defined as designing and constructing biological devices, biological systems, and biological machines for useful purposes. Since that is the case, the transgenic technology is its basic methods inevitably. The key of transgenic technology is the transgene. A transgene is a gene or genetic material that has been transferred naturally, or by any of a number of genetic engineering techniques from one organism to another. The introduction of a transgene has the potential to change the phenotype of an organism.
The transgenic technology has been used on microbes, Drosophila, mice, and other model organisms for research purposes. And it also shows great potential in benefiting the remedy of genetic diseases, cultivation of agricultural products with high quality or yield, and so on.
Nevertheless, the technology also arouses widespread public criticisms in its legitimacy and morality. Most of these criticisms are direct to the genetically modified organism (GMO), which refers to any organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. The GMOs are now widely used in scientific research and are also applied in agriculture as the source of genetically modified food.
Critics for GMOs, especially for the genetically modified food, claim that the risks of the food have not"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Tec-Monterrey,2012,Team:Tec-Monterrey EKAM#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"thesize each specific iteration separately, thus cutting a great amount of costs from the project.
Obviously, this can and has been achieved by working with digestion and ligation reactions, but multiple reactions convey an additional expense on reactants, mostly enzymes. Because a desired sequence exchange could be done by a single digestion and ligation, the modular strategy also promises a reduction on costs in this area. Even further, oligonucleotide synthesis has a limited sequence length that can be reached without errors, so larger constructs require the use of subcloning, which further expands the project’s cost. This is when the In-Fusion tool comes in handy, as it makes it possible, through flanking site recombination, to construct precise DNA molecules by joining several fragments. This allows for the synthesis of separate sequences to be ordered and then these fragments to be used in a single reaction that will end up with the final desired construct, with the modular design strategy implemented.
Having the option to easily manipulate different sections of the genetic construct makes it possible to debug a genetically engineered system by switching the involved components and using trial and error, so malfunctioning parts can be edited. This property also makes it easier to characterize certain parts by enabling the use of different expression assemblies. A module can be constituted by a switchable promoter or reporter gene, for example, offering the opportunity to reuse systems that have been proved useful to study new single parts.
Software Tool
As a tool for the implementation of this construct design strategy, a software application was developed to aid in the appropriate consideration and placing of restriction sites in the master molecule, enabling a simultaneous consideration of the multiple factors affecting the efficiency of the final design. Enzyme compatibility, including digestion reaction conditions and cohesive end affinity, as well as their availability and other characteristics, are taken into account as the user points out the limits they wish to define for each module, so a future manipulation of the fragment can be carried out with as little enzyme as possible.
Implementation on a Platform for Terpenoid Production
The modular design strategy obviously poses a greater advantage to systems aimed at manufacturing related products, such as families of biomolecules, related to each other by common metabolic pathways of production. One such family of biomolecules is terpenoids, also known as isoprenoids, which are a kind of hydrocarbon made up of five-carbon isoprene units, arranged and modified in such a way that all of them share common physical and chemical characteristics and yet also exhibit a wide range of biological properties.

Figure 9: Mercury specific cell extract made from E. coli cells, which have already expressed the activator before cell extract production. Induction of mercury inducible promoter without T7 in front of the operator site with different mercury concentrations. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates.
In vitro this sensor showed good results. The fluorescence level was high at low concentrations. Additionally, it showed that the expression level at 6 µg/L (Guideline of WHO for Mercury) reached the maximal signal. This result indicated the potential for measurement of concentrations under 6 µg/L.To confirm this hypothesis, it takes more experiments and tests with lower concentrations. Due to the high expression of sfGFP at low concentrations and the same expression level at different concentrations, it is not possible to quantify mercury with CFPS analyses . , Our model predicted this observation. During the measurement we noticed that the heavy metals have negative influences on the cell extract. Because of this fact, we used a correction factor, which resulted from the heavy metals influence on the CFPS system. This already optimized sensor showed the high potential of optimized sensors in CFPS.
To summarize
We demonstrated, that our mercury sensor works well in vivo (figure 4). There is a clearly noticeable increase in fluorescence after induction with mercury. Even the threshold concentration, which is given in the WHO guideline, can be measured. This well working sensor was tested in in vitro as well. The presented data suggested, that maximal output is reached at concentrations of 6 µg/ L,which represent the value of the former mentioned WHO guideline. Further optimization could lead to a decreasing in vitro detection threshold.
Nickel
Naturally nickel occurrences are quite low and rare. In Germany most drinking water pollutions by nickel take place in the last meters of the plumbing system. The reason for these pollutions are wrong tap ware. There may be higher concentrations in drinking-water in special cases of release from natural or industrial nickel deposits. Higher nickel concentrations in water can lead to dermatitis as itching of fingers and other parts of the body through long term skin contact. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a limit of 70 µg/L in drinking water.
in vivo
We aimed to construct a sensor for nickel detection. It consists of rcnR the repressor and the nickel specific promoter prcnA. The promoter is regulated by the RcnR, which binds Ni2+-ions. As the former sensors this one encloses a sfGFP for detection via fluorescence.
Our nickel biosensor consists of parts"

Protocol
1. The λ/red technique for the construction of BcsA-knockout FY-07
The λ/red system is derived from the λ red bacteriophage and it is a method that can be used for cloning or genome engineering, which is based on homologous recombination. It allows for direct modification of genome DNA: insertion and deletion of selectable and non-selectable sequences, point mutations or other small base pair changes, and the addition of protein tags.
The λ red system has three components: Exo, Beta and Gam. Gam: Gam prevents both the endogenous RecBCD and SbcCD nucleases from digesting linear DNA introduced into the bacterium. Exo: Exo is a 5’→3’ dsDNA-dependent exonuclease. Exo will degrade linear dsDNA starting from the 5’ end and generate 2 possible products: a partially dsDNA duplex with single-stranded 3’ overhangs or a ssDNA whose entire complementary strand was degraded, if the dsDNA was short enough. Beta: Beta protects the ssDNA created by Exo and promotes its annealing to a complementary ssDNA target in the cell.
Experimental Procedure:

●Amplify the upstream and downstream homologous arms of the targerted gene. ●Overlap the upstream and downstream homologous arms of the targeted gene and insert them into the vector pTsk1. ●Transform the recombinant plasmid into specific bacterium and select the positive clones. ●Culture the selected clones to get the double-crossover bacterium and expel the recombinant plasmid at 37℃.
2. Gibson Assembly Cloning for Plasmid Construction:
Regardless of fragment length or end compatibility, multiple overlapping DNA fragments can be joined in a single isothermal reaction through Gibson. With the activities of three different enzymes, the product of a Gibson Assembly is a fully ligated double-stranded DNA molecule,which has proven to be an efficient and effective method for the assembly of plasmids, and molecular biologists now use this method extensively.

Environmental and General Public Safety
Improper disposal of biological waste might result in leak of biological materials to the environment,      which might cause contamination, and improper disposal might also cause infection to those who process the wastes.       However, there is little biological risk associated with our project in the first place, as described above because       we are using innocuous bacteria strains that are unlikely to propagate in the environment. Despite being so, we       autoclave all solid biological wastes before they are discarded as landfill garbage.      We also treat liquid waste with 10% bleach to ensure that no biological waste could escape to the environment.       Commonly used chemicals are mostly buffers and therefore pose little threat and risk to the environment.      For chemicals that are hazardous, they could cause damage to other people if leaked out. We avoid these risks by       collecting these chemical wastes and sending them to a centralized chemical waste disposal       center within our university, where they will be processed by professionals in chemical waste treatment.      The only living biological material that could escaped from the lab would be our E. coli host for DNA cloning and"

Women play a central role in the provision, management and safeguarding of water resources.
Water has an economic value and should therefore be seen as an economic good.
Concepts emerging from a SWM approach include:
Management of Water and Wastewater at Source
Water purification can be implemented at community scale and industrial wastewater treatment can occur on site. Focus should be on treatment as close to the site of origin or use as possible, rather than transferring water and wastewater long distances, making the methods more sustainable and environmentally friendly (Abra & Simms no date).
Low Impact Wastewater Treatment
Recycling wastewater is essential for sustainable management of water supplies. Effort should be made however to reduce the input of chemicals and fossil-fuel energy into these processes (Abra & Simms no date).
Decentralising the Water Supply
Centralised water and wastewater treatment have been of critical importance for water resource management in the development of societies since the 1800s. Although centralised systems have served us cheaply and reliably so far, recent socioeconomic developments - population growth, increasing use of water for agricultural irrigation, increasing need for sustainable water management - call for new approaches (Gikas & Tchobanoglous 2009). Decentralised water and wastewater management can play an important role in the future of water resource management. Factors driving this change include:
Capacity Limitations
The continuous growth of urban areas has exerted increasing pressure on their water management systems. Whilst treatment"
NKU_China,2017,Team:NKU China#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," hard to select the biobricks that reliably implements a desired cellular function with quantitative values. To overcome this problem, the RBSs were designed to control the expression of downstream genes when necessary.[1]This year we are about to test RBS B0034 and another modified RBS called bicistronic device (BCD2)-J364100 with the same GFP gene:GFP E0040.
Visible Results
We hope that our experimental results are direct and easy to understand,so we just let E.coli themselves tell the story by making them grow into the shape of our team name.In this picture,N is written with negative control,K&U with positive control.The last six letters were written with E.coli containing devices 1-6.It’s quite interesting that we can see device 2 is the brightest,even brighter than positive control.Among device 4-6,4 is the brightest,which corresponds with our experimental data beleow well.

How we designed our gene constructs and assemble them in one vector
The gene constructs were assembled in pHT254 shuttle vector using Gibson Assembly. pHT254 shuttle vector harbours the origin of replication for E. coli and ampicillin as selection marker in E. coli, while chloramphenicol is used as selection marker in B. subtilis. pHT254 harbours an IPTG inducible promoter Pgrac100 which is used.
Figure 2:. Illustrates the cloning strategy of B. subtilis. (A) Schematic overview of the planned cloning. (B) Schematic overview of the Gibson Assembly. The colour region correspond to the homologous sites that were introduced with PCR on each gene.
PhaA and PhaB were ordered with fluorescence tags due to their small size, while PCT and LPE genes were bought separately along with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) genes. PCT and YFP was then fused together in the laboratory to obtain the PCT-YFP construct. The same was tried for LPE and GFP, we were unfortunately unable in obtaining the LPE-GFP construct. In addition, the distinct restriction sites between and homologous sites were introduced by PCR between the genes and the fluorescence tag to remove the tag in the future if it is needed.

Instead, the gel-purified LPE and GFP which already contained the homologous sites was used as individual constructs along with gel-purified PCT-YFP, PhaA-CFP, PhaB-RFP-Term and the cut pHT254 vector from restriction digestion mix for the Gibson assembly as shown in Figure 2B. E. coli was transformed and the formed and the positive colonies with the vector harbouring all five constructs using colony-PCR.

Washington,2009,Team:Washington#Project#Display_-_-_TEXT.html," we visualized under the microscope. The results of this experiment are described below.
Data
BBa_J36848 This image shows both the induced and uninduced cells for part 48 in varying levels of  fluorophore (0nM to 100nM). The cells were induced at 1mM IPTG. This data shows that there is no appreciable difference between the induced and uninduced cells at any given level of fluorophore. All curves appear to have the same amount of fluorescence. We found similar results using a microscopy assay.
+ Control We used the streptavidin coated beads11 to show us what the magnitude of fluorescence increase we should see with increased fluorophore levels. We were able to see that as the level of fluorophore was increased we could see increased retention between the beads and the fluorophore. The black is beads with no fluorophore, the red is with 10 nM, and the purple is 100 nM. These showed a clear difference between the beads without fluorophore, and the beads with fluorophore. The cells shown at right, matched the readings of the beads when they had no fluorophore added.
In the flow cytometer, our positive control, streptavidin-coated beads, showed a clear distinction between beads pre-incubated with biotinylated fluorophore and the beads without fluorophore, indicating that this assay is capable of visualizing streptavidin binding to the biotinylated fluorophore.  Like in the microscopy assay, we did not observe  appreciable binding occurring with any of the ompA-streptavidin parts to biotin at the population level. This data only shows part number 48. However this data is applicable to all of the parts we observed. All streptavidin-expressing cells demonstrated low levels of fluorescence comparable to those of beads not pre-incubated with fluorophore.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we demonstrated expression of the Harvard 2006 streptavidin surface display parts via Western Blot. We were unable, however, to visualize binding between a biotinylated fluorophore and the cells expressing these proteins. This indicates that the streptavidin display system is likely not binding biotin correctly. We hypothesize that streptavidin might not having enough room on the cell surface to form tetramers (which is its native state), and thus may not be binding to biotin with high efficiency. In order to generate a construct that demonstrates tight binding to to bi"

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Project#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," sample. To go a step further, our algorithm has the capacity of expanding the database as it detects new gene doping sequences, thereby simultaneously evolving with gene doping.
Impact
We proved our designed fusion protein could direct DNA integration to a specific sequence by the use of a sgRNA. We also demonstrate that this novel protein could be used to perform targeted next generation sequencing with ONT MinION device. Therefore, we believe that by establishing and integrating our novel detection method into valid testing systems, we could discourage athletes from using high-risk gene doping technologies. Not only has the Dutch Doping Authority, the Delft Sports Engineering Institute and Dutch Trotting and Flat Racing Association (NDR) shown interest in our technology, but so have various other non gene doping related stakeholders. Sanquin, the Dutch blood bank, and the Dutch Research Department for Food Safety (RIKILT) at Wageningen University also emphasized the potential and value of our targeted sequencing technology. These stakeholders’ interests highlight the possible applications of our targeted sequencing method in other fields, such as cancer detection, non-invasive prenatal screening, food safety regulations, and even strain identification.

To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi. We simplify this"

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," experimentally on the growth-coupled production of acetate. A manuscript describing the algorithm and its experimental validation was submitted at the end of the Summer and is currently under review [7]. In our project, we have in parallel applied FRUITS to Synechocystis focusing on a different target product - fumarate.
Table 5.1 Metabolites that can be produced in a growth coupled way based on in silico simulations during constant light.
An important pattern in the output of FRUITS (table N) is the inverse proportionality between the predicted maximal growth rates and the Y p/x normalized over the number of carbon atoms per molecule (C-mol). To put it bluntly, the more carbon is deviated towards product formation, the slower the culture is predicted to grow. The same pattern was observed experimentally for lactate production in Synechocystis [9], when the flux towards lactate was allosterically increased without changing the expression level of the responsible enzyme (L-lactate dehydrogenase). This suggests that the fitness trade off at the core of the phenotypic instability that haunts biotechnology according to transport as experts and literature [10, 11], is hardwired already in the structure of the metabolic network.
All the target compounds identified by FRUITS have never been tested experimentally to be indeed possible to couple to growth. To the best of our knowledge, the only exception is acetate, which as mentioned above, transport as our supervisors have used to validate the method [7]. We convinced them to let us try to test this for fumarate within this iGEM project mainly because out of all these compounds, fumarate is the one that currently is mostly derived from oil. Luckily, they agreed!
Model guided photoautotrophic growth-coupled production of fumarate.
We started by performing Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) of the Synechocystis model iJN678, constrained to    simulate photoautotrophic growth, and using maximization of the flux through the biomass equation as the    objective function. Examination of the optimal flux distributions rapidly gives a sense of how fumarate is    being produced and consumed at the same rate (hence, no accumulation!) The picture that emerges is very    different from what one is accustomed when looking for instance at respiring E. coli or other    chemoheterotrophs (i.e. fumarate is produced and consumed within the TCA cycle). In stark contrast, the flux    towards fumarate in photoautotroph"

As stated above, our blue light sensor is based on a modified version of Lausanne 2009 's LovTAP part ( BBa_K191009 ) developed by our collaborators at Mexico UNAM-Genomics : BBa_K360121 . We have coupled this with a simple reporter system (RFP) in order to perform characterisation tests.
BBa_K322999 : LovTAP with RFP reporter system, based on Mexico UNAM-Genomics BBa_K360121
Characterisation
The protocol that we developed for LovTAP characterization is as follows:
Liquid cultures (same as for minipreps) were grown overnight in 37C with antibiotics. The next day, bottles with 3.5 ml of broth were inoculated with the 0.5 ml of appropriate cultures (0.5. ml of broth added as a control).
samples designated DARK were wrapped in the aluminium foil straight after the inoculation; the cap was not wrapped (not see through anyway)so that samples could be easily taken without unwrapping the bottles from the foil.
All the samples were then taken to the shaker in the hot room and placed in prepared spots: for the dark- anywhere on an easily accessible holder, for light- in 2 rows of holders..
Light samples were covered with the cardboard box with blue LEDs attached on the sides(470 nm wavelength; 2200 mcd/B; V=4.5 V; RS466-3548), in a way to optimize light accession to the samples. Box was securely taped to the shaker.
Measurements were taken every half an hour: 200ul of the samples were placed in the numbered cuvette and then 800ul of water was added. Readings of fluorescence (green mode) were taken in standard fluorescence units (SFU, two readings each). Then optical density was measured (in the incubator room) at 360 nm wavelength. Control was used to calibrate the machine (set ref button). Also 2 readings were taken. Samples were shaken by inversion prior to taking measurement.
Experiment was stopped after 3 hours (6 sets of reading taken).
Results analysis (to generate the data for the graph):
means were calculated from 2 readings of optical density and fluorescence.
(mean SFU minus background SFU) was divided by (mean OD minus background OD, if different from 0).
table was made for the samples at different points of time- e.g. sample 1 after 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min"

Future Vision for Safety in Synthetic Biology
In iGEM, it is a common practice for teams to choose their projects by first identifying real life issues, researching these issues, attempting to design a microorganism to help resolve an identified issue, and then engineering such an organism. As a first-year iGEM team, we could have tremendously benefitted from a systematic method to discuss environmental concerns in the design stage of our project. Safety cases would not only provide a systematic method to discuss environmental concerns, but it can also become a key element in the documentation of the project. Safety cases can also be a map to more detailed information of the project.
Our team envisions the use of a systematic technique to gain confidence in the safety of engineered microorganisms as common practice in the future of synthetic biology. Such thorough methods of safety assurance will be required for certification and regulation of SEBO’s. We see that the iGEM competition has an opportunity to be on the forefront of this inevitable movement. The UNL 2016 iGEM team has laid out unique ideas for how systematic safety assurance methods could be integrated into the iGEM competition and the field of synthetic biology.
Some Ideas:
The idea of BioBricks is a forward thinking concept. Parts are designed, engineered, characterized and submitted to a repository. The BioBrick standard has been an indispensable component of synthetic biology’s growth, as it promotes the sharing of ideas, and has allowed for the development of more complex systems, by giving synthetic biologists quick access to previously characterized parts.
SafetyBricks
Much like BioBricks, safety cases of iGEM projects could be built and then submitted to a repository for future iGEM teams to take into account when designing their projects. SafetyBricks could be safety cases of individual BioBricks, an environmental/safety characterization of BioBricks in a specific chassis.
Once a BioBrick has been created, future teams do not have to redesign the exact same part and isolate or synthesize the DNA sequence. This allows for the field to be capable of designing more complex systems. A repository of SafetyBricks would have a similar effect on safety in the field of Synthetic Biology. Teams using parts that safety cases have already been built for will be able to develop even more thorough safety cases on them and adapt them when developing safety cases of their own."

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on"

icE. coli
Escherichia coli's optimal growth temperature is 37°C. Its growth rate decreases drastically at lower temperatures and growth completely halts below 7°C. The aim of our project is to increase the cold tolerance of E. coli by expressing and combining several chaperone proteins that are normally found in psychrophillic bacteria. Chaperone proteins are essential in maintaining correct protein folding following changes in temperature. As such, expressing these proteins will enable enhanced growth rates at temperatures below 37°C and shift the minimal growth temperature down from 7°C, possibly even allowing growth near 0°C. Protein expression is achieved by using BioBricks, combining promoters and ribosome binding sites characterized by previous iGEM teams with newly synthesized genes that encode for psychrophile chaperones. While our subject is mainly fundamental in nature, there are various practical applications such as selection for growth on low temperatures instead of antibiotics or the optimization of biofuel production.

CryoBricks
The different proteins we intend to use for making cold resistant E. coli strains can be classified into three different categories: Cold growth rate enhancing proteins, freeze survivability proteins and antifreeze proteins. Chaperones from psychrotrophic organisms have been show to enhance growth rate at lower than optimal temperatures. This extension of the growth curve could even shift minimum growth rate from 7°C (the wildtype minimum) to 0°C or lower. Freeze survivability proteins allow a larger fraction of the cells to survive when being frozen and subsequently thawed. Antifreeze proteins allow for a reduction in freezing temperature as well as increased cell viability at subzero temperatures. We intend to combine these three classes of proteins in order to build cells that are very well equipped against the cold. For more detailed information on any of the parts listed below, refer to our Basic Parts page in the BioBricks section.

1 General idea
Tsinghua iGEM 2012 presents the idea of “Domino  Effect in E. coli” as a potential approach to allow a whole E. coli community  to perform exactly the same with only one weak initial signal and carry out  information processing. This goal can be achieved by a set of quorum  sensing-based design, including basic modules of signal reception and release,  signal amplification and complex modules of logic gating. Furthermore, the  population of bacteria community is a huge advantage for information processing  compared to existing single cell-based computing circuitries.
2 Concept
Figure  1A. This figure shows how conventional domino effect
works, as the tile in  front fall, they topple the tiles behind them
as a result – signal transmission  and
Figure 1B. This figure demonstrates our basic  concept of
E. coli dominos, inspired by the conventional domino effect.
 
From the figures above, if we look at it from  another perspective, the domino effect can be viewed as a form of information  processing, with the possibility to realize signal amplification and logic  gating. We attempted to use biological elements to replace the mechanical  elements in mechanical domino effect: each bacterium represents a domino tile; the  action of topple here refers to a set of information transmission process, and  the mechanical force is replaced by chemical signaling molecules; these  elements are the key to building a set of “E. coli dominos”, like the one we  showed in figure 1B.
Quorum sensing in prokaryotes allows bacteria to communicate through  chemical signals like AHLs, and coordinate behaviors among the whole bacterial community.  This mechanism is ideal to serve as a basis  for our project.
In the basic module, a small proportion of E.  coli in the community will receive and recognize an external signal, then send  it forward to bacteria nearby using AHL signals, causing the same reaction in  cells nearby. Since each bacterium"

Moving our glow sticks for synthetic biology
Participating in a synthetic biology competition, we wanted to exchange our ideas on synthetic biology with other interested schoolmates, thus we gave a presentation carefully prepared to them. Click here for detail.
Attentions on policy-making
So far, no policy has been established on how to standardize the microRNA antagonist therapy, Instead of simply waiting for the new policy, we actively consulted professors and obtained a general idea of it. Want to see? Click here .
Consultation with expert
We went to Genetalks
Genetalks is founded in Santiago by a team of young scientists in North America. Since 2009, the clinical transformation of gene testing has been carried out, and it was formally established in Beijing in 2014. With the core of gene technology and other advanced technologies such as information technology and machine learning, the company is committed to technological innovation, application development and services in the field of medicine and health. hoping to receive some professional, market-based suggestions from technicians there, and we were lucky enough to interview Dr. Zhuo Song. As the CTO, he really formed a deeper idea than we students, which inspired us a lot.
The most important point we've discussed was about safety issues. If a product or a technology is put into use, the very first thing is to ensure its safety. On this thing, Zhuo put forward two questions:
Will the sponge affect the normal function of cells?
Will MicroRNA inhibitor work in positive correlation with level gradient?
These provided us new ideas of safety inspection of product beyond the mainline; in order to fully solve these questions, we added cytotoxicity test and concentration gradient experiment to our future work.
As for application, he mentioned the market of MicroRNA inhibitor is not limited to research or the treatment of human diseases. Actually, agriculture and animal husbandry are also potential and untapped areas for MicroRNA inhibitor. Moreover, market sense is also important for a project; a streamlined and efficient experimental method, along with a lower cost, will make our project more popular.
Product evaluation
We evaluated the cost of our product. It contains mainly three steps:

The nature of democracy is one of fast but short-term improvement as policy makers have only a matter of a few years in which to prove themselves. This is reflective of human nature: we crave instant gratification at the cost of long-term improvement. However, today more than ever before it is clear how powerfully our actions impact our future. We need to build a more sustainable society.  Our project aims to improve environmental sustainability of important industry by making the processes they use less environmentally damaging in the long run. However, part of what makes planning every project so challenging is that to be truly sustainable, it must be sustainable in every aspect. This is why our human practices are so important.
Cadmium in Global Waters
Cadmium in natural waters exists as either free/aquated cation (Cd2+/CdOH+)[1] this is due to the competition of organic binding resulting in aluminium causing the almost complete displacement of cadmium.
A large amount of cadmium pollution in water ways is due to either industrial waste or fertilizers produced from phosphate ores. In unpolluted natural waters the cadmium concentrations are usually below 1μg/l[2] however the maximum level ever recorded was in Rio Rimao in Peru at 100μg/l[3].  The WHO have set the guideline level of cadmium in global drinking waters as 3μg/l[4] In 2007 UNEP stated these would be the parameters set for water quality as a global index[5].

We had a very successful year which would not have been possible without the support of so many dedicated people. We would like to take the chance to thank these people here for all of their help. It really means a lot to us.
2017 Team and Project
Team recruitment was started in February and bi-weekly meetings were held in March to flesh out the 2017 project idea. By the end of March, we had decided to continue working on the project from the previous year: Cloning the cellulose degradation pathway into E. coli for efficient conversion of wood waste to glucose, then production of ethanol by yeast. iGEM elections for team leads were held in April. We elected the president and 5 team leads: Wet Lab, Dry Lab, Web Design, Fundraising and Human Practices. Our team was 24 undergraduate students at the beginning of April. Over the course of April and May we developed our project, and the goals we wanted to complete before the Jamboree. Starting in June we began mining the synthetic metagenomic library for enzymes to send for synthesis. In June we also started building the metagenomic cosmid library which continued, with much troubleshooting, until the end of October. Cloning began immediately after our first IDT shipment arrived, and assay development started early September. This continued into late October. In June we also started contacting people for our science communication project. We wanted to ensure that our science project would be understood by the most people possible. Human practices finished all interviews by early October. Our project was developed by undergraduate students at Dalhousie University with the help of the following people.
Faculty Support of the Project
Drs. Craig McCormick, John Rohde, and Lois Murray helped form and direct the project from the beginning. Drs. McCormick and Rohde provided their lab and many reagents to get us started. Dr. Rohde provided presentation coaching and formed a journal club, separate to the Think of the PLoSibilities blog.  Dr. Murray arranged our own iGEM laboratory space during the summer.

Sample preparation and protein loading
5. Incubate samples at 37 °C for 15 min or for up to 60 min for samples that were in pellet form. Avoid boiling samples, because membrane proteins can irreversibly aggregate in SDS at temperatures >50 °C.
6. Mount the gels in the vertical electrophoresis apparatus (see EQUIPMENT), and add anode buffer as the lower electrode buffer and cathode buffer as the upper electrode buffer (anodes and cathodes are commonly marked red and black, respectively, by the suppliers).
7. Load samples under the cathode buffer. Apply 10-μl sample volumes to 0.7 × 5 mm sample wells.For the optimal resolution of peptides of 1–5 kDa, reduce the amount of SDS in the incubation buffers, for example, by fourfold and reduce the volume applied to 5 μl. Reducing the amount of SDS facilitates electrophoretic separation of peptides from the bulk of SDS. To avoid streaking of peptide bands, peptides and bulk SDS must be separated before the faster-migrating bulk SDS and the peptides immediately following reach the separating gel. The sample volume applied for Tricine–SDS-PAGE should not substantially exceed 10 μl, because stacking of proteins in the range 20–100 kDa is less efficient than in Laemmli–SDS-PAGE.
Electrophoresis conditions
8. Set running conditions appropriate to your type of gel; guidance on appropriate running conditions are given in the table below. Start electrophoresis with an initial voltage of 30 V and maintain at this voltage until the sample has completely entered the stacking gel. The next appropriate voltage step can then be applied. The initial current may be as high as 80 mA for a 0.7mm 10% gel. Gels may warm up, but the temperature should not exceed 35–40 °C. Approaching the end of the run, voltage can be gradually increased to shorten the total time of electrophoresis. Fast runs give better results than overnight runs, especially with 10% acrylamide gels. Alternatively, a constant power of 10 W per gel might be set to ensure an even distribution of heat. The specific settings for electrophoretic runs depend considerably on the apparatus used"

Computational Modelling
The modelling in our 2009 iGEM project, BacMan, can be split into a number of sections - the Stochastic Switch , Degradation system , Metal Intake , Sporulation Tuning and Population Simulation . We are particularly proud of our Population Simulation Model as it combines distributed computing, agent based and cellular models.
For computational modelling, we are using a number of technologies, including Java , Matlab , Amazon EC2 , Microbase , SBML and CellML .
Sub-projects
Stochastic Switch
See Stochastic Switch Model
We have modelled our stochastic switch.
We also designed an inducible protein degradation system for our switch.
See Degradation Model
Population Modelling
See Population Simulation
One of the models which we are producing is one concerning the population numbers of our bacteria. It looks at how our additions to the DNA may affect the growth of the bacterial population.
Sporulation Tuning
See KinA Expression Model
The KinA Expression model describes how KinA is expressed.
See Sporulation Tuning Model
Building on the KinA Expression model, the phosphorelay is implented into our model, using the expression of KinA to induce sporulation.
See Sin Operon Model
The Sin Operon model is used to repress sporulation, in view of making our model more realistic.
Metal Intake
See Metal Intake Model
Another of our models looks at metal intake. Specifically this looks at Cadmium transport throughout our bacteria.

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"ospores are highly     resistant and durable structures. They have a central cytoplasmic     core where the DNA and ribosomes are protected by an impermeable     and rigid coat. Spores, when released in the environment, can     survive extreme heat and freezing, lack of water, high pressure      exposure to many toxic chemicals and certain radiations. Compared     to the vegetative cells, endospores are contained in a thicker cell     wall along with additional layers that make them last long periods     in its dehydrated metabolically inactive state.
Sporulation
The process of endospore formation within a B. subtilis can take     up several hours to complete and is called sporulation or     sporogenesis. Sporulation can be induced manually in the lab by     limiting the availability of a key nutrient, such as the carbon or     nitrogen source.
Sporulation begins with a small portion of cytoplasm, along with     a newly replicated bacterial chromosome, is isolated by an     ingrowth of the plasma membrane, called spore septum. The spore     gets a double-layered membrane that will surround the chromosome     and cytoplasm. This structure is entirely enclosed within the     original cell, and is called forespore.
Peptidoglycan layers are laid down between the two membrane     layers. A thick spore coat is formed around the outside membrane,     which is responsible for the resistance of endospores. The last     stage of sporulation is the degradation of the original cell and     the release from the endospore [30] .
Germination
An endospore returns to its vegetative state by a process called     germination. This process is triggered by physical or chemical cell     damage to the endospore coat. The enzymes of the endospores then     break down the extra layers surrounding the endospore. The water     enters and the metabolism resumes. [30]
Natural Competence
The natural competence of B. subtilis is one of its less used     advantages. Competent B. subtilis can actively pull DNA fragments     from their environment. These uptaken nucleotides change the genotype by homologous recombination, also known as natural     transformation. In order for B. subtilis to integrate DNA from     medium, the cells can synthesize a specific DNA-binding and uptake     system as seen in figure 9. In this figure there are a few proteins     which form the translocation complex drawn (A, NucA; C, ComC; E,     ComE; F, ComF"

An introduction
We aim to optimize the conditions already present in the cell to optimize the overall production of rubber. We’ve been looking at two quite different ways of optimizing the rubber production, which should be applicable to a real-life production. These two are:
Optimization of each cell
Optimization of the number of cells
The optimization of each cell identifies rate-limiting steps in the pathways related to the production of the polyisoprene. Where the optimization of the number of cells is to make in vitro tests of how a cell responds to different changes in environment, and find the environment with the best influence.
Optimization of each cell
In the production of rubber, there are three primary pathways: the glycolysis, the MEP-pathway, and the rubber transferase itself. We decided to focus on the MEP-pathway.
Since no one had modelled the entire pathway before, we build the model from the ground up. We based the model on Michaelis Menten kinetics, and the kinetic terms entering the model are: ordinary uni-uni reaction, ordinary bi-bi reaction, reversible bi-bi reaction and substrate inhibitory bi"

There are several iGEM teams in Japan, and as ‘iGEM JAPAN’, we collaborated with 'iGEM JAPAN Kansai Forum' and ' May Festival' written below. We also collaborated with many other teams inside Japan, and also with many teams in the world
＜iGEM JAPAN Kansai Forum＞
On February 19th, we visited University of Kyoto and participated on a meeting event ‘iGEM Japan Kansai Forum’. iGEM Nagahama team , iGEM Gifu team , iGEM Kobe team , iGEM Kyoto team , KAIT team , iGEM Hokkaido team ,and Botchan Lab Tokyo team gathered in Kyoto. In February, we haven’t decided the theme of the project yet, and had several ideas of the project. So, we presented our 4 ideas and got feedbacks and opinions on each idea in details. We also exchanged opinions not only on projects and experiments but also on team managing and activities. Since it was the first year for our university to participate in iGEM competition, all of the teams above helped us setting up our team. We also conducted a survey and asked  iGEM teams above the questions about what abilities we can get and how this experience be used in the future by participating on iGEM competition.
＜Collaboration with iGEM Nagahama＞
We collaborated with iGEM Nagahama , one of the teams in Japan. We got advice and hints of participating in iGEM as private university from iGEM Nagahama team, since we are both private universities, such as how to setting up funds, how to work on iGEM in the universities, and so on.  Because it was our fisrt time to participate, they also taught us how to write wiki. On the other hand, we helped iGEM Nagahama team as well. We advised about cloud funding, especially which website to use,"

Our team presented the hardware built using digital fabrication techniques in a lecture and demonstration session. The event represented a singular opportunity to share our work and insights: from the motivations that led us to built our own lab equipments to the context of the iGEM competition and the social impact of our project. As we were used to talking to scholars and students, FAZ gave us the chance to reach out for designers, architects and artists, a public we had not dialogued before. The insights and questions raised there enriched our experience by pointing out the design and visual aspects of building biotechnology devices. It was great to see how different backgrounds lead to different ways of approaching an specific problem.

NRP 59
Introduction
Location of Switzerland in Europe
In 2005, the Swiss decided on a five year Moratorium on the commercial use of genetically modified plants (GMP)s in a referendum with 55.7 % of the voters in favor of the moratorium. At the same time, the government conducted a national research program ( NRP ) with the title ‘Benefits and risks of the deliberate release of genetically modified plants’. The aim of the so called NRP 59 was to do research on safety, benefits and risks of GMP regarding specifically the situation and conditions in Switzerland [1].
In 2010, the moratorium was elongated for three more years until November 2013 to wait for the final results of NRP 59 that should provide a solid scientific basis for a broad public discussion of the topic.
This year, 2012, the NFP 59 published its final results. We want to take the opportunity to let people from other countries know how Switzerland deals with genetically modified plants. To further critically access the results of NFP 59, we talked to two important players that have an impact on Swiss plant biotechnology: Mr. Markus Ritter (link in German, French or Italy), member of the Swiss National Council and head of the swiss farmers’ association and Prof. Ingo Potrykus , who is one of the inventors of ' golden rice"

Besides, we will try to develop the ribB report gene. We hope that the riboflavin-MFC system can be a new measurement standard system for quantitive measuring.
Interlab
Overview
As our team is participating in the Measurement track, we are asked to work in the Interlab Study. Interlab Study In this year, we are asked to build 3 devices. The devices are J23101 + I13504, J23106 + I13504 and J23117 + I13504.
In our study, we constructed the 3 devices in E.coli DH5 alpha and the devices were all constructed in the pSB1C3 plasmid. We used the flow cytometer (LSRFortessa, BD) as the equipment and the data was processed by TASEB tools. TASEB tools In the Collections Page of Anderson Promoters, Collections Page of Anderson Promoters we can get the strength of the three promoters(J23101, J23106 and J23117). We had known that J23101 is the strongest and J23117 is the weakest. Our results proved this information.
Experimental Design
We used the BBa_I20270 as the positive control. The negative control is empty plasmid pET-28a. We constructed the three required devices (J23101 + I13504, J23106 + I13504 and J23117 + I13504) by BioBricks Assembly. We measured the devices using the flow cytometer. The data was processed by FlowJo 10
Methods
Device Construct
The parts were presented kindly by the team TJU. All the plasmids were transformed into E.coli DH5 alpha competent cells (made by the Ca ions method). We extracted the plasmid by the OMEGA Plasmid Mini Prep Kit (D6943-02). BBa_I13504 was cut by XbaI and PstI. J23101, J23106 and J23117 were cut by SpeI and PstI. The I13504 was inserted into the 3 vectors above by T4 Ligase. Finally the devices we constructed were transformed into E.coli DH5 alpha. All enzymes we used in the study is from TAKARATM. The restriction maps is below.

Macquarie_Australia,2016,Team:Macquarie Australia#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," [24]. Later he attempted to decouple the Hydrogenase activity from the oxidation of water by expressing Hydrogenase in a non-photosynthetic organism, but was unsuccessful [25]. Within this project we are attempting to produce [Fe] Hydrogenase, ferredoxin, and maturation enzymes. In conjunction they reduce hydrogen ions and electrons to produce hydrogen gas. As this is a new addition to our project we have synthesised all four genes (hyd1, hydEF, hydG, and Ferredoxin), as gBlocks and successfully ligated all 4 gBlocks into Biobricks. We are yet to confirm the expression of each gene in E. coli for characterisation, which if successful will allow hydrogen production (Fig. 4).
CRISPR/Cas9
Figure. 5 HemH knock-out using CRISPR/Cas9
CRISPR/Cas9 was discovered as a component in the immune system of Streptococcus pyogenes. Since its discovery CRISPR/Cas9 has been an effective tool for genomic manipulation within many organisms [26]. The ability of CRISPR to manipulate E. coli genes has been demonstrated previously, with a near 100% editing success rate for insertions and deletions for double and single stranded DNA [27].
We have incorporated this technique into our project to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Chlorophyll and Photosystem II pathways. By knocking out the hemH gene that produces Ferrachelatase in heme biosynthesis pathway [16] using CRISPR/Cas9 approach, more Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) can be accumulated [7], providing more substrate for our Chlorophyll synthesis pathway. As a result, all cellular PPIX could be redirected for chlorophyll synthesis and can be used for the Photosystem II within E. coli.
We have also collaborated with the Singapore NTU iGEM team by testing the activity of their mammalian CRISPR/Cas9 in a bacterial system. Their Cas9 plasmids, including one wild type and two mutants, has been His-tag purified and coupled with our sgRNA in an vitro assay, in an attempt to characterise their parts.

Despite its potential, the costs exceed the supply by a fair margin; initial costs are astronomical and maintaining them              are troublesome. Also, the harm it induces on the environment is undeniable; because wide bodies of land are required for              them to work, they inevitably intersect wild life, and its acoustics make it impossible to incorporate it to urban settings;              which ruin the acoustics, endangering species of birds.
Hydro-Energy uses the kinetic energy of water and has the largest capacity among renewable energy sources. (Herzog et al., 2001)              However, despite it does not involve fossil fuels, its effects on the environment aren’t that much better; defeating the purpose.              (Herzog et al., 200) The need to make space for mechanisms involves flooding the water mass, which wrecks the aquatic life,              devastated water quality, reduce dam efficiency because of sedimentation and waterborne diseases along with the need to displace              native residents. (Herzog et al., 2001) Not to mention; the initial costs are colossal. (Herzog et al., 2001)
Energy derived from natural heat within the earth, better known as geothermal energy, is another conventional renewable energy.              (Herzog et al., 2001) It is inexhaustible; only 1% of the heat in the uppermost 10 km's of earth's crust is 500 times all the oil              and gas we have. (Herzog et al., 2001) Yet, this energy is distributed unevenly, rarely concentrated and often too deep to be viable,              making it less than optimal. Also, it's associated with the release of toxic substances like hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, mercury, radon,              and boron, although it's a minor concern. (Herzog et al., 2001)
Solar energy, energy from the sun with the use of solar panels, are seemingly viable since the sunlight falls on earth in one hour              is alleged to meet world’s energy demands for a year. (Aster, 2012) However, its disadvantages make it less than optimal; it not              being available everywhere year-round, it's incredibly astronomical prices, it requiring an AC inverter to be usable in daily life,              not meeting demand in terms of heat, taking up large spaces with low efficiency are to name a few.

(1)
The data was collected in three independent experiments. The fluorescence of the samples was measured in the supernatant of the immobilization experiment after centrifugation of the silica beads. The fluorescence of the control was measured in a sample which was treated exactly like the others but no silica beads were added. 100 µg protein was used for one immobilization experiment. The data was fitted with a sigmoidal dose-response function of the form.
(2)
with the Hill coefficient p, the bottom asymptote A1, the top asymptote A2 and the switch point log(x0) (R² = 0.874).
The fit indicates that a good silica concentration for 100 µg of protein is 150 - 200 mg mL-1. This set-up leads to saturated beads with low waste of protein. So a good protein / bead ratio to work with is 5 - 7 * 10-4.
Figure 9: Degree of clearance of the fluorescence in the supernatant plotted against the concentration of silicium dioxide beads used to immobilize <partinfo>K525305</partinfo> (n = 3). Data is fitted with dose-reponse function (R² = 0.874).
Effect on enzyme stability
To test whether the S-layer protein enhances the half-life of the firefly luciferase, immobilization experiments were carried out. After the IEX described above, the elution fraction was immobilized on silicon dioxide beads or just diluted with HBSS buffer which is used for the immobilization / recrystallization of SgsE S-layer proteins. The immobilization is carried out at room temperature for 4 h. It could be seen that the luciferase activity nearly expired during this time (in the positive and the negative control). So the S-layer SgsE could not stabilize the luciferase at room temperature. The results of this experiment is shown in the figure below:
Fig. 10: Results of immobilization experiments with <partinfo>K525311</partinfo>. The stability of the luciferase activity at room temperature is decreasing quickly.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#PoliciesAndPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," aGEM presentation. We prepared content for the presentation and videos featuring our expert's interviews. We also practiced answering potential questions that can arise after our presentation at aGEM. We also started uploading policies and practices content on the wiki.
The Canadian and American governments as well as the FBI attend the Pathogen Security Partners meeting that will be taking place this fall in November.  We have stayed in contact with representatives from the Public Agency of Canada and the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs as they are interested in a presentation from our team at this event and governmental meeting.  This in addition to our teams experience at the Biological Weapons Convention in Geneva will allow iGEM and its teams to create an awareness of undergraduate research in synthetic biology and the impact of iGEM on this industry.  Over the next couple weeks our team plans to continue to plan this presentation with our contacts with the Canadian government, and continue to pursue our project after the Giant Jamboree in Boston.  We have forwarded more information regarding our project and its potential impact and have set up several phone meetings to discuss these plans.  Although this is a future direction for our project that will take place after Boston, our team is very passionate about the synthetic biology industry and scope of our project and wants to take this opportunity to showcase the potential of iGEM.
Week 19: September 8th - September 12th
We have continued discussion with the Government of Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada over the past week and will continue for the entirety of iGEM 2014 to ensure they have the necessary background information on our project.  This necessary background information will ensure that a relevant presentation can be created addressing the conferences interests in our team’s project.  By staying in contact and discussion the necessary planning measures that will need to be taken to attend this event we can make this experience possible.
The remaining weeks until iGEM composed of finalizing and compiling all results of the research and perspectives we have gathered.  Additionally we have continued to organize the logistics for the presentation at the Pathogen Security Partners meeting and implement this policy throughout our designs and device.
