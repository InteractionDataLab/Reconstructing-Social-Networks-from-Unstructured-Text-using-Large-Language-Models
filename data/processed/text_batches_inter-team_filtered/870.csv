Duquesne Ethics Forum
Duquesne Ethics Forum
Our Presentation
Ethical considerations are a significant portion of any new, developing field and are especially pertinent to synthetic biology. The Pitt iGEM Team believes our best recommendations for the future are developed through analysis of ethical case studies of the past. To this effect, the Pitt iGEM Team participated in the 2014 Duquesne Ethics Forum, where we presented a case study of the Holmesburg Prison Experiments, unethically conducted by Dr. Albert Kligman and the University of Pennsylvania from 1951 to 1974.
Our case shows that despite numerous guidance documents, such as the Helsinki and Nuremburg codes, Dr. Kligman was still able to operate without much oversight. In Dr. Kligman’s words, “Informed consent was unheard of. No one asked me what I was doing. It was a wonderful time.” Even when the public discovered how prisoners at Holmesburg were routinely infected with warts, herpes, and staphylococcus and were test subjects for dozens of unknown chemicals, Dr. Kligman (along with sponsoring government agencies) faced few repercussions for his complete disregard for medical ethics. Dr. Kligman avoided any implications of medical misconduct by blatantly deleting his results. Since his death in 2010, he is revered by his institution and is known to have “lived by a philosophy that compelled him to give back.”
Thankfully, the creation of Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), has provided the necessary oversight to enforce ethical guidelines, such as the NIH Code of Federal Regulations for Human Trials. However, the Pitt iGEM Team believes there is more to the story. Prior to the Holmesburg experiments, medical ethics were not taught in medical school, which made it easier for Dr. Kligman and his associates to turn a blind eye. In that light, our recommendation to the scientific community is to promote and encourage the study of ethics in university curricula, as it pertains to synthetic biology.

Project Components
In order to automate the output of a microfluidic device, we have divided our goals into three main components:
Microfluidics: A microfluidic chip designed to execute a desired biological experiment.
Hardware: A low-cost, do-it-yourself active XY-translational stage that selectively dispenses the output of the microfluidic chip to a 96-well plate, as well as automated control syringes.
Software: A software interface that will allow the user to detail the parameters of the experiment run on the chip; the specific location per output on the 96-well plate; and the amount of each output dispensed.
To learn more about these components, explore the tabs below!
Microfluidics
Hardware
Software
Microfluidic chips are engineered devices that manipulate fluid flow through microchannels, which are typically molded or engraved into a material. Due to the small size of the channels, turbulent flow is minimized, allowing scientists to accurately direct fluids through the chip. The most common method of fabricating microfluidic devices is soft lithography, which creates channels by casting a polymer, such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), onto a mold and curing the polymer. This, however, involves high costs due to the need to create a master mold for every chip design and the materials needed to create and cure the PDMS chip. In order to make microfluidics more accessible to synthetic biologists, we have adopted the Boston University CIDAR Lab's low-cost manufacturing protocol for microfluidic devices.
BU CIDAR Lab has created a manufacturing workflow, MakerFluidics, which allows scientists to create microfluidic devices by milling microchannels into polycarbonate using a desktop CNC mill.
These microfluidic devices are comprised of two layers of polycarbonate, the flow layer and control layer, which sandwich a thin layer of PDMS. The polycarbonate layers contain etched features that allow for the manipulation of fluid through the device and the PDMS allows for the actuation of valves, which selectively direct fluid flow. Typically, the fabrication of these devices ranges from one to two hours for milling, depending on the complexity of the design, and another hour for assembly.

Cellulose Binding Domain - Introduction
In the field of cheap protein-extraction cellulose binding domains (CBD) have made themselves a name. A lot of publications have been made, concerning a cheap strategy to capture a protein from the cell-lysate with a CBD-tag. Also enhanced segregation with CBD-tagged proteins have been observed. Here the idea is different, we want to take advantage of the binding capacity of binding domains not only for purification reasons (it is still a benefit), but also as an immobilizing-protocol for our laccases.
To make a purification and immobilization-tag out of a protein domain, there are a lot of decisions and characterizations you have to get through.
Figure 1:Graphical sequence-alignment of <partinfo>K392014</partinfo> and the Xyn10A gene of C.josui
Starting with the choice of the binding domain, the first limitation is accessibility. Our first place to look was, of course the Partsregistry . We found a promising Cellulose binding motif of the C. josui Xyn10A gene (<partinfo>BBa_K392014</partinfo>) there and ordered it right from the spot for our project. After some research later concerning the sequence of that BioBrick it turned out that the part is not the CBD of the Xylanase as it should be, but the glycosyl hydrolase domain of the protein (Figure 1). This result made the part useless for our project ( complete review ) and it was the only binding domain in the Partsregistry that fitted to our project.
So we started to search the accessible organisms we had via NCBI for binding-domains, -proteins and -motifs and asked in work-groups if they could help us out. The results of our database research were only two chitin/carbohydate binding modules within the Bacillus halodurans genome (we ordered that stain for it's laccase <partinfo>BBa_K863020</partinfo>). One is in the Cochin chitinase gene and the other in a chitin binding protein .

\begin{equation} D_eff = \frac{D_m}{1 + \phi} \times (1 - \frac{2 \times \phi}{1 + \phi}) \end{equation}
Modeling the bed bugs behaviour, movements and death
Movements of bed bugs
Now we have modeled the diffusion of pheromones through the room, now, we have to model the behaviour of bed bugs in this environment. We firstly visualised the movement of our bed bugs as random when they are not in contact with any pheromones. Then, as soon as they are in contact with pheromones, the randomness of their behaviour is limited by the attraction of the high quantity of pheromones. Since pheromones are used to attract bed bugs to the traps, only 2 structures will emit pheromones : traps, in order to model our solution, and the nest, modeling the place where the bed bug go back.
Concretely, when the bed bug is not in contact with a patch containing pheromones, we designed the bed bug to walk randomly across the environment, thanks to a group of ifelses instructions and an increasing randomness code. When the bed bug is near a patch containing pheromones, the bed bug is oriented facing the patch with the higher quantity of pheromones. Then, the bed bug moves forward to the patch the bed bug is facing, but with a bit of randomness again. It is important to note that bed bugs have a minimum and a maximum pheromone detection threshold. Those thresholds limit the attractive effect of the pheromones, making the model more realistic.
We also implemented some particular movements behaviour in the case a bed bug had to interact with a specific patch, such as furniture, traps or the nest.  When the bed bug is facing a furniture, it will be oriented at the opposite from furniture before moving forward randomly. In the case of the nest, the bed bug is stopped by the histamin contained in the nest. A few moments later, the bed bug is set facing another direction and move forward.
Death mechanisms of bed bugs and their nest
Another particular behaviour is triggered by the infection of bed bugs by the fungus and the deaths of infected bed bugs. When a bed bug is in front of a trap, the program colors the bed bug in orange and"

Tsinghua-A,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#fluid medium 2_-_-_TEXT.html," only warrior lived in the medium.
4. RFP intensity is used to indicate the amount of LacI, so it can indicate the killing ability of the warrior. This means in our model that the warrior cannot actually kill another warrior, but can activate the RFP expression of another warrior. And more RFP inside cell means the cell is killed more by warrior in other side.
Then we can evaluate killing ability by looking at change of RFP intensity as time inside each warrior. The initial amount of them is same.
III Gene circuit of warrior in the model
Note: Here for simplicity, we hypothesize that this gene circuit is orthometric.
IV ODE, parameters and its resource
V Original Parameter set of the model
Tsinghua-A ODE
VI Results of model
Note: Since we have assumed that the increasing rate and carrying capacity of two warriors are same, so in the model, the amount of two warriors are same at all the time.
1. Results under original parameter sets:
(Fig. 3 RFP level inside warrior I and warrior II)
As stated above, RFP intensity is used to indicate the killing ability of the warrior. From this original parameter set and result, we can see that since the maximal expression rate of RFP of two warriors (Indicating the amount of LacI) have large difference, so the maximal killing abilities are different largely. In the real situation, this means that the warrior I has higher amount of LacI and thus less CmR so it has less resistance to chloramphenicol and slower growth rate.
The first step we can do to regulate maximal killing ability is to increase/decrease the maximal expression rate of warrior I/II. In the experiment, this can be achieved by changing the RBS after Prhl in warrior. For example, we can increasing the maximal expression level of RFP inside warrior II to increase the killing ability of warrior I.
2.  Increasing the maximal expression rate of RFP inside warrior II
Change beta1AHL1 from 6e3 to 6e4
(Figure 4 RFP level inside warrior I and warrior II beta(1AHL1 )=6e4)
From this, Even the maximal expression intensity of AHL promoter of two warriors are the same, we will think warrior II still have much higher killing ability than that of warrior I. This is because its killing ability is high at the beginning, so warrior I may be killed at a very fast speed at the beginning.

The process of luminescence involves a variety of substances, which are products of bacterial metabolism. When external condition worsens, its luminous way will be affected in a very short period of time, resulting in suppression or shutdown of luminescent reaction. As a result, luminescence of bacteria is positively correlated to the concentration of toxin in condition, what’s more, the correlation can be approached by a linear function. Based on the mechanism, luminescent bacteria have been widely adopted as a biological indicator in rapid quantification of toxin in the environment.
Luminescent bacteria luciferase gene
Bacteria luminescence is a consequence of its luciferase catalytic metabolic process. The luciferase encoding gene is LuxAB. All genus of luminescent bacteria have five core constitute lux gene operon, order of which is luxCDABE. Bacteria luciferase is composed of two subunits heterodimer, including luciferase alpha and beta subunits coded by luxA and luxB respectively. LuxC, luxD, luxE encode for reduction of fatty acid synthesis fatty aldehyde enzyme complexes of three subunits: reductase, transferase, synthetase, respectively. Mancin (1988) successfully cloned the photobacterium phosphoreum’s luciferase operon luxCDABFE and expressed it in Escherichia coli. Except for methods though plasmid, lux gene can also be integrated into the cell chromosome by genetic engineering techniques in pursuit of stability. What’s more, bioluminescent detection through lux gene is easy to achieve, and it is fast, simple and sensitive.  Hence the bioluminescent detection method has extensive research and application in gene transduction, expression and regulation, environmental chemistry and its toxicity detection,etc.

    Directed evolution strategies have always been a common method for obtaining specific optimized functional strains, but it’s easy to obtain specific functional components, nor explore the functional mechanisms of components. Therefore, based on the data and experience of this project, we have established a model for screening specific functional components, which can also provide a reference for the preliminary exploration of functional mechanisms. The goal of this project is to build a Lactococcus lactis strain with acid and freeze resistance, in which the acid-resistant components are obtained due to this model. Below I will introduce our model with our acid-resistant component msmK as an example:
    Before model, you should have a strain with corresponding capability or function. In our project, we got the anti-acid strain L.lactis by the following steps:
    We firstly mutant our parent strain L.lactis NZ9000, and 3 key mutant strains were screened from 35,000 mutant strains under high throughput screening, namely L.lactis WH101, WH102, and WH103.
    And then we did acid stress analysis on these three mutant strains.
    Figure 1 The survival rate of 4 strains, L.lactis NZ9000, L.lactis WH101, L.lactis WH102, L.lactis WH103. On the left it’s colony distribution of parent strain and acid-tolerant strains under a pH of 4.0 stress gradient of 10-3, and on the right it’s the survival rate of parent strain and acid tolerant strain (pH 4.0).
    Figure 2 The growth curve of 4 strains, L.lactis NZ9000, L.lactis WH101, L.lactis WH102, L.lactis WH103. A: pH 7.0, B: pH 5.0, C: pH 4.5.
    From figure 1 and figure 2, we screened out L.lactis WH101, which has remarkably 16000-fold higher survival rate than the parent strain at pH4.0 for 5h, which is the highest among the reported survival rates at the same condition.

Count Colony Forming Units per mL of the co-culture
Choose plates that haven’t formed lawns, you want easy to identify colonies ideally
Count the number of colonies on that plate (choose a dilution in which all three co-cultures can be counted)
Divide the number of colonies by the dilution factor to get the number of CFUs
Divide that value by the fraction of mLs plated to get CFUs/mL
Compare the CFUs of the inhibitor with the positive and negative control to determine if the inhibitor properly inhibits the target strain"

Human Practice has always been a crucial part of an IGEM project. In order to establish integrated human practice with enough social engagement, we performed the following tasks.
Gold
Online  Media
At the beginning of the project, we set up a WeChat official account, a form of online media, where our team posted articles that introduce concept and knowledge relating to our project. The official account was run by one team member and articles about introduction of lab safety, team member introduction, and interview with a doctor at Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, an article about what is colorectal cancer, and an article talks about synthetic biology as well as our team’s project.
*Zhongnan Hospital is a hospital run by Wuhan University. Its whole name is Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University.
Presentations
During our visit in Hangzhou, we did a presentation to students from Yiling Middle School in Zhejiang University. As this is also a part of collaboration, the participated teams talked about different aspects of IGEM competition. Our team focused on the introduction of our project through explaining what is colorectal cancer and mechanism of how microRNA controlling gene expression as well as cell cycle. Later we went to the Zhejiang Science Museum to introduce our project and the competition to the public. We hand out fans with information about colorectal cancer, tell the tourists about the project, and we designed games relating to science for the younger children to play. The process of handing out the fans and talking to tourists involves a lot of social interaction where we get to know about people’s attitude toward cancer related projects.

To better understand the public opinion, a survey was designed after returning from Hangzhou. The first version was released and received 333 responses. A second modified version was released with changes in the descriptions and choices of the questions so to avoid the equivocation occurred in the"

Figure 7 shows a TEM image with 147 identified silver nanoparticles produced by the wild type human ferritin (BBa_K1189019) . The particles are between 24.5 and 1597.8 nm in size with one very big particle with a size of 7272.3 nm, which seems to consist in many agglutinated silver nanoparticles. No particle was found in the expected size of about 8 nm.

Figure 8 shows a TEM image with 708 identified silver nanoparticles produced by the gold silver mutant ferritin sample (BBa_K2638999) . The particles have a size between 1.8 and 34.8 nm. 120 of the silver nanoparticles (16.9 %) are exactly in the expected size of 7 to 9 nm which indicates that at least all of these particles are produced by our improved ferritin (BBa_K2638999) .
Figure 9: The silver nanoparticles in our gold silver mutant ferritin (BBa_K2638999) with a mean diameter of 8.2 nm were significant smaller than the nanoparticles of the wildtype human ferritin (BBa_K1189019) with a mean diameter of 531.8 nm.
The direct comparison of our new gold silver mutant ferritin (BBa_K2638999) and the old wild type human ferritin (BBa_K1189019) in figure 9 shows that our improved enzyme produces nearly five times more silver nanoparticles which are 98.5 % smaller than the silver nanoparticles produced by the wild type ferritin. This proves that the new ferritin enzyme is much more suitable for producing silver nanoparticles than the wild type version.

Based on the Holling Ⅱ Type Functional Reacting Model, we can apply an ecology model to study the predation relation between tumor cells and bifidobacteria, and show the curve of population change with time. Combining all of the relations among tumor cells, bifidobacteria and somatic cells, we can establish an ecological model to estimate the curves of population change of tumor cells and somatic cells when bifidobacteria are introduced into the tissue.
Model
2.1 The somatic cells - tumor cells relation model
Considering that the tumor cells act as an invasive species in the ecosystem and compete with somatic cell for resources, the competition model is an appropriate model to simulate the relation between tumor cells and somatic cells. Based on the Lotka-Volterra Model, we set〖 x〗_1 as the population of tumor cells, x_3 as the population of somatic cells. The differential equations show as follows.
The definitions of the parameters can be found in the link: (get more information about our ecological models…)
Model
The modeling result shows that when ecological system is healthy, and the immune system can limit environmental capacity of tumor cells (N_1 in the equations above) in a low scope, somatic cells is the dominant species in body ecosystem, and tumors cannot expand. When the body ecosystem is defected and the body's immune system is weak, the value of N_1 increases and somatic cells have a lower survival advantage than tumor cell. Gradually, the number of somatic cells will decrease, and tumor cells become the dominant species. In that case, tumors expand.
Figure6: The population of tumor cells and somatic cells changes when the body's immune system is weak. Tumor cells become the dominant species
The image of the differential equations above:
Model
2.2 Bifidobacteria-tumor cells relation model
When the genetically engineered bifidobacteria is introduced into the tumor tissues, they secrete apoptin to induce the apoptosis of tumor cells. For tumor cells, bifidobacterium is as a predator in the tissue ecosystem. However, bifidobacterium is strictly anaerobic bacterium. When tumor cell population decreases, which is likely to cause the increasing of oxygen concentration in tissues, the growth of bifidobacterium is suppressed. Therefore, the relation between bifidobacteria and tumor cells is more likely to be a parasitic relation. Based on the Holling Ⅱ Type Functional Reacting Model, we establish a differential"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,500 x g for 10 min at room temperature. The cell pellet was resuspended in fresh BG-11 medium at a density of 109 cells/ml and transformated immediately.
Plasmid DNA (1 μg plasmid in 10 μl 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.5]) was added to 1 ml of cells, gently mixed, and incubated for 1 hour without agitation at 30oC with illumination.
Cells were spread on 50-ml BG-11 agar plates (0.1 ml per plate) and incubated under illumination for 2 days at 30°C. At this stage, the appropriate selective agent (kanamycin) was added by lifting the agar slab with an ethanol-flamed spatula and dispensing 50 μl of a solution containing kanamycin (10 mg ml−1) underneath. After 14 days, transformant colonies were isolated and purified by restreaking three times in the presence of antibiotics as above.

OUC-China,2017,Team:OUC-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,". When we carried out the experiment, we met the problem that there are different incubation conditions in different paper.  So we had to explore the best culture condition for the INP-mSA protein expression. Firstly, We did two sets of experiments to compare the fluorescence values of 2h incubation under two temperatures ( 0 ℃ and 30 ℃, 0℃ means incubate on ice.)
Fig 2.4 Expression level of INP-mSA fusion protein under different conditions.( I )  the single cell fluorescence values from E.coli DH5α cell expressing JIM fusion and DH5α without a plasmid under 0 ℃  incu-bation for 2h. ( II ) the fluorescence values of E.coli DH5α cell expressing JIM fusion and DH5α under 30 ℃.
The image showed that E. coli containing the Jim plasmid successfully expressed INP-MSA fusion protein. The fluorescence value increased after 2 hours incubation under 30 ℃ conditions. We speculate that there may be an ice dye incubation that causes ice nucleation proteins to form crystals that inhibit the combination of fluorescent dyes and the mSA of fusion proteins. [2]
Yeast strain construction
Here we need to construct the vector of BirA (biotin ligase) and BAP (biotin acceptor peptide) in yeast for displaying biotin on the surface.(fig.1)
We first cloned birA into the yeast-shuttle plasmid pYC230. After transformation, it enables the yeast to transfer biotin to biotin acceptor peptide（BAP);  pYD1 is another 5.0 Kbp expression circuit designed for expression, secretion, and display of proteins on the extracel-lular surface of S.cerevisiae. The vector contains AGA2 gene from S.cerevisiae encoding one subunit of the a-agglutinin receptor. By fusing our gene of interest to AGA2, so we can enable the yeast to display the biotin on the cell surface.
After successful construction of plasmids, we introduced pYD1 containing BAP and pYC230 containing Bira into S.cerevisiae EBY100.
Protein expression verification
We want to test whether biotinylated BAP is successfully integrated in the yeast cell wall. So, we dyed engineered yeast and negative control respectively with FITC-streptavidin. Using fluorescent microscopy, we are able to observe the fluorescence of both"

68C and 72C are the preferred annealing temperatures.  It seems as though the desired product is present, but it is smeared.  The non-specific band appears lower than 250bp, so it may be different than the non-specific bands previously.
The 68C, ad 72C bands were cut out from the gel, and kept in the -20C.

Volume strategy is a special method to solve problems introduced by diffusion reactions. Consider a transport reaction S1->S2 in which the species S1 is moved from the first compartment with volume V1, to the second with volume V2. The rate constant is k but the rate law is not k*[S1]*V1, because the concentration conversion is needed. The correct expression is N*k*[S1]*V1. The volume strategy just uses N*V1 instead of V1 as the volume of the first compartment. To have a general definition, the volume of a compartment is defined as V*N1*N2, where:
V is the volume of the compartment itself;
N1 is the number of compartments located in its outside compartment;
N2 is the total number of its outside compartment
Chain Sorting and Weighting Scheme
Chains in our Chain-Node model should not have any order since there are no natural ways to sort them. One chain is not preferred to another, since in a complex of multiple chains, which are connected via binding interaction of binding bites on their own, all chains are equivalent. However, a chain-sorting program is a prerequisite for implementations of many other functions, such as comparison of two Chain-Node structures, or pattern matching of template species to those in the system.
Sorting is always performed under some rules. Since there are no natural options, we design one to generate the unique order for a list of chains. The rule we developed is something like that for comparing two strings: compare the first part of two chains by their partReference and partType in alphabet order and if equal, then compare the next until there are differences or to the end of either chain. At this stage, besides partReference and partType, two parts are considered equal if both are in bound states or not. There are some exceptions for DNA molecule: since dsDNA has both forward and reverse directions, comparison between its forward and reverse chain is also needed.
If all chains are different in the first stage of sorting, we have already obtain the unique order of the chain list. However, it is not always so: equal chains in the above sorting may be equivalent or not. It is due to the assumption that two bound parts are taken as equal if both have same partReferenceand partType attribute values. Though the above sorting strategy takes binding positions into consideration, it ignores the binding details of those"

Several circuits have been proposed, constructed, and implemented, leading to landmark discoveries in synthetic biology. These include systems such as the bi-stable toggle switch, and the repressilator, which brought about a paradigm shift in the field. Since then, several systems have been constructed to employ memory modules, create counters, adders, digital biosensors, and a whole wide range of other products.
Figure – A brief timeline of major notable events in the creation and development of synthetic biology (Source: Del Vecchio, Domitilla et al, Journal of The Royal Society Interface 13.120 (2016): 20160380.)
However, there are several limitations that still need to be overcome, as the field continues to make strides in every area. These involve the fact that biological systems have a lot of noises that cannot be modeled accurately to date, and the fact that metabolic burden is a major issue. Along these lines, one of the central issues is the distinct lack of digital responses in synthetic biology.
Thus, as described in the project overview, we wished to use the high cooperativity TetR homologs in such a manner so as to generate a square wave oscillator circuit. Such a system could have a whole multitude of applications; some of which were mentioned briefly in the overview, and the same are also discussed below,

The potential of genetic clock lies in its role to triggering logic reaction for sequential biological circuits. A square wave generator could be used as a genetic clock, since square waves lie at the heart of clocks. Further, these clocks could be"

This is a very large gene (1,818 nucleotides, native sequence). Both the nuclease part (BBa_K1792004) and dextranase part (BBa_K1792002) include a T7 promoter, which is IPTG inducible to get maximum yield of protein. The promoters and RBS are also selected for greatest yield of protein when induced. These proteins contain a N-terminal bacterial secretion tag. Which allows the proteins to be exported from cells and easily separated by centrifugation. The proteins also contain a 6X histidine tag for possible downstream purification and concentration via affinity chromatography (if necessary). Stop codons take care of the protein termination for both the nuclease and dextranase. There is a double terminator on the nuclease construct to stop mRNA production after the gene of interest is translated. The dextranase construct was very large, so to minimize part size a terminator element was not included. As a result, dextranase mRNA synthesis will continue until the transcription complex falls off.

The project focuses on the detection of NT-proBNP as a means to diagnose heart failure. However, what’s more important is the amount of NT-proBNP present in the serum. I would recommend both qualitative and quantitative assessment. It would be great if the HAPPI could support a quick diagnosis. Then, HAPPI surely will affect heart failure mortality rate positively. Nonetheless, a potential drawback is that countries with inadequate infrastructure have no potential for huge investment and will not be able to adopt HAPPI into their medical infrastructure.
U-healthcare system-adopted heart failure diagnosis, which is the ultimate goal, will definitely benefit the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure. Heart failure is not a condition whose symptoms are evident. U-healthcare system will allow convenient detection of the condition at its initial stage and will be beneficial, but the meaningful criteria need to be considered in the patient’s mortality. If released in the future, the HAPPI would be beneficial to first-line medical care, i.e. emergency patients, emergency medical services (EMS), and novice paramedics.
In my opinion, the project will be meaningful if the development of the HAPPI is feasible.
What we learned
Professor Jong-Wha Lee gave us great advices on the practical aspects of our project. Rather than just focusing on the beneficial aspects, he also shared his opinion on the weak aspects of our project. Our team realized some important clinical aspects, such as the practical utility of the fabricated chip and the importance of quantitative detection of the NT-proBNP as well as qualitiative assessment, because normal people also have it somewhat. Furthermore, we perceived that the development of a low cost biosensor  that can be used for early diagnosis and monitoring of heart failure disease is important. As a result, we have tried to apply a simple and low-cost fabrication method for a small chip by using plastic substrates that are very cheap and the GBP-ProG fusion protein we have developled in this study. We also confirmed that our project is very helpful to many people suffering from heart failure disease.

ADD small Phage project overview
The mission of Brigham Young University--founded, supported, and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life. That assistance should provide a period of intensive learning in a stimulating setting where a commitment to excellence is expected and the full realization of human potential is pursued.
All instruction, programs, and services at BYU, including a wide variety of extracurricular experiences, should make their own contribution toward the balanced development of the total person. Such a broadly prepared individual will not only be capable of meeting personal challenge and change but will also bring strength to others in the tasks of home and family life, social relationships, civic duty, and service to mankind.
.....
In meeting these objectives BYU's faculty, staff, students, and administrators should be anxious to make their service and scholarship available to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in furthering its work worldwide. In an era of limited enrollments, BYU can continue to expand its influence both by encouraging programs that are central to the Church's purposes and by making its resources available to the Church when called upon to do so.
We believe the earnest pursuit of this institutional mission can have a strong effect on the course of higher education and will greatly enlarge Brigham Young University's influence in a world we wish to improve.

I’m learning a lot thanks to all the amazing (and crazy) people I’ve met during this experience. By the end of september, I should be an expert at micropipetting!

I'm a Masters student with a background in Physics, Chemistry, Computational Sciences (little biology), but have learnt a lot of Biology during my work for iGEM. What attracts me to iGEM is the design and the human practices, which is so different from the ""boring"" (haha) normal lab science. I basically managed all the different projects in the team, and was also involved deeply in the design thinking, human practices, mathematical modeling and conceptualizing ideas, and loved it all. But the hectic summer took me off my love of sports, and I'm not complaining a lot. It was worth it :)

BiMaTox consist of an aptazyme that is contained in a cell-free cellulose matrix device. The aptazyme, as it was said previously in the overview, is composed by the aptamer and the DNAzyme, but to bind both parts a linker sequence is needed. It is important to mention that the aptazyme is a ssDNA molecule.
Our Aptazyme's parts
DNAzyme HRP like
There are many types of DNAzyme, the one we chose is a sequence previously described and used in diverse systems with a described and proven activity that is supported by the literature.
The sequence that we used is known as G-Cuadruplex. This sequence has two functions it works at the same time as NADH oxidasa  and also it posses peroxidase activity that mimics the one found in horse radish. The reaction causes the oxidation of ABTS molecule which generates a change colour  showing green. This only happens if there is enough concentration of STX in the solution.
The Aptamer
We used an Aptamer previously described by a group of scientist in the year 2015. The group lead by X. Zheng improved an existing aptamer that could bind to STX via SELEX and finally obtained a variety of this sequence that they called M30-f, in our project we based our molecular construct in this aptamer.
Linker
The linker is a fundamental part because as it binds specific zones of the Aptazyme it acts as a kidnapper of the catalytic zone of the molecule. When the aptamer is not interacting with the ligand, the linker is kidnapping the DNAzyme, altering the conformation of the DNAzyme. Then as the aptamer interacts with the ligand, a conformational change takes place in the molecule, this conformational change promotes the movement of the linker from the original place, and in consequence, the DNAzyme is released; only when this occurs the DNAzyme can take the catalytic conformation and can catalyze the reaction.
To  the linker we used a program called J.A.W.S. This program was created by the Heidelberg iGEM team from 2015 for more information about the program visit the following link:

All the work was done by students : wiki design , fundraising , policy and practices as all the cakes shown on social networks :) .  In order to be more efficient, we decided to divide the work in little teams. We recieved however, a lot of help all throughout the year. First, we want to thank the European Institute of Chemistry and Biology for hosting us all the year and during our internships. Denis DUPUY, our supervisor who gives us many judicious advices and Jonathan MILLET who succeeded to coexist with many team members of iGEM Bordeaux during all this summer. Our team had to use several machines which not belong to our lab. That’s why we had to collaborate many times with the neighbor labs. We hope that they enjoyed our cake as gift. ;)

Grenoble-Alpes,2018,Team:Grenoble-Alpes#events_-_-_TEXT.html," on the project, which led us to continue in the same direction
tried to think about a multiple uses of the system
IGEM SPANISH MEET-UP
From Saturday 18th to Monday 20th of August, Lucas went to Barcelona for the Spanish meet-up organized by iGEM UPF-CRG-Barcelona. Grenoble-Alpes was the only French team there!
This meet-up allowed us to meet all the Spanish teams except from Valencia (which makes two teams from Barcelona, one from Madrid and one from Navarre). Each team did a Jamboree-like presentation. Feedbacks have been produced on the presentations. Speakers came to talk about the evolution of synthetic biology, ethics and bacterial microfilms.
Thanks to the iGEM Navarra BG team, our project has been featured in Spanish press articles.
LOCAL EVENTS
FORUM BIOTECH
For the 21st edition of the Biotechnology Forum of Auvergne Rhône-Alpes, iGEM Grenoble was invited to present phage therapy and its project to biotechnologies professionals. Romy, a former member of iGEM Grenoble 2017, helped us to organize this event.
FRENCH-AMERICAN WORKSHOP
Thanks to our proximity with the GIANT campus, we had the chance to mingle with foreigners postdoctoral researchers  who showed a great interest in our project. It was also a real pleasure to meet Minh-Hà PHAM, Counselor for Science and Technology at the Embassy of France in the United States, who incites us to continue our efforts.
UGA C'EST PARTY!
On the 12th and 13th of September, we welcomed new students from Grenoble-Alpes University and Grenoble INP Network. The goal was to make the association and the competition known to encourage vocations for the next years. We also had the opportunity to meet teachers, researchers and volunteers from the university community who were able to help us for the visibility and the construction of our Phagyzer project. 40 people were willing to take part in the competition next year.
UNIVERSITE D'ETE SOLIDAIRE
With iGEM EPFL Swiss team, we attended workshops about ethical reflection on synthetic biology at a summer university (called université d’été solidaire in French) in Grenoble on Thursday, August 23rd. The iGEM EPFL team produced a film in which the day's progress appears.
We met with associations, seeking to make citizens aware of new advances in research and to participate in research budget votes and research legislation"

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook-N_-_-_TEXT.html," use a technique to measure the weight of an object using a coat hanger, and depending on weight, calculate the amount of lactose inside that container. This would be the dairy that the people have on hand. Depending on weight, we will have a chart that says how much lactose is in that container. The people will be guided to portion a certain amount of the lactose into an ice-cube-like container and grow the yeast in there. Because there will be a specific amount of lactose in each section, and our promoters are sensitive to galactose, our yeast will stop producing progesterone after it consumes all of the lactose.
We have found multiple ways to insert our genes into Y.lipolytica and we made pros and cons lists for each method to decide which one would be the most effective and time-efficient. The methods are regular homologous recombination using homologous arms on our plasmid, EasyCloneYALI: CRISPR/Cas9‐based technique for engineering Y.lipolytica specifically, and Drag and Drop cloning.

We confirmed that using a constitutive promoter would be better than an inducible one, at least initially, because it will use up energy to keep producing progesterone after the growth media has been consumed. Our website has gone through several prototype designs, but it seems like we may be getting close to a final design we would like to use to represent our work. One fun feature that is a work in progress is an interactive map that will, when moused over, provide information about different countries and our outreach there. We have also been working on finalizing our logo, which will include the name of our project: PoPPY. PoPPY stands for Portable Progesterone Production in Yeast, an accurate description of the goal of our project. A low this week for the team was realizing that most of the survey responses received from one of the groups we reached out to about contraceptive accessibility were unreliable, since many answers between supposedly different women were the exact same, word for word. However, we hope that this was a problem specific to the group, and not the norm. We have some more legitimate groups who are willing to send us photos of the women filling out the surveys, and we hope to see good results.

Freiburg,2011,Team:Freiburg#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," bound Coomassie dye is 595nm. The absorbance is proportional with the amount of bound dye. With a series of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) measurements the exact protein concentration of the samples can be determined. BSA acts like a “marker” because the concentration of BSA is known and with a linear calibration line the exact protein concentration can be detected.
The values of the fluorescence intensity of RFP and GFP deviate from the expected values. We´ve expected PR1 to have the strongest GFP/RFP signal and PR6 with the lowest GFP/RFP signal. The data shows the differences. We could not repeat this measurement another time because of lack of time. We could not measure PR1-GFP because the sequencing was negative and there was no time for repeating. The measurement of PR3-RFP was an error and was excluded.
PR-GFP
GFP fluorescence intensity dependent on the strenght of promoter and RBS.
GFP served as a reporter of expression. We wanted to know how strong the promoter and RBS activity is. With this reporter gene it was possible to analyze the expression via plate reader. GFP is excited at a wavelength of 509nm and has an emission of 520nm. The plate reader illuminates the samples with a high energy xenon flash lamp. Optical filters or monochromator create the exact wavelength. The more GFP in the sample the higher is the GFP fluorescence intensity. The intensity is collected with the second optical system and is detected with a side window photomultiplier tube.

Validation
1.Training of the built-in weight for the algorithm including only the information from the websites
For the biobricks (parts and devices) in the database, we give them a score based on their 12 features. We transform the values of feature into values between 0 and 1, and give each feature a weight. In order to set up a appropriate weight for each feature, we choose 40 parts or devices with high values of features as positive samples and choose 40 parts or devices with low values of features as negative samples. Then we change the weight of one feature and fix others to expand the gap between the average of positive samples' score and the average of negative samples' score. By this way, we adjust the weight of each feature to improve the accuracy of distinguishing the great and poor biobricks.
Using the above method, we find several important features that should have higher weights than others. On the other hand, we give each feature an appropriate weight in consideration of their effects on researches.
2.Adjust the score from devices scoring method to get close to the method based on biobrick features
For the devices that are not in our database, we score them based on the score of their parts and the score of the connecting between their parts. In order to prove the validity of this algorithm, we choose 24 devices with high score (score>55) in the database as positive samples and choose 18 devices with low score (score<20) in the database as negative samples. Then we use this algorithm to score the positive samples and negative samples. In order to improve the accuracy of algorithm's prediction and balance the error rate of the prediction of two groups, we regard the devices with score beyond 55 as great devices and regard the devices with score below 30 as poor devices. For the devices with score between 30 and 55, our algorithm can not exactly tell you whether they are great devices or not. By that standard, the accuracy of the algorithm's prediction of positive samples and negative samples are 58.3% and 55.6%. For all samples, the accuracy of the algorithm's prediction is 57.1%.
3.The practical application of our algorithm

Biolector M2P-Labs
Of each of the three constructs #1 was tested once, #2 was tested 3 times, and #3 was tested 5 times for GFP expression on the Biolector. The Biolector is a plate based reader that can simulate optimal growth conditions with temperature, shaking, and humidity control while measuring absorbance and fluorescence for measureable GFP and Biomass readings. E. coli transformants with BBa_733018 in the pSB1C3 plasmid were grown in 1.5 mL of liquid LB media with 6 ug/mL chloramphenicol (CAM) with or without 1% Xylose to release the XylR and induce GFP transcription and translation.
Protocol:
Measure the OD600 of overnight cultures of transformants grown in LB media with 6 ug/mL chloramphenicol in order to prepare a dilution scheme so all samples have an initial OD600 of 0.1
Prepare LB media with 7.5 ug/mL chloramphenicol. Take 100 mL of that sample and add 1.25 g of xylose to prepare a 1.25% xylose stock of LB media with 7.5 ug/mL of CAM.
Dilute overnight cultures in sterile deionized H2O so that with a 1.25x dilution they will have an OD600 of 0.1.
Transfer 1.2 mL of LB media with CAM +/- xylose to a 48 well Biolector flowerplate and add 300 uL of diluted overnight cultures. Assay was prepared in triplicate with a negative control
Cover Biolector plate with a gas permeable seal and place in Biolector chamber with an incubation temperature of 37°C, shaking at 1000 RPM, humidity at 95%, O2 at 20.95%, Biomass absorbance at 620 nm, and GFP filter with fluorescence excitation at 488 nm and measurement at 520 nm. Measurements were taken every 10 minutes for up to 15 hours.
Results
All transformants were tested in triplicate and the standard deviation is included in the error bars on the graph. The absorbance readings were averaged and corrected for background by subtracting the values of the media only samples. It is interesting to note that all samples grown in 1% xylose had a higher amount of biomass and indicates that E. coli can use it as a nutrient source.

On the next pages we are going to present you our BioBrick work.
One approach of our project was to visualize a readout by a light emitting system. So a luciferase BioBrick was built. This BioBrick is a highly sensitive reporter gene which was successfully applied in different devices with a PoPS output. The characterization of this BioBrick can be found here .
The second step was to establish a complete VirA/G signaling system from Agrobacterium tumefaciens in Escherichia coli. For this purpose three new BioBricks were created - virA, virG and a vir promoter. The VirA receptor recognizes the phenolic substance acetosyringone and transmits this information to the VirG response regulator - a bacterial transcription factor which activates vir promoters. This natural VirA/G signaling system works in E. coli and was measured and characterized by using the reporter genes mRFP and luciferase .
In the third step we tried to modify the VirA receptor by directed mutagenesis using error-prone PCR, in order to detect substances other than acetosyringone (e.g. capsaicin). For that purpose we designed a high-throughput screening system with a selective system based on the expression of a kanamycin resistance. We tried to modify the receptor by different modification strategies like error prone (random mutagenesis) or specific amino acid changes ( mut1 / mut2 )."
Edinburgh_OG,2017,Team:Edinburgh OG#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins are a component of the bacterial adaptive immune system, providing protection against foreign DNA such as that from bacteriophages (Qi et al., 2014).
The CRISPR array contains palindromic DNA repeat sequences which flank ‘spacers’ – regions of DNA which have been associated with foreign bacteriophage DNA (Barrangou et al., 2007). The array becomes transcribed into mRNA     to produce ‘guide RNA’ (gRNA), which is associated with an endonuclease such as Cas9 (Bikard et al., 2012). If DNA containing the homologous sequence to the spacer (referred to as a ‘protospacer’, normally 20-30 nt)     appears in the cell, the gRNA will guide the Cas9 to the foreign DNA and bind to the complementary site. The Cas9 will then cleave and destroy the foreign DNA if there is a 2-6 bp protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence next to the protospacer site (Figure 3)     (Barrangou et al., 2007). Spacers can be engineered to target almost any part of the genome - including antibiotic resistance genes.
Somewhat ironically, CRISPR systems targeting antibiotic resistance genes have been recently integrated into lysogenic bacteriophages. When the engineered phage genome is injected into the host, the CRISPR system becomes active and will target the desired     genes. Studies by Citorik et al. (2014) and Bikard et al. (2014) successfully demonstrated the use of this system to re-sensitise pathogens to antibiotics by cleaving plasmid-mediated resistance genes. One weakness of this single-phage     system is that any bacteria that are resistant to the lysogenic phage will have a selective advantage over their re-sensitised counterparts. Antibiotic treatment will result in the phage-resistant bacteria becoming dominant in the population, in the     same manner as antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
To overcome this selection pressure for resistance, Yosef et al. (2015) developed a dual phage system. After the initial re-sensitisation by the lysogenic CRISPR-containing phage, the bacteria are then exposed to a lytic phage. This lytic phage     is engineered to contain the same resistance gene protospacers that are targeted by the CRISPR system, meaning that any bacteria that have been successfully re-sensitised will also be immune to infection by the lytic phage.

(Figure 2-2A) Then we mixed PAN-S and TritonX-100 by 1:20 mass ratio, and added ddH2O for thorough dissolving to get the final working solution, TritonX-100-PAN-S (TPS), with bright orange color. (Figure 2-2B)
Secondly, we conducted the characterization for our self-synthesized water-soluble metal indicator with expected colorimetric selectivity for heavy metals. We started with pH and metal concentration titration. By adding TPS into different pH solution at different mercury concentration, we found the proper color transition point at pH=~8. The lower limit of metal concentration for color transition was 0.8×10-5M. The color of solution changed from bright yellow to rosy color. (Figure 2-3)
Thirdly, we used our characterized indicator for direct visualization of mercury detoxification process. We constructed an integrated plasmid consisting of a constitutive promoter and metal binding peptides localized at different cell compartments. After transformation and overnight culturing, the bacteria were used to treat sample solution with 10-5M mercury and TPS at 37℃ for 10 min. The result was intriguing. Evident distinction could be observed between experiment group and control groups, which indicated the high efficacy of our bioabsorbent. (Figure 2-4)
For quantitative evaluation, we used inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) to precisely measure the different concentration of heavy metal before and after the treatment of bioabsorbent.
We constructed several plasmids for different localization of metal binding peptides and transformed them into BL21 (DE3) for expression, respectively. After approximately 40 hours of induction at the presence of different concentration of heavy metals, we collected the bacteria, washed with ddH2O for several times, and freeze-dried the pellet overnight before precise measuring their dry weights. Then we performed microwave digestion to completely dissolve all metal ions into solution before ICP-AES measurements. (Figure 2-5A, B)
The results are shown in the following figures:
These four parts are tested with the mercury concentration of 10^-5M to compare with each other, with the results shown in figure 4. It is necessary to point that that the device consisting of the three subparts seems to be less efficient than that of the surface display part Lpp-OmpA-MBP but it is better than the MBP in the"

CTRL0, CTRL2 and CTRL5 are E. coli K-12 MG1655 PRO ΔcsgA ompR234 cells with pSB1C3, used as a control. MFP50, MFP52 and MFP55 are E. coli K-12 MG1655 PRO ΔcsgA ompR234 cells expressing a plasmid that contains csgA attached to the mfp5 peptide under an inducible promoter. The termination 0, 2 and 5 denote the induction with no rhamnose (0), 0.2% w/v (2) and 0.5% w/v (5).
As we also observed in the crystal violet assay for the plasmid containing the csgA gene, the sample that can also express RFP as a reporter gene is also able to make a biofilm. That confirms that this strain can be used for the experiments of characterization of the 3D printing, as the reporter gene expression is not interfering in the biofilm-making ability.
On the other hand, the tagged CsgA proteins seem to have biofilm-making capability despite having a peptidic modification in the structure. To confirm that there is a real change between the analysed samples and the empty plasmid control, a significance analysis was performed for α=0.05 (Table 8.).
Table 8. Significance analysis of the samples analysed, with a significance α value of 5%. All the samples but the 0.5% induction of CSGARFP5 display a significant difference when compared to the empty plasmid homolog sample (CTRL).
The significance analysis shows how all the samples with a modified CsgA can efficiently create a biofilm, when compared with an empty plasmid control (i.e. without csgA expression). The sample with CsgA and RFP as reporter gene, when induced with 0.5% w/v of rhamnose, shows no significant difference with an alpha value of 0.05. However, if"

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.

Full system, proof on paper under construction…
We prepared the nitrocellulose strips, functionalized with the aptamers.                                 This experiment was done very late in the project (October 10th, 2016).                                 Unfortunately the latex beads could not migrate easily enough on the nitrocellulose tested.                                 We concluded that larger pore size were required. Although we ordered a more appropriate support,                                 it did not arrive in time to complete our experiments… So close to our goal !
Conclusion: We have proven that beads coated with aptamers are able to recognize their target in a sandwich assay.                                 A fixation of the beads on the support occurs. This detection system works.

Part 1 Streptavidin-CBDs purification on cellulose
Two modified proteins to bind cellulose were used.                                 A streptavidin-CBD (cellulose-binding domain) from the 2014 iGEM Stanford-Brown-Spelman team ( BBa_K1934020) and a streptavidin-CiPA                                 (a different kind of cellulose binding domain) produced thanks to our BBa_K1934010 part .                                 To visually follow the process, a RFP-CBD generator was build ( BBa_1934000 ).
Crude cell lysates were loaded on a cellulose column for affinity purification.                                 Unbound proteins were washed with water before elution of purified streptavidin-CBDs proteins.                                 Proteins with Cellulose Binding Domains (CBDs) stick to the cellulose until elution.                                 Streptavidin-CipA sticks better than Stanford’s existing part (compare green and blue curves). See figure 8 below.
Fig.8 CBDs confer ability to bind cellulose: demonstration on chromatography affinity column. The protein purification process was followed by measuring OD280 of the collected fractions.                                     Fraction 8 containing the majority of purified proteins was collected for further testing. The control was made with NM522 crude lysate.
Part 2 Streptavidin-CBDs both links cellulose and functionalized aptamer
The  affinity to cellulose of streptavidin-CBDs encoded by BBa_K1934020 and streptavidin-CiPA BBa_K1934030 were compared to the one of commercial streptavidin.                                 A molecule of fluorescein was grafted at the 5’ end of a DNA oligo carrying a molecule of biotin at its "
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2014,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Notebook#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," they are injected into the blood stream. It would also be problematic if these E. coli strains make contact with the eyes. Oral exposition could change the bacterial population in the gut by delivering new DNA features. Lab safety training included safe handling regulations, mandatory lab coats and eye protection equipment during the work with bacteria.
The definition of biosafety level 1 says that there is no risk according to the current scientific knowledge if everything is done properly. The usage of safe E. coli strains should prevent any risks for the general public. DNA molecules from our strains could be transferred into other bacteria if genetically modified organisms escape the lab. The biggest problems are the antibiotic resistances, because they could be transferred to human pathogenic species. The impact of this problem is reduced by the fact that all resistance genes are already out there. Our lab safety trainings also included instructions on waste disposal requirements for normal and hazardous lab material as well as biologicals or lab materials contaminated by biologicals. All genetically engineered strains and material contaminated with such organisms require sterilization by autoclaving. Afterwards the sterilized material is subjected to garbage incineration. Special decontamination rules regulate hazardous chemicals and materials contaminated with such. The proper disposal of these is handled by the Department of Chemistry at our university. It would be possible to combine all our antibiotic resistances in one pathogenic organism to use it for bioterrorism purposes. We think, that the specific parts and constructs of our project and all possible combinations of these do not have an increased potential for malicious miss-use.
There are several levels of security measures. First of all, there is a personalized electronic access system for all labs, allowing a fine-grained restriction of access and a tracking of all access activities by the authorities of Bielefeld University.
In addition, the mandatory lab safety trainings and the continuous surveillance of measures provides the second level of safety regulation. Next, there is the need for a detailed documentation of all experimental work, including all levels of accidents. Last but not least, an atmosphere of responsible planning and conduct is pursued by all scientists, including the instructors and supervisors of the iGEM projects.
Risks of Our Project in the Future
The single parts of our project are in our opinion almost free of risks. This is implied by their biosafety level classification. We do not expect them to interact in a way which could increase these risks or provide unforseeable ones. As stated above, we are planning to develop inbuilt safety systems, instantly killing the strain upon release from its containment. In addition, the last years iGEM team had started to develop an antibiotics-free selection"
Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,"ICO has a number of projects: [for example] the trachoma elimination program which is funded by the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust and we have the low vision program where we do mass screenings at primary and secondary schools and provide glasses for those students who are visually impaired. At BICO I work as a personal assistant for Prof. Kalua but I also do data management and ICT (information and communications technology). So I am going to talk a lot on how we manage our data.                                 […] I should say that previously we’ve been capturing all the trachoma data on hard copies but that way it was hard to keep all the questionnaires, to track them, to do analysis. […] So in 2015 we moved again to
Open Data Kit
, which involves capturing and collection of data through electronic questionnaires and the data is stored on a cloud server. Everyone can easily access it as long as they have the rights. We developed our own cloud server for BICO. Then we moved all our hard copy questionnaires onto the server. So whenever we want to go to the field to do research or data collection, we get the questionnaires from the server onto a phone and use apps to access it, which are either Task force Tropical Data or Task Force LINKS .                                 […] For the trachoma elimination programs there are a number of things that we are doing: There is mass drug administration. We administer azithromycin, the trachoma drug.

Daniel C.:
…which is an epidemic region?
Salomi:
Yes. [And] We also have trachoma trichiasis surgeries happen. So we have some questionnaire to capture the data for the trachoma trichiasis patients. The whole process starts with screening, trachoma trichiasis verification and then the actual operation. For all those processes we have questionnaires […].
Daniel C.:
What about your trachoma mapping efforts?
Salomi:
We do mapping in Mangochi . We had a baseline survey and we will have another mass drug administration in this district because it was confirmed to be a hotspot.
Daniel C.:
Who goes out into the field and does the actual mapping?

Further work has gone into developing the buttons, having now written the code for hit testing the clicks on the button. This code is a little buggy but will be improved as the program is progressed. Started to create the sub-menu that will appear when the ""Install BioBrick"" button is clicked. Currently this is just a blue box that will eventually contain a list of installable BioBricks.

HBsu-(x)FP BioBrick Extraction
Aims:
Please refer to August 6th
Methods:
Continued protocol from August 6th
Using the QIAgen Mini-Prep protocol we extracted the HBsu-RFP & HBsu-GFP BioBricks from the E. coli. We checked the concentration & quality of the plasmid using a spectophotometer .
Results:
The DNA concentration reading was the following
HBsu-GFP: 67.5 ng/μl HBsu-RFP: 55.5 ng/μl
This is of good quality and will be used for cloning in the pSB1C3 plasmid on the same day.
Coloning HBsu-(x)FP BioBrick into psB1C3 Plasmid
Aim:
Clone the HBsu(x)FP BioBrick into pSB1C3 so it can be submitted to the repository.
Methods:
The HBsu-(x)FP BioBrick and the linearised pSB1C3 plasmid was cut using EcoRI and PstI. We then attempted to purify the BioBrick using the gel extraction protocol
Results:
No bands were found after we have conducted the protocol. The protocol will be repeated on the next day.

After the addition of L-alanine to the solution, which would supposedly initiate germination, the solution was left in the incubator for 10 minutes
After 10 minutes, the eppendorf tube containing the solution was spinned down for approximately 1 minute.
Note: Fill another eppendorf tube with water and put it on the opposite site to balance out the weight.
The supernatant was removed from the eppendorf tube and the spores were resuspended in 1000ul of LB solution.
Note
The team faced difficulties in resuspending the spores.
The serial dilutions.
A serial dilution was performed as illustrated below, and 50ul of each solution was plated out using glass beads on LB + Cm plates.
In addition, 5ul of the cwlD spores were plated out using glass beads on LB + Cm plates. No colonies should grow on this plate as the spores were not treated.
Results
The following pictures shows the results for the recovery of the cwlD spores.
As mentioned, due to previous calculation errors, only 4ul of stock lysozyme was added to a ml of buffer solution in this experiment. A volume of 40ml of stock lysozyme should have been added instead.  As lysozyme is added to disrupt the bacterial cell wall, 4ul may not have been sufficient, resulting in no or few colonies growing on the plates, as seen in the pictures below. The experiment was performed again on Monday, 17th August . See Monday, 17th August for more details.
In this plate, 5ul of spores were directly plated on without going through any treatment to see if any colonies grew.
cwlD mutant plate, without treatment.
The spores in this plate were not diluted, thus it is expected that the number of colonies growing in this plate would be greater than the other plates.
cwlD mutant plate, concentration = 1
Only one colony is seen growing on this plate, where a 1 time dilution was performed.
cwlD mutant plate, concentration = 10-1
As can been seen in the following pictures, starting from the 2 times dilution onwards, no colonies can be seen growing.
cwlD mutant plate, concentration = 10-2
cwlD mutant plate, concentration = 10-3
cwlD mutant plate, concentration = 10-4

SDM transformations (Lab Journal lab journal Methylation ) and triple transformations were successful. When the plates were inspected under the fluorescence binoculars, several eYFP positive colonies could be identified that weren’t RFP positive. This indicated that these bacteria contained all 3 plasmids, and weren’t antibiotic resistant due to self ligation events of the linearized vector backbone used on 11/10/18 .
2 colonies were picked and inoculated in 5 ml LB with ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol. The selection of colonies was based on increased YFP expression and low RFP expression (background plasmid signal).

Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," to inoculate the new PREDCEL culture. The phage reproduction worked well, a titer of 1*10^10 could be achieved. This could then be used to inoculate the new PREDCEL culture in order to repeat the whole process. The outcome was checked by plaque assay afterwards. The plaque assay worked well this time, but no significant difference between caffeine (in different concentrations) and no caffeine could be detected. So we came to the conclusion, that in order to meassure the CYP1A2 activity another assay has to be planned.
Furhtermore, the first PREDCEL run with passaging was conducted (in triplicates, and 100 �M and 1000 �M theophylline were used). As most of the reproduced phages were used up for this experiment, new phages had to be reproduced again. The titer was then checked by plaque assay as well as the outcome of the PRDCEL run. Checking all triplicates from all sample timepoints would have been to laborious for a frist check, so only the first, the second and the last time point were checked by plaque assay. There one could see, that the last timepoint did not show plaques, which indicates that the five passages could not be conducted successfully. Nevertheless, some of the passages might be successful and the samples inbetween the second and the last timepoint were checked by plaque assay afterwards.
2. Transformmation: Previously electrocompetent cells containing the AP and all three ORI variants have been generated. Those were now transformed with the expression plasmid containing the CYP1A2 gene (which was used in further testings before). Right after recovering the transformed cells, they were plated on LB-chloramphenicol- ampicillin-plates.
All three variants could be successfully transformed and colonies were picked respectively in order to produce glycerol stocks. The next day an experiment was started to check for the CYP1A2's correct tertiary structure. To do so, growths have been inoculated from the glycerol stocks and the cells containing the CYP1A2 were then lysed by ultrasonic waves and centrifuged. Then 50 �l Disodiumdithionide (10 mg/ml) were added to 700 �l of the supernatant. The Disodiumdithionide reduces the heme group, which is essential for the catalytic activity of the CYP1A2. The heme group can only be bound, when the proper three dimensional structure of the C"

Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Notebook#EvanNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,", we worked with E. coli to make them turn different colours under light and we also tested the strength/effectiveness of different plasmids. We finished up by creating a ""genomic circuit"" using a breadboard; I'd never used a breadboard before, and I had a lot of fun. It made me excited for the machine organization course that I'm taking in the fall at Wellesley. At the end of the day, the team went to a hole-in-the-wall cafe called Life Alive and got delicious smoothies to combat the 95-degree weather.
Fri, May 31: It was Wellesley's Commencement today, so most of us took the day off to see the class of 2013 graduate. Despite the scorching heat, the ceremony was beautiful; the commencement speaker was Valerie Jarrett, senior advisor to President Barack Obama and chair of the White House Council on Women and Girls. She reminded us to be flexible and resilient and to pace ourselves and feel free to ask for help. In addition, the HCI lab/our iGEM team's faculty advisor, Orit Shaer, received the Pinanski Prize for Teaching Excellence!! Commencement was a bit emotional for me, because so many of my friends from the Ultimate Frisbee team were seniors this year. I'll miss them (in fact, I already do), but I also can't wait to see the amazing things that they'll all undoubtedly go on to accomplish.
Week 2: June 3 - June 7
My team's circuit
Mon, June 3: Today, our team again ventured out into the city to meet with our BU team counterparts at the BU Photonics building. After general introductions, they gave us a brief overview of synthetic biology as a discipline and some of their work in the lab. Afterwards, we learned Eugene , a programming language developed specifically for synthetic biologists. We were divided up into groups and given different circuits to model using Eugene. It was actually quite difficult; Eugene is an object-oriented language similar to Java, which I'm very familiar with thanks to Wellesley's CS department, but there was some Eugene-specific syntax that was a bit hard to grasp. Although the language does a good job of capturing many of the rules that need to be defined for genetic devices, there were still some things that were hard to define: things like ""threshold"". For example, for my group's circuit (shown on the right), the P-lambda promoter can either be repressed or induced, depending on the amount of cI present. This, in particular"

We made a mockup to a modelling database . This database should help other teams with their modelling and ideally it should be included to the Registry, in order to make a ""Registry of Modelling"". One of the major time consumptions during this kind of modeling is finding rate equations and searching for parameters. This time consuming process reoccurs each year. We therefore propose that we make a common database for modelling, that is incorporated into the iGEM website.

Name
Description
BBa_K197021
EILD
One peptide of a heterodimeric leucine zipper that dimerizes with KILR.
BBa_K197022
KILR
A heterodimeric peptide that dimerizes to EILD. This can be used for adhering two cells together to evolve new two cell chemistry and functions.
BBa_J3901
PrFe-mRFP1
This device coupled the promoters PI and PII of rus operon from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans with a monomeric red fluorescent protein (BBa_E1010) used as a signal, showing specific sensorbility response to iron ions presence.

Iron promoter -EYFP reporter
Iron promoter expresion is reported by the trascription of EYFP reporter.
Parts we standardized
Two of these parts ( BBa_K197021 and BBa_K197022 ) were in a non-standard backbone and format ( BBa_K197038 ). For the BBa_K197022 part, we tried to brick it by adding standard 10 pre- and suffixes and inserting it in the pSB1C3 (we used BBa_J04450 as template) standard backbone. We uploaded the standardized version of BBa_K197022 on the registry as BBa_K883600 . Unfortunately the BBa_K883600 lacks a SpeI restriction-site to match iGEM's standard 10. We found out about this after the part was send to the parts registry. It will be corrected by a new ligation in a working part after the wiki freeze.

Garrett Jensen
Garrett is most known for his absurd love of running, curly hair, and is known as the guy who lives in room 2129 of the Life Science Building. He is from a small town in Arizona, hates all forms of winter, snow, ice, and cold things in general, and did I mention he likes to run. His study of microbiology has brought him to this point in his research career where he has studied, along with teammates Mike and Mike, the wonderful world of CRISPRs. Unfortunately Garrett has no coconut-wielding troubadour squire as did Jordan Alexadrius Berg to write his autobiography for him, so he had to write it himself.
Bri Keele
The Beatles have taught the world that there is nothing you can do that can’t be done. Adopted as her mantra, Bri is constantly on the move. As a science-loving, festy-loving, traveling, art-creating, tattoo-enthusiast, Bri finds the time to devote to her two main passions: environmental microbiology and eating. Intrinsically integrated, you can find her in deep conversation at farmers markets talking pesticide use with vendors or with her hands covered in the soil of her own garden. Bri firmly believes in altruism, the healing power of music and art, and that laughter is always the best medicine.
Mike Linzey
I don't really know how I ended up here at iGEM...I am a Neuroscience Major, not Molecular or Microbiology. However  it happened, I have loved learning more about Synthetic Biology. Just a little bit about myself, I am from a small town in Massachusetts which I believe is the greatest state in the Country! I am a junior at BYU and as I said before I am studying Neuroscience with the hope of going on to graduate school to study drug development. I guess my greatest hope in life is become a drug dealer...but the good kind of drugs. I have had the opportunity to work with some great guys, Garrett and Mike Abboud, to try and get a CRISPR system to work. It has been a challenge but we are getting closer and closer to getting it to work.

The first one, microorganisms can escape from their confinement area, proliferate without any control and contaminate the environment, causing damage repairable or not.
Secondly, synthetic organisms may develop in an open environment, side effects not detected during testing phases.
Finally, it is also important to take into account the risk of bioterrorism. Terrorist organizations or individual actions can exploit synthetic biology for hostile purposes.

Accidental release
It has never yet been mentioned any release of GMOs into the environment. It is likely that GMO is less competitive compared to wild strains and did not persist in the environment. However, to avoid overflow, the scientific community has developed various means of containment:
Physical containment: This is the most used; it ranks bacteria and pathogens agents into 4 classes and determines the requirements to be followed in handling.
The trophic containment: It is about making the microorganism dependent of rare substances or unknown in nature, so it cannot grow without human intervention.
The containment semantics: It is still in development. It consists for example on modifying the genetic code or the development of new nucleic acids, called XNA which the sugar is neither a desoxyribose or ribose, which prevents the transmission of genes.
A final way would be the addition of suicide genes into the genome of the microorganism, destroying the bacteria once performed its function.

Tests in open environment
Since the creation of GMOs and their use in agriculture, many varieties of plants were grown in nature: in an open environment, while the vast majority of species were only tested in the laboratory.
In theory, two types of adverse effects may occur after the test of a GMO in an open environment. A fortiori it is the case for Genetically Synthesized organisms (OGS):
The microorganism can disturb the local biotope by creating a competitive environment, which may in the worst case lead to the extinction of several species.
It may also, after having colonized the middle, becoming impossible to remove.

As is shown below, we can see that there are quite a few areas of overlapping red and green fluorescent in positive group where there are both S.cerevisiae and E.coli in the sample, indicating that they are very likely to have linked to each other. The negative control of S.cerevisiae and E.coli however, has either red or green fluorescent. And for the empty group, there is no fluorescent detected at all.

One step further, we want to confirm the connection between E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae by FACS analysis, because this analysis method can observe in single-cell level.Unfortunately, however, we found the Beckman flow cytometry (FCM) in our university couldn’t excite our fluorescent dye rhodamine-biotin so we wereas not able to use it to catch dyed E. coli.
Finally, we use the scanning tunneling microscope to shoot the microscopic structure of the connecting system and get a clearer picture of the connection structure. So far, we can say our adhesion platform is successfully established.

The feedback we received has really helped us rethink how we can present our project to the world in a better and clearer way. We now have a clear understanding that not everyone has the knowledge that we do about our project and the science behind it. Therefore it is essential that we receive feedback from people who were listening to our presentation and act upon it by making our presentation clearer and more easier to follow and understand.Through the iGEM project journey we have found out that its essential that we focus on clear communication of our project. Not only were we able to receive feedback on our project, but we also gave some feedback to some of the other teams.

Design
     HTML, CSS, and Javascript were used to create the user interface for Protocat 2.0. The intent was to design the site in a way that makes it easy for users to create, find, and use any protocol on our database. We used Bootstrap for its HTML grid layout to format our pages.
     We used the Django web framework designed for Python 3.4 to manage the inner workings of Protocat 2.0. Django is convenient because it is capable of useful features including managing administration, databases, authentication, and templating of data on HTML pages through a Model-View-Controller system. The Model component is the Python code interacting that stores classes and objects needed for the database. The View component is the user interface that updates when changes are made to the model. The Controller handles browser requests and responses, as well as database connections. The combined MVC is an architecturally sound web application.
     Protocat 2.0 uses two databases, one for protocols and one for users. We created a “class Protocol,” a model of a protocol, to be used in the protocol database. This class includes properties such as name, reagents, protocol ID, and steps. Django takes care of the necessary steps to aggregate the various protocols into a database. Whenever changes need to be made to our models, all we need to do is migrate the changes through Django and it will change our database accordingly. Django comes with its own user system, which was used instead of creating our own user model. New user information such as username, password, email, and real name are added to the user database. Likewise, when a protocol is uploaded, all those attributes are saved in the protocol database."

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Project#Demonstration_-_-_TEXT.html," fusion was loaded with sgRNAs designed to target the substrate DNA,  erythropoietin (EPO) coding DNA sequence (cds), at position 179 bp (from a total length of 623 bp). If the integration of DNA adapters was site-specific, two main products should be obtained: ~250 bp and ~470 bp (one from the forward and one from the reverse strand), schematically shown in figure 2. This integration was demonstrated and presented in figure 2.B, in which lanes 2 and 3 represent each one of the fragments described. These lanes can be compared to the negative control in lanes 4 and 5. These lanes represent integration in the absence of sgRNA, the component required from targeted integration.
Targeted Next generation sequencing
Not only did we demonstrate that our fusion protein is capable of targeted integration, but we used our protein in its designed application: targeted sequencing with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platform. We used our fusion protein during library preparation to integrate sequencing adapters at the target site in the EPO cds, using the same sgRNA from the assay described above. The library reaction mixture had equimolar concentrations of two molecules:
Target DNA: EPO linear plasmid DNA containing a complimentary sgRNA target site.
Background DNA:Tn5 cds DNA containing no sgRNA compatible target sites.
After library preparation , we also added equimolar concentrations of randomly tagged reference DNA, as an internal control to verify the sequencing run. We sequenced the DNA molecules with an ONT MinION device. Sequencing results showed multiple reads of the reference DNA (internal control), 89 unique aligned reads of to the target DNA, EPO linear plasmid, and 0 unique aligned reads to Tn5 cds DNA, background DNA. Demonstrating a successful sequencing run and the target specificity of our fusion protein. Close analysis of one of the alignment reads demonstrates the precise site where the sequencing adapters were added. We could thus identify the exact distance from the binding of dxCas9 to the integration site of the adapters as shown in figure 3.
Figure 3. (A) Alignment of the DNA sequence read with reference EPO cds in plasmid DNA. (B) Zoom-in into the sequence alignment to determine the sgRNA target. Fusion protein depicted with arrows representing binding of dxCas9 position (red) and the addition of sequencing adapters (blue).
Conclusion
We proved that our designed fusion protein could direct DNA integration to a specific sequence by the use of a sgRNA. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that this novel protein can be used"

Characterization of IPTG inducable KinA sporulation trigger device - part BBa_K174011
We successfully characterized our IPTG inducible kinA sporulation tuning device BBa_K174011 . Although Spo0A is the master regulator of sporulation in B. subtilis, only an increase in phosphorylated Spo0A can trigger the sporulation(1). kinA is a kinase that will phosphorylate Spo0A. Thus, we achieved the increase in sporulation rate by artificially inducing the gene, kinA, with the pSpac promoter controlled by IPTG. We used growth curves and fluorescence microscopy to verify our results by assaying the expression of the gfp gene that is transcriptionally fused to kinA and by counting the spores visible by brightfield microscopy.
For more information about the design of this device go to our sporulation tuning page.
Our synthesised device was cloned into the integration vector pGFP-rrnb constructed by Dr. JW Veening. By placing our device just before the gfp CDS in the integration vector, we hoped to see GFP when we induce the device with IPTG. However for IPTG to work, we needed LacI expressed in the cells.
When we first did our transformation for B. subtilis we forgot this link and we got similar results with cells induced with IPTG and not induced with IPTG. Obviously LacI was not present in the cells and so adding IPTG did not make any difference.
We then used a Bacillus subtilis mutant, BFS687, which has pMutin4 integrated into the chromosomal DNA (2). We selected this mutant especially since it does not have any phenotype under a wide range of conditions as described in the Micado database. Since"
