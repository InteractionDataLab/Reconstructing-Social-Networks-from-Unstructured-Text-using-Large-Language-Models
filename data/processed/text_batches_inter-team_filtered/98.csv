The collaboration with BIT-CHINA
After we met and exchanged ideas with BIT-China during the meeting in Beijing, we confirmed our collaboration relationship. In the light of helping each other, we assisted them for a new gene circuits.
At the same time, they helped us finish the pre experimental the fish experiment.
The LANZHOU iGEM 2016 team consists of 1 graduate students, 14 undergraduate students and 6 instructors. The main part of our project was finished by students from LANZHOU iGEM. We would like to thank our 6 instructors sincerely, for their time and efforts of helping us improve our project. Our work can be divided into 7 parts which are shown below. Each part of work was finished by several student members.
We helped them finish the “another inhibitor” system (arac+pBAD+B0034+TetR+B0015+pTet+B0034+RFP+B0015).(Fig 1)
Fig 1 Inhibitor system construction.
In this system, pBAD is one of the inducible promoter (from BBa_K808000) which can be induced by arabinose. B0034 and B0032 are two kinds of strong ribosome binding sites (RBS) and the strength of B0032 is only 33.96% of B0034. pTet promoter is constitutively ON and repressed by TetR repressor.
We were very glad to help them because this “inhibitor” system is vital for their project. They use the concentration of inhibitor proteins as a signal indicating the plasmid numbers, and it can trigger the downstream reaction by activating the killer gene while the plasmid concentration reduce to the threshold.
At the same time, they helped us finish the pre experimental the fish experiment.
There are three crucial components, INP, GFP, and Metal Catcher (Fig 2). INP (Ice Nucleation Protein) is an extrinsic membrane protein of E.coli and acts as an anchor. GFP acts as a reporter while metal catcher can bind heavy-metal ions. This is how we assemble the crucial elements.
At the same time, they helped us finish the pre experimental the fish experiment.

Furthermore E3 can begin an iterative degradation with E4 if the E4 main product enter in the range of substrate specificity.
BBa_K2198004:E4 The trans-2-carboxybenzalpyruvate hydratase-aldolase from Nocardioides sp Ref. [4]
The last step of our degradation pathway allow us to remove a ring from the PAH by producing a py-ruvic acid. This product is a common harmless cell intermediate molecule. Moreover, this step pro-duce a smaller PAH if there is more than 2 ring at the beginning. This second generation PAH can reintegrate the pathway at the previous step thanks to a low substrate specificity E3
BBa_K2198005:S1 The Major ampullate Spidroin 1 (MaSp1) from Euprosthenops australis Ref. [5]
In order to carry out the reaction on a solid support, we designed a scaffold made of spider silk that can polymerize.
Figure 1: Biochemical degradation pathway for Anthracene
The catalytic degradation of PAH is ensured by four enzymes. (E1_1, E1_2) homodimer catalyzes the di-hydroxylation, E2 the dehydrogenation of the vicinal diol, E3 oxidative cleavage of the aromatic cycle and E4 cleavage of a linear unsaturated α-β enone to release a pyruvate molecule.
Open reading frames for the four enzymes were designed using Geneious 11.0.2 Ref. [5] software with Uniprot database sequences. Each sequence was designed with Biobrick prefix and suffix Registry in the 5’ and 3’ regions respectively. In addition, His(6) tag, spacer and TeV cleavage sites were included at the N-terminus for purification and release of the His(6) -tag. BamHI site were inserted in the construct after the prefix and before the suffix respectively for insertion into pET43.1a(+) or pET32a(+) (Merck-Millipore) expression plasmids. Genes were ordered from Eurofins Genomics after sequence optimization for Biobrick and cloning into pET vector compatibility. Sequences were further optimized for expression in Escherichia coli and gene synthesis.

Synchronizing the oscillations at a population level
In order to make our system easier to observe, we need to extend and synchronize the oscillations at a population scale. The best way to do so is to insert a check-point that can be overcome only if the major part of the population has reached it. The phenomenon of quorum-sensing is the way bacteria synchronize the expression of genes when the density of bacteria is important enough.

The Hawaiian bobtail squid have a symbiotic relationship with Vibrio fischeri
Presentation of the phenomenon of quorum-sensing : intercellular communication in bacterias
The phenomenon of quorum sensing was first discovered in Vibrio fischeri. This bacteria only expresses luciferase when the density of bacteria is very high (1011bact/mL). Typically, the bacteria does not express bioluminescence when they are free living in the ocean. At the contrary, they express luciferase when they are highly concentrated in the photophore of Hawaiian bobtail squid.
Fig 1 : Quorum sensing in V. fischeri. (Red triangle represent AHL produced by LuxI. OM : Outer Membrane, IM : Inner Membrane
The genetic cascade
In this system, LuxI and LuxR control the expression of luciferase operon luxICDABE, necessary to produce bioluminescence. LuxI synthesize small diffusible molecules called Acyl Homoserin Lactone (AHL). LuxR is the intracellular receptor to AHL.
The AHL freely diffuses into the extracellular medium. Its concentration increases as the population gets more dense. When the concentration reaches a critical level, those small molecules bind to their receptor. LuxR bound to AHL and the complex activate the operon that code for luciferase (Figure 1.).

These parts represent an easy way to build fusion constructs of intein parts with any protein or peptide of interest (POI). In a single step you can fuse your protein to a split intein part. Desired extein residues, RFC [i] standard overhangs and BsaI sites generating these overhangs have to be added to the coding sequence of the POI by PCR. Facilitating the highly efficient GoldenGate assembly reaction, the mRFP selection marker can be replaced with the POI insert.
The resulting parts can be concatenated using standard BioBrick cloning into an expression backbone to coexpress the POIs fused to a N- and a C-intein.
In an auto catalytic in vivo reaction, the inteins will cleave themselves out and ligate the exteins - here your POIs - together. For example we used this mechanism to reconstitute the fluorescence of split sfGFP . To read more about the trans-splicing reaction visit our Intein Background page. The whole process becomes significant more interesting with conditional protein trans splicing .
If performing experiments with split inteins make sure you always have a non-splicing negative control. Check out our non splicing assembly constructs (with part names ending with 2 or 3) for example: BBa_K1362102 and BBa_K1362103
Intein Library.
Inteins are the basic unity of our toolbox. They are integrated as extraneous polypeptide sequences into habitual proteins and do not follow the original protein function. Inteins perform an autocatalytic splicing reaction, where they excite themselves out of the host protein while reconnecting the remaining chains on both end, so called N and C exteins, via a new peptide bond. Read more about it in our project background !
To characterize the different types and groups of split-inteins and inteins we collect many details about them to develop a intein library. It gives you a great and clear overview about the most important facts.

SYSU Software iGEM team visualizations
Our team began to scrape team data and abstracts from the iGEM database using a web scraper, with the aim of                 identifying common themes between different teams, so as to create a tool that could potentially help teams                 find others with similar topics in the future. We wish to further improve the database by converting the                 csv file, which contains a lot of keywords, into a visualization where the output will be a visualized diagram                 that is easier to search, more creative and more user-friendly. Because our modelling team is not expert                 in making visualization using JavaScript, we decided to post our collaboration request on iGEM collaboration                 page to seek help from iGEM teams to improve the visualization for interested iGEM teams to use in the future.
SYSU software team was enthusiastic about this collaboration. We have achieved our final goal for this finished                 product, which is to put the Network Visualization on our wiki page!

Modeling and characterization collaboration with CUHK
For modelling collaboration, our modelling team bidirectionally cooperated with CUHK's modelling team in the early summer.                 We contributed two Python scripts for CUHK team. One of them was for simulating and plotting an ODE-based                 model using Euler's method. The other was for simulating and plotting a stochastic model using a Gillespie                 algorithm. Both of these scripts were used for them to model the proportion of active and inactive toehold                 switches in their project.
In the opposite direction, we received from CUHK iGEM team a Python interface implemented with Cython that would                 allow us to call functions from a library called ViennaRNA which is written in C. Since it can be quite difficult                 to use functions between different languages like Python and C, and CUHK team’s interface greatly simplified                 our workload for modelling. We used this interface to estimate the dissociation constant for the antis"

Solid model
I Introduction
     Spatial factors have a great impact on the results of population interactions. To understand spatial effects better, we develop our discrete probabilistic solid model.
    Concretely, to achieve this goal we designed a fluid model based on Cellular Automaton (CA).
    What is more, we found that it will be much easier to consider spatial factors on population interactions if we can visualize it. Therefore, we designed our game---Solid E.coli War based on our solid model to satisfy our needs. What's more, the game can also help us realize educational purpose of our project and make public know more about synthetic biology! ( Exhibition at National Museum )
    Our game is made on the structure of html5. Below is a small video of our solid E.coli War.
See more details on Solid E.coli War.
II Our method
    It seems we can use Partial Differential Equation (PDE) directly. However, it will be too complicated to execute PDE fast in program and also difficult for visualization of the changing process, not to say adapting it to our game.
    Therefore, we chose another method as our solid model fundamental: cellular automaton (CA).
    A cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states. An initial state (time t = 0) is selected by assigning a state for each cell. A new generation is created (advancing t by 1), according to some fixed rule (generally, a mathematical function) that determines the new state of each"

Impression 5 Science Center
In order to educate children about synthetic biology and get them excited about science, we held an outreach event at Impression 5, a science center in Lansing, Michigan on June 29, 2018. The event started with a brief introduction to our team and what synthetic biology is. Then, in efforts to entertain the children, we hosted some hands on activities. These were organized into separate stations. Some of the stations consisted of practicing pipetting, extracting DNA from strawberries, constructing an alien with randomized selection, and colored leaf imprints. Over 50 children participated in the event. Our main goal in collaboration with Impression 5 was to teach children more about science and how it may be applicable to their interests and future careers.
East Lansing Public Library & Capital Area Public Library
Using Impression 5’s event as a model, we also reached out to the East Lansing Public Library and the Lansing Public Library. The East Lansing Public Library’s event took place on July 13th 2018 in East Lansing and the Lansing Capital Area Public Library’s event was held in the Lansing on the 26th of July. Both of these featured the activities previously mentioned from Impression 5 (practicing pipetting, extracting DNA from strawberries, constructing an alien with randomized selection, and colored leaf imprints).
Mid-Sure Presentation
We attended a poster presentation at the Mid-Michigan Symposium for Undergraduate Research Experiences held at Michigan State University, discussing our project with attendees and exploring projects designed by students from across the area."
Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," molecular scale using phages is often difficult and intimidating from a biosafety perspective. A simple plasmid-based expression system of capsid proteins built for bacteria or yeast could make nano-encapsulation much more accessible to non-experts who are keen to learn molecular biology techniques or researchers who want to become familiar with biological encapsulation and delivery. The “tuning” of the capsid proteins to have different chemical characteristics is an advanced undertaking.  Having a software application to help with the capsid protein design would enable those with less experience and the broader scientific community to begin working with encapsulation. Effectively, the software application would give the user a starting point to learn about how protein capsids work. Overall, this interview was helpful for informing our construct design and confirming this would be a useful tool for researchers. Justin and Julie Legault, the CEO of Amino Labs, are also releasing a book called From Zero to Genetic Engineering Hero this month (https://amino.bio/products/learn-genetic-engineering-the-genetic-engineering-hero-book). This book is the perfect journey for students to learn the basics of engineering bacteria - From covering the basics and learning about DNA, extracting proteins that you’ve engineered bacteria to create, to even control genetic circuits, these are the topics you need to know before you start innovating on your iGEM project.
Dr. Vanessa Meier-Stephenson, Postdoctoral Fellow
Need a more effective tool for cell transfection
We spoke with Dr. Vanessa Meier-Stephenson, an MD-PhD working as a Postdoctoral Fellow in collaboration effort at the University of Lethbridge and the University of Calgary. During her PhD, she worked on drug design and told us that packaging methods for small molecules are designed to ensure that the drug can survive the acidic conditions of the stomach. Additionally, some larger drugs such as vancomycin cannot diffuse naturally across cell membranes. She suggested that for our protein nanocompartment system, it would be effective for this application by helping with moving larger molecules across membranes and for ensuring a smaller concentration of molecules would be required for certain cell types. In her own work, she said that there are difficulties in doing transfection assays using cell lines for Hepatitis B. She suggested that it would be useful if tags could be added to capsids to make them specific for different cell lines to increase the modularity of our system. Vanessa also suggested that we would need to look into toxicity levels in the cells and the potential immune response for safety considerations. Overall, this interview helped identify that there are issues with trying to transfect some cell lines,"

My motivation to join iGEM was boredom. It offered me some monstrous joy for summer! It taught                          me what science really is. iGEM was not just a simple project but a great opportunity to                          fulfill my time with lovely people. It is beyond the lab. In this path, I learned advance                          biology, lab rules and math while discovering the world and amazed by some little bacteria. It                          is nice to know that everything can be changed by science."

I am exploring the emergence of synthetic biology in India, and it was a great honour that iGEM IIT Delhi team invited and welcomed me. As a sociologist of science, it had been a great learning experience for me to observe the way a group of young people took up this new mode of knowledge construction. Their passion, perseverance and never give up attitude - given the lack of resources they face - enriched my own work in multiple ways and proved out as an excellent site for a STS scholar.

5. Place the cover on the electrophoresis unit, plug into the power source, and turn on voltage to 120V, set time to 30 minutes, and press the start button twice,leave when bubbles are seen. DNA separation can be observed as time goes on by turning off the power supply then gently removing the basin from the electrophoresis unit (be careful not to let the gel slip out of the basin) and placing on the UV transilluminator to see DNA bands.
6. When the desired level of separation is obtained, the basin can be placed on the transilluminator for picture taking(Of the absence of transilluminator,we use camera to take pictures with the UV light ).

[2]Hind III and BamH I were used in order to ligate insert into pET43.1a(+) but since we changed genetic constructions by deleting T7 promoter, we used Xba I and Hind III for cloning. We deleted the T7 promoter from our insert in order to avoid two successive promoters once ligated into pET43.a(+). [3]We didn’t achieve cloning into pET43.1a(+) because we had not enough inserts. So we decided amplifying the insert by PCR and TOPO Cloning before cloning into pET43.a(+) [4]We realized that induction by 0.5 mM IPTG for 3h at 37°C was not sufficient to produce our protein, that’s why we decided doing it by 0.3 mM IPTG overnight at 15°C (allowing folding of the fusion protein).

Terpenoids
Implementation on a Platform for Terpenoid Production
The modular design strategy obviously poses a greater advantage to systems aimed at manufacturing related products, such as families of biomolecules, related to each other by common metabolic pathways of production. One such family of biomolecules is terpenoids, also known as isoprenoids, which are a kind of hydrocarbon made up of five-carbon isoprene units, arranged and modified in such a way that all of them share common physical and chemical characteristics and yet also exhibit a wide range of biological properties.  Well-known cases are artemisinin, the drug with the most effective mechanism against malaria-causing P. falciparum, and taxol, a mitotic inhibitor used in chemotherapeutic cancer treatments. Both of them are produced in plants (a fern-like shrub and the bark of a tree, respectively), but their yields are usually low and the demand for their medical use is significantly high. Other examples include lycopene, the precursor in tomatoes for beta-carotene, and limonene, which is present in most cosmetic products distributed nowadays.  The biological pathway through which terpenoids are synthesized in eukaryotes is the mevalonate pathway, which includes a series of molecular transformations from Acetyl-CoA to isopentenyl-5-pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl-pyrophosphate. These isomeric molecules are the common precursors for all terpenoid molecules. A bioengineering approach for terpenoid production involves using the mevalonate pathway and the appropriate synthases in order to end up with the desired molecule. The yeast P. pastoris already uses the mevalonate pathway, but it has been reported that the HMG-CoA reductase involved in its rate-limiting step is heavily regulated. This can be bypassed by a reported N-terminus truncation that renders it still functional but increases the total yield of the process.  Applying the aforementioned modular biofactory design strategy to this model, it is possible to implement a biological platform for the synthesis of terpenoids. Using the production of lycopene as a proof of concept, the separate genes required include the truncated HMG-CoA reductase, GGPP synthase (CrtE), phytoene synthase (CrtB), and phytoene desaturase (C"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media

By allowing      participants to use the microscope, they were able to gain a better appreciation for both how this technology works, as well as the microorganisms      and microparticles that compose the world we live in. The third component of our booth was the use of a virtual reality (VR) headset with the app      InCell VR. This application allowed participants to get an in-depth view of the inside of a human cell at the molecular level. Children were able      to see cell components including the nucleus, mitochondria, and ribosomes during this interactive virtual experience. Although it was difficult      to introduce complicated genetic concepts to  young children for the first time, they were as fascinated and intrigued as we were!

Canadian Undergraduate Technology Conference (CUTC)
QGEM was invited to attend and participate in the annual Maker’s Fair at the Canadian Undergraduate Technology Conference hosted by the University of Waterloo.      CUTC is Canada's largest technology conference for undergraduate students established to bring together creators, designers, engineers, entrepreneurs, budding      scientists and young visionaries across the country. There we were able to interact with and explain potential applications of synthetic biology to students in      both high school and post-secondary. The team also highlighted problems tackled by past QGEM teams and briefly outlined recent years’ projects for a better      understanding of the work that we do. As well, we were able to collaborate and share our ideas with other design teams from around Ontario.
Science Quest
Something our team has always been passionate about when it comes to synthetic biology is education. We believe that teaching children about the basics of synthetic biology      from a young age can not only prepare them for future education but also allow them to explore a potential area of interest that they may want to pursue as a career one day.      Although Science Rendezvous provided an opportunity to expose children of various ages to what our team does, and better explore the topic of DNA and cell biology,"

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html,"We also met with two U of C professors in nanoscience to discuss the feasibility of our magnetism idea. Dr. Max Anikovskiy, an instructor from the nanoscience program, allowed us to use a 50 lb. pull force rare earth magnet to manipulate native horse spleen ferritin. However, there were no changes over a three hour period. We also spoke to Dr. Simon Trudel from the nanomagnetism research group. He seemed to think our idea was feasible, but might require optimizing with respect to the solvent system in which the particles are dissolved. From both these meetings, it emerged that modelling the fluid dynamics is beyond our capabilities. Our best bet is to test these ideas experimentally, one step at a time, by first synthesizing and testing magnetoferritin.
Week 7: June 10 - June 14
We visited the Cargill Meat Solutions plant and discovered that our system would be most applicable in identifying cattle who are super shedders, which would require our system to be quantitative. One possible approach utilizes a fusion of TALE and a reporter protein, although this system may subtract from quantification due to binding of multiple DNA strands to the nanoparticle. An alternative approach utilizes a ferritin-TALE to immobilize target DNA, which can then be visualized through a second TALE fused to a reporter enzyme.
One question we currently have is the construction of the ferritin genes.  Lee et al. (2002), and Huh and Kim (2003) have successfully created heavy-light chain ferritin subunit fusions, allowing better control of the subunit ratios. Therefore we intend to use a similar approach as it would halve the number of subunits involved, and in turn halve the number of bound TALEs, reducing our concerns about steric hindrance. E coils will be bound to the N-terminus due to its presence on the outside of the nanoparticle,  ensuring exposure to the environment (Luzzago and Cesareni 1989).
Upon further investigation, we found that the creation of Prussian Blue ferritin nanoparticles involve the use of potassium ferrocyanide, a compound that has the potential to evolve hydrogen cyanide. These fears were abated upon contacting members in the nanoscience department, stating the conditions and concentrations involved in our experiment were too low to be of concern.
Week 8: June 17 - June 21
An issue we addressed this week was the assembly of gene constructs to test ferritin in our system. A tentative strategy plan has been proposed. Coordinating"

Formal Lab Session - 14th August 2009
Overview
Metal Sensor Team - prepared some LB + Chloramphenicol + starch plates and added pGFP-rrnB B. subtilis transformants to it
Metal Sensor Team
Introduction and Summary
So far we have shown that our Bacillus subtilis 168 cultures, once the pGFP-rrnB DNA has been added, can survive on LB + Chloramphenicol media. This suggests that we have successfully transformed our B. subtilis cells as the wild type B. subtilis cells do not have this resistance. However we need to prove that the resistance inherited by the Bacillus subtilis bacteria is due to the GFP-rrnb and not acquired by other means. Today, we intend to pour some LB + Chloramphenicol + starch plates and then plate our 'transformed' Bacillus cells onto these plates. The reason for adding starch to the plates: the GFP-rrnb plasmid removes the Bacillus subtilis bacteria's ability to break down starch using the amyE enzyme - starch plates will prove the bacteria have been transformed.
Changes to protocol
There were no changes to the protocol described here except for the fact that the chosen antibiotic is chloramphenicol
Work we did
Two 1 litre flasks - one containing 500ml LB + agar with starch also present and the other flask containing 500ml of deionised water
Mathew pouring the LB starch + chloramphenicol plates under aseptic technique
Using the 'pouring plates' protocol , we made up 1 litre of LB + agar + starch solution and once it had been autoclaved and properly prepared"

When designing our project, we aimed to create something that could truly be appreciated in the field. We therefore explored the needs and concerns of the various stakeholders of our chosen problem in multiple ways. Each of these interactions has shaped our rather vague initial idea. Our idea of creating a smart bacteria for diagnostics.
Vidilab
Vidilab (a veterinary diagnostics company) was consulted at multiple points in our project. From the very beginning, when we didn’t even have a project, to the very end of our lab period in august we talked with both management (the CEO, Bitte Ljungström) and researchers at the company (Alice Anlind, Sara Hägglund Ljungström). From these discussions, we learnt about the major issues of the field and how large the need was for a new diagnostic tool for small strongyles. In the end this was the reason why we decided to take up the fight against these parasites.
Initially, our project focused mainly on small strongyles and in vitro diagnosis of the encysted larvae. From the literature we learnt that small strongyles formes cysts containing hundreds of individual worms in the intestinal tract of horses. It was these cysts that we initially planned to detect and isolate from horse tissue and co-culture them with bacteria.
Vidilab was kind enough to provide access to horse tissue with encysted larvae. The cysts we received did not correspond with what we initially expected due to our previous research. Because of this, we decided to focus on detection of the worms rather than the cysts. But as we knew, free floating small strongyles do not put the horse into significant danger. Instead we decided only to focus on providing farmers with better information about their horses’ wellbeing. Thanks to Vidilab we also knew that the usage of anthelmintics is leading towards resistance development in the strongyle population, turning them into a threat to the equine industry and horses’ physical health. By administering more accurate treatments, the resistance development rate among the strongyles could"

Amber Brown
Amber is not the typical lab junkie that you would imagine.  Rather than spending a lot of time indoors, she loves getting out! Between all of her hiking, rafting, and slacklining she manages to squeeze in several hours research time in the lab for the BYU iGEM team.  Amber one day hopes to become a professor of microbiology, a good fit for someone who is so dedicated to her work.  Amber has enjoyed the research opportunities offered by iGEM and found it to be a valuable experience!
Arick Christopher
Despite Arick’s creepy looking picture right here, he is actually a pretty cool cat.  Growing up a redneck in Redding, California, he somehow joined the hipster phase when he moved to Medford, Oregon.  While he is not studying exercise science, he is busy rafting, hiking, or playing Dungeons and Dragons.  He aspires to one day become an oral surgeon and is apparently quite the cook (according to his girlfriend...).
Clarice Harrison
Clarice lives a life torn between the two loves of her life: Russia and molecular biology. Self proclaimed 'gene junkie' and русская сестра, she finally achieved a merger of these two worlds when she spent a month at the University of Moscow on a biotechnology internship. After that she didn't know what to do with her life. So of course she is going to apply for grad school.  In her spare time she enjoys sleeping with her purple pillows, purple blanket, and copy of Eugene Onegin.

The effect of post-translationally modifications are protein stability, proper ligand binding, and reduced risk of immunogenicity (2). Most of the therapeutic proteins approved and currently in development are post-translationally modified (3). However, the genetic tools used for constructing mammalian cells vectors are based on outworn methods, and since 60-70% of all recombinant protein pharmaceuticals are produced in mammalian cells, there is a desperate need for simpler and more efficient cloning techniques (5).
The U-2 OS cell line
The U-2 OS cell line, originally known as the 2T line, is an immortalized human-derived cell line that was established in 1964. The original cells were taken from bone tissue of the tibia of a 15 year old girl suffering from osteosarcoma. An immortalized cell line has acquired the ability to proliferate indefinitely through either random mutation or modifications such as artificial expression of the telomerase gene. Several cell lines are well established as representatives of certain cell types. U-2 OS cells show epithelial adherent morphology, and no viruses have been detected in the cell line. In comparison, the HeLa cell line contains the well known HPV virus. They are also very good-looking in the microscope, and therefore U-2 OS was chosen for the proof of concept of the Plug 'n’ Play assembly standard for mammalian cells.
Transient transfection
Transient expression is the ability to express heterologous DNA during a short period of time, which allows fast production of a desired protein. A high copy number of plasmids are introduced into the cells, and expression may be transitory over a period of time until the DNA is lost from the population. This allows for protein characterization or to verify the integrity, functionality, and the efficiency of different recombinant vectors. Production of a large amount of recombinant protein has been reported for transient expression systems at large scale. A small number of the transfected cells may incorporate the exogenous DNA into their genome by recombination leading to a stable transfection of a gene (6).

They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.

TU_Munich,2012,Team:TU Munich#Project#Thaumatin_-_-_TEXT.html," Anglo-Saxon world - stouts and ales - these are the sorts that could directly profit from the licorice-like sweetness, as they are generally more full-bodied and show a variety of caramel flavors.
It opens the world of brewage to a whole new generation of lifestyle drinks - perhaps a bit too innovative for the conservative german beer market, but nevertheless there is quite a potential there for cutting-edge beverages with the soul of beer and the savor of all the fruits you can imagine. Thaumatin might serve as a low-carb ingredient to balance out the bitter and sour flavors of guava, grapefruits, currant - or even horseradish.
Background and Principles
Thaumatin is a natural α+β-protein which is synthesized by the katamfe plant (Thaumatococcus daniellii) – a species of tropical flowering plants - and belongs to the thaumatin-like protein family. There exist different varieties of thaumatin, however, thaumatin I und thaumatin II are well characterized and differ only in one amino acid position (position 46 – without signaling sequence; thaumatin I Asn; thaumatin II Lys). Both are said to be 22000 to 100000 times sweeter than sucrose on molar basis, but the sweetness builds slow and lasts long.
Thaumatin is a single chain with 207 amino acid residues, eight disulfide bonds and a molecular weight of 22.2 kDa. It is highly water soluble, stable at heating (not for cooking, bakery, etc.) and stable under acidic conditions. The production of thaumatin is induced by an attack upon the plant by viroid pathogens. Thus it is involved in systematically acquired resistance and stress response.
Thaumatin has been approved as a sweetener in the European Union (E957).
The general idea is to create a system that expresses thaumatin via genetic engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively the direct precursor (preprothaumatin). The N-terminal ""pre"" part is the internal signalling sequence for secretion, the C-terminal ""pro"" sequence supports the correct and functional folding of thaumatin. Alternatively one could have used a fusion product of prothaumatin and the Mat-α-factor to achieve secretion.
The natural preprothaumatin seems to be preferable, because of the expected higher yield [ Masuda et al., 2011 ] and the possibility that the pre-sequence is necessary for the correct procession [ Ide et al., 2007 ]. A similar construct"

Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"Figure 6: Biochemical properties and hydropathy of a CBD-HHTC-Re fusion protein. The fusion protein displays significant hydrophobic tendencies. While this was initially thought to be a problem, it synergized well with the nature of the mycelium surface and most likely allowed the protein to obtain a proximity close enough for chitin binding to occur. The simulation to produce the graphs above was done by LifeTein.
We then also produced RFP-CBD fusion protein following a regular His-Tag purification protocol and analogous transformation/cloning steps as our other fusion proteins to stain mycelial material with, and as a cool visual tool/probe. The following images depict purified protein, and liquid cultures of T7 E. coli cells producing the protein, respectively.
The next factor to contemplate was the manner in which the filter could be implemented. Our first thought was to grow fungus inside a syringe on wood chips and treat the mycelium with our fusion protein, and then run water through this. We discovered that the prototypes created, however, were not very permeable, and applying pressure to push water through washed out the mycelium itself, leaving only substrate behind (as seen in the following two images).
The approach that we selected in the end was to make use of filter-based design in which we could take advantage of tangential flow as opposed to direct head-on flow. The following images show the mycelium strips being incubated with purified CBD-HHTC-Re 2x protein for 72 hours with DTT for cleavage (the protocol we designed for creation of the filters). These were realistically implemented by inserting a thin sheet of glass fiber at the bottom of a syringe to prevent any mycelial material from flowing through. The mycelium material could also be shredded to increase surface area for absorption of metal and display of chitin. The strips were then added on top and water could be flown through this setup. The filter strips were cut into 1 cm x 1 cm squares for prototype testing. Various iterations of this process can be seen in the images that follow.
Tangential Flow Prototype Testing: Bulk Surface Adsorption Using Phen Green
The Cu concentration in the initial copper solution was 325 (+/-25) µM Cu. After 30 minutes of tangential flow, interestingly, the untreated mycelium absorbed about 23% of the copper in solution, revealing a fascinating synergy in that the mycelium possesses some inherent metal sequestration properties. The treated mycelium (filter prototype) was able to sequester ~92% of the available Cu in"
Toronto,2016,Team:Toronto#HP-Impact_-_-_TEXT.html," sometimes requiring new methods; and the ability to produce original research, or other advanced scholarship, of a quality to satisfy peer review, and to merit publication. Emphasis ours; this is a precise description of what the publication of an iGEM project entails.
There are caveats to this analysis. iGEM teams that publish often achieve this expectation collectively, although many papers did not list all undergraduate members as authors, and some were screened out for having one or zero undergraduate members as authors. iGEM teams are supported by multiple advisors who are in pursuit or possession of a doctoral degree already; we suspect that having advisors who already have been published and who are often listed as last authors on iGEM publications helps greatly with getting these papers published. On the other hand, doctoral students themselves often have advisors who provide similar assistance.
Beyond the educational benefit of simply participating, members of teams who publish gain skills that will prove incredibly useful should they pursue graduate studies. While our literature review shows how participating helps to give skills to a workforce, our study of iGEM publication shows how iGEM prepares members of the most successful teams for joining academia. This is aside from the fact that iGEM teams have produced 82 additions to scientific literature, have supported the research of professors in work published only on their team wikis, and worked on projects that are eventually published but without authorship for two or more undergraduates.
There are many determinants to whether an iGEM team is successful and thus more likely to publish. However, there are many barriers to participation that would prevent success and publication. Lowering these barriers, through assistance in paying registration fees, assistance in acquiring materials and lab space, or generating greater enthusiasm among potential advisors, would increase the likelihood that a given team goes on to participate, win a gold medal or be named a finalist, and publish- with a concomitant greater likelihood for large educational benefits.
Section Four
Synthetic Biology has tremendous potential to improve how goods and services are provided and generate new goods and services, making iGEM-affiliated startups an obvious example of the social benefit of participation in iGEM. iGEM incentivizes teams to consider implications outside of the lab through Human Practices Projects, demonstrate feasibility through proof-of-concept and prototypes (Judging/Medals, 2016.igem.org, 2016), and plan for implementation through the short-lived entrepreneurship track (2012e.igem.org, no title, 2012). When the entrepreneurship track ended after the 2014 Jamboree, it was not because iGEM did not value"

In detail, the experiments were done to identify different resistances and different fluorescence proteins encoded on different plasmids. By transforming both plasmids and plating on different antibiotics the students were able to distinguish between GFP on a plasmid carrying an ampicillin resistance, and RFP on a plasmid carrying a kanamycin resistance. Many of the students showed big interest in our projects and some of them were convinced to study in the field of biology and were fascinated by the opportunity to participate in iGEM in the near future. While teaching in the academy we improved our teaching skills.
Additionally, we observed several issues in the communication. The understanding of certain terms was completely different to our expectation and intention.Seeing the next generation of scientists we were once again reminded of the importance of outreach. Engaging in dialogues with people outside of the lab is essential when strengthening the reputation of synthetic biology. We need to understand the concerns of the public to address these issues properly. Even the pupils showed a strong interest in other aspects than the scientific ones. We talked a lot about morality and responsibility in synthetic biology as well as social aspects in a group project such as iGEM. At the end of the week we knew about the importance of talking about scientific topics in a simple yet respectful way.
We were further encouraged to find new ways of communicating our project.
Postcards - raising synthetic biology awareness on 150cm²
When it comes to synthetic biology the public may be prejudiced. This is most presumably caused due to misconceptions. This year's iGEM team Düsseldorf from the HHU Düsseldorf felt called upon tackling this issue and motivate the people to overcome their skepticism. Thus the idea to create and distribute educational postcards in the context of synthetic biology emerged.
Gathering the creativity of all other German iGEM teams, topics ranging from the production of insulin to gene editing were covered. We exchanged packs of about 100 postcards with some of the other teams to be able to have a broader area to spread them. This led to receiving postcards from the teams from Aachen , Darmstadt , Düsseldorf , Hannover , Goettingen and Tuebingen . Our postcard was designed after the motto 'Tolerance for Transgenes'. By that we demanded for a higher level of tolerance for GMO's which in general are negatively connoted in Germany and pointed towards their advantages.
We would like to thank team Düsseldorf for letting us join their campaign. Hopefully, many will follow their example and engage in public communication!

A:So far, the most advanced way in the world uses algae as the carrier for absorption, and researchers have made detailed explanations.In the past, many studies used plant carbonic anhydrase to capture CO2.Though this kind of carbonic anhydrase can survive in most environments,yet efficiency of human carbonic anhydrase for capturing CO2 is dozens of times higher than that of the plant one.
③Q:The major scientific research direction of biochemical research center.
A:It can be concluded as drug delivery, CO2 capture and conversion, biomaterials and regenerative medicine.
④Q:As far as we know, the carbonic anhydrase expressed in escherichia coli in our iGEM project is more active than that did in human body. This is because of the effect of modifying the active site based on the carbonic anhydrase expressed in human body. Therefore, we want to know how to find out the relevant active site to improve the activity of carbonic anhydrase by computer.
A:The relevant active sites of carbonic anhydrase are known in the knowledge base. We use computer to simulate mutation of the known active sites of carbonic anhydrase to see if it can improve its function, which is verified by conducting relevant experiments later.Our workload and efficiency can be reduced and improved by computer simulation.

Interview
Q：We still have some questions regarding to the market. It would be such a pleasure if you can                         share some of your ideas or understandings about them.
A : Please ask, I’m very glad to help you.
Q1: Could you please inform us UDCA medicine’s value in market and its efficacy?
A: UDCA is an cholic acid medicine that has choleretic effect to human bodies. It can cure                         various dan diseases like gallstone as well as hepatopathy including hepatic adipose                         infiltration. UDCA medicine has stronger healing effect than CDCA medicine while having less                         side effects in treatment. However, subtracted from bears, UDCA has a relatively high costs. And                         using UDCA directly converted by CDCA mainly has two benefits: first of all, it requires a lower                         cost because CDCA is subtracted from poultry like chickens, ducks, and geese; also, use CDCA                         instead of UDCA can help protect wild animals (bears.) Also, I consulted experts in our                         marketing department about it and they revealed to me that this approach has very high                         vendibility that medicines manufactured oversea are in short supply.
Q2: What is the basic principle of this drug design/production?
: First we extract CDCA from the bile of chicken, duck and geese. Then we convert CDCA into UDCA                         through two steps of redox reaction. These two substance are isomers than differ in their                         three-dimensional structure only.
Q3: We found out that there are only few factories manufactures UDCA medicine. Is it because the                         producing process’s complexity? Where is the complexity embodied in specific?
A: In fact, the actual process or technology used is not very complex but the key dangerous                         factor is the need of sodium, a dangerous, active metal that burns when it meets with water.                         Moreover, to consider this issue from other perspectives, UDCA medicine’s production copes wth                         the pressure from people’s safety and environment protection concerns. Therefore there are not                         too many factories that manufactures UDCA medicine.

Invalid inputs (e.g. a letter different from G, C, T, A or N in a nucleotide sequence; loop(s) in the logic network; no sequences assigned to input(s)/output(s); input or output sequences that are too similar) are reported back to the users as error messages providing a description of the errors and advices how to correct the errors. The Check and Turn-to-DNA modules can only be entered when the network contains no errors.

2. Step: Verify the logic network

The logic network designed in step 1 can now be verified.
Logical values are represented by colors (green = true, red = false). Thus a green box represents a gates (e.g. an AND-gate) with the logical value true, a red box a gates with the logical value false. The flow of logical value can be followed by following the colored edges between the gates.
The logical value(s) of the input(s) can be manipulated by clicking on their checkbox(es).

3. Step: Synthesize - Turn the logic network into DNA

A set of genetic gates (categorized as input, logic gates and output) representing the logical network designed in step 1 is calculated and displayed.
All elements consist of a promoter, a ribosome binding site, up to two toggle switches, one output transmitter sequences and at least one terminator.
This information may at a later point, when the functionality of our toggle switches has been demonstrated in the lab and not only in silicio, be used for synthesizing the genetic networks.

Results
Our team has successfully demonstrated the RNA-dependent response of our cells using a toehold switch circuit.
Figure 3 - By looking at the plate using blue light, it was possible to visualize the fluorescence difference between different samples (1-6) and their respective controls containing an empty plasmid in place of the trigger RNA.
We then decided to assess if this response is IPTG-dependent, in an attempt to evaluate how much RNA is needed to activate the system:
Figure 4 - Expression profile from our constructions with different IPTG concentration.
As shown by the graph above, IPTG concentrations as low as 0,01mM could activate the system! To assess if the observed expression was mostly related to the interaction between the trigger and the switch RNAs (and not due to some leakage of the Switch RNA), we compared the fluorescence profiles of a strain transformed with the two plasmids and another transformed with both a plasmid containing the Switch RNA and an empty plasmid.
Figure 5 - Expression profile comparison between strains with and without the trigger RNA.
Our last question was: would this system be sensitive enough to work under real conditions? In other words, mRNA expression variations observed in bacteria are really able to promote the activation of the Switch RNA? For this purpose, we decided to do some modeling, which you can check it out here!
Results in our Chassis
Lastly but no least, we decided to design a new toehold switch for expression in our chassis, P. agglomerans! For that purpose, we needed to change the promoter and cotransform our bacteria with these new plasmids.
We then replaced the T7 promoter by a lac promoter from both the switch and trigger RNA, resulting in two new parts: BBa_K2486177 and BBa_K2486179 To evaluate if these new system could actually work in P. agglomerans, we decided to do some microscopy!
For our surprise, the new chassis was not only able to be cotransformed with the new plasmids but also to exhibit a toehold-switch like behavior!
Figure 6 - Microscopy study of our P. agglomerans strain . Analysis was performed by a Leica DMI8 epi-fluorescent microscope using a 60x high NA objective, 500ms at 30% intensity exposure time. Images were analysed by ""MicrobeJ"" plugin in ImageJ."

Duke,2017,Team:Duke#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"able variant had a value of -0.149. GRAVY values that are more positive are more hydrophobic. The thermostable variant is 1.6 times more hydrophobic than the wild type variant.
THERMOSTABILITY HEAT TRIALS
The purpose of this experiment was to test the melting temperature (denature temperature) of the confirmed thermostable griffithsin samples.
Aliquots of each sample were then heated at high temperatures (50,60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 90 degree celcius) for 30 and 60 minutes. The results were analyzed using SDS-PAGE.
Figure 5: Monomer GRFT for 30 minutes
Figure 6: 12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel. Thermostable Dimer Griffithsin for 30 minutes
Figure 7: 12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel. Thermostable Dimer Griffithsin for 60 minutes
Figure 8: 12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel. Thermostable Monomer for 60 minutes
Demonstration of Thermostability
Each thermostable griffithsin sample—monomer and dimer—displayed a band at ~35 kDa, confirming expression of Griffithsin. Furthermore, the band was not present in the empty vector well of any of the gels.
As both dimer and monomeric form were visible on the gel and thus stable until 75 degrees celsius when heated 30 minutes. The more stable dimer form was stable until 90 degrees celsius.
At 60 minutes, both types of Griffithsin were stable until 75 degrees celsius.
Importance
The wildtype melting temperature of Griffithsin is 78 degrees celsius. Our maximum melting temperature of 90 degrees celsius represents a >10 degree change in melting temperature.
Since, the majority of E. coli proteins denature around 60 degrees celsius. Our results indicate that a thermostable version will allow for a heat purification—for up to 30 minutes at 90 degrees celsius—of fermentations to eliminate contaminating E. coli native protein. This allows for a degree of heat purification significantly greater than that using the wild-type Griffithsin.

This meetup took place the 24th to the 26th of april, where all of the other danish teams participated. The core of this meetup was a biobrick workshop, which took place in the DTU laboratory. This workshop was meant as an introduction for how to build a biobrick. A lot of the team members do nott have much experience with wet lab before iGEM, so this was also a general “how to”-guide for wet lab.  But the meetup also consisted of lectures about ‘How to do - Wiki’ and some cosy social games and a dinner.
The Nordic Jamboree was hosted by the Uppsala iGEM team in collaboration with the Stockholm iGEM Team. This took place at University of Uppsala from the 24th to the 26th of July and a lot of the nordic iGEM teams participated in this event. The main event of this meetup was the Nordic iGEM Jamboree competition, which was held on the 25th. The competition was meant as a chance to practise for the Giant Jamboree in Boston. The winning team of the Nordic Jamboree would receive The Golden Pipette. Other than this the event consisted of workshops, social events, and a dinner saturday evening with a following barcrawl.
After the Nordic Jamboree we were contacted by the Uppsala iGEM team. They needed help to find information on how many teams that had been using antibodies in their projects. This turned out to be a win-win situation, since we could use the data in our Business Plan ). We also helped the 2015 iGEM team from d'Aix Marseille Université by spreading their survey about chewing gum. We earned a silver medal for our efforts.

Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample"

1.Introduction
1.1 Why do we need a model
Developing a mathematical model of the systems we established (or plan to establish) is a vital step in our project. A model, namely, is a mathematical representation of the system. The model can help us with the following:
- Confirming that our system has the potential to work as expected. For example, as for the Test System, the model should present us that both the self-activating component and safety-catch component work in theory.
- Determining optimal conditions for the system to work. e.g. Initial concentration of AHL.
- Estimating biological parameters.
- Understanding the mechanism of the system better.
- Optimizing the design of our final project.
1.2 What is our model about?
The model is basically established by using ODEs (ordinary differential equations) to describe reactions and events in the system. ODE is a powerful tool when it comes to modelling a dynamic system. It allows us to predict the behavior of the system at given conditions, and to analyze several features of the system such as robustness and stability. For the sake of simplicity, various assumptions are made when developing the model. These assumptions usually tend to simplify our systems, reducing our workload. According to the assumptions, many trivial details are omitted, while the overall properties and behaviors of the model remain unchanged.
When describing the reactions and events involved, we mainly apply the law of mass action, which assumes the system is in quasi steady state. When modelling reactions that resemble enzymatically catalyzed reactions and events that involve ligand binding, we refer to Hill Equation, which is simple but effective.
We focused on building a model for the “Test System”. The model depicts the behaviors of the Test System under several different conditions, and highlights some key features and properties of the system. The model is generally successful as it predicted the behavior of the system correctly, according to our experiments. We have performed various analysis regarding the model and pinpointed some intriguing characteristics of the system.
In addition to this, we also built a model for the Neon System. Using the model, we can simulate how Neon System works. It can serve as a “guideline” for our future work on the Neon System.
2. Model Development —— Test System
2.1 Overview
In the following sections, we will explain how we developed our model of the Test System and present our results. Figure 1 offers an intuitive explanation of the way our Test System works. It can be seen that the system would act differently (perform different functions) under different conditions. Our goal is to"
Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"The sequencing results revealed the right sequence! We have a infectious phage containing EL222. To determine the phage titer of the Opto_SP_Klon-8 supernatant, a Blue Plaque Assay was performed.
According to this plaque assay the titer of the Opto_SP_Klon-8 supernatant is 2.6*1015 PFU/ml.
AP Opto
The purified APs (2x AP_light, 2x AP-dark) were sent to GATC for Sanger sequencing (using primer JM_065_rev). The sequencing results revealed the right sequence! We have the right AP containing the promoters pBLind and pBLrep in front of gene III. Next, growths of AP_light-1 and AP_dark-1 were prepared in 4 ml 2xYT medium with carbenicillin. Plasmids were purified using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit. Trafos were performed transforming AP_light and AP_dark in S1030 and S1030 containing MP6. After one hour recovery in SOC, cells were plated on the respective plate.
Only the plate with AP_dark in S1030 cells contained cultures, which were very close and had to be plated on an other plate. Trafos were repeated with different strains, recovery media, plates, and purifications without success. A restriction double digest of the APs with HindIII-HF and SpeI-HF was performed and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The expected bands were slightly visible on the gel, but also smear.

Simplification of Blue Plaque Assays
A 50 ml E. coli culture (ID:47) was cultivated in 2xYT with carbenicillin until an OD600 of 0.8. 3 ml of this culture were used to perform a Blue Plaque Assay. The remaining culture was put on ice for 10 min and was afterwards stored at 4 °C in the fridge. On the following five days, a Blue Plaque Assay was performed in the evening. Every Plaque Assay contained the 10-11 dilution of the Dickinson phage target 133 (1x1015 PFU/ml) in triplicates and a negative control. The plaque assays were performed using the E. coli culture from the fridge. Plaque assays worked for four days with a similar number of plaques. Therefore, it is confirmed that E. coli cultures for plaque assays can be stored in the fridge for at least four days.

Experimental Procedure 1
Cell extracts were prepared from E. coli BL21 cells using sonication. A CFPS supplement premix solution was prepared as above, except the salts were omitted. Separate solutions for each salt were prepared and added to each CFPS reaction according to the main effects screening design. Reactions were performed as above and CFPS activity was measured as fluorescence at each time point minus fluorescence at 15 mins (Figure 4). Endpoint data was then used, along with the JMP software, to build a model predicting the important factors (Figure 5).
Figure 4: CFPS activity of CFPS reactions with salt concentrations according to the main effects screening design (table 2) was determined as fluorescence intensity at each time point minus fluorescence intensity at the 15 minute time point. Reaction IDs are described in table 2.
Figure 5: Screening model constructed using JMP showing which factors were closest to significance. Predictions for interactions are unreliable due to forced orthogonality (*). Of the primary factors, magnesium glutamate is the closest to significant, followed by potassium glutamate, sodium oxalate, and ammonium acetate in that order.
Design Stage 2
Figure 6: Comparison of four surface response designs generated by the JMP software using the compare designs feature. From top to bottom: design type, number of reactions required by the design, colour map on correlations, Power analysis of terms, efficiencies, and average prediction variance. For the colour map on correlations, red is highly correlated and blue is highly un-correlated.
The three salts which the screening design determined as being the most important (magnesium glutamate, potassium glutamate, and sodium oxalate) were analysed further. A surface response design was used to help determine optimal concentrations for each salt in the CFPS supplement premix solution. The JMP software was used to create a classical surface response design for magnesium glutamate, potassium glutamate, and sodium oxalate. Each factor was given a lower limit of 0.5 times their ‘normal’ concentration, and an upper limit of 1.5 times their ‘normal’ concentration. Four types of surface response designs were constructed and compared (Figure 6 - see our modelling page for more information). Ultimately the central composite design – orthogonal was chosen. The list of experiments determined by this design are shown in Table 3.

Evolution stepped in accordingly. Why waste evergy maintaining a process as complex as the immune system when it served no function? By 2090 the aveage white cell count was down 60%. By 2150 no had a white blood cell to speak of.
Looking back, I find it ironic that the isolation we strive for was the very thing that brought the attention of the entire world on us. My name is Jeremiah Catz, I was a member of an isolationist community of Hasidic Jews in the southern tip of South Africa. We were relatively few. Around 1200 of us. The world we lived in was one of change. With each passing the day the world became a different place. New technologies were being developed at an incredible pace, the technology developed one year were left entirely obsolete by the developments of the next. In a world like this, where nothing is constant, no one is sure of anything. Nothing seems real. You feel as if you are living your life in eternal sleep,always shifting between dreams. Or so I've been told. When our community formed in the year 2020, it was was founded on the principal that the key to a prosperous and wholesome life could not be found in the world that was growing around it. Instead the community chose to revoke modern technology altogether and build a society founded upon the principles of hard work and tradition. None of the technologies we had were invented after 1930, and all our food we farmed and raised ourselves. Our community gradually cut off almost all ties with the rest of the world. As a result, IVIS never reached us. We still had the immune system that God gave us.
2165, the year of the epidemic. Humanities greatest test. No one was immune. The virus was relentless. IVIS had no response. People began dying in droves. The virus attacked the mind first, the victims mental faculties were completely depleted in a matter of days. Death followed shortly after. No one was immune. No one except us. We were different. Maybe it was that we were still human and the rest of the world wasn't. Maybe this was God's way of asserting his will, his way of punishing mankind. I wont say that there wasn't a small sentiment of validation, smugness, maybe even satisfaction within some members of the community when the situation was fully understood. The outside world that we so reproached with their fancy vacuum cleaners and such was coming crashing down, and we, we"

Hexahistidine encapsulin was first expressed in our cell free expression system, that was supplemented with Promega’s lysine BODIPY, following our BODIPY fluorescence expression protocol. This way some of lysine residues present in our                   protein construct would be fluorescently labeled, making the the whole construct fluorescently labeled.
After expression and purification, the correct expression of Hexahistidine encapsulin and the correct incorporation of fluorescent lysines was checked by performing an SDS PAGE and fluorescently imaging the gel (Figure 1). This fluorescent                   image suggests that we have a fluorescent band just below the 32 kDa ladder band, for both HH encapsulin B and HH encapsulin S, but not in the negative control (N.C. in Fig. 1). This indicates the presence of encapsulin at its expected                   size of 31 kDa. The image also suggests the presence of fluorescent bands of high weight for HH encapsulin B and HH encapsulin S, but not N.C. These high bands refer to a very high molecular weight, which we believe indicates the presence                   of the encapsulin multimer (M.W. ~ 1.8 MDa). This gel image serves as a proof that we are able to express fluorescent HH encapsulin.
Figure 12: Fluorescent Image of an SDS PAGE gel of the encapsulin expressed in cell free transcription-translation system (TX-TL system) with Lysine-BODIPY. This expression was performed to generate the encapsulin to be used for validation                     of vaccine uptake by dendritic cells. Imaging filters used were those for measuring fluorescein λex = 494 nm, λem= 512 nm. The first lane is a fluorescent ladder. The second lane (N.C.) is for a negative control (cell free reaction                     with no DNA template supplied). Third lane (HH encapsulin B) is Hexahistidine encapsulin expressed in the TX-TL system supplied with Lysine BODIPY before purification (B stands for Before purification). The fourth lane (HH encapsulin                     S) is Hexahistidine encapsulin expressed in the TX-TL system supplied with Lysine BODIPY after applying our purification protocol (S stands for the Supernatant generated post heat purification).
Murine bone marrow derived dendritic cells were obtained from the LBI lab at EPFL.

However, we will also attempt one extra ""treatment"", which is carrying out the same ""treatment"", but without the addition of lysozyme. What we are trying to achieve here, is how great an effect lysozyme has on the spores as can been seen in the results section below.
The drawn-on sections for the single colonies of the transformations.
Also, we intend to plate out our transformed Bacillus subtilis onto starch plates so that we can carry out the iodine test on it to see if it has truly transformed. The rational and steps to carrying out the iodine test has been explained above by the Metal Sensor Team. The only difference is that our team only plated out 21 colonies; Square 1 contained the wild type Bacillus subtilis, which Square 2 to 21 contained the Bacillus subtilis transformed with gfp-rrnb as can be seen in the results section below.
Results
Recovery of cwlD Spores
The results were taken the following day , and the experiment seem to have been a success, as seen in the following photos.
This time round, the results observed seem to be more reasonable as compared to Wednesday, 12th August , as the control plate was not overgrown with colonies. This is probably due to the fact that the spores were ""treated"" as per normal, just without the addition of lysozyme. When lysozyme is added, it would disrupt the cell wall, thus it was thought that it would be a critical factor, which has been proved via this experiment.
cwlD mutant plates, control and concentration = 1
Observing the colonies growing on the plates, the experiment seems to be a success as the plate with a concentration of 1 has the most number of colonies, and the plate with a concentration of 10-1 has less colonies than the plate with a concentration of 1.
The same pattern is observed for the other plates. The lower concentration plates have less colonies growing on it, which can be seen in the following pictures.
cwlD mutant plates, concentration = 10-1 and 10-2.
cwlD mutant plates, concentration = 10-3 and 10-4.

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

Orthogonal ribosomes are a kind of ribosomes that have been engineered and reprogrammed. In our project, we mainly focus on the binding interaction between mRNA and the 16S ribosomal RNA(rRNA), hoping to create an isolate translation system. In the phase of translation, ribosome small subunit find the RBS(ribosome binding site) on the mRNA to start to translate. While the altered 16S rRNA can only recognize and bind to an altered Shine-Dalgarno sequence, which then initiates the translation of the downstream gene.
Since the 16S rRNA and the SD sequence is mutated and different from the endogenous system, the orthogonal ribosome’s control of translation is separated from the host’s.

Examination of the characteristic of the orthogonal ribosome, including feasibility, orthogonality and compatibility with the ribosome of the host and the other orthogonal ribosome.
Prepration for the combination of our negative feedback loop and orthogonal ribosome.
Introduction of 2 new orthogonal ribosomes and 3 new orthogonal RBS to the iGEM community.
Update of the BioBrick Registry library by designing a tool kit plasmid containing orthogonal RBS that the target gene can easily cloned into.
Overview
Our engineered cells need a three-node Negative Feedback Loop to construct a more sensitive and high-fidelity control system.
Nevertheless, since there is limited resource in the engineered cells, there has to be a resource competition between the host genome and exogenous target gene. This kind of competition will finally induce unexpected interaction which will result in negative correlation between the input signal and output signal.
This means, if we put the output gene downstream the part B, the transcription of the target gene will be well regulated, and the amount of mRNA will follow the input signal well. However, because of the resource competition mentioned before, the translational level regulation will be disrupted, in this case, the expression of the target gene is not as expected.

Our approach
To solve this problem, we introduce orthogonal ribosome into our system. Since"

Week 4: June 17 - June 21
Monday: Finally starting development on an actual product! We're diving into creating a web app using HTML, CSS, jQuery, you name it! But first...I needed to go through tutorials on HTML and CSS. I had some brief experience with HTML and CSS when I had a Xanga blog back in middle school, but I don't really count that as web design experience. By the end of the day, I got the hang of how HTML and CSS work together to create web pages.
Tuesday: We held another brainstorming session while Tiffany and Evan went to meet with the Eugene team at BU. We came up with yet another idea for a user interface (I'm starting to realize there's lots of iteration involved in user interface design!), and we fleshed out the specific components we need before building our product. Better to plan out a general outline before building so we don't wind up working with spaghetti code.
Wednesday: I practiced more HTML and CSS by creating a ""home page"" for users who log into our web app, Eugenie. I'm really starting to see how HTML and CSS work in tandem to create web pages. You really can't have one without the other.
Thursday: Half the Eugenie team had been working on drag and drop since Monday and today they continued working on adding more functionality to their project. I was involved in creating a paper prototype and recording a video of how we expect Eugenie to work for preliminary demonstrations.
Friday: Continued working on our web app, and ended the day with a group dinner at TGI Friday's and then going to the movies to watch Monster's University. Great end to a productive week!
Week 5: June 24 - June 28
Monday: The layout of our web app needs to incorporate multiple ""views"", so the main display needs to be divided into sections with sliding bars to adjust the size of each section. We also need dynamically updating divs so each section can ""live update"" when one section is changed. Apparently this is a lot trickier than it seems, because we've been using jQuery, which is tricky to use with dynamically updating elements.
Tuesday: We're learning about using AngularJS in addition to jQuery to guide our development of Eugenie. It's kind of overwhelming to learn yet another JavaScript framework after just starting to"

What is it?
Synthetic Biology has many definitions. Being a novel discipline, it has many approaches, logics, and philosophies. Here we briefly present some of them.
Wikipedia
""Synthetic biology is a new area of biological research that combines science and engineering. Synthetic biology encompasses a variety of different approaches, methodologies and disciplines, and many different definitions exist. What they all have in common, however, is that they see synthetic biology as the design and construction of new biological functions and systems not found in nature.""
SyntheticBiology.org
Synthetic Biology is:
A) the design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems, and
B) the re-design of existing, natural biological systems for useful purposes.
Christina Smolke
""The application of engineering design principles to do construction, characterization, and design of biological systems""
If you don't know who Christina Smolke is, ask Drew Endy...
Our View
We, the UNAM-Genomics_Mexico Team think Synthetic Biology is more a way of viewing biology than anything else. We see cells as hyper-complex machines composed of simple sub-machines. It is a form of thinking much like Systems Biology. As cells are therefore chassis for machinery, one can re-organize said machinery with parts from a different chassis, or create new parts to import into the chassis. In some ways, we think as engineers.
Of course, sooner or later we have to incorporate the biological perspective to explain the chaos inside the chassis, the reason why plasmids refuse to work, why cells refuse to grow...

Date: Jul. 23, 2018 Location: National Chiao Tung University
Our team went to NCTU to participate in an iGEM meetup with one NCTU team and two NTHU teams this morning. We listed some questions from them and the answers. Q1. Which living things are you going to apply this system to? A1. We are going to apply the AMP reporter system to mosquitoes as a biosensor. Q2. Why are you using mosquitoes? It seems to have many problems using mosquitoes. A2. Mosquitoes can act as a natural syringe. They’re tiny and easy to carry, and they’re naturally good at collecting blood. Most importantly, it is biodegradable compared to other syringes. Q3. What are the advantages of your method compared to saliva samples? Using saliva samples is as convenient, too. A3. The windows period of saliva samples is three months. On the other hand, our method is only one to two weeks. (When infected by HIV, it takes some time to produce HIV antibody. Before it produces enough antibodies for us to detect it, the result would be negative. The time before it produces enough antibodies is called windows period.) Q4. How about your mosquitoes are reluctant to suck blood? A4. We had discussed this question with Dr. Tseng, a mosquito expert working at NCHU. According to his explanation, mosquitoes from the laboratory are always willing to suck blood during daytime. If you place your hand into the mosquito breeding cage, they will suck your blood in five minutes. Keeping the mosquitoes in a hungry state can increase the possibility of mosquitoes sucking blood.
Then we visited the biological technology laboratory at NCTU. We saw many equipment there, including those that Mingdao lab doesn’t have.

How will we assay the enzyme and screen for gluten?
Before we move our engineered yeast into beer, it will be necessary to determine whether or not the enzyme is performing as expected. In 2011 the UW iGEM team assayed mutated Kumamolisin-As using fluorescence. We hope to repeat their tests in the lab using the peptide sequence PQPQLP with attached fluorophore and quencher. When the sequence is cleaved, the fluorophore will be separated from the quencher and will fluoresce. Ideally our results will resemble Washington’s.
Once we have determined whether the enzyme is present, and how active it is, the next step will be to assess how well it can break down the naturally occurring peptides found in beer. Studies have shown that the brewing process breaks native gluten proteins into smaller peptides, some of which are still immunogenic. However, it will still be necessary to confirm that Kumamolisin-As can manage these peptides and neutralize their toxicity. To do so, we have prepared a competitive ELISA to detect the presence of gluten antigens after incubation with Kumamolisin-As.
What will be the effects of the secreted protein on beer?

Finally, our project involved combining the work of other subteams to verify the localization of our constructs in the peroxisome and analyze the effects they have on the import. Therefore, we are using the superfolded-GFP protein, another fluorescent marker, which is in our case fused to the peroxisomal import sequence PTS1, and a version of Pex11 that is fused to the fluorescent marker Venus. Both markers emit light in the green light spectrum, were as mRuby2 emits light in the red part of the spectrum, giving us a strong contrast and an easy way of differentiating between the two under the fluorescent microscope.
To physically create our constructs, we researched the DNA sequences of bacteriorhodopsin , Pex3 and PEX26 via UniProt and pre-designed our fusion constructs with the software tool „Geneious“. We ordered the synthesis of three separate parts ( Pex3 , PEX26 and Pex3 -BacR) from IDT. To ease out the process of assembling our plasmids, we used the „ Dueber Toolbox "", containing various parts such as promoters and terminators, to tailor the plasmids specific to your needs. Finally, to combine all the selected parts, we used the „Golden Gate” assembly method.
Secretion
For the peroxisome secretion in S. cerevisiae we designed fusion proteins of the v-SNARE Snc1 with different peroxisomal membrane anchors. We tested the constructs using a GUS Assay. The assays were performed using transformants of the strain BY4742.
Experimental Design
We will adapt the system of  Sagt and colleagues  to secrete the content of our modified compartments (Sagt et al, 2009) .
For the application of this system in S. cerevisiae we use a truncated version of the v-SNARE Snc1 to decorate our compartments (Figure 3.1) (Gerst et al, 1997) .

Little leakage in Gaussia luciferase expression
We investigate the inductility of the Pu promoter to ensure that the gaussia luciferase is not constitutively produce in our biosensor. To do so we compared the bioluminescence intensity of bacteria containing our biosensor to the bioluminescence intensity of bacteria transformed with a genetic construction that do not contain the Gaussia luciferase gene (BB12 : Pr-RBS-XylR).
The obtained results (figure 6) indicate that the gaussia luciferase gene is not produce in a constitutive manner in the cells. The bioluminescence intensity of our biosensor without toluene injection (158.86 RLU) is a little higher than the bioluminescence intensity of cells transformed with BB12 (53.14 RLU). However this bioluminescence intensity is significantly lower than the bioluminescence intensity of the cells transformed with our biosensor in presence of toluene (results presented in the next section)

Due to the little LB background noise and leakage in gaussia luciferase synthesis, obtain bioluminescence intensity results were treated as followed.

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a"

Hide ODEs
We visualize these ODE's in the Simbiology Toolbox which results in the following diagram:
2.1 Cell B
The system of Cell B is also under control of the cI repressor and is activated similar as cell A. The activation by the temperature raise, leads to the production of LuxR. AHL of the medium can diffuse into the cell, binding LuxR and activating the next component of the circuit. This leads to the production of CheZ and PenI. CheZ is the protein responsible for cells to make a directed movement, governed by the repellent Leucine. PenI is a repressor which will shut down the last part of the circuit which was responsible for the production of RFP.
We can extract the following ODEs for Cell B from this sytem:
$$\frac{{\large d} m_{cI}}{d t} = \alpha_1 {\cdot} cI_{gene} - d_1 {\cdot} m_{cI}$$  $$\frac{{\large d}{cI}}{d t} = \beta_1 {\cdot} {cI} -2 {\cdot} {k_{cI,dim}} {\cdot} {cI}^2 + 2 {\cdot}{k_{-cI,dim}}{\cdot}     {[cI]_2} - d_{cI} {\cdot} {cI} $$

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#KeyDeletion_-_-_TEXT.html," system to perform efficient    genome editing of Bacillus subtilis. The plasmid (pJOE8999) is used as    a shuttle vector with - a pUC origin of replication for E. coli, a    kanamycin resistance gene and a temperature-sensitive replication    origin from the plasmid pE194ts. [1] This plasmid carries the Cas9 gene    under the transcriptional regulation of a mannose-inducible promoter    PmanP. The sgRNA is transcribed under a semisynthetic promoter PvanP,    interrupted by the loop terminator and the T7 promoter (T7P). The Cas9    and sgRNA genetic elements allow the plasmid to be used a genome    editing tool, see Figure 2.
Fig 3. Plasmid pJOE8999 redesigned for our project.
For application in our project, the idea was to replace the PmanP    with the tetracycline-repressible promoter PtetR. The pTetR promoter is    constitutively on and is repressed by TetR. The repression can be    inhibited by the addition of tetracycline [5] .
With the help of the sgRNA Designer tool (Broad Institute) we were    able to design the 20-nucleotide spacer sequence of the sgRNA. This    sgRNA guides the Cas9 to its target, in our case the key or the    message [1] . The 700-bp amplified from B. subtilis serves as the DNA    template (PAM-motif) for amyE.
If the spores containing the message or the key escape into the    environment, the CRISPR/Cas9 system will be activated due to the    constitutively on pTetR and the targeted area, which contains the key    sequence in our case, will be deleted. The same applies if the spores    are in possession by unauthorized parties who are unaware of adding    tetracycline to inactivate the pTetR promoter. This addresses the    issues pertaining to access of the message and key by unauthorized    parties, and also prevents genetically modified bacteria from spreading    in the environment. Therefore, this system has potential to be applied    in any other genetically modified B. subtilis.

Environment Consideration and Assessment
We interviewed several chemical companies to ensure they take environment protection into consideration in their manufacture.
According to Xintong Chemical Industry, they have several methods to measure the poisonousness of pesticide, such as feeding mice with pesticide. To measure the effect on environment, they feed bees, birds, and fish with pesticide, then get the information from their behavior. To measure the residual of pesticide, they will feed the mice with leaves which were sprayed with pesticide for some time. Also, they detect the residual in soil, water, air in lab directly.
As for Changxing First Chemical Industry, which mainly produces active compound of atrazine, they follow the toxicity information provided by National Standard instead of measuring those data by themselves. Atrazine is considered to be a low toxicity, both the product and raw material. They have never got any information or complaint about atrazine residual doing harm to human or animals. But to take environment protection into consideration and assessment, their production is limited to 5000t atrazine every year, and they have to deal with their industrial wastes carefully, which accounts for their 20% in total degression. Both chemical and biological methods are used to deal their wastes. Here is schematic diagram. The secretary of the party committee of Changxing First Chemical Indsutry told us,”The government of Zhejiang Province is strict to environment protection.”
Application for Our Seek & Degrade System
To make sure whether our Seek & Degrade System can be used in industry, we interviewed those industries’ staff and managers, and stepped into their factories to do researches. Our system may be used in both degrading the atrazine residual in soil and factory sewage. The manager of Xinnong Chemical Industry recommended that we should make our bacteria into dry powder, which can be used more conveniently.
It is a big challenge to apply our system into industry. First, we have to make sure that our bacteria is safe to environment, which has been taken into consideration by E-coli suicide design and CaCO3 shell. Secondly, we have to ensure that our bacteria can be stored long enough and are easy to be switched from stored to working state. To solve these problems, we hypothesize that we can package our bacteria into a shell, such as CaCO3 or macromolecules, which can be made into dry powder. Bacteria are released if we change the pH of solution, by which they can be"

Project Description
Overview & Introduction
Microfluidics is the scientific field which studies the manipulation of small amounts of fluids on the scale of microliters and nanoliters. Engineered systems have been created to move and manipulate these fluids within microfluidic devices. The application of microfluidics in synthetic biology research will enable scientists to design and implement synthetic biology systems more efficiently and with greater reproducibility. Currently, these devices have been incorporated in fields such as genetic analysis, DNA amplification, cell-based assays and analysis, point-of-care diagnostics, drug discovery, and more.
Problem Statement
While microfluidics is not new to the field of synthetic biology, it is not currently widely used or accessible to many benchtop biologists. The current “lab on a chip” microfluidic devices are highly specialized to each experiment and expensive to manufacture. In order to analyze the results of the experiments on microfluidic chips, many designs embed sensors directly into the chip. Many of these sensors, however, already exist in traditional analytical devices, such as plate readers. These devices could be used for analysis of microfluidic outputs if the outputs were dispensed selectively into a compatible vessel, such as a microtiter plate. If this were possible, synthetic biologists would be able to incorporate microfluidic chips to streamline their experiments without sinking time and money to design and fabricate highly specialized chips. Therefore an application agnostic system that selectively dispenses outputs into vessels currently use in traditional benchtop biology would result in a more efficient method for performing analysis.
Our Project
Our project, Terra, aims to create an automated system that bridges benchtop biology and microfluidics. Terra is comprised of three main components:
Microfluidics: A microfluidic chip designed to execute a desired biological experiment.
Hardware: A low-cost, accessible XY-translational stage that selectively dispenses the output of the microfluidic chip to a 96-well plate and automated control syringes.
Software: A software interface that will allow the user to detail the parameters of the experiment run on the chip; the specific location per output on the 96-well plate; and the amount of each output dispensed.
