Whilst this does seem like a mountainous flaw in the objective of our project, it need not be. Rather, it provides our team with the chance to explore and design some novel, groundbreaking techniques in biosensor design to circumvent this “problem.”
Furthermore, viewing our project in this way neglects the crucial engineering phase in the development of any new technology. E.coli is the host for our biocircuit in the context of the lab, and is essential in proving the fundamental scientific function of the isolated Mycobacterium NBB4 genes EtnR1 and EtnR2. That’s not to say, however, that E.coli must play a part in the transition of this biotechnology from lab to market. One of the biggest potential areas for further research, and what our team envisions for this technology in the future is the development of a cell-free biosensor.
Technology Review
When assessing currently available and emerging technologies, there are many ways to potentially immobilise whole cells such that a functional biosensor can be developed with a much lower, if not completely negligible, biosafety risk. This is a realistic and reasonable phase of development before advancing to a cell-free model.
Polymer anchoring
A simple and established method of enclosing cells, enzymes and proteins into sensing devices is through anchoring of these molecules into various polymers. There are many examples of these, including polyacrimide, agar, agarose and chistosan (Close et. al., 2009). Immobilisation occurs due to affinity interactions (Cosnier and Holzinger, 2010), however reaction times are often slow because of diffusion through the polymer (Close et. al., 2009).
Sol-gels
Sol-gel is the name given to a class of materials that are formed when a three-dimensional network is formed out of solid particles that are suspended in a liquid as a colloid (Brinker and Scherer, 2013). These gels are most commonly silica-based, and can be described as ‘porous glass gels’ (Close et. al., 2009). Bakul et. al. (1994) presented that silicon sol-gels can effectively trap and immobilize proteins in their matrix with minimal impact on the function, specificity or selectivity of the protein. However, Kuncova et al. (2004) emphasises that the encapsulation process is not optimal for whole cell as the silicon content can result in cell toxicity, while Flinkinger et. al. (2007) attributed increased cell death to alcohol toxicity when"

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," with 4 transcriptional units. For the ori we chose ColEI, which has a broad host range and a high copy number in V. natriegens and E. coli ( link to ori characterization of the part collection ) (Jain et al. 2013) ).   We decided for that one, because V. natriegens shall be a chassis for testing pathway variants, which then maybe will be transferred into other strains, therefore a broad host range vector is reasonable.   For accBC and accD we chose the promoter J23106 and for mcr the promoter J23109 according to the model. For birA we also chose J23109 as promoter, because BirA is only relevant for activation of
Acc
and not for direct reaction catalysis. For ribosome binding sites and terminators, we used the same for each coding region, because otherwise we would have fluctuations which weren’t considered in the model.   An illustration of the plasmid is shown in figure 5.
Figure 5: Composition of our rationally designed pathway plasmid with the Marburg Collection
The scheme shows the composition of the level 2 plasmid, containing four transcriptional units for accBC, accD, birA and mcr. We chose the promoters according to the metabolic link to model section to achieve optimized expression strengths.
Pathway library
For the second approach of pathway design, where we build a whole library, we also used the Marburg to combine different promoters, ribosome binding sites and coding regions.   In theory, the toolbox enables the plasmid assembly of 21780 different part combinations per transcriptional unit (22 promoters x 5 rbs
RBS
x 6 terminators x 3 oris x  11 resistance cassettes; connectors weren’t considered).   For a plasmid containing accBC, accD, birA and mcr that would make 6 x 1012 possible constructs, but assembly of so many versions is irrational. The better way is to select a few parts which are combined and then for the most promising versions one can think of more combinations.   Therefore, we focused on eight promoters and three ribosome binding sites with different strengths. Our idea was to build pathway plasmids containing the whole pathway, as well as plasmids containing only the acetyl-CoA carboxylase genes or only the mcr gene, which can then be cotransformed (Table 1).   To enable cotransformation, we used the oris ColEI and p15a, which are compatible"

Integrated practices
Interviews with experts
Introduction
Human practice has been a cornerstone in our iGEM project right from the start. We have spent a great deal of time educating others about our project. We have been able to use the feedback to improve our presentation and get ideas for new future perspectives, as well as avoiding any potential pitfalls. We have also been reaching out to companies and experts in different fields to get a more qualified view on our work. The information they gave, helped and gave us new goals and expanded our knowledge about the different sub elements. By interviewing all these experts and companies, we have gained insight into today's market and we can observe that there is a demand for developing new solutions to old problems, of which our sub elements have great potential.
Projects
Evaluation from KOLD College
We finished our visit at KOLD College with an evaluation in order to get a better idea of our performance and project. We received constructive feedback on Bacto-Aid. The students showed awareness abou the problems antimicrobial resistance. It was rewarding to see, that we are trying to solve an issue that society worries about. We reflected on the comments and have integrated the feedback into our future presentations. Some examples of feedback were: ""There is a lot of potential in these areas"". The future potential for the different parts of the project tended to give a positive response. Therefore, we added a slideshow exclusively for the potentials of the sub projects. ""It lacks focus on problematics"". We took this comment into consideration and decided to start the presentation with an explanation of why this area still needs a solution. The feedback helped us especially with finding a fixed focal point throughout the presentation.
Interviewing Laura Jakobsen
We interviewed the nurse Laura Jakobsen who is working at the plastic surgery department at the University Hospital of Odense (OUH). In Denmark, burn patients are mainly sent to OUH and Rigshospitalet (another major hospital unit in our country). She helped us understand what kind of issues the hospitals are facing when treating wounds, and the requirements needed for a functional Bacto-Aid. At OUH, they have encountered resistant bacterial infections, which required special care and extra awareness. This confirms the problem of resistance and proving how actual the problem is.

The structure of the fruiting body is sporangia containing a lot of spores on the cells called stalk. The stalk is made of dead cells which have a vacuole developed and secrete cellulose. (5th stage)  Slime mold is repeats this lifecycle.
We have focused on these characteristic morphological changes of slime mold, and hope to develop a multi-step adjustment course by using morphological changes in the slime mold. As a concrete plan, at this stage, we produce a pigment to a slime mold and to change the color of the slime mold in each stage of the form change.The above-mentioned items are the current plans of team KIT-Kyoto.

Engineering a limonene production pathway of E.coli
Why Produce Limonene?
Limonene is a 10-carbon monoterpene found in the oils of citrus fruits.  It is used as a cleaning agent, solvent, and food additive, and recent research has shown it has potential anti-cancer applications. Limonene also possesses the chemical properties of an ideal biofuel; its low freezing point, combustibility, and high energy density make it a potential jet fuel replacement. Currently, industrial production is restricted to direct extraction from citrus fruits, preventing collection in quantities large enough to be useful as a biofuel. Other organisms, such as Escherichia coli , could be used to produce limonene more effectively and efficiently.
The Mevalonate Pathway
The mevalonate pathway, found in plants and fungi, produces 3-isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) from acetyl-CoA. IPP and DMAPP are the building blocks of the isoprenoids, a group of organic molecules with a wide array of functions. These compounds are normally synthesized in small amounts, preventing large-scale production; by moving the mevalonate pathway into E. coli this limitation can be circumvented. The Keasling lab at UC-Berkeley used this approach to produce the isoprenoid amorphadiene, which can be converted into the antimalarial drug artemisinin. This breakthrough brought the price of artemisinin down dramatically for treatment in the developing world.
We have constructed a strain containing the mevalonate pathway, a codon-optimized geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS), and a codon-optimized limonene synthase gene. The plasmid pBba5c contains the genes for the mevalonate pathway under a lactose-inducible promoter. The plasmid originally contained the unnecessary ispA gene; we used the Gibson cloning method to replace ispA with the GPP"

While it narrows down the number of candidates, 16s rRNA sequencing is not a reliable method to distinguish between Bacillus species 18 . Therefore, an SDS-PAGE gel of the protein extracts was prepared to further analyse them. This gel is shown in Figure 16; Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus thuringiensis were included as controls.

The yellow arrow indicates a band that was investigated with protein MS/MS – see Figure 17.
Proteomics analysis of isolate V82
Based on the previous results, isolate V82 had the most potential to be a putative mite pathogen. It is closely related to a known insect pathogen, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, which is known to produce a 100 kDa mosquitocidal toxin 19 . Our isolate also showed a strong band in the 100 kDa region (Figure 16). A new SDS-PAGE gel was prepared with independently grown V82 cultures and bands were cut out for peptide extraction, so the 100 kDa protein could be analysed with LC-MS/MS . Negative control bands were cut out approximately ~1 cM above the 100 kDa bands. MaxQuant 20 was used to analyze the data.

I have been working all week long with attTn7 analyses. When I found a problem I would just consider it since I had other priorities such us getting a RNA secondary structure and improving the Perl initial written program.
Week 7
I looked for other software different from TreeView to perform phylogenetic trees. I found several useful ones and I tried them all. I also looked for a platform to calculate logos. At the end of the week I ended up with trees and logos for all the alignments which I already had.
Week 8
I went to wet labs to keep them up-to-date about all my work. I also asked them for more ideas. The rest of the week I worked on getting all the results from the Tn7 system.
Week 9
During this week I finished all the structure-related analyses and I discussed the results with Antonio J. Pérez. We also had a group meeting, with all the members, in which we presented all the results and based on this, the group gave us some new interesting ideas.

To make sure the recA promoter was in front of lacZ, we first cut the SOS (recA) plasmid with EcoRI and SpeI, which left us the promoter all by itself, a 192 bp part.  We cut lacZ with EcoRI and XbaI, which cut out the piece of plasmid in front of lacZ, leaving a part about 5000 bp long.  After digestion, we ran our parts through an agarose gel, and purified the bands of the correct sizes (using a QIAGEN QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit).  Next in the process was ligation, again using materials from New England Biolabs.  Finally, the new plasmids were transformed into chemically competent DH5a cells.
Testing of the new bacteria to follow, as well as submission of the new part to the Registry.
For more detailed protocols, see the Notebook page.
Part 4: Results
We made the part, and sent it in!  See the Notebook/Project page, or the powerpoint/poster below for more details. Unfortunately, due to lack of funding and time, we were unable to test our part.  For the expected results, see the Modeling page.
Part 5: Safety Considerations
Our project is intended to raise the public's awareness of the lack of danger posed by bacterial mutations.  Our eventual hope would be that an application involving our living biosensor would be possible.  Our cloned bacteria are already engineered so that they cannot survive outside of a lab environment.  In other words, our protocol was entirely under Biosafety Level I (i.e., little or no health hazard).
At Purdue, the group in charge of recombinant DNA research is the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC).  In cooperation with them, we filled out a form detailing our entire protocol.  We then had to indicate any health hazards that could be posed by our project (which there were none).
Failed Ideas
In order to make a multicolored sensor, we would first need to obtain DNA coding for the promoters of uvrA (the first gene activated in NER) or phr.  Unfortunately, a complete analysis of the promoters of phr are not available, and uvrA is not part of the Registry, so we do not have access to it currently.  Ideally, the phr pathway"

Biofair
As a part of  human practices, we had conducted a small science fair and a social awareness campaign called the Biofair in a local park in collaboration with Team REC_CHENNAI.This was necessary to dispose the common misconception amongst the people that genetically modified organisms are generally  harmful and are not supposed to be released in the market. To do so we put up a stall and spoke to the public about GMO’s , their pros and cons and how rDNA technology can be used to produce safe GM products. After talking to us , they were convinced that GMO’s are safe and are essential for the future. At the end of the day we asked them to fill out a survey form , the results of which are shown in the pie chart.
In addition to  this, we explained about iGEM , synthetic biology and our previous iGEM project with the help of charts to illustrate an example of how a real life problem can be solved using synthetic biology. A large faction of the people who visited our stall were children. In order to instill the knowledge of science in them we conducted simple and interesting  science experiments like extraction of  DNA from strawberry. It was a very fun filled evening and we were able to reach out to a large public of mixed demographic, educating them about science and managed to bust some of the common myths about GMO’s.
Schools
Human practices is the key component and the most exciting part of any iGEM project where teams consider the many ways that their research can impact society.One of the most efficient ways of spreading knowledge is by teaching. Hence we decided to visit some schools in our locality to teach the students about the field of synthetic biology and how iGEM plays a major role in promoting this field.
At first we visited Bonne Nehru Higher Secondary School where we taught the students about the basics of microbiology and molecular biology. This sparked their interest in the subject and they were very eager to learn more about it. So we organized a one day workshop at our institution"

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#project_-_-_TEXT.html," [21] and we have inserted it into the assembled BioBrick device using PCR cloning. After the transfection of the receptor plasmids cells were stained with the following reagents: Hoechst dye for the nuclear staining at 405 nm; Alexa488-bioting to stain biotin binding proteins; mRuby3 which is a part of the receptor and is expected to show a membrane localization and Dy634-antiA3C5-Fab. The staining was followed by three washing steps with PBS. Following this staining procedure the cells were mounted on a confocal fluorescence microscope (Leica). The results for each fluorescence channel are given in the following figure (see Fig. ???).
Quantification of functionalized membrane proteins using flow cytometry
Fig.11 Flow cytometry data of stably integrated cells. Intrinsic mRuby fluorescence was measured as well as binding of a A3C5-tag specific Fab and of Biotin to single chain Avidin and enhanced monomeric Avidin.
To make sure the receptor is properly presented on the surface of the cells and to quantify the yield of stably transfected cells we used flow cytometry analysis.  The results presented in Fig. 11 show a positive signal in the rfp channel for the scAvidin and the eMA receptor bearing cells. As already observed in microscopy mRuby-fluorescence could not be detected for the BAP-receptor cells. But surprisingly about 40% where positive for Dy634, meaning that the A3C5 tag, against which the fluorophor labeled Fab is dierectet, must be present on the cell surface. This results suggest that there might be a problem about the folding of the mRuby beta-barrel leading to a loss of fluorescent activity.  For scA and eMA cells Dy634 signal has been positive albeit not as high as expected.  Another stain was the eGFP coupled with biotin giving a positive signal for scA and eMA to which the biotin binds. For BAP cells there was no signal since this receptor, is biotinylated by the BirA and doesn't cooperatively bind the Biotin. Moreover the biotin snd the dye are coupled via the C-terminal tail of the biotin leaving no contact point for the BirA to ligate the eGFP-biotin to the receptor's acceptor peptide.

Furthermore, we determined the mutation rate of our error prone polymerase I as well as of our genome wide mutator   BioBrick BBa_K2082117 by high-throughput sequencing.

Selection
The main selection system applied for the whole Evobody generator was a bacterial two-hybrid system. This method is able to select whole bacterial cultures based on their binding strength of the Evobody against a desired target. A lot of parameters of the system were checked by showing the interaction possibility of the positive controls, the binding of the cI DNA binding domain and the expression rate of the fusion proteins itself. However, the most important achievement was the demonstration of a whole working bacterial two-hybrid system.
Figure 3: Selection system
Modeling
With our mutagenesis system, we want to find the best adapted E. coli culture, and we want to find this culture as quickly as possible. Therefore, we looked for a tool that can predict, if the desired culture can be found at all, and, if yes, which culture will be the winner. Additionally, the prediction should provide optimal parameters for the laboratory, the best cultivation time and inoculation number. The program computes a minimal cultivation period of 8 hours and at least 11 inoculations, when an initial binder exists (figure 4).
Figure 4: Time between inoculations.
Fermentation
One of the fundamental aspects when establishing a directed evolution approach is to grant an advantage to the individuals with favorable properties. In our setup, we coupled correct binding properties of our Evobody proteins to a growth advantage in the form of a gradual ampicillin resistance. To determine the applicability of this resistance and to analyze how selective pressure can be applied, we did several fermentations to characterize the used strain

Human Practices Overview
Our project encompassed three areas within human practices: research, impact, and outreach. Each allowed us to better understand our project as well as help the community become a part of our experiments. We met with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Michigan Department of Agriculture (MDA), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), lawyers, conventional farmers, professors, environmental scientists, global agriculture specialists, bioethicists, organic farmers, biotechnology companies, and entrepreneurs to change our project based on regulations and professional opinions. We then gathered the thoughts, opinions, and concerns of community members, raised awareness of GMO foods, and invited the community to engage in conversation on a hot topic.
Engaging Experts: GMOs, food, water, drought, and salinity affect much of humanity. Such a far-reaching project required discussions with professionals, ethicists, farmers, and more. Check out our site visit and interviews from professionals who assisted our endeavors.
Responsibility: Developing our science requires responsibility, listening to the farmers, and hearing public concerns. We spoke with hundreds of community members through surveys, discovering their fears and investigating mitigation of public disapproval of GMOs.
Public Engagement: iGEM values and goals led us to reaching out, holding public meetings, and creating a video explaining our project and its importance.
Education: The next generation of scientists must be interested. We held science days at museums and libraries, allowing children to learn more about our project, plants, and synthetic biology.
Collaborations: We collaborated with many teams throughout the course of the project, creating exchanges of information, ideas, and time. We participated in meetups, provided ideas for Human Practices, and even had troubleshooting sessions.

Endelig knagede det ene æg efter det andet: “pip! pip!” sagde det, alle æggeblommerne var blevet levende og stak hovedet ud.  “Rap! rap!” sagde hun, og så rappede de sig alt hvad de kunne, og så til alle sider under de grønne blade, og moderen lod dem se så meget de ville, for det grønne er godt for øjnene.  “Hvor dog verden er stor!” sagde alle ungerne; thi de havde nu rigtignok ganske anderledes plads, end da de lå inde i ægget.

Rundt om ager og eng var der store skove, og midt i skovene dybe søer; jo, der var rigtignok dejligt derude på landet!

INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES
To ease the use of our tool, Neptune offers several features to the user. First, the user could simply email the developers, or visit our Github page where there would be instructions on how to get started, and some documentation. This would include what the user would need to download, and the steps to get Neptune running on the biologist's computer.
When the user first enters Neptune, they could also go through a guided tour using the 'Tour' button on the dashboard page. The guided tour would step through the entire application to show the user what they need to do to make their first microfluidic chip from top to bottom.
Otherwise, the user can visit our iGEM wiki page where they can view more documentation, tutorial videos, and so on. They could also reach out to the synthetic biology community to talk to other biologists and how they used Neptune for their research experiments. This interaction using Neptune would enable biologists around the world to share their ideas, get feedback, and progress the advancement of science.
PARAMETRIC DESIGNS
All of our STL files used for 3-D printing hardware infrastructure are parametric. If the user decides to use a different servo than that which Neptune recommends, he or she may simply enter a few measurements into the  parameters listed at the top of the provided files and the designs will update automatically to reflect those changes.
Our software is designed to convert a mL amount to be dispensed into a PWM command to be sent to the arduino such that an even dispense rate is achieved for fluid movement through the microfluidic device. This conversion, however, is dependent on the specific servo/syringe combination the user has implemented. If the user decides to use a different servo/syringe setup than what is recommended by our system, he or she may still use our dispense conversion algorithm to control their system as it is also completely parametric.

LARGE FUNCTIONAL RANGE OF HARDWARE
Our Hardware system is highly adaptable for both small and large system requirements. Neptune is capable of running up to 200 servo/syringe combinations at once, fulfilling the need for the most demanding microfluidic system. This number is calculated by finding the bottleneck in data transfer from the computer to Arduino, and the transfer rate from Arduino to motor controller shield. Processing time in both the computer"

The IOD band is a project built on system level integration. At the outset, it seemed like an impossible goal for a single iGEM project especially as there are no precedents for many of the system parts. Take a look how we divided the project into specific goals that we also achieved!

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.
Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Equations
The following equations were used for the whole cell model.  The production of Bxb1 and ΦC31 is reduced to a hill function of RLux an RLas respectively. For details, check Quorum sensing module .
The equation is for a system which produces LasI and GFP as outputs. The LasI catalyses the production of LasAHL from SAM and ACP. Since, we do not know the amount of ACP or SAM present in the cell, we assume the rate of production of LasAHL to depend only on LasI concentration.
$$\begin{align*} \frac{d[LuxAHL]}{dt} &= -d_{LuxAHL}[LuxAHL]\\ \frac{d[LuxR]}{dt} &= \alpha_{LuxR} -k_{RLux}[LuxAHL][LuxR] + k_{-RLux}[RLux] - d_{LuxR}[LuxR] \\ \frac{"
UC_Berkeley_Tools,2008,Team:UC Berkeley Tools#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," systems, the ways to describe desired functionality are still in their infancy. For example, while NOR functionality is well understood in a digital logic context, a NOR gate's operation and production in a synthetic biological context depends heavily on the proteins and other chemicals involved. Capturing functional descriptions will prove to be an important part in the development of any design methodology.  Figure 2 illustrates a potential process a functional description could go through to constrain itself to map to a platform. Here, Remote Control of Bacteria is shown as a pseudo code initial description. In the event that the inductor Arabinose (ARA) is present, bacteria swim toward Aspartic acid (ASP), otherwise they swim toward Serine (SER). The figure shows the various classes of constraints that direct the functionality toward a particular platform.
In Clotho, functionality is described at the ""part"" level. For example there may be a number of BioBrick parts each which implement the same function. However they differ in the physical part in the lab which has been created to carry out this functionality. Clotho designs should keep separate the theoretical part from the physical reality.
Architecture
Example Standard Assembly System : Figure 3
Architectural Space for Biological Systems : Figure 4
In PBD for electronic systems, architectures provide services which then incur a particular cost if used. The process of selecting an individual architecture instance is then observing which collection of platform components implement the desired functionality at a cost acceptable to the designer (low power, rapid execution time, etc).
For a synthetic biological system, once the functional pieces have been constrained as shown in Figure 4 what now is required is the actual stitching together of the standardized parts along with synthesizing the needed parts if they do not exist. This leads to the following two points:
Designs will be composed both of parts which exist in registries as well as DNA synthesized by De-novo tools which fill in the gaps of the design. Parts in registries should be assembled in a standardized way [5].
Parts must export up cost metrics to allow the design space exploration process to occur. These costs allow decisions to be made regarding the functional assignment to parts (i.e. mapping).
To give an example of such a stiching assembly method, Figure 3 illustrates how this is done for the BioBricks system. The BioBricks parts are comprised of their contents, and standard BioBricks ends. The contents are arbitrary, with the caveat that they may not contain any of the BioBricks restriction sites (EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, NotI and PstI). These"
CPU_CHINA,2018,Team:CPU CHINA#Application_-_-_TEXT.html,"SYN) minimal promoter has previously been demonstrated to direct neuronal-specific expression of eGFP when incorporated into an AAV-vector and delivered into the rat brain[14]. Wettergren et al. evaluated several disease-relevant promoter candidates using lentiviral vectors in rat striatum. DNAJC3, MAP1a and RNF25 all had a neuronal specificity of 91–100%, and efficiencies comparable to the widely used ubiquitous promoters CMV, EF1α and CAG (7–18%)[15]. Specificity could be further improved using miRNA detargeting. Wettergren et al. designed an astrocytic-specific vector combining fibrillary acidic promoter (GFAP) and miRNA-based regulation using miRNA 124[16]. Transgene expression could potentially be silenced in unwanted cell types highly expressing this miRNA (mature neurons), thus the tropism of the vectors could be shifted from a neuronal one to an astrocytic one.
To our surprise, no efforts towards RNAi therapeutics for PD has ever been paid in the iGEM community. Perhaps it’s because that RNAi is always about de-regulating certain gene products but the canonical idea behind current PD therapies is about L-DOPA production[17][18]. But there has been some progress outside demonstrating RNAi therapeutic potential in cell and animal models for PD[21]. Two of the known genes associated with PD are the aggregate-forming alpha-synuclein (α-syn) seen in Lewy Bodies, and leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2). Many such studies have been focusing on targeting single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in α-syn or LRRK2.
Instead of deciding on a specific target, we can just express known good miRNAs in the pathogenic cells. Interestingly, over-expression of miR-124 mentioned above could effectively attenuate LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and promote the secretion of neuroprotective factors[19]. For patients with known alpha synuclein gene multiplications, delivery of miR-7 and miR-153 may represent an appealing therapeutic strategy to promote neuroprotection[20]. Other relevant miRNAs include miR-133b and miR-433[21].

Although there is so much more to be said about Gargi Ratnaparki, this direct quote sums her up pretty well: “Five minipreps? I eat five minipreps for breakfast.”
Aaron Gittelman
In a land far, far away, where the grass stayed green and the water crystal blue, where minipreps worked and all was good, lived a young dragon-rider who soared the sky as carefree and lighthearted as the breeze that took him. Everywhere he flew over, music followed. The timbre and vibrancy of his voice, interwoven with the depth and complexity of his bass, spun even the simplest tunes into enchanting melodies. Oh how smooth and sweet they were! Everyone swooned at the mere echoes -- and did I mention his good looks? In the air, he and his dragon were one. But one day, his dragon fell ill. The deep emerald scales gave in to a pale sickly orange. For years, the rider searched for an answer, but what could it have been? Then, whispers came. ""Look within."" Hoping to hone his skills in the molecular world, he decided to join iGEM to first master the techniques of synthetic biology. Interviewers tried to stump him, but unbeknownst to the community, riders grew up around the art. The yellow tint in his eyes glowed as his intent gaze pierced through the dense air. His replies were as accurate as poised. By the end, he was not just any other newcomer. He was Aaron Gittelman – his name said it all.

Human Practices
The Penn State iGEM team wanted to find a way to communicate the ideas and ethics behind synthetic biology to the public. We wanted to educate more people about how genetic engineering actually works and maybe fix some of the misconceptions that people may have about it. Our team accomplished this goal by giving a lecture on synthetic biology to two different groups. One was a group of students involved with the ScienceU program at Penn State and the other were teachers who felt the need to learn more about the growing field of synthetic biology. We explained the ideas behind what we had been doing all summer and began a discussion of the ethical ramifications of genetically modifying organisms and what that might mean to the world.
Reaching out to the teachers was definitely something new for Penn State iGEM, not only did we talk with them about the ethics and the science behind synthetic biology. We created lesson plans with the help of the education majors on our team for those teachers to implement the lessons in their classrooms. This came with an activity for students to learn how to design constructs, an instructional video that covers the basics of synthetic biology, an interactive presentation for the teachers to introduce the topic, and an activity for the students to discuss the ethics of synthetic biology. With allowing the students to state their own opinions and think freely about the topics, it really allows for the growth of new ideas as well as getting feedback from a different point of view. The feedback from the teachers and the students was incredibly positive and now there are many more possible synthetic biologists out there.

Comparative environmental risk assessment
The diluted compounds of washing detergents end up in the waste water and consequently in the waste water treatment plant.
Boric acid is highly water soluble and can be neither eliminated in the waste water treatment plant nor in the drinking water purification plant. [ 13 ]
The LIPs products are organic products, which could be eliminated by a biological waste water treatment plant but this remains to be verified as there is no related data available. As organic compounds they could most likely be filtered by active charcoal and others whereby human exposure by the drinking water can be excluded. Also, organic compounds will likely be degraded over time.

Potential risks
Our project poses the typical risks of working in a biology lab. So we reduce those risks by fulfilling safety level 1 procedures as seen below.
Waste treatment
All biological materials (including genetically modified organism (abbreviation GMO)) or equipment, that was used for handling, is collected separately and autoclaved.
Transportation:
Closed boxes are used for transportation between labs but if possible, transportation between labs should be avoided.
Emergency reaction:
If lab coats or clothes start burning, use emergency showers.
If acids or other harmful liquids get into the eyes, use eye showers.
If injuries occurred, treat them with first aid-kits, report the injury, and go to the hospital if necessary.
If solutions with GMO is running down the bench (or other kinds of contamination), swap it and disinfect the place with Bacillol.
Protective equipment:
Lab coats are mandatory.
Safety glasses are mandatory in special areas of the lab and should be used in other areas if necessary.
Usage of safety gloves are mandatory in special areas of the lab and should be used depending on the working materials.
Other rules:
Do not work alone. There should be at least one person from the lab, who is not part of the iGEM team.
Do not pipette with your mouth.
Disinfect hands after contamination with GMOs.
Disinfect hands and wash them after working in the lab.
Furthermore our project includes the handling of non-canonical amino acids, which we treat according to their special requirements.

Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. It is encouraged that you to reach out and work with other teams on difficult problems which are easier to solve together.
iGEM Peshawar:
Our team collaborated with iGEM Peshawar, a first time participant and the first team ever from Pakistan to participate in iGEM. Since they were new to iGEM, they were quite inquisitive about it and we tried to help them as much as we could by addressing their questions. We had a separate Skype meetup with their team where we discussed each other’s ideas and about the wet lab procedures, the Giant Jamboree among other things. Since they were a little late with starting their wet lab work due to late registration and late shipment of the kit, we gave them some suggestions about how to go plan different experiments of the project in order to make most out of the limited time that they have. Advised them about which assembly protocol to follow, how to attribute the work in the group etc. They were quite friendly and we also shared some light moments after the Skype meetup. Apart from the Skype session, we helped them address the issues they faced as they went ahead with the project through regular interactions via email and social media. We also helped them spread their survey and we are thankful to them to help us spread our survey too.
IIT Madras:
iGEM IIT Madras team has made a wonderful android game related to Synthetic Biology. It was a great initiative by the team and it has inspired the fellow teams to think of such cool ways to spread the Synthetic Biology concepts. The game shows ribosomes “eating” the plasmids as the game progresses, which shows that the plasmids are expressed by the Ribosomes. They asked us to play and review the game for them which can be used to make the game better and come up with better versions in the future. We suggested them to increase the difficulty level of the game and to include more such modules where the role of each part of the cell the gene expression can be explained"

While evaluating the sequencing data with Sequ-Into, we noticed that in the first 10% of the sequencing time of         each experiment, more non-target reads were sequenced than in any latter time interval.         Moreover, we found that this also holds true for the first x sequenced reads, which allowed us to setup sequ-into such         that it only analyses the first 1000 reads of a minION sequencing experiment, speeding up computation and enabling         en-run analysis.

Equal Results are shown for the first x sequenced reads.
After getting rid of the contamination, we noticed a non-uniform coverage in the phage genome assemblies after         re-aligning the reads to the assembly.
Rearranging the middle part which initially was “over-expressed” and re-assembling led us to the expected uniform         coverage of the de-novo genome sequence after re-aligning the input reads.         Finally, we could predict coding-sequences and visualize all descriptive statistics in genome diagrams.

Encapsulation
After successful bacteriophage production and toxicity evaluation the final step of the manufacturing pipeline is therapeutic application. By nature, bacteriophages possess a relatively short have-life when orally administered. Encapsulation in alginate negates this effect by protecting phages from gastric fluid. 7
We constructed a simple device that allows us to encapsulate our bacteriophages in alginate droplets.

Monodisperse Alginate Droplets at 150X magnification.
In order to achieve defined phage concentrations and therefore defined doses, we optimized the monodispersity of our alginate droplets.
In our initial attempts to create alginate droplets the size within a batch often varied significantly. Additionally, a lot of droplets were lost due to   aggregation. Optimization of parameters such as flow rate,   alginate concentration and N2 pressure led to an increase of monodispersity for all tested sizes (50-300 μm).   Specifically, an alginate concentration of 1.8 % alginate and 0.2 % low-viscosity alginate proved to be ideal. Pressure and flow rate determine the droplet sizes and can"

Optimization of Golden Gate Assembly
Many of the teams we talked to, including Texas Tech and Rice University, either did not use Golden Gate Assembly (GGA) or did not use it as their main technique for molecular cloning and were not intimately familiar with the process. Given our experience with GGA, we decided to make our kit simpler to use.  We designed standardized bridging sequences that reduced the number of parts in a GGA reaction, increasing the likelihood of a successful assembly. We also improved the expression of certain chromoproteins to allow them to express more quickly and brighter. Through these two improvements, we streamlined the kit, increasing its efficiency and potential to be used by amateurs and professionals alike.
1 - 5 Bridging Sequences
Golden Gate Assembly is a molecular cloning method that uses modular, interchangeable parts. Parts are categorized into types according to their function. In order to make a full assembly plasmid, containing multiple parts of interest, such as a promoter, a specific coding sequence, and a specific origin, each part must first be put into a standardized entry vector. This entry vector is pYTK001, a GFP-dropout with a colE one origin of replication and a chloramphenicol resistance gene. Parts are cloned from a template plasmid using primers that add BsmBI and BsaI restriction sites to the ends of the PCR products. These products are then made into parts plasmids, using BsmBI and T4 DNA ligase. The end product is a self-replicating plasmid that acts to store the part for use in a larger assembly. The BsaI sites on the insertion sequence are retained for future assemblies using multiple part plasmids.
Multiple part plasmids are combined in a Golden Gate Assembly reaction. Each part is digested with BsaI and ligated back together. However, the success of reaction, that is when all part types are successfully ligated together to create an entire plasmid, decreases as the number of parts increases. Therefore, larger, more sophisticated plasmids tend to be difficult to make.

Install BioHub
If you just want to try it, please visit out website biohub.tech . Or, if you want to install BioHub on your own server, we suggest users use Docker to deploy BioHub. It just needs two steps:
docker run -d --name biohubdb -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password mysql
docker run -d --name biohub --link biohubdb:db -p 80:5000 biohubtech/biohub
You can also use -e BIOHUB_DB_HOST=<host> and/or -e BIOHUB_DB_USER=<user> -e BIOHUB_DB_PASSWORD=<password> to connect to other databases.
Also, you can clone the repo and run it manually. We've tested this on Debian 8:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git python3 python3-pip python3-biopython python3-flask python3-sqlalchemy python3-scipy libmysqlclient-dev mysql-server mysql-client wget
git clone https://github.com/igemsoftware2016/USTC-Software-2016.git
cd USTC-Software-2016
sudo pip3 install flask_login mysqlclient pymysql
echo CREATE DATABASE biohub | mysql -u<user> -p # please fill in the blanks
wget http://parts.igem.org/partsdb/download.cgi?type=parts_sql -O biobricks.sql.gz
gunzip biobricks.sql.gz
mysql -u<user> -p biohub < biobricks.sql # please fill in the blanks
echo ""DATABASE_URI = 'mysql://<username>:<password>@localhost/biohub'"" >config.py # please fill in the blanks
echo ""SECRET_KEY = '<a random string>'"" >>config.py # please fill in the blanks
./run.py
# then the server will start on port 5000
Install ABACUS
Copy and run the code below to install ABACUS:

NTU-Singapore,2009,Team:NTU-Singapore#HPA#Interview_-_-_TEXT.html," people should possess?)
Tito : I think iGEM Teams are the best -- they understand that biology should be engineered. Those interested in synthetic biology are usually pretty open to the idea of DIYbio.
Jason : Junior High/Secondary or equivalent level of knowledge is sufficient to engage in DIYbio.
Q.  Which of the following are the most important factors when deciding to carry out an experiment?
Jason :
Venue / budget / availability of reagents & equipment
Safety / level of training / familiarity with techniques
Complexity / duration (of experiment)
Manpower / interest level
Q. What do you feel is the minimum level of safety measures that DIYBioers should practice?
(e.g. We found DIYbioNYC telling readers that E.Coli K-12 is so harmless that you can even drink it without ill effects. While this definitely makes DIYbio sound relatively safe, will inexperienced readers get the wrong idea and disregard other safety issues as well?)
Tito : It definitely depends on the type of work you're doing. However, common sense guidelines such as DIY Safety Manual at DIYbio OpenWetWare are useful.
Q. If people could really equip a room to have lab conditions [eg negative pressure, biohoods etc], then would it still be considered DIYBio?
The question here is whether DIYBio refers to the time/money commitment or the expertise of the experimenters?
Tito : DIYbio depends wholly on ""doing"". It doesn't matter how much equipment or expertise or ideas you have. The focus is on ""doing"".
Q.  What is your typical protocol procedure?
Jason : A combination of both common established protocol & guidelines AND experimental approaches that may be better in some way.
Q. Have you ever considered the impact of your experimentation on society?
Jason : Yes.
Q. What do you feel is the potential for misuse? Is there sufficient cause to worry?
Tito : There are certainly risks involved in amateur biology, including waste disposal and sample management. I advocate for community labs because of this.
Q. If there is cause to worry, what overriding factors made you believe a website like DIYBio could do more good than harm?
Tito : DIYbio is successful because it is a community of people, from a wide range of backgrounds. A website, a mailing list, and other tools make this possible, by bringing groups together. Then those groups are better at making decisions than individuals.
Q. If DIY Bio becomes more mainstream, is it not harder to control/contain lab experiments gone wrong? How can we alleviate this situation?

ZJU-China,2016,Team:ZJU-China#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," to help them to decode the information, the mechanical cipher machine to let them try the process of encryption and decryption, which helped a lot to explain our project.
    Our mode was tested from the east to west China. The educational tools were welcome, and do help us to explain synthetic biology and our project in an effective and interesting way. They were proved to be successful.
 
Dialogue& our reflection
 
 
    These feedbacks are the epitome of wonder and concern about synthetic biology. The old rejected things that may change their life instinctively, and were very serious about biosafety. The teacher welcomed the new idea of synthetic biology, and want to help the students to expand their horizon. The high school student were curious about what synthetic biology can do, and want to know more about the details. And the kids’ curiosity for synthetic biology was sparked. And for the youth, they cared more about the project itself, and were curious about synthetic biology.
    We carefully explained the safety problem synthetic biology concerned to the old, and realized it is the first problem that synthetic biology should settled down, in order to apply it to reality. However, some problems of biosafety are easy to settle, while others are hard to make it clear. There is still many attention and effort to be paid. And we were very pleased that the tools can be useful for them to understand it better.
    We explained the details to the youth who asked us problem about the project. And they encouraged us a lot, telling us that the project was very impressive and thanks us for bringing the idea of synthetic biology. We were aware that the youth cared less about the application than others, and they value the idea and creativeness. But we still can’t ignore the problems that synthetic biology meet when it comes to apply it to the real world, which are also the problems that we were asked. We used to think that an innovative design is enough, and we can extract the certain circuit of it for future application. But now we think the application can’t always be delayed. It is not only the problem that the public concerned most, but also the motivation for synthetic biologists.

What is synthetic biology?
""One of the applications of synthetic biology is genetic engineering. In my opinion, individualized and specified applications such as gene therapy is a great use of this technology. Yet if synthetic biology is used on the public or in an open environment, I will be concerned about the genetic exchanges with wild type organisms.""
What do you think of ""HOPE""? Are you willing to use ""hope"" to prevent cavities if our project has been realized?
""Since dental techniques cannot catch up the rapid advancement of the economy, and that children in Taiwan are in easy access to sweets, kids have a higher rate of cavities than other parts of the world. HOPE might just be the answer for this problem.""
""HOPE has promising effects to our world. However, your team should be aware of the different microflora in children and the elderly. You guys can come up with an idea to make HOPE applicable to both age groups.""
Fighting for one’s belief
Chief Director Huang could have stayed at home comfortably, yet she chose to have several meetings per week only to fight for her belief. She has made great efforts in promoting organic foods. We could even see sparks of delight in her eyes when she proudly introduced their organic moon cakes!
It was our honor to have a discussion with her. She has inspired us to improve our project and make the world a better place.

Our Nabobody BIFC-Control was mentioned to them and suggested as well-suited for this part
We then agreed to exchange abstracts and discussed ways we could aid each other.
Summary:
Freiburg: Think about having a control similar to our Nanobody BIFC-System.
Bielefeld: Think about getting the affinity of our binding proteins to specific targets measured by Team Freiburg.
Protocol from 2016-09-15
Participants Freiburg: Wlad
Paricipants Bielefeld: Judith , Mika
The projects were once again resumed and innovations were stated. We then came back to the topics we could help each other out.
Freiburg:
The principle of the OCTET RED measurement and the conditions the proteins have to fulfill were mentioned once again.
It was stated that the antigen gets coupled with a biosensor for the measurement
He suggested that we should think of an additional exporter for secretion in the periplasm
Once again we talked about the protein purification and the necessity of a his-tag
The amount of time necessary for the correct condition was estimated.
Bielefeld:
Our Nanobody BIFC-Control was once again mentioned and the advantages were stated
We suggested sending them the two plasmids necessary for the BIFC containing the sequences for it.
We then informed them about the way they would be used and talked about how the split-proteins were designed and agreed on sending them the '.genious-file' and further details .
The conversation then switched back to the OCTET RED measurement Team Freiburg offered to carry out for us
We stated that the way of protein purification we chose ( IMPACT ) made tags unnecessary
We proceeded by telling them we would be able to use another way for defining the affinity between our target protein and our binder

LMU-Munich,2014,Team:LMU-Munich#Project#Bakillus_-_-_TEXT.html,"xin SDP is a multi-step process.  The sdpC sequence encodes the Pro-SdpC1-203,,which is translated by the ribosome.It is a precursor peptide which needs to be processed by a signal peptidases and the two membrane proteins SdpA and SdpB to become functional. This active form of SDP is a 42-amino-acid antimicrobial peptide (AMP) containing a disulfide bond between two cysteine residues located at the N-terminus.(Fig. 2). [2 ]
Fig. 2. SDP production requires multiple steps. In the cytosol, the full length SdpC (pro-SdpC1-203) is secreted via the Sec pathway. Following secretion, the signal peptidases SipS and SipT cleave the N-terminal signal peptide sequence of SdpC. Disulfide bond formation occurs independently of SdpAB. Finally, posttranslational cleavage of SdpC occurs via SdpAB to produce a 42-amino-acid SDP that will be secreted extracellulary as the active SDP peptide. [2 ]
SDP has been shown to be a very effective AMP against a variety of Gram-positive bacteria in the Phylum of the Firmicutes (Fig. 3). It rapidly collapses the proton motive force (PMF), thus inducing autolysis. [3 ]
Fig. 3. SDP inhibition curves for pathogenic microbes. Relative growth of the strains named abovewith the presence of increasing concentrations of SDP is shown in the curve. As a negative control the gram-negative bacteria K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa are depicted, which are unaffected by the toxin SDP, as it specifically targets gram-positive bacteria. B. subtilis is a gram-positive bacteria, but expresses the immunity protein SdpI and is therefore relatively resistent to the toxin SDP. the Stapylococcus species (also MRSA) though are quite drastically reduced in the presence of the SDP. [4 ]
The sdpIR Operon – Production and Regulation of the Immunity Protein SdpI
In the absence of SDP the gene coding for the immunity protein SdpI is repressed by the autorepressor SdpR. If extracellular SDP binds the transmembrane protein SdpI it causes a conformational change. As a consequence SdpR is sequestered at the membrane, forming a complex with SDP and SdpI. Since the repression by SdpR"

    To simplify and mimic the complex relationships between populations in real ecosystems, we use methods of synthetic biology to construct a more simple system using E.coli. The system involves two groups of E.coli, with each group having three characters. By secreting AHL molecules, warriors attack the enemies but not E.coli from the same group. Farmers provide nutrients for everybody by the secretion of invertase. Beggars sit there doing nothing, growing and waiting to be killed by warriors from the other group.
    Concretely, the gene circuits are designed as follows.     
Fig.1 Gene circuit for our six types of E.coli
See more description at Design of characters
    Therefore, our main task is to construct three characters of the two groups.
    Our achievements are shown below.
I Construct a new part--invertase
    The invertase used by farmers supports other E.coli when sucrose is the sole carbohydrate source.
    In our system, we hope farmers can produce invertase and secrete it outside the cell to help other E.coli survive. To test if invertase can work as we expected, we transformed invertase and its transport system to E.coli and co-cultured it with cells that can express RFP. We found that E.coli that can produce invertase can truly support the survival of other E.coli. (Fig.2)

We tested the 4 selected biosensors and control group with 0, 10, 100, 500, and 1000 μM Cu2+ induced for 20 min, and the result is shown below with logarithmic coordinates.
Fig. 4-7. The leakage expression of different promoters
Fig. 4-7. The leakage expression of different promoters
The figure shows the response ranges of biosensors with different promoters within 20 min. For most biosensors, the fluorescence intensity increases as copper ion’s concentration increases from 0 to 100 μM. However, when the concentration exceeds 100 μM, the responses of most biosensor become slow, and the fluorescence intensity decreases. A reasonable explanation is that high concentrations of copper can inhibit the biosensor's response within a short time.
Fortunately, we still found a biosensor who met the requirements of an excellent biosensor. EP-5 has a less leakage and a higher sensitivity. Its fluorescence intensity is lower than the control group by 17 units with no induction and is higher by 21 units with 100-μM-Cu induction. By aligning the sequence with the CUP1 promoter, we found altered bases mainly located at both sides of UASs and a deletion of one base even occurred between two UASs. We suspected that the change of sensitivity and leakage expression mainly due to the change of spatial distribution and the increase of A/T concentration, which both could influence the binding procedure of transcription factors.
Fig. 4-8. The base changes in EP-5
Fig. 4-8. The base changes in EP-5
DISCUSSION & FUTURE WORK
In our characterization of both primary and improved promoters, we found the effect of induction is not as obvious as expected (Previous iGEM team’s results). After reading some references, we found the activation process is related to the acetylation of H3 and H4 located at the CUP1 promoter, which showed nucleosome reposition and transcription factors binding might be the main reason for the activation. However, our biosensors were ligated on plasmid pRS416, which usually exists in the nucleus in a supercoiled state. There is only little possibility for a plasmid to binds to histones, so the transcription process shows less activation than that on a chromosome.
In the future, we plan to construct this biosensor on chromosomes to see whether the result will be more positive. Meanwhile, we will continue enlarging the response peak and range to improve this biosensor.

Estimate the effectiveness of “Prometheus” from the results of program and do forecast
Abstract
Analyzing dynamics of E.coli’s chemotaxis and estimating effectiveness of the ""Prometheus"" require high accuracy, and thus hard to realize with experiments. Here, we construct a virtual peanut root-E.coli system (by c++ and OpenGL), storing the 3-D environmental information by k-d tree. We quantify the process in which “Promethei”, our engineered bacteria, carrying Mo, move towards peanut roots. We at last estimate around 20-40% of bacteria could work in reality, and that the best “memory” time be around 40 min ( See here ). All codes (in c++) of the project are available*.
*The size of the code is too big, please contact Li Si-yao (201211211043@mail.bnu.edu.cn) to get it.

E.coli model
Mechanism
We divide Escherichia coli’s behavior into two parts: “running” straight lines, and “tumbling” for reorientation[1]. When attractant concentration uniformed, E.coli can be described as doing “random walk”[4], and the running time fits a normal distribution. With spatial concentration gradients of chemical attractance,when bacteria sense a higher attractant concentration than before,the mean of the statistical distribution of running time increases. Otherwise, the time keeps the same as that in the uniform environment, no matter how high or low the concentration is["

The field of synthetic biology relies heavily on mathematical models that help simulate and predict the process of biological systems. Our team established two models to simulate the process of sweeteners binding to the receptor T1R2/T1R3 and the process of sweeteners signal transduction in mating pheromone pathway. Then improve our biological systems based on the simulation results.
The T1R2/T1R3 structure was built using SWISS-MODEL, then docking with the small molecule by AutoDock Vina. The signal transduction model is established by  reaction kinetics equations (RKE) and MATLAB to solve the ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
We developed our models based on three main purposes:
1. Determine the binding pattern between sweeteners and T1R2/T1R3.
2. Establish the GPCR signal transduction model for signal measurement.
3. Simulate the relationship between sweetness and red fluorescence intensity of mRFP, which was employed as a reporter.
Overview of system
Our goal is to detect the sweetness of the sweetener based on retrofitting the mating pheromone response pathway in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (CENPK2-1C).
Fig. 1  Each domain of the T1R2/T1R3 heterodimer
Initially，to make the signal input more accurate and reliable, we simulated the model of T1R2/T1R3 receptor's structure (Fig. 1), and choose some classic sweeteners docking with T1R2/T1R3.
Fig. 2  A simplified model of the α pheromone pathway with T1R2/T1R3
Next, the GPCR signal transduction model was established for signal measurement. Based on yeast MAPK signal pathway (Fig. 2), we made simple model for our biological systems. This pathway was divided into four modules: the activation of T1R2/T1R3 receptor, the activaion of G-protein cycle, the MAPK cascade, and the expression of RFP. We used ODEs to describe the changes in the"

We had tested which media that is best for plastic production. The three medas are, 2xYT, TB and LB.
The medias were tested by OD measuring approximate made every half hour in 7 hours.
The 2xYT media waas better for fast growth of bacteria. Both Top10 and Top10/pSB1C3-PanK+sec had a lower generation time in 2xYT media.TB media however, was better for producing a lot of bacteria. A higher OD was reached when growing bacteria in this media.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#project_-_-_TEXT.html," tested a total of three signal peptides - one taken from the parts registry, and two designed by ourselves.
The EGFR signal peptide was taken from the iGEM parts registry ( BBa_K157001 ) and combined with a BioBrick encoding the CMV promoter sequence ( BBa_K747096 ) via the RFC10 cloning standard.
The BM40 and Igκ signal peptides were designed by us, providing additional spacing as well as a Kozak sequence to the 5'-UTR of the constructs and combined with a BioBrick encoding the CMV promoter sequence ( BBa_K747096 ) via the RFC10 cloning standard.
As shown below, the EGFR signal peptide taken from the parts registry is constructed in a way that the signal peptide ORF immediately follows the RFC10 cloning scar after the CMV promoter, thus resulting in a very short 5’ untranslated region (UTR) of the transcribed mRNA. The combination of the CMV promoter with the synthesized BM40 and Igκ signal peptides allows for a considerably longer 5’ UTR of the resulting mRNA - additionally allowing them to contain a full Kozak consensus sequence by design. The Kozak sequence is recognized by the ribosome as a translational start site; this element missing or deviating from the consensus sequence may considerably decrease translation efficiency. [2] For the EGFR signal peptide construct, a Kozak sequence is not present, as it would have to preceed the start codon ATG - a position which is occupied by the RFC10 cloning scar. Since both, the distance from the promoter to the open reading frame as well as the Kozak consensus sequence are considered crucial parameters for expression levels [3] , BM40 and Igκ signal peptide constructs are likely to resut in increased expression levels compared to proteins containing the EGFR signal peptide from the parts registry.
As the functionality of the signal peptides had to be determined before including one of these into the final receptor constructs, the three options (Igκ, BM40, EGFR) were tested via bioinformatic tools as well as by conducting a secretion assay of luciferase constructs.
Results of signal peptide functional analysis
Bioinformatic signal peptide analysis via the SignalP server
The SignalP server, being able to discriminate between the hydrophobic signal peptide sequence and the hydrophobic transmembrane domain [4] , can determine whether a sequence possesses the biophysical requirements for functioning as a signal peptide. Furthermore, it is able to predict the probable cleavage site of the signal peptide after its translocation into the ER. For all constructs"

Nature is the world’s most skilled engineer and has naturally occurring magnetotactic bacteria such as Magnetospirrilium magneticum. Under certain conditions, these organisms form magnetosomes, which are chains of magnetite nanoparticles. These function as an intracellular compass for the cell and even allow them to orientate along earth’s weak magnetic field.
As previous iGEM teams have shown, synthesizing fully functional magnetosomes in E. coli is highly difficult as more than 60 highly regulated genes are involved[4]. The Berlin iGEM team came up with an alternative strategy that does not rely on the formation of magnetosomes.
By knocking out the iron efflux transporter gene FieF and the iron uptake suppressor Fur, we want to increase the total iron level of the cytosol. By sequestering iron in a ferritin protein, iron crystals are formed and the cell is detoxified. In order to create ferromagnetic crystals, we will use intensive high-throughput growth medium optimization to discover the best conditions for the formation of magnetic nanoparticles in E. coli.  We will work with other metal binding proteins such as metallothioneins and phytochelatin synthases in order to achieve nanoparticle synthesis. Once we have discovered the best way to magnetize E. coli bacteria, we will build and characterize suitable BioBricks that can be used by any research lab or iGEM team in the world in order to remote control the cellular movement.

In our project, the laboratory strains we used are routine strains, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli. In addition, the sweet receptor protein we used is T1R2/T1R3, it’s safe too. We communicate with Dr. Yang about the safety details of the project.
COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER UNIVERSITIES
At the latter phase of our project, we organized Beijing University, Lanzhou University and Jilin University to make a big chat about what we had done so far and held three scientific speeches to introduce the development and the common use of sweeteners in our daily life, which contributed to the popularity of iGEM as well as Synthetic Biology. Ultimately, we collected the critical advice from the audiences in time and accepted one of them, which recommended us to set saccharose as the standard. After that running, the test would be more reasonable.
MEDIA CAMPAIGN
In September, we were interviewed by the Propaganda Department of Beijing Institute of Technology, and we had launched a website campaign on the BIT official website of synthetic biology and iGEM. In the course of the interview, we carried out scientific exchanges on the knowledge of sweet substances.
iGEM MEETING
In the late September, in order to promote synthetic biology and iGEM, we held a preaching meeting about synthetic biology and iGEM for all the students of all majors in BIT. At the meeting, we had a total of three links, the first link was to introduce iGEM and synthetic biology to the students. The second link was brainstorm, so that students can think about our project's innovative point and flash point with our project's background. The third part was a free exchange session. Students can communicate with us any project and team related things. After this meeting, the innovation of our project is further sublimated.
OPEN-ENDED ACTIVITY
At the 85th anniversary of Beijing institute of technology, we were invited to show iGEM and our project to alumni. In our display case, we prepared some small biology games, and we told students what‘s Synthetic biology. And we introduced our former projects to people. They can learn about iGEM through our past competition experiences. Meanwhile, we can improve our project through the suggestions of students. In this open-ended activity, we communicated with more than 3000 people, and got more than 500 suggestions. In the open-ended activity, we select sweet substances as our inducers better.

As a lab instructor I did prep work for labs, went through (sometimes) short lectures on the theoretical basis of the experiments we were performing, and finally guided the group through the planned procedures. All of our procedures worked this year which was excellent, and during the down-time between steps we were able to review and reinforce the concepts learned that day in the lecture portions.
Outside of the lab, when I have time, I enjoy exploring new types of music, comic books, the occasional video game, long walks to just organize my thoughts, NPR, and Netflix. In the future I hope to pursue a career in research by attending graduate school, although I am not truly sure of what I want to focus on just yet.

I am currently a junior biology student at WLC and this year on iGEM I have been in charge of the completion of the surveys by the WELS high school science teachers. My biggest time contributions have gone toward the policy and practices section of the project. I have organized meetings and have done what I could to make things as easy as possible. I have also helped in the editing of the articles that we have put onto our website. My favorite iGEM moment would be the first time I met the other members of the team. The first impression that they gave me assured me that I would be working with a group of determined people who planned on having fun in the process.

I am a sophomore intending to major in Biology with a Chemistry minor. Much of the work I did for iGEM was in the lab which consisted of projects such as phage isolation, cloning and Kirby-Bauer Assays. In the lab I also focused on obtaining the knowledge and skills to take over leading the laboratory work in coming years. Outside of the lab I assisted this year’s iGEM team with the survey as well as writing an article on Klebsiella and Yersinia Pestis. My favorite moment from iGEM thus far was successfully moving the Klebsiella tolC to the PSB1C3 Plasmid. It has been an awesome learning experience so far and I intend to continue with it in the coming years!

Integrated Human Practices
Required link: 2016.igem.org/Team:Washington/Integrated_Practices This team can be evaluated for this prize. Please write 150 words on why you think your team is eligible for this prize:
Our integrated human practices focused on the ethics, effects, and benefits of our system in an industrial setting. Through an investigation of literature and environmental data, we could conclude that our system would be energy efficient and cost effective for a lab to implement. Current problems with bioreactors are that they are expensive and inefficient, partly because of the need for human adjustment of inputs, which are affected by human error. An autonomous system would save workers time while producing less waste than current systems.
Education and Public Engagement
Required link: 2016.igem.org/Team:Washington/Engagement This team can be evaluated for this prize. Please write 150 words on why you think your team is eligible for this prize:
Our team is passionate about fostering a love for science and engineering in younger members of our community and engaging with parents about cutting edge solutions to real-world problems. Every year, we volunteer at local science fairs and STEM events, sharing our research and promoting interest in the biological sciences. This year, we attended multiple local science fairs and outreach events at our university and in local schools, where our exhibit allowed elementary students to try their hand at DNA purification from strawberries and a pH test.
Our team has also worked on a comic book aimed towards elementary and middle school students that addresses lab safety, synthetic biology dogma and basic lab protocols in a fun and engaging way, which we’ve posted on our wiki as open source curriculum.
Model

Rewiring the E. coli machinery
As mentioned, the nonpathogenic E. coli strain MG1655 only lacks the prenyltransferase enzyme from the rubber tree before it is able to produce natural rubber. Apart from introducing the HRT2 gene to the strain, we also wanted to enhance the IPP production of the cell for further rubber production. As a consequence of these goals, we studied the prenyltransferase and the MEP pathway, which subsequently enabled us to reach our rubber-producing ambitions.
The MEP pathway - Will open in a new tab due to the size. Edited from  Alexander Steinbüchel: Production of rubber-like polymers by microorganism, Current Opinion in Microbiology 2003. 6:261-270.
MEP pathway
The biosynthesis of isoprenoids in bacteria works through the MEP pathway. MEP pathwaymethylerythritol phosphate pathway
The pathway is initiated with a condensation reaction between GAP GAPD-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate to produce DXP DXP1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate and CO2 catalysed by Dxs"

Also created pSB3T5: pBAD + MBP and pSB1C3: mRFP1 + CpxP-His.
Week 15 (7th of August - 13th of August)
Removed pCpxR 1 bp insertional mutation from pSB1C3: mRFP1 + CpxP-Affibody fusion variants by PCR.  Subsequent transformation of fusion variants (without mutations) to JW5558 strain. Repeat of pSB3T5: pBAD + MalE31 construct, again without success.
Week 16 (14th of August - 20th of August)
pSB3T5: pBAD + MalE31 construct creation by GoldenGate was attempted with higher insert ratio, successful.
Week 17 (21st of August - 27th of August)
Double transformations of pSB3T5: pBAD + MalE31 and pSB1C3: mRFP1+CpxP-Aff fusions were performed. The Cpx system induction by KCl was tested in BL21DE3 and CpxP KO strains, but results were confusing. Started cloning the membrane-tethered CpxP-Aff fusions by creating the MalE24-1 gene.

Week 18 (28th of August - 3rd of September)
MalE24-1 gene was successfully created. GoldenGate was performed to fuse the MBP misfolder with the CpxP-Aff fusions, resulting in half of the constructs successfully created so far.
Week 19 (4th of September - 10th of September)
Performed two more measurements of Cpx induction with KCl using old protocol, resulting in confusing data again. Tried new protocol: growing induced strains overnight and measuring in morning. This resulted in better data of Cpx induction by KCl.
Week 20 (11th of September - 17th of September)
Repeated transformation of GoldenGate samples to obtain pSB1C3: mRFP1+MalE24-1-CpxP and ”-MalE24-1-CpxP-Aff,  Did new measurement protocols with M9 medium, giving better results of Cpx induction by KCl.

Allow a limited time to figure out what valves to open or close, then flow in a dyed liquid. If the path is correct, the fluid flows into a ""win"" pool. Otherwise, it leaks into a ""lose"" pool.
Tamagotchi
Keep an on-chip C. Elegans worm. Flow in food, dyes, or whatever, flush out its excrements. Sounds boring but people like pets...
If we can figure out how to make them reproduce we can make a microsims game.
Crowdsourcing
A cool application of web-controlled games is ""crowdsourcing"": using the community's ""idle brain time"", or harnessing all those people wasting their time on facebook games to do something useful. Great examples are ReCaptcha, where by answering captchas people help the gutenberg project transcribe books, or somewhat forgotten ESP game, where people help label images on the internet. I just found Zooniverse: http://www.zooniverse.org/projects , where by playing games people help advance scientific projects.
For a crowdsourcing project to work we need:
An interesting problem to solve, that is easy to solve by humans, but tough for computers. Any kind of image processing or concept assimilation comes to mind. Tasks like massive image processing are appropriate, for example colouring in neurons on microtomographs.
A fun, simple, but addictive game. The community has to find it fun to play, and not feel like they are being exploited.
OR a ReCaptcha style thing. You're only stealing three seconds of the person's time and you are solving a problem that is necessary for the user anyway (Captchas were used before ReCaptcha came up).
For microfluidics, I can think of a shooter-style game where people would locate glowing wells on a plate or chip. I can remember Matt saying he struggled to program that for poorly aligned chips.
Citizen Science
http://www.scientificamerican.com/citizen-science/
Citizen science seems to be the new 'thing': get ordinary people to participate in scientific projects. Both to teach the population about science and to help scientific projects. Crowdsourcing is one approach (which helps advance a project). Education is another one.
For example, we could design a chip that teaches people about transcription factors live: have a linear template that expresses / represses GFP in presence of tetR. Flow tetR on the chip, and watch in awe as the light turns off. In another well, have the same circuit with a different promoter,"

But even this time something went wrong, because contamination was still waiting for us; and so I threw away the first ligation product. Then I made one mistake plating onto the wrong antibiotic, throwing away the second ligation product. This forced me to be in the lab at 5am the next Monday, to recover lost time and not to slow all the work of others, whose samples should have been sent in the morning of 08/06 together with mine. This time I was very confident, I felt it was the right time; but my up early revealed totally useless, as you will read.
K731520 has been fully characterized. I’ve been able to reduce the delay by doubling the work load on the last days, and with this my job is done.
I’ve spent a lovely Sunday at Caldonazzo’s lake with my girlfriend. It has been my first free day in three weeks: up to saturday, it has been 23 consecutive days of work.
We tested the restriction enzyme activity digesting our terminator platform with XhoI and E, P, S, X.      This time the digestion was made in a total volume of 20µl to avoid influence of glycerol concentration.      Also decided to look for a better way to run gels of such little fragments: finally we tried with a 1.5X agarose gel, with a little more EtBr and TBE instead of TAE . Wow!
We were also too confident: we amplified and made an insertion on a Ptac plasmid not yet sequenced… Friday the results arrived and was really puzzling: we took a mutated sample but 6/8 were correct…such a bad luck!
We started right away with the correct colony and made all the remaining clonings:
* pSB1C3 with B0010, B0015
* T7 terminator platform with B0015
* Ptac terminator platform with T7, B0010, B0015
During the whole cloning phase Roberta and Laura gave us a great help: also this time we had B0015 (registry 2011) from them, since with couldn’t extract it from the 2012 reg.
This week we also had a major happening: CONTAMINATION!      All the competent cells began to grow on every antibiotics and the whole team’ plates contained carpets of cells!
Sincerely, I think I had a bug part in this mess…
We threw away antibiotics, plates, cells, LB, transformation buffer, glycerol…everything!

(A,C) are height maps of the cell, (B,D) are stiffness maps. (E) Relative stiffness of E. coli cells covered with and without polysilicate layer, compared to the stiffness of a glass slide measured with Peakforce QNM AFM.
Multiple cells (n=3) were imaged and the relative stiffness of the cell compared to the stiffness of the glass slide was determined (figure 3E). We found that cells covered with a layer of polysilicate have a stiffness of 0.43 compared to the glass slide and the cells without a layer of polysilicate have a stiffness of 0.16 compared to the glass slide. We can see that due to the encapsulation of the cells in polysilicate the stiffness of the cells increases significantly.

Viability experiments of polysilicate covered cells
Introduction
Since the silicatein expressing cells are to cover themselves in polysilicate, their nutrient supply might be limited by diffusion, which can eventually result in cell death. To investigate whether this is indeed the case,a growth study was performed.
Methods
Cells containing the three different silicatein biobricks were grown overnight in selective LB. They were transfered to fresh medium and grown until in exponential phase. Then IPTG was added to induce expression. After a subsequent incubation of three hours, the medium was supplemented with silicic acid as substrate for silicatein. During the following five hours samples were taken, of which a 10-6 dilution was plated on selective LB plates. Colony forming units (cfu) were counted the day after.
Results and Discussion
Cells expressing either silicatein (Sil), silicatein fused to INP (INP-Silicatein) or silicatein fused to OmpA (OmpA-Silicatein) were tested. As a negative control, OmpA-silicatein expressing cells without silicic acid were used. After one hour no colonies were observed on the plates on which the cultures with silicic acid were plated (Figure 1). The cultures without silicic acid continued to grow until after five hours.

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as Global Goals, are a set of universal goals, targets and indicators that meet the most urgent challenges facing our world. SDGs came into effect in January 2016 and since then, with 15 years horizon, set the framework for the United Nations Development Programme. SDGs follow and expand on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in which all 191 United Nations member states declared commitment from 2000 to 2015 (21).
The success of the goals depends unsurprisingly on their translation into the introduction of new legislations, improvement of existing regulations and the implementation of action plans in both governmental and sub-governmental level. Therefore, as it seems paradoxical at first, “localization’’ is the key to attain these ambitious global goals. Localization means to put everything within subnational frameworks, from setting targets to deciding the mode of action and selecting indicators for monitoring progress. And from this local perspective, we would like to show Biotic Blue potential to contribute to fulfilling these goals, which in our eyes mirrors its impact on our planet and society in the most accurate way (22).
Biotic Blue, to different extent contributes to attain 10 out of the 17 goals, demonstrating its capability to influence society on multiple levels (Figure 9).
Figure 9. The Sustainable Development Goals 2030 Biotic Blue contributes to be attained. (The illustration is a redesign of UN SDGs 2030 [23])
By minimizing the levels of hazardous pharmaceuticals in effluent wastewater and consequently in the aquatic environment, Biotic Blue increases safe re-use of wastewater and reduces pharmaceutical pollution. It also protects and restores water-related ecosystems including rivers and lakes.
Helps human settlements, adopting and implementing integrated policies towards inclusion. In addition, Biotic Blue enhances the capacity for more sustainable urbanization.
Helps the development of advanced regional infrastructure to support sustainable economic growth by upgrading the technological capabilities of WWTPs to treat wastewater.
Helps the achievement of sustainable management of consumed pharmaceuticals. Biotic Blue minimizes the adverse impacts on human health and the environment derived by the presence of pharmaceuticals in the wastewater.
Biotic blue helps in preventing and reducing marine pharmaceutical pollution protecting sensitive coastal and marine ecosystems. It stops the exposure of marine organisms to chemical entities not occurring naturally in the aquatic environment.
Helps to slow down the development of antibiotic resistance, which comprises a major and imminent threat to human health, by minimizing uncontrolled exposure of environmental bacteria to antibiotics.
Helps to preserve marine ecosystems that play a significant role in our effort to restore our planet's climate and mitigate the environmental impact of"

Construct 2
Construct 2 seeks to demonstrate the affect of Sex-Lethal (SxL) expression on 3' splice site selection.  It contains a proximal and distal 3' splice sites.  The proximal 3' splice site contains a SxL recognition sequence. Initially the proximal 3' splice site is favored due to its greatly decreased intron length (Klinz, Gallwitz, 1985) causing a greater CFP to YFP ratio.  Upon expression of SxL the 3' proximal site will be inhibited due to competitive binding between SxL and U2AF (see Project Background section).  This will cause a shift in the ratio of CFP to YFP towards YFP demonstrating synthetic controllable alternative splicing within S. cerevisiae.
Construct 3
Construct 3 demonstrates an application of our alternative splicing system in order to show the unique advantages that alternative splicing can confer.  This construct differs from construct 2 in the CFP and YFP proteins and split between a homologous 5' region and heterologous 3' regions.  The 5' homologous region is upstream of the splice sites, causing it to always be include in the processed mRNA, the 3' ends of the two florescent proteins are then alternatively spliced on, leadings to the production of either CFP or YFP.  This shows the production of two different isoforms of a fluorescent protein, the ratio of which can be modulated through the use of a splicing regulatory protein.
SxL Construct
The SxL construct simply allows inducible expression of the SxL protein in S. cerevisiae.  It accomplishes this by placing the D. melanogaster gene SxL under the control of a galactose inducible promoter.
Biobricks
The following biobricks were used in the above constructs:

TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Human Practice#Panel Discussion_-_-_TEXT.html,". At a panel discussion it became clear that the conscious use of resources and especially the recovery of these in Germany have to play an important role in the future. The Darmstadt iGEM team became clear that their project had met the ravages of time. Apart from the other projects the teams were able to provide an overview of the development of biotechnology in Germany. It was was clear that as well as the Red and White Biotechnology has precedence the furthest in the development. New technologies such as Systems Biology and particularly Synthetic Biology were observed more critically. Here the iGEM teams were aware that it applies to the next scientific generation to discuss topics like synthetic biology in an open and honest way and especially integrate the people. For this reason the German iGEM teams have pronounced an event day on 25th of August. All German teams in common should try to inform the people about their projects and also synthetic biology. It is up to the young scientists to inform about new technologies and to reflect them so that they can be explored and used in Germany.

23rd - 25th July 2012 CAS Conference - Synthetic Biology
The Center for Advanced Studies at the Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich organized a conference for Synthetic Biology on the campus Martinsried. On this occasion not only top researchers from around the world were invited, but also the German, British and Dutch iGEM teams. The iGEM team from the Technical University of Darmstadt was able to present their project ""Next Generation Recycling"" to scientific audience. Furthermore, it was a reunion of the German iGEM teams which met on the 3rd Annual Meeting of Strategic Process Biotechnology 2020+ in Berlin. At the congress the teams could discuss their projects and also the challenges they were faced during the lab work. The presentations provided insights in the latest research in Synthetic Biology and its application. At the end Jay Keasling, a famous representatives of the Synthetic Biology, talked about his urgent research projects. The CAS Conference gives the iGEM teams the occasion to learn about the other teams outside of the iGEM Jamboree. Special thanks for the LMU Munich iGEM team for their great organization of the evening with all the other teams.

Since Proteorhodopsin uses retinal as a chromophore for light reception, the supplied retinal is a key protein for the growth of the bacteria, hence people could give control to this system.
2011 Gaston Day School
Team Gaston Day School try to build a nitrogen detector that is easy to use for needed people, like farmers and ranchers. They use RFP as reporter, thus simple to know if there is nitrogen pollution.
After the detection, the bacteria have to be destroyed in case the drug-resistant ability spread out. Rather than using complicated circuit or method, they choose to carry out a simple method – bleach. Amazingly, bleaching has a significant effect on killing bacteria. It seems can kill the bacteria completely. Once we follow the bleach direction could we use the bacterial detector or other modified bacteria safely.
They give us an example that we don’t always have to find out the solution from a sophisticated way. Sometimes simple, is the best.
2010 SDU-Denmark
Ideas of the project
The project of SDU-Denmark is “Flow-E”, which is a nano-scale machine that generates a flow by a bacterial pump. The bacteria were aligned along the internal surface of a mirco-tube, and the flow was generated through the synchronized movement of the flagella of the bacteria. The flow depends on the number of the flagella, and to alternate the flow, synthesis of the flagella was regulated by the intensity of light.
Thus, the project may be divided into three parts: retinal biosynthesis, phototaxis by photosensors and hyperflagellation, which will be combined into bacteria eventually. Phototsensors are activated by the light, and the signal transduction pathway was then started and linked to the synthesis of flagella, resulting in hyperflagellation. Retinol acts as a relayed component that initializes the signal transduction.
Safety concerns of their project
The safety concerns of the project was divided into three parts: (1) project and researcher safety (2)laws and guidelines (3)watermark.
(1)Project and researcher safety
During the election of the project, numerous ideas were considered by the team: the environment, foods, health & disease, physics/chemistry/biochemistry. First of all, they discussed about which bacteria it was possible to use. Medical ideas for implementing in the body were also considered. Secondly, which type of the actual mechanical work to be done tended to be a great issue. Pili were considered but then abandoned due to its"

 Crazy Lab
Our board game “Crazy Lab” combines our project this year. The “Crazy Lab” describes how we turn the straw into hydrogen and butanol. We design an interesting story to make it more relevant to life. We want to share it with more people, expecting them to know about our project and the fun of synthetic biology.
 Gene Card online
“Gene Card online” is a turn-based online card game adapting from our product, “Gene Card”, which is a card game based on synthetic biology and genetic engineering. The game is a turn-based game. Through the game between players, the first to get six different base cards will win the game. It was very popular among iGEMers last year, so we decide to put it online.

A Journey Through Science Communication
Our journey through science communication, which we took in the process of addressing how uptake of technologies is a barrier facing synthetic biology biosensors, is documented here.
Synthetic Biology Dialogue
To gain awareness of previous work which has been completed in understanding public and stakeholder attitudes towards synthetic biology, we have read and reviewed the BBSRC’s 2010 study ‘ Synthetic Biology Dialogue ’. This has led us to carry out further research into certain points which were particularly pertinent for Newcastle University’s iGEM project, including concerns surrounding transparency in communication and how synthetic biology is covered by the media. Our key conclusions from this can be read here.

Language, Communication and Education Sciences
As part of our research, we had conversations with staff members at Newcastle University’s school of Language, Communication and Education Sciences. These provided further inspiration and technical advice for how we could study science communication. One of these was Dr Spencer Hazel - a Senior Lecturer in Applied Linguistics. Dr Hazel also completed British Science Association Media Fellowship, working for a month as a science writer at The Times. Hearing of his experiences, and learning about the process involved in publishing a story about science, is another thing which inspired us to further research science communication in the media. We decided to use corpus linguistics study language use in action during science communication.
Corpus Linguistics
Corpus linguistics is a method which can be used to access and analyse large bodies of text, and uncover patterns within them. In our research, we used corpus linguistics to complete searches for the terms"

JUNE 4TH TO JUNE 7TH
Product Development: Product Development conducted interviews with various hydroponic farmers and gathered data on how to build a mechanical component that would be most useful to them.
P&P: Together, P&P and Product Development spoke to Dr. Bill Miller at Cornell about the feasibility of our project as well as major aspects and issues with hydroponic agriculture. Furthermore, the team reached out to Rebecca Ireland-Perry at the Cornell Cooperative Extension to learn about hydroponic education in the community, and her interactions with growers, both traditional and hydroponic. Eli at Planted Earth Hydroponics gave team members a better idea of the operations and obstacles of commercial hydroponics. Through Product Development’s work at Rev, the team was able to make contact with PureSpinach, a hydroponic startup aimed at growing hydroponic spinach more efficiently. They spoke to the team about setting up a hydroponic system and their model.
Interviews: Alex Liu (Plant Sciences Undergraduate at Cornell), Gabriel Green (PureSpinach), Kyle Valachovic (PureSpinach), Dr. Bill Miller (Cornell School of Integrative Plant Science), Eli (Planted Earth Hydroponics), Rebecca Ireland-Perry (Cornell Cooperative Extension), Michael (Petal (Rev))
JUNE 8TH TO JUNE 10TH
P&P: Product development and P&P continued to interview hydroponic growers. The team received important feedback from them, including their needs. One key theme we found in our interviews was a need for a simple, continuous, real-time monitoring system. Furthermore, they learned that there were several sources of abiotic stress, including excess heat, insects, humidity, and pH fluctuations. They also found that many hydroponic growers were open to testing new methods and technology. The group also reached out to the Rasheed Hislop Community Garden in New York City to consider the ramifications of placing genetically-engineered bacteria in such close proximity to people’s food. While it isn’t common, team members did find that some hydroponic growers, such as those at             Terrapin Farms in Maryland, do use bacteria in their setup to provide benefits to crops.
