Yale,2011,Team:Yale#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the source of its potent antifreeze activity.  Preliminary and promising “fuzzy-ball” crystal hits for RiAFP have been obtained thus far. We are in the process of further optimizing conditions for crystallization. Additionally, we are in the process of using site-directed mutagenesis to replace methionine residues by Se-met in order to solve the crystallographic phase problem.
To read more about our crystallization efforts, please visit our crystallography page.
Outreach
Team Amsterdam found out during the summer that we were working on antifreeze proteins and requested biobricks of RiAFP, ZeAFP, and TmAFP for them to incorporate in their project. We sent them three parts for them to use in their icE. Coli project . This was done before our parts were submitted to the iGEM registry.
Sent AFP parts to Brown-Stanford for integration into their Mars tool kit
We are donating purified RiAFP to the Fikrig Lab at Yale to use as a positive control in their studies on purifying an antifreeze glycoprotein.
We donated competent Origami B cells to another group of researchers from Yale.
We donated a TmAFP plasmid to a researcher in the Elizabeth Rhoades lab at Yale looking for a highly disulfide bonded protein to use as a control.

DLUT_China_B,2018,Team:DLUT China B#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"                             the liquid crystals could not be arranged in parallel to discolor the observation. We                             reflect on                             whether the concentration of DMOAP in the experiment has an interference effect on the                             experimental results. Since DMOAP plays a role in inducing the vertical alignment of liquid                             crystals in the experiment, the reason for the analysis may be that DMOAP leads to the                             failure                             to obtain ideal experimental results. So we chose 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8% DMOAP                             concentration,                             and the antibody concentration was still 500 ng/mL. The DMOAP concentration was different,                             and                             the number of bright spots in the parallel light image was different (Fig. 4). From 0.8% to                             0.2%                             concentration, the main body of the image is black, but the number of bright spots is                             significantly increased. The number of bright spots is much higher at 0.2%; the number of                             bright                             spots on the image is less at 0.8%, which is equivalent to the previous 1%                             concentration.

Since the experimental results are not ideal, we consider re-selecting the experimental                             protocol.                             After consulting the literature and discussing with the professional researchers in the                             field,                             we decided to use the competition method.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Sensor_-_-_TEXT.html,"ET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in pur"

Referring to the possible game types, adventure and strategy games are students’ favorite, while some of them prefer stimulation and action games. In our program, we tried our best to listen to their voice and develop a game which is both educational and appealing.
Communication
We’d like to share what we have achieved with the world, so we did and will do a great deal to communicate with others and learn. For example, we collaborate closely with USTC wet team to learn what biology majors think of iGame and improve. Several seminars have been hold to make sure our program can really help the promotion of both synthesis biology and our tutor game. In addition, further transnational communication is not absent, like we had a deep talk with Dr. Joy Yueyue Zhang*(*BIOS Centre, London School of Economics and Politics Science) on how our program can change the development of both IGEM and make biology a better subject.
Yet we do not stop here. We have sent emails to other teams for further communications and asked for their opions on how we can improve iGame. What is more, all our codes are shared on github [1] (in the right picture). With fixes and new features putting forward every day,any one in any corner of the world can learn and keep update of our work, not just from the surface, but from codes and essense of our work. This is really a great way of communication, for we do not have to say too much to put our achieves across to those who really want to know our work, which really works. Great contributions have been given through github and we get a lot of advices and opinions as well.
Community
To better promote synthesis and the spirit of IGEM, we decided to establish a community together with IGEM USTC team. For the community, we have set regular classes and lectures for both synthesis biology and IGEM. We also open our laboratory to our community members and teach them basic skills of biology experiment(as in the right picture), like PCR. Of course, this is the main field we will update our progress on in the future.

The project of ZTU this year will use microbial toxins in termite control and prevention, though how to improve strain safety become a important subject. However, one important part of our project is delayed suicide of  microorganisms, so, in the hope of improving safety of their experiments, we provide them a complete regulatory suicide circuit, along which we also provide the detailed data of promotor's inducing expression intensity.
Collaboration with SJTU
This year, SJTU_Software build a biobrick selection assist system based on empirical algorithm. This system can generalize the heat map of different splicing pattern, based on the history record of its splicing sequence in the database, and provide a experiential score to the user. Experiential score is a score that not associated to certain experiment, so a specific situation is needed, which means it grades the results under different experiment condition.
We cooperate with SJTU_Software on the project of experiment grading and result predicting. We would set up multiple parallel experiment groups in the construction and testing of inverted components. These groups are comparable between their designs and results, which would become one of the pivotal parts of our project, and the data extracted from which would meet SJTU_Software’s needs.
Through our cooperation, they can grade our experiment results, then the scores would be compared to our evaluation. To SJTU_Software, the comparison of our experiment results and the design of our plasmids' construction is a case which can directly evaluate their software. And it is also meaningful for us to evaluate the circuits with software, which would be beneficial to improve our future experiments.

Ethics
BioEthics regarding the Biological Ethics, discussing about biological issues, have been debated since ancient times.  Bioethical issues gained widespread attention in recent years and are often extremely morally contentious. Considerable societal conflict exists regarding fundamental clinical issues such as: defining the beginning and end of life; appropriate standards of care; and broader environmental issues with potential social and health impacts such as growth of genetically-modified organisms and their use in the food supply.
BioEthics in Tsinghua iGEM
Here in Tsinghua iGEM 2010 Team, we are now focusing on some parts of BioEthics, such as animal handling requirement, care for animal welfare, appropriate standards of care, broader environmental issues with potential social and health impacts, impact of our products to be used in the manufacture and how to spread our ideas to make more people get this knowledge.
Thus we, Tsinghua iGEM 2010, pay our attention specially to BioEthics and keep our promise by two ways. One is to teach every member about keeping healthy, safe and being environmentally friendly while conducting experiments. The other one is to try visit and talk with more people, discussing about our projects, the current biological issues and how to promote the environment where we are living as well as let more people know about and start to be interested in Synthetic Biology and iGEM.

Safety
According to the WHO biosafety is the prevention of unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins, or their accidental release, whereas biosecurity is the prevention of loss, theft, misuse, diversion or intentional release of pathogens and toxins. (From https://2010.igem.org/Safety )
We are always paying special care to the safety of our teammates and the people around. Thus we signed a document to keep in rules about the Safety in Laboratory, not only to protect ourselves but also help to keep a clean and healthy environment.
The model animals we used are harmless engineering strains of Escherichia coli. They are widely used in all kinds of laboratories around the world. We answered the questions about safety on the Safety Page from  iGEM( https://2010.igem.org/Safety ) as following:

Outreach
Two of our team members traveled to Uppsala to present our project and the iGEM competition to Thermo-Fischer Scientific's employees in the form of an open seminar (Fig. 1 & 2). Anyone interested was allowed to attend, and the seminar room was packed with curious Thermo-Fischer Scientific employees. We got wonderfully positive feedback and it was great fun to spread information about iGEM and our project. Sigma-Aldrich had two representatives travel to our University where we held a joint-seminar for the Chemistry Institution about iGEM, our project, and an exciting new technique within Synthetic Biology that Sigma-Aldrich has developed (Fig. 3). Great exchange of knowledge for all!

Finally, it was very important for us to spread knowledge about Synthetic Biology and the possibilities within this area of research to a younger generation. Therefore we teamed up with our University and joined other researchers at our ""Popular Science Week"" hosted here in Linköping. High School students are invited to attend this week of presentations to get a better understanding about different science subjects. Naturally LiU iGEM 2014 was there to inspire young and bright minds to continue down the path of science!

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," we have made a prototype living material. In addition, we confirmed  that the hydrogel is non-toxic, which is crucial for a wound healing application. In experiments on S. aureus performed by our collaborator PAMM , we observed that our lysostaphin constructs effectively kill (methicillin-resistant) S. aureus.
Our solution in practice
Figure 5. A schematic of our wound healing plaster.
Approval
To allow the use of our living material as a wound healing plaster, we will need to prove its biocompatibility. We have demonstrated that our hydrogel does not contain any toxins after dialysis. Dextran is a biocampatible hydrogel, which is confirmed by its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM),(29). The E. coli strain used is safe to humans (30–32). Animal studies indicate that lysostaphin is non-toxic (12). This has, however, not been confirmed on humans. In principle, the components of our system are thus biocompatible, but the safety of the complete system must be verified in order to have our plaster approved as a medical device. As we learned from Koen Lim from Plasmacure, the approval trajectory will be a long and winding one. In our case, the approval trajectory would be even more complicated than for ‘regular’ pharmaceutics, as we are using living GMOs. For the remainder of the evaluation, we assume that the evaluation will succeed.
Costs
It is difficult to provide a cost estimation, as the final costs will be highly dependent on labor costs and the available manufacturing facilities. Nevertheless, we estimated the material costs. The production of one hydrogel (400 μL) only requires small dextran quantities (100 μg). Therefore, the estimated dextran costs for making one hydrogel in patch form is around €0,65. Adding other reagents will bring the total costs to approximately €1,00 for one hydrogel in small scale conditions. These costs can be optimized by upscaling.
Modification of the bacteria is a one-time expenditure. Afterwards they can be cultured and re-used for a long period. Culturing the bacteria can be performed on a large scale. The costs of medium are very low. The bacteria entrapped in the hydrogel can be modified to obtain different functionalities, such as the secretion of lysostaphin. Overall, the material costs for our living material are manageable, and upscaling will further reduce the costs. Although the exact manufacturing"

Thorough research lead to the finding that the OmpR-dependent promoter is not controllable when cloned on a high copy vector. As the modelling revealed, and which is evident from Figure 2-Main-Page
, a relatively low expression of RelE is required to induce dormancy, whereas high expression levels quickly result in overshooting. Since the OmpR-regulated promoter is an integrated part of the light sensing system, replacement is not an option. Therefore, the variability of the relE gene copy number was studied, and it was found that the OmpR-regulated promoter should be cloned into the bacterial chromosome or a low copy vector to obtain proper regulation Levskaya A, Chevalier AA, Tabor JJ, Simpson ZB, Lavery LA, Levy M, et al.

After vacation came a new academic semester and also a new beginning. Each group came up with their well-established ideas and details of their plans and presented them to each other. Decision was made by all of the members that which idea or project is the best one for the team. And “ E. colsim” captured everyone’s attention and won as the best idea. And so at the late February, the team determined their project and focused all their power and energy to work it out. In addition, to register the competition officially and at the same time acquire financial support from the department, the team had to prepare for the oral defence of the thesis in the department. To get support from the department, between late February and early March, everyday the team got together, discussed, enriched our plans and perfect our project. Fortunately, as an old Chinese phrase goes that KONG FU people live, the team successfully demonstrated their competency and received the financial support from the department.
After the oral defense, the team successfully registered competition and finally started the experiments and researches. Whether it’s day or night, whether it’s weekend or weekdays, there are members in the laboratory enjoying the happiness or overcoming the difficulties in the programs. Until now, six months has passed by, they still on their way to make their projects work well and still on their way to realize their dreams. Though there are tear and failures, setbacks and anxiety, the team still holds on. And on 3rd, October, 2012, the Asian qualifier, it’s time for the team to tell their ideas and dreams to the world.

Diffusion Equation
The equation for the rate of change of the concentration of particles in an inhomogeneous region, diffusion equation, also called ‘Fick’s second law of diffusion’, which relates the rate of change of concentration at a point to the spatial variation of the concentration at that point:$$\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}=D\frac{\partial ^{2}c}{\partial x^{2}}$$
Justification
Consider a thin slab of cross-sectional area A that extends from x to x + l.
Let the concentration at x be c at the time t. The amount (number of moles) of particles that enter the slab in the infinitesimal interval dt is JAdt, so the rate of increase in molar concentration inside the slab (which has volume Al) on account of the flux from the left is $$\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}=\frac{JA\mathrm{d}t}{Al\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{J}{l}$$
There is also an outflow through the right-hand window. The flux through that window is J′, and the rate of change of concentration that results is$$\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}=-\frac{J'A\mathrm{d}t}{Al\mathrm{d}t}=-\frac{J'}{l}$$
The net rate of change of concentration is therefore$$\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}=\frac{J-J'}{l}$$
Each flux is proportional to the concentration gradient at the window. So, by using Fick’s first law, we can write
Zhuangbility
We can calculate the net distance travelled on average by particles in a time t if they have a diffusion constant D. We calculate the probability that a particle will be found at"

Characterising the Biobrick
Contents
1 Characterising the Biobrick
1.1 Initial Tests
1.2 More detailed characterisation: 0 - 10mM assay
1.2.1 Experiment
1.2.2 Data
1.2.3 Graphs
1.3 Conclusions
With our BioBrick made, we then needed to establish whether it worked, and over what range. We began by checking simply whether it responded to nitrate at all. Then, having determined that it did, conducted a more detailed assay across the range of nitrate levels for which the BioBrick is most sensitive.
Having established the BioBrick was definitely switched on by 20mM of KNO3, we wanted to conduct a broader test of its behaviour across a range of different nitrate levels
Initial Tests
To begin with we simply wanted to determine whether the BioBrick worked as expected - producing GFP in the presence of  nitrates, but not without.
Two 5mL overnights were set up, one without any nitrogen and one with 20mM of Potassium Nitrate KNO3, made up according to the table below. This level was chosen as previous work by the Edinburgh 2009 iGEM team had shown the promoter strongly active by this point.

Mammalian cell experiments
Overview
The detection of CTC with our engineered MicroBeacon bacteria relies on the detection of two cancer markers, susceptibility to sTRAIL and elevated lactate production by cancer cells. To reproduce literature data on these two points we performed several experiments with several mammalian cell lines, optimizing our protocols until we reached the most reliable results. We perormed all our experiments with Jurkat cells and 3T3 cells, representing a cancerogenic and non-cancerogenic cell line, respectively. We performed our experiments also for HL60 cells"

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Hydrocarbon_-_-_TEXT.html," to use Pseudomonas resinovorans and Rhodococcus erythropolis to amplify these genes from. CarABC and AntABC from P. resinovorans has been shown to have a wide range of nitrogen containing substrate specificity. R. erythropolis contains the amdA gene that we wish to use, and some evidence suggests that it may also be able to degrade sulfur rings through its CarABC pathway.
In addition to our research we have also been learning some of the lab techniques we will be using this summer. This includes transforming a plasmid into E. coli, plating and selecting for bacteria containing the plasmid, verifying with colony PCR, performing a mini-prep and a restriction digest.
Desulfurization
Along with the rest of the team, this week was dedicated to familiarizing ourselves on the protocols that will be utilized during this years project; specifically the polymerase chain reaction, gel verification, preparation of overnight cultures, as well as developing a procedural flowchart to transform competent cells with registry biobricks. With regards to our sub-group specific goals, we reviewed the current available literature around various industrial and laboratory approaches to desulfurization of organic groups, especially in the petroleum industry. This included a comparison of non-biological processes such as conventional hydrodesulfurization, which is currently employed in petroleum product refinery stages, and how a biological approach would supplement and perhaps even offer several advantages over these methods. Current limitations to biological desulfurization, however, include such factors as biocatalyst stability, enzyme specificity, desulfurization rate, and a need for a carbon source to regenerate co-factors. We also identified the enzyme desulfinase (DszB) as being one of the bottlenecks in the desulfurization 4S pathway. Overall, our goals moving forward involve determining the specific pathways involved in the desulfurization process as well as the reaction conditions we would want to employ, and identifying specific model compounds in addition to dibenzothiophene (DBT) that we could use to test the effectivity of our biosystem in order to determine its functionality in the conversion of naphthenic acids to economically valuable hydrocarbons.
Ring Cleavage
This week we mainly researched aromatic ring cleaving using intra- and extradiol dioxygenases from species of Pseudomonas and Bacillus but also began literature searches on aliphatic ring cleavage done by monooxygenases.

Education Fair between city and countryside
Current situation of the education in countryside and city
65% of the population of China is from countryside. The illiterate and the half illiterate are 21.9 million. Even in the group of people who have job, the illiterate and the half illiterate account for 35.9%, and their average degree of education is four years. This phenomenon is quite different to the city. (Yang,2011)
There are several reasons for this embarrassing circumstances. The most crucial cause is the discrepancy of the government’s finance input. The input to the countryside’s education is really low. The educational appropriations mainly put into the city’s school and center schools of villages and towns. The research of the United Nations in 2003, the educational appropriations only took 3% of GDP. Additionally, the input from the government was 53%, while the rest was from the parents. For example, in 2000, the average educational appropriations of students in Shanghai was 2756 yuan, while in Henan was 261 yuan. It’s apperant that the input is not equal, but the government’s input makes a great difference for the education process. (Yu,2013) There is no doubt that the more investment in education, the better condition our students will get. However, the students from countryside can not get the necessary resource so it impedes them to know more about the high-technic and the newly scientific development.
Furthermore, the level of teachers are also distinct. And the gap is becoming wider and wider. The number of teachers in city is over its demand, while in the countryside is indeed limited and even lacked. For instance, it is very common in the countryside, a teacher has to take charge of several subjects or grades, but the subject don’t match their major and some of them didn’t graduate from the normal university. Therefore, maybe the ability"

Environmental
Waste management of the GMMs
As GMMs are used in this system, it is essential to think about their waste management. After the use of the GMMs for the detection of V. cholerae and the purification of water, they must be killed before throwing them away. The questions are: how to kill them and where to dump the GMMs?
Recyclable plastic
In order to have an eco-friendly approach, the plastic used for the device must be recyclable.
Material
GMMs storage
GMMs (V. harveyi and P. pastoris) must be confined in the same compartment because they need to interact with each other. The microorganisms must be kept in this compartment. If they are freeze-dried, the water to be treated must be able to rehydrate the microorganisms. Therefore, water must be able to enter into the compartment.
To sum up, the compartment containing the microorganisms must hold them back but also, allow exchanges of CAI-1 molecules, AMPs and water between the two compartments of the device.
Easy to use
In developing countries, war-torn countries or those affected by natural disasters, people cannot possess a complex device from both a scientific and technical point of view.
Transportable
The device must be easy to transport in order to reach the populations of remote villages or in conditions of natural disaster and armed conflict.
Treatment speed
The treatment speed must be reasonable compared to the volume of treated water.
Water treatment capacity
The water treatment capacity must be adapted to the device function and to the capacity of the microorganisms to detect and treat the water. According to Alama Keita (UNICEF), our device must be able to purify around 11,025 L of water in a week for a village.
Strength
The device has to be built with robust materials (refer to paragraph “Spreading of the GMMs”).
Water taste
Water treatment must not modified its taste so that the product can be easily accepted.
Economical
The price must be adapted to similar options offered on the market.
Chloramine tablets are often used to treat water. In order to be competitive on the market, it is necessary to bring our price into line with our competitors. Therefore, to give us an order of magnitude, cost of chloramine tablets to treat the same volume of water as our product can be calculated.

SMMU-China,2018,Team:SMMU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the treatment of our medicine, the heart is rejuvenated.
Moral
The core of our project is to antagonize the phosphorylation of s2808 site on the calcium channel RyR2, the key site of heart failure, through the protection of AR-185 antibody, so as to avoid calcium overload and ultimately inhibit the deterioration of heart failure. We think of AR-185 as a warrior who protects the S2808 locus of cardiomyocytes. They're targeted and powerful. The s2808 locus is a home that they need to defend.
Contribute our love
On September 23, we came to the Shanghai Yanji geracomium to give a lecture on heart failure prevention to the old people. On the day of the event, we were still a bit embarrassed, not knowing if our activities would achieve the desired results. Fortunately, the event was very successful.          During the lecture, our team members talked on the stage, and the audience was almost full. After the presentation, there are still many elderly people around the presenter to ask questions, while our other members are obliged to perform regular physical examinations for the elderly. After the event, the president of the nursing home thanked us for the wonderful presentations we had brought to the old people. Maybe we spent a short time in the nursing home, but as long as they can understand the importance of heart failure prevention and action in the days to come, our actions are meaningful.
Clinical research
We designed a questionnaire to investigate the basic information and severity of disease. The patients were admitted in our investigation according to the inclusion criteria:
(1) Diagnosed as heart failure in accordance with criteria from the Chinese Medical Association Cardiovascular Society's ""Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Heart Failure"";
(2) Over 18 years old;
(3) Informed consent and signed informed consent.
The patients were excluded according to exclusive criteria:
(1) Mental illness or cognitive impairment;
(2) Complicated with severe organ dysfunction or malignant tumor.
The content was designed according to the NYHA classes for heart failure. Some patients’ relatives answered the questionnaire due to patients were unable to finish the questionnaire. The research was conducted from March 1st to September 31th in the cardiovascular department of Changhai Hospital. There were totally 76 patients admitted into the test. And we can find that the average cost on the HF treatment is about 47.32 thousand yuan per year. The average hospitalization time is about 18.78 days per year.

The results for all the genes we selected are summarized in this file.
To exclude “false positive” interaction partners (e.g. caused by a very weak interaction) we picked grown colonies and transferred them onto plates with a selection medium that allows only yeast cells containing peptides with a strong affinity to our surface proteins to grow. After this procedure and several previous selection steps, we still had around 70% of our interaction partners from the first screening.
To have a manageable amount of samples, we chose 10 of the interaction partners (peptides) which we found in the Y2H screen for each of our 20 surface proteins and used them for further analysis.  The cells containing the plasmids were plated on selection plates and the Y2H screen was repeated to finally confirm the interaction between one of our surface proteins and a specific peptide. This time, we used a robot to fasten up the screen and to be able to analyze a large number of possible interactions at the same time.
Interactions could be verified in 70% of all tested interaction partners!
In the last step, we tested the interaction of our surface proteins and the peptides in in vivo experiments.

nbsp;   Secondly, we conducted a closer look into the structure of MerR family TFs(Brown et al., 2003; Hobman, 2007; Hobman et al., 2005). The metal binding domain of MerR is a 48-residue, named alpha-helix 5(Guo et al.; Song et al., 2007). A strategy to engineer MerR TF proteins was developed from previous work (Qin et al., 2006; Song et al., 2004). We directly fused two copies of alpha helix 5 into a single-chain,antiparallel coiled coil, called Metal Binding Domain (MBD). MBD reduces cost of metal binding. And then high-performance bioabsorbent was accomplished by"

This initial chip consists of four inputs, one for the initial sample and the other three are used to dilute that initial sample by adding water. Following each addition of water are mixer so that the liquids are mixed into one homogenous, dilute solution. While the chip works in theory, for this design to work, the initial flow rate of the initial sample is 0.1 or 0.01 mL/hour. This slow rate alongside the larger dimensions of these channels made using this chip unfeasible. And it was redesigned with smaller features.
Version 2
In an attempt to solve the problem of multiplying flow rates faced by the last chip, this version tried to siphoned off three quarters of each dilution through varying resistance. The hope was to mitigate the dramatic increase in flow rates further downstream by only allowing a portion of the flow to continue through the chip, thus allowing faster initial flow rates then those used in the previous chip design. Unfortunately, by creating a path with an intentionally lower resistance, all the flow was redirected to this path instead of just 75% intended to follow this path. This left no fluid to continue through the rest of the chip.
Version 3
This chip is similar in design to that of the original version of this chip with the two primary differences being smaller feature sizes and the addition of more outputs and accompanying valves. The point of smaller feature dimensions is to decrease the wait time, even when using the small flow rates used in the initial chip design. The valves are used for two purposes: testing and timing. This chip was tested with a member of the 2018 BostonU iGEM team using a green fluorescent protein as the initial sample in order to determine the accuracy of each dilution.                 The valves leading to the additional output ports provides
manipulation of the fluid and the ability to collect a sample after each dilution instead of just the third. After testing the system, relying on visual cues to facilitate each dilution, it was determined that the some math modeling needed to be done to determine the timing needed for each mixer to reach a steady state before collecting each of the three outputs.

After NEGEM, we started a brief collaboration with the MIT iGEM team. As part of their project, they were looking for a way to culture two different types of cells in the same environment under a continuous influx of media. The outputted media would then be analyzed to see if the inhibitor molecules they were looking to produced had been secreted"

6. Fluorescent ratiometric construct for standardizing promoter output(Part:BBa_K911009)
Biosensors may give unreliable outputs. This is due to differences in the number and state of the cells from test to test. By including an internal control signal, to which another inducible signal may be normalised, the reliability and reproducibility of a sensor may be significantly improved. The construct that uses an inducible eCFP (E0020) and a constitutively expressed eYFP (E0030) under the control of the constitutive promoter Pveg (K143012). The construct is optimized in both E. coli and B. subtilis, through the use of B. subtilis ribosome binding sites GsiB (K143020) and SpoVG (K143021).

Description
Hyperuricemia and refractory gout are caused by the high urate concentration in the blood. Considering there                 are still debates on whether the drug should be used in the asymptomatic hyperuricemia patients and the drug                 resistance of the refractory gout patients, new approaches are eagerly needed. We constructed the urate metabolic                 pathway in the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 and applied it in the gut to reduce the urate concentration                 in the blood indirectly. In addition, we built a dialysis-like device combined with modified bacteria to                 utilize the urate directly in the blood. Our solutions provide a suitable, long-term and non-drug treatment                 for the asymptomatic hyperuricemia patients and an ultimate treatment for the refractory gout patients.

Reducing the urate concentration in the gut for HUA patients.
There’s a pathway to metabolite urate to allatonin existing in bacteria and plant. The process is shown in the Figure 1.                     Urate is catalyzed into hydroxyisourate by uricase (1.7.3.3), then hydroxyisourate can react spontaneously                     and form allantoin. Allantoin is highly soluble in water and can be easily excreted from the body. The                     abovementioned new uricase drug is based on this mechanism. There are another two enzymes (3.5.2.17,                     4.1.1.97) that can speed up the process from hydroxyisourate to allantoin.

Biotransfert Day
Organized by students of INSA Toulouse every year, Biotransfert day is a full-day of conferences about biology. This year theme was Synthetic Biology and we got famous stakeholders like Philippe Marlière, one of the leader in synthetic Biology in France, or Thierry Magnin, director of the Catholic Institute of Lyon. We had also the great honor to brielfly introduce our project at the end of the day.
COS Presentation (TWB)
Organized by Mr MONSAN on february, 15th, the aim of this presentation was to invite for TWB all their scientific partners and investors in order to show them the perspective of this new company. It was for our iGEM team a great opportunity to present our project in the goal of finding new financial supports for the iGEM competition.
LISBP presentation
First of our presentations, we explain our project to all of our teachers and people who works at the INSA Toulouse. It was kind of “big test” for us,  the occasion to receive an external point of view concerning the project. Some essential issues had been raise and we also received good advice.

Chalmers-Gothenburg,2015,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#OtherApplications_-_-_TEXT.html," the chemical markers, but without the downsides of auxotrophic markers. However, since the irradiation causes no chemical waste handling it would be the more ethical choice.
Space applications
The next frontier, the border to the unexplored, space. Having sustainable production of resources is one of the big problems needing a solution before we start colonizing other planets. Mars is a possible candidate for colonization but it wouldn’t be easy.  There is only a low abundance of oxygen and therefore ozone in the atmosphere. Without ozone, a lethal amount of UV radiation bombards the surface of Mars making most life from earth unable to survive. Another problem to life forms such us ours, is the lack of oxygen which leads to death by suffocation.
A solution for the colonizing would be to grow plants on mars, and when you have adult plants, then, it is only a matter of placing them in a synthetic environment like a dome. Humans could then possible live inside the dome.
All of this starts with developing a mechanism for plants to survive in high levels of UV. Some projects, like the one of our neighbor team UNIK Copenhagen ( https://2015.igem.org/Team:UNIK_Copenhagen ), are trying to design vegetation which survives on mars. They take a lot more survival factors than UV irradiation into an account, but our repair system could be one of the pieces needed for the final product."

Heidelberg :
We aided in their development of an NRPS database by submitting metal binding NRPS parts which we had done some work with. We also helped their modelling by testing their NRPS designer. This allowed us to put out NRPS data to use whilst also helping in Heidelburg's development of their software.
Stanford-Brown :
We collaborated with the Stanford-Brown team on Bacillus subtilis protocols and in trying to design a vector. This is also a potential collaboration for future work we did not have time to finish.
SDU-Denmark :
They helped us in the mathematical aspect of our modelling when we were having problems with oscillations when solving a differential-algebraic system of equations. We worked together on implementing different implicit and explicit methods.
Newcastle :
The Newcastle team helped us with our modelling by finding for us some parameters about the Bacillus subtillis metabolism from the literature.
From our side, we participated in a skype conference between the Newcastle team and our team. In this meeting, our Human practices advisors and ourselves helped the Newcastle team with their Human Prectices. While they are investigating creating a bacillus without a cell well, we discussed the possible dangers and advantages of releasing these cells into the environment. We also gave them ideas for possible analogues between synthetic biology and architecture.
Paris Bettencourt :
We completed a survey for them regarding different motives for participating in iGEM.

Talks & Media
We held panel discussions and attended various meetings and seminars in order to exchange ideas and refine our project. Meanwhile, we presented our project with more in-depth details to more than thirty Chinese iGEM teams in Central China iGEM Consortium. (More details) Besides, not only did we utilize online media involving Twitter, Wechat, Renren Blog and wiki to expand the influence of our activities and synthetic biology, but were involved to write Biweekly Newsletter, which can be regarded as a collection of information and introduction about most iGEM teams and a better access to exchange teams’ ideas conveniently.
Survey Questionnaire
In  the process of building a new iGEM team, we discovered several problems in the  development of iGEM in China. As a result, in order to investigate the current  situation of iGEM at home and abroad, and find solutions for our team and more  Chinese teams, we designed and carried out a survey questionnaire on university  involvement in iGEM. More than one hundred iGEMers replied to assist us in  gathering iGEMers’ perspectives and feelings.
Team Collaboration   
In  cooperation with other ten iGEM teams, we collected issues of each team and  posted a questionnaire in order to understand different people’s views on project-related  issues in different regions of the world and make publicity for synthetic biology.  Also, our team members visited and communicated with some teams in depth such  as Tsinghua-A and NKU.
 
Seek Sponsors
We contacted with more than one hundred companies, most of which are biotechnology companies. We introduced the iGEM and our project to them and showed our sponsorship proposal. When looking for sponsorship, we not only obtained the sponsor fees but made better promotion of iGEM and synthetic biology. With the opinions from the experts, we can better our project. Additionally, we also harvest a lot of experience and deepen our understanding of our project when going out of school and contacting workers and experts.(More details)
Educational & Public Engagement
Science & Education Exhibition
On Saturday 4th April 2015, Tianjin University opened its doors to the general public for its fourth White Crabapple Season Open Day, where this year we hosted a stand. Over 30,000 people entered our campus throughout the day and visited our Science & Education Exhibition.

Transform remainders of pFB9010 stored at -20 C (nanodrop, transform)
Try digestion of J23107 again – did not work AGAIN! Will attempt another time but with another lab’s REs, SAP and buffer.
If digestion works, ligate with I13507. – did not work =(
August 19
Digestion of J23107 was re-done using REs, Buffer and SAP from another lab (except for SpeI, since it was not available from anyone else.) This did not work either.
We think that maybe there is something wrong with the J23107 miniprepped stock in the -20C fridge, so we will make a new one. Took J23107 from frozen stock and streaked onto an Amp100 plate, as well as inoculated into Amp100 liquid culture. This will be miniprepped tomorrow.

Miniprepped J23107
Nanodropped and digested – SUCCESSFUL!!!!
Gel Purified and Nanodropped
Concentration according to nanodropping is ~ 1ng/ul = way too low.
More J23107 and I13507 will be inoculated over the weekend, and will be minirepped and digested on Monday.
Regarding LPS, took a Km20 plate which yielded good results, and inoculated it into the following liquid cultures.
Km20, Km10, Km20/Sm100, Km20/Sm50,Km10/Sm100,Km10/Sm50, Sm50, Sm100.
This was done to ensure that the concentration of Sm or Km is not too high in the liquid cultures (mass transfer accounts for erroneously high concentration in comparison to solid agar on plates.)
August 22
Results from inoculations of various Km/Sm concentrations were as follows:
Contents  Results
Km10  +++ (red precipitate on the bottom)
Km20  +++ (red precipitate on the bottom)
Sm50  +++(very little white-ish red precipitate on the bottom)
Sm100  -/+ (looks little bit cloudier than regular LB, but that could be due to re-suspension of the patches, since it was taken from a patch, not from a single colony)
Km10/Sm50  +++ (red precipitate on the bottom)

Valencia_UPV,2016,Team:Valencia UPV#Loop_-_-_TEXT.html," below it can be                         appreciated that there are two sources of variability                         affecting the energetic balance of duplex                         hybridization. On one hand, there is a clear dependence                         of the nucleotide, and on the other hand, the type of                         nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) also affects the free energy                         increment.
Figure 12.                            Comparison between the energy exchange resulting from hybridizations with all possible nucleotides of RNA or DNA
Thus, we had to choose an approach which considered the                         energy differences between different nucleotides and different nucleic acids. Moreover, the model used to                         estimate the energetic cost of forming the R-loop, had                         to consider the distance of base pairs to the PAM region.
This kind of forward move which considers all the                         mentioned criteria, is known as nearest neighbor model.                         The meaning of this model is that RNA:DNA union will                         rely on the context. The energy used to bind a pair of                         duplexes, uses the energy released by the previous                         duplex union. In other words, it is assumed that the                         energy from the kth hydrogen bond will be                         used in the reaction of the nearest base pair, k +                         1.
Thus, the hybridization of several nucleotides can be                         represented as a sequence of binding reactions, leading                         to a global difference between the hydrolysis of                         DNA:DNA bounds, and the union of gRNA:DNA strands. The                         term ΔΔGexchange gRNA:target reflects the                         difference between the free energy used for the pair                         DNA-DNA hydrolysis and the pair RNA-DNA hybridized.
However, the gRNA may have thermodynamically stable                         unions with other regions which are not the target.                         Those DNA regions, named off-targets, may have only few                         mismatches that slightly affect its affinity towards                         the gRNA. The half part of the gRNA close to the PAM,                         is the most determining to form the R-loop. Therefore, if mismatches are placed in the extreme opposite to the                         PAM, they may will not compromise the off-target                         knockout.
In a similar way as we did with matching duplexes, our                         first try was to find more information about energy                         accounted when mismatches are produced. Nevertheless,                         there is poor consensus among bibliography, not all                         possible duplexes have been studied and we neither                         could determine these energetic values empirically.
In order to solve this, we created a penalty vector which adds a penalty to the match binding energy for                         each mismatch:

Mathematical Formulation
High dimensional model representation(HDMR) is a general set of quantitative model assessment and analysis tools for capturing high dimensional IO system behavior. As the impact of the multiple input variables on the output can be independent and cooperative, it is natural to express the model output ()fx as a finite hierarchical correlated function expansion in terms of the input variables:
<math> f(x) = f_{0}+\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}(x_{i})+\sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n} f_{ij}(x_{i}, x_{j})+ </math>
<math>\sum_{1\leq i<j<k\leq
n}f_{ijk}(x_{i},x_{j},x_{k})+...+ </math>
<math>
\sum_{1\leq i_{1}<...<i_{l}\leq n}f_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(x_{i1},x_{i2},...,x_{il})+...+f_{12...n}(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}) </math>
where the zeroth-order component function <math>f_{0}</math> is a constant representing the mean response to <math>f(x)</math>, and the first order component function <math> f_{i}(x_{i})</math> gives the independent contribution to <math>f(x)</math> by the ith input variable acting alone, the second order component function <math>f_{ij}(x_{i},x_{j})</math> gives the pair correlated contribution to <math>f(x)</math> by the input variables <math>x_{i}</math> and <math>x_{j}</math>, etc. The last term contains any residual <math>n</math>th order correlated contribution of all input variables.

At 9:30 a.m, we finished no.4, no.5, no.2. and no.6’s streaking and cultured them in the incubator. At 10 a.m, new parts have been streaked and cultured in the incubator. In the afternoon, we make up some antibiotics. Extract no.11’s plasmids which have failed to be transformed to study how to increase plasmids’ concentration and at the same time keep proteins’ remnants at a low level.

Minnesota,2014,Team:Minnesota#Templates#home_-_-_TEXT.html," zones of inhibition. The diameter of the zone of inhibition was measured in triplicate. Green corresponds to pBBRBB::gfp, blue to pBBRBB::merRTPAB, and red to pBBRBB::merΔmerA. Individual constructs range from highest resistance in the following order: merRTPAB > vector control >merΔmerA.  Our results show that both the recombinant E. coli and Pseudomonas putida containing the pBBRBB::mer plasmid were able to grow significantly closer to the HgCl2 disc than the negative control (pBBRBB::GFP). The E.coli strain containing the merA deletion plasmid could not survive as close to the heavy metal spotted disc as the negative control. This is likely due to the fact that it still contains the transport proteins MerP and MerT, and therefore transports the toxic mercury ions into the cell without remediating it due to the lack of MerA, causing cell death. On the other hand, the pBBRBB::GFP control was not able to take up any mercury ions.

1st MeHg data In addition to testing 2 biological replicates of ""E.coli"" and ""Pseudomonas"" strains carrying the “pBBRBB::mer” plasmid, strains containing the “pBBRBB::gfp” within encapsulation beads were tested as a negative control within encapsulation beads. LB (abiotic) as well as LB (abiotic) containing 0.5g encapsulation beads were also used as negative controls. Unencapsulated bacteria of each strain were also tested to compare the efficiency of those cells in direct contact with MeHg to those within the encapsulation beads.
Experiments were conducted by adding methylmercury chloride to 7 mL of LB at a final concentration of 1 mg/L. The methylmercury levels were analyzed at the start of the experiment and after 36 hours. At each time point the samples were diluted a million-fold before taking measurements with a Tekran model 2700 Automated Methyl Mercury Analyzer using EPA method 1630 without distillation. This is a highly sensitive and ultra-stable cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVAFS) Hg detector.

Synthetic Biology enthusiasts from around Cambridge gather once a month in a pub behind the Chemistry Department. We were invited to present our work in this informal setting. We discussed our ideas with people from a range of disciplines and received a lot of great advice on how to effectively communicate.
Visit to the John Innes Centre and meeting with the UEA team
We travelled up to the Norwich Research Park to see our JIC advicer, George Lomonosoff, and exchange ideas with the UEA team. We were also given a tour of the area, including the impressively large growth facility. It was a great chance to meet face to face with our RFC collaborators (RFC 105: Standardized Plant Syntax) and debate our ideas.
YSB 2.0
The team attended the Young Synthetic Biology Conference in August. Firstly it was lovely to see familiar faces from the Oxford Conference, and to find out how their ideas had changed, advanced and developed.
We presented our project. It was really encouraging to see the excitement that arose from the audience, their immediate engagement and the questions that came up.
Plus it was a great opportunity to reflect on and improve our presentation technique.
To our delight, we met a team working on the same enzyme as us and shared experiences. We also set up collaborations with a team to standardize protocols and to research in iGEM team dynamics.

We have determined that Dre/Rox recombinase is likely the most efficient SSR in E. coli, and that it is orthogonal to the rest of the recombinases. However, we also observed that the SCre/VCre and VCre/Vika pairs would cross-react with one another. As a result, we do not suggest using either pair to catalyse parallel recombination events in one cell. Therefore, we recommend using Dre, Cre, SCre, and Vika for parallel reactions in E. coli, as all four listed will have minimal interference with one another.

Logic gates and software
We have designed two-input OR, NOR, AND, NAND, XOR, and XNOR gates using the excision property of two orthogonal tyrosine recombinases. See our designs in the design page.
As they contain a high degree of repetitiveness, we had difficulty ordering them as a single DNA block. Therefore, we designed software to break up the repetitive elements into several oligonucleotides. This allows convenient design and ordering of target sites. The details on how to download and use our software can be found in the accessibility page under the human practice section.
Modeling the behavior of site-specific recombinase
We have built deterministic and stochastic models to simulate the behavior of our E. coli strain used for measurement (BL21 (DE3) E. coli carrying T7-LacO-recombinase generator and measurement constructs). The model is able to predict that the leaky expression of recombinase can induce a significant degree of terminator excision, leading to a moderate background expression of RFP.
Furthermore, we have developed an algorithm and used it to scan through the genome of E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain, and"

If we can successfully operate one enzyme to E. coli, it may synthesize geraniol using geranyl diphosphate as a precursor. In this context, we designed our system for establishing the concept of “Flavorator” to build up a brand-new biosynthetic pathways, in which geraniol is produced in the E. coli.  In doing so, we transfered the three types of genes listed below to create the hyper-producer E. coli of geraniol.
We examined our working hypothesis to “Flavorator” that the volatile gaseous substances from plants’ origin can show either the antibacterial or bacteriostatic activity in a box like Kozoko.
Preventive effect of grated garlic
Protocl here
Garlic was known to produce its flavorous substance (alicin) to suppress unwanted microbial growth. We checked the effect of volatile substance, whether it is effective to prervent mean deay or not. The left figure (A) shows that the pink color of the fresh pork meat was not changed. The right one (B) shows that the color of the pork meat was changed from pink to brown. Based on these observations, grated garlc has the preventive(s) to protect the pork's decay, possibly by releasing the antibacterial substances from the garlic.

Meetings with institutional actors in the fight against air pollution
Then, after sensitizing the general public by the means we have exposed so far, we also presented the solution aether to a number of actors in the fight against pollution. We introduced them about our solution based on synthetic biology and we benefited from their feedback to improve the design and scenario of our device.
French Ministry of Environment On August 8th, 2017, we met Mr. Hubert Holin, in charge of air quality at the Ministry of the Environment. We introduced him to iGEM, our project, and the application scenario we envisioned. M. Holin comforted us in our idea of ​​targeting indoor pollution. Indeed, he said that to clean the outside air, it is better to fight the sources than to propose a solution downstream. He also described the energy autonomy of our product as a great advantage for some emerging countries, where access to electricity is not always guaranteed. He told us that it would be interesting to have a first commercial phase (in the scenario, we considered rather a free distribution) on a smaller scale (10,000 copies for example). Such an approach would show the politicians that there is an appetite for the general public and that there is a real solution to the problem of indoor air pollution. By mapping the pollutants, we could also sound the alarm. Finally, Mr. Holin gave us valuable"

What We Do
The  burning  of  fossil  fuels  generates  greenhouse  gases  that  are  damaging  the  atmosphere  and  impacting  the  global  environment.  Energy  from  sustainable  sources  such  as  wind  and  solar  is  difficult  to  store  for  times  when  the  wind  is  not  blowing  or  the  sun  is  not  shining.
In  order  to  build  a  sustainable  energy  source  for  energy  on  demand  we  are  creating  a  system  using  living  organisms.  E.  coli  will  be  engineered  to  synthesize  lactate  which  will  then  be  used  to  feed  a  Shewanella  biofilm.  Shewanella  is  a  bacteria  that  can  transfer  electrons  to  a  cathode  and  produce  a  current  to  light  a  bulb.  The  community  will  be  involved  through  a  DNA  Code  Game  designed  for  middle  and  elementary  school  students  to  raise  awareness  of  synthetic  biology  and  iGEM.

Safety & Security
The Safety of our project:
Safe Project Design
Our project connects the four elements—sound, light, color, odor—together , and the whole process was divided to three parts: sound to light, light to color, light to odor. The sound to light module is achieved by our software, while the light to color and odor module is based on the RGB system reported by Prof. Christopher A Voigt in 2017[1]. We did some modifications and applications of the system, using the parts previously submitted by iGEM teams.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
The parts of the RGB system we used in our project have been edited to reduce the toxin by the Lab of Prof. Christopher A Voigt. The chromoprotein parts we used have been submitted to the registry by Uppsala University team in 2012, and the odor parts we used have been submitted to the registry by Paris Bettencourt in 2014.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are JF1(modified from K12) and DH5α, which means that all the organism we"

To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help from"

AALTO-HELSINKI 2016
We were lucky to have quite a few collaborations. We got to help in starting up a new iGEM team, as we were approached by UCLouvain team from Belgium. It happened to be that one of their team members was on an exchange in the University of Helsinki, so we met and talked. We told as well as we could how our team was assembled the first time and what problems they had had. We talked about financing the project, choosing the project subject and about founding an organization to help with the financial side. Hopefully our tips were helpful and UCLouvain has had a great time in iGEM!
Thanks to the Stockholm conference we made good friends with the other Nordic iGEM teams and got to do a small collaboration with the Uppsala team. They asked for general information and methods for working with yeast, since they knew from our NiC presentation that we were working with yeast. We had a Skype meeting with them and sent our protocols.
EPF Lausanne team contacted us regarding a collaboration project they were planning to do which was somewhat related to our CollabSeeker. They wanted to create a platform, in the form of a blog or website, on which they could present iGEM teams and projects through “news articles”.  We informed them about the CollabSeeker, which they found very exciting. We ended up giving them an interview via Skype, telling more about our search engine and answering questions to the survey they had prepared.
We also got in touch with a few other teams. We shared information about ourselves and CollabSeeker for XMU-China team’s exchange platform – Newsletter.
We had a Skype meeting with TEC CEM team and shared information about our teams as well as projects. The team, which is from Mexico, didn’t know that we had a true mexican in our team, and finding out about this was really fun.
We also helped METU HS Ankara team who wanted to create a database consisting of protocols in different language. We helped them to achieve their goal by translating our protocols into Finnish. Protocols were about Transformation, LB Broth, LB Agar, ONC, Competent Cell Preparation by Calcium Chloride, Getting the DNA Parts from the Kit Plate, Mini Prep Plasmid Isolation and Plasmid Isolation."

THE FIFTH CONFERENCE
OF CHINA IGEMER COMMUNITY
    “Among us, past, present and futuremeet. ”
    With excitement, the team members of the HUBU-Wuhan igem team boarded the train to Shanghai. For the reason of the experiment, we arrived at Shanghai Tech University  on the fourth day, the transparent glass appearance of the conference center, the delicious tea break time, the wonderful professional professors’ lectures all showed the organizer's intention.
    We walked into the classroom and listened to the presentation of TSINGHUA, iGEM Tianjin and other teams. We learned the application and development of synthetic biology in more fields which has broadened our thinking. In the evening， we came to shcool of life science and technology .We explained our projects to other teams. At the same time, in the process of communicating with other teams and answering questions, we also had new ideas for our projects. Sure enough, the communication collided with the spark of thought.
    By the next day, we started our own team’s presentation. Because it was the first team to show, it was a bit nervous a. At the Q&A session, students from other teams asked us questions about how to solve H2SO4 in the project. Our H2SO4 concentration is only 3% and is recycled. Next is the panel session hosted by Haotian Guo. Together with UESTC-China, Haotian Guo used his humor to successfully bring the atmosphere of the whole classroom, and joked that only 6 members of our team were a kind of newborn calf. The behavior is also a new idea.
    At noon lunch, we had dinner with HBUT.,communicated the projects of each team and HP progress, learned more forms of HP, and made iGEMers have a deeper friendship.
    This ccic trip, let us go out of the lab, get to know new partners, learn the advantages of other teams inpresentation, poster, etc., and appreciate the unique charm of synthetic biology, and let us have a new understanding about igem, about experiment, about personal growth . Goodbye to the fifth ccic,"

Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus"

An overview of the Gibson assembly method is provided in Figure 1 below and involves the ligation of DNA oligos, or ‘gBlocks’, of varying size (upto 500 BP each). As can be seen in the figure, gBlocks contain overlapping DNA regions of at least 30 BP which are exposed upon the action of the exonuclease. This facilitates complimentary base pairing between gBlocks.  The simultaneous action of a DNA polymerase (preferably with proof-reading activity) and Taq polymerase, respectively, then complete and seal the newly formed conjugate (Gibson et al., 2010, Gibson et al., 2009).
The technique has obvious advantages in terms of time efficiency and simplicity. It involves considerably less labour and steps to complete compared to traditional methods. In particular there are no polymerase cycling assembly; PCR, gel purification; restriction digestion and DNA ligation steps are necessary (Gibson et al., 2010). For these reasons we have chosen to apply this technique to the assembly our BioBricks.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#translational system#translation mechanism_-_-_TEXT.html," recognized that the Escherichia coli cells containing different aminoacyl tRNA/RS plasmids had different characteristics. We could further confirm this assumption by performing growth experiments with E.coli that prior to the cultivation were transformed with our different aminoacyl tRNA/synthetases.  For this purpose, we transformed chosen aminoacyl tRNA/synthetases and two control vectors, pSB1C3 and pSB3T5 , into E. coli BL21 (DE3). We performed the cultivation in 1 mL LB-media with the matching non canonical amino acid (ncAA) in 12‑well microtiter plates by 600 rpm at 37 °C. We used two biological replicates, each with three technical replicates. The optical density of each cultivation was measured with NanoDrop at 600 nm. The comparison of the growth rates of each cultivation for the cells containing the aminoacyl tRNA/RS in high copy plasmid pSB1C3, as depicted in Figure 1, showed significant  differences between different the cultures. Additionally, the growth experiments show that the incorporation of ncAAs through the amber codon cause a major metabolic burden for the cells, resulting in a growth rate decreased by 0.25 and 0.5 %, as compared to control cultures. Only the Propargyllysine (PrK) ‑tRNA/synthetase showed growth of up to 17 % higher than the growth of the control cultures. This can be explained by the metabolic pressure, exerted by the pSB1C3, due to coding the mRFP. In addition, the highly specific incorporation of the ncAA by the PrK (Figure 3) also supports faster growth of the culture, containing the PrK aminoacyl tRNA/synthetase. This is due to the similarity of the used ncAA Prk-couple to the wild type amino acid pyrrolysyl, requiring only one point mutation of the aminoacyl synthetase (aaRS). This could be demonstrated with our CFP‑YFP system( BBa_K2201343 )for the efficiency of the incorporation of ncAA.

https://2016.igem.org/Team:Lanzhou/Collaboration
This year, team Lanzhou aimed to employ the gut flora to treat the mercury pollution inside fish body. To transform the gut flora, they planned to feed the fish with genetic engineered bacteria.
Above is the gene circuit they designed, INP (Ice Nucleation Protein) is an extrinsic membrane protein of E.coli and acts as an anchor. gfp acts as a reporter gene while metal catcher can bind heavy-metal ions.
We helped them designed and operated the pre-experiment to identify the maximum concentration of mercury ions which can keep the fish alive. From literature research, we chose the following concentration: 0.3mg/L, 0.2mg/L, 0.15mg/L, 0.1mg/L, 0.05mg/L, 0.025mg/L.
Then we raised 10 fishes and measured the number at the same time in fifteen days.
At last, we found that the concentration of mercury ions should be maintained at 0.1 milligrams per liter. When the concentration is higher than this value, the fish will die. When the concentration is lower than this value, the difference will not be obvious.
◎ Lanzhou for BIT-China
On September 18th, 2016, we met and exchanged ideas with members of teams from Lanzhou by the Beijing Institute of Technology. After the meeting, we confirmed our collaboration relationship. To further extend our system, we asked them for helping us constructing one of our gene circuits.
They constructed one of our testing circuits.

We constructed one pab operon consisting of the pabA and pabB/C gene from Lactococcus lactis to overexpress p-ABA. Therefore we used the biobrick parts BBa_K137055 and BBa_S04039 as a template to construct the wished composites.
In a second step the pab operon will be cloned downstream of the PL promoter with operator sites TetO1 and LacO1 . In case blue and red light is present, p-ABA will be produced as a blue and red light response.

Beyond the Lab Bench
Communicating our project and educating the public about synthetic biology have been keys in our outreach activities. We have talked to media, been in contact with the industry and made the BioBrick system available to 200 high schools nationwide

""Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work""
Peter Carr,
Director of Judging
Amazing projects can be conducted in the laboratory without anyone ever hearing about the possibilities the research brings. With this in mind, going beyond the lab bench was crucial to us.
Our human practices efforts had three aspects. We wanted to tell our community, fellow students and the students of the future about the field of synthetic biology and more specific the exciting project we were working on. This was done by inviting high school students to join our team, getting attention in nationwide newspaper and taking on all the opportunities we had to share our experiences. Secondly, we wanted to give high school students all over Denmark the opportunity to work with assembly of BioBricks. This Biosensor project reached over 200 high schools nationwide (The Biosensor) . At last, our project is very industry-based which made it very important for us to consult and spar with relevant industrial companies within our project framework (Integrated Practices)
High Schoolers Joining Our Team
""I could see a great potential of getting an amazing experience which would challenge and develop my skills within biotechnology.""
Rasmus Hildebrandt,
H.C. Ørsted High School
When receiving so much backup, enthusiasm and getting such a great opportunity as being a part of iGEM, the most important thing for us was to give something back. Therefore, we fetched reinforcements in the form of three amazing high school students during the summer. Our three students, Sigrid, Tobias and Rasmus helped us out in the lab and gained valuable skills which will be of great value for them in their future"

Week 3: 20 July 2009 - 26 July 2009
[ edit ] Wednesday
Received mail from Valencia: The vanillin Receptor is not usable, Madrid also tried to use and ran into all sorts of problems: Problems span from the binding of the periplasmic protein to the vanillin molecule, to the function of the fusion protein, to the activation of the ompR.
There are two solutions to this problem:
Construct a different vanillin receptor
Using virA/virG, a phenol receptor in agrobacterium .
Detect an alternative substance that has a linear relationship with the vanillin concentration
Vanillin inhibits the Ahl receptor
Synthesis of another signaling molecule that will be sensed
[ edit ] Friday
Possible receptor is the virA/virG system from Agrobacterium, the virA protein will bind to phenolic compounds and induce transcription of vir genes by phosphorylation of virG. Protein ChvE results in a broader response to phenolic compounds. Papers:

Contrary to that the read out plasmid with KanR has a special ori, named R6K, which can only amplify in E. coli strains that express the gene pir to produce the so called Pir protein. Most of the strains used in laboratory are pir- but few (e.g EC100D) are pir+ ( Bowers et al., 2007 ).
The setup of the different oris was chosen to separate both plamids at this experimental stage. To change the read out system from KanR to luciferase, one just needs to perform two transformations and isolations of plasmids. In the first step plasmids are isolated from colonies with positive binding properties to one of the tested substances. This mixture of plasmids with ColE1 and R6K oris is then transformed to a pir- strain (e.g. TOP10). In the following only the plasmid with ColE1 ori will be amplified during the growth of the transformants, leading to pure plasmids with virA when plasmids are isolated for a second time. In the last step this isolated DNA can be transformed to bacteria including another read out plasmid (e.g. with luciferase).

Designing the XY-Stage
In order for TERRA to select for specific locations to dispense fluids, we needed a method of either moving the output tube or the vessel, such as a 96-well plate. We ultimately decided to move the vessel, as that would minimize the length of and amount of unusable volume in the output tube. This XY-stage needed to have the following functions and features: the ability for translational motion; a homing system; a control system; a manufacturing method; material; and motors.
The following morphological chart illustrates our potential means of accomplishing each function or feature and the chosen options are written in green.

Translational Motion: We chose to use a system of timing belts and pulleys as it is more accurate and creates less backlash than threaded rods. The timing belts and pulleys are also more cost effective, as they are as accurate as higher-end threaded rods, which would be necessary for smooth translational motion. The pulleys are also easier to mount and integrate into the design of the XY-stage than threaded rods.
Homing: Our team chose to utilize contact switches in order to home our system as they were the easiest to integrate into the existing design of TERRA and were low-cost. We had briefly considered manual, user-controlled homing, but realized that it would result in a great amount of human error, as the user would need to approximate the distance from the nozzle to the well A1. Optical sensors and ultrasonic sensors would result in accurate locations, but would increase the cost of TERRA and would provide unnecessary feedback.
Control: We decided to use the Arduino Mega to control our XY-stage and syringe pumps, as the addition of Arduino shields allowed for more motors to be connected per microprocessor. Our team also considered the use of a Raspberry Pi, but it contained more functions than needed for our project with fewer ports.

1.2.3Discussion
According to result figure ,we can find that the chip has very good transparency for the fluorescence.We find that even for 3000 of the fluorescence, a clear capture is also possible.
Futher quantitative analysis by histogram:
Comparing A and B,we found that more diluted 3000 times,the standard deviation is reduced by 2.91
Compared with B and C, we found that more diluted 10000 times the standard deviation is reduced by 10.It proves that the material has little to do with its attenuation by it’s linear decay.These have proved that the transparency of our chip is very good.
2.Temperature control module
Introduction
The purpose of this experiment is to verify that the temperature control module can control the microfluidic chip expression chamber temperature constant at 37 ° C . Because we hope that engineering bacteria can work efficiently, we need to build a temperature control module to provide an optimum growth temperature for E. coli. The fluorescent protein used in the project was expressed by Escherichia coli, and we knew that the optimal growth temperature for E. coli was 37 ° C.
 
Method
We injected the microfluidic chip into the LB medium and placed it on a temperature control platform for heating. The temperature of the surface of the microfluidic chip was measured by infrared thermometer, and the curve of the surface"

Dr Roberts wants to meet with the students who wish to have access to his lab, sooner rather than later. It is important that Team Baltimore bring reagents over to the Roberts Lab and begin to use some of the space Dr Roberts has set aside for us, in order to demonstrate that we are serious about using his lab. Anyone who would like to work at the TU site sometimes should contact Dr Liz immediately.
There is a DNA sequencer and a high-throughput DNA seperator that is accurate to 1 bp for oligos between 100-650 bp long. If Team Baltimore wants to use this machine, that is possible. In that case Dr liz will talk to her Dean at TU to acquire funds to help share the cost of using it.

SpyTag (ST) in BBa_K2623021 (Figure 4a) is inserted to N-termini of OmpA, while ST in BBa_K2623023 (Figure 4c) is inserted to C-termini of OmpA. Our HSFCM data shows that BBa_K2623021 is more efficient to transport ST-OmpA-GFP to OMVs and might be a good candidate for the following study.

Demonstrate the OmpA-ST inside E. coli BL21 and OMVs
As our HSFCM data show, OmpA-ST-GFP (BBa_K2623021 and BBa_K2623023) transported to OMVs could be detected. In our total circuit, we would use non-GFP part (BBa_K2623022 and BBa_K2623024) to establish SpyTag/SpyCatcher (ST/SC) conjugation. For this purpose, we'd like to demonstrate the OmpA-ST (BBa_K2623022 and BBa_K2623024) inside both E. coli BL21 and OMVs, as well as SDS-PAGE used (Figure 5).
