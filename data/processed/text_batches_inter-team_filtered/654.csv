Cooper_Union,2014,Team:Cooper Union#Biohack project_-_-_TEXT.html," activate the promoter to kick-start the system. Then, depending on the promoter, over the next day or two the system will begin to express the reporter gene! Students will also have the ability to monitor the system  to see how the gene expression varies with time.
Results
Our composite part (BBa_K1354000) uses the sulA promoter (biobricked by UT-Tokyo in 2011 - BBa_K518010), and the delta activator from phiR73 phage (biobricked by Cambridge in 2007 - BBa_I746352). The phage activator turned on a phage promoter with a GFP reporter composite part,
BBa_I746321
. The two composite parts were in separate plasmids. When shocked with UV, the UV promoter was turned on, which activated the phage activator. This then turned the phage promoter on which activated the GFP reporter. The fluorescence readings are shown below.

Future Work
We built our system with restriction sites around the UV promoter and GFP reporter so that they can be cut out and replaced with other inputs and outputs easily. Going forward, we hope to create an entire kit, consisting of at least four more inputs and four more outputs. Any input or output can be used from the BioBrick registry, as long as primers are designed to incorporate the correct restriction enzyme sites.

Athlete Education
As a response to our debate in Stirling as well as to the athlete interviews, we identified the need for athlete education when it comes to gene doping. Therefore, we contacted the responsible doping authority to discuss the implementation of gene doping education for athletes. The Dutch Doping Authority however indicated that they don’t want to address it as a separate topic, but see it integrated with the current education material. In Scotland in the mean time, prof. Dimeo and Dr. Henning are continuing the implementation of specific gene doping education.
Hotline
Who knows better the issues of an iGEM team as one of the iGEM teams? This motivated us to set up a low threshold platform to help iGEM teams from all over the world. Several teams contacted us via our special e-mail hotline.tudelft.igem@gmail.com

Public Outreach
Train Debates
With selective social media messages, people tend to be informed only about their immediate interests. It can be enlightning to talk to people and engage in an open debate, especially on a topic not many people from the general public know about: synthetic biology! On June 26th we decided to bring the Biotechnology Day from Belgium to the Netherlands by engaging people in a debate on gene technology on trains!
“Gene technology is beautiful for medical purposes, but I oppose to its use for luxury purposes as sports.”
Train passenger
Our team split up in three teams that travelled throughout the country. For mutual learning and engagement it is important to have a public as diverse as possible, and where to find this better than on trains that travel throughout a whole country?
“Gene editing will only be available to the rich thereby widening the gap between rich and poor, which is a big concern to me.”
Train passenger
Not only did we inform and engage passengers, we also learnt from them about the general opinion on several aspects of our project through a survey. 75% indicated that there should be more public debates on developments in biotechnology in general to inform the public and reduce fear caused by ignorance. That was what we strived for with our outreach activities with which we on purpose tried to address the general public.
“With increasing manipulability we forget about the beauty of what is already there. We will diverge from our essential nature with consequences no one knows yet.”

The number of CFU was not countable because of cellular lawn. The percentage of cell growth on plates was calculated by taking the controls of the same bacteria growing without antibiotics as reference.

The number of CFU was not countable because of cellular lawn. The percentage of cell growth on plates was calculated by taking the controls of the same bacteria growing without antibiotics as reference. The ΔOD (600nm) was calculated by subtracting the initial OD (600nm) at Day 0 from the OD(600nm) of the considered day.
Unfortunately, results for tetracyclin on MB medium are not useful. Indeed, all our bacteria have grown. It can be because of a technical problem with the drug, or it can also be explained by the presence of some genes bringing a resistance to this drug in Pseudovibrio denitrificans (see section Genome assembly ). But the death of cells on M9 plates doesn't allow us to confirm this hypothesis, even if it can be explained by a conditional expression of these genes.
We can also see that Pseudovibrio denitrificans manage to grow on very high concentrations of ampicillin. By sequencing our bacteria, we found resistance gene to ampicillin too. This drug is so not really useful, except in a huge concentration.
On a brighter side, according to these results, we can select Pseudovibrio denitrificans transformed  with a PSB1C3 on a concentration of chloramphenicol adjusted to the ratio 1/1000 (cf: Table3).
To use other drugs, best ratio (Growth on antibiotic/Growth on medium only) allowed determining optimal concentrations to use on our different media (cf: Table4).
Table4: Concentrations which can be used for selection of Pseudovibrio denitrificans
Transformation Protocol
First, we tried to transform Pseudovibrio denitrificans by a heat shock. Chemically competent cells were prepared with CaCl2 solution. Transformation protocols were carried out by mixing 50 µL of cells with 1 µL of plasmid pSB1C3 solution (35ng/µL). After the standard heat shock protocol for E.coli, cells were spread on 1X MB medium plates."

Introduction
Synthetic biology is currently one of the most rapidly developing fields in science. Recent advancements, particularly in genetic engineering, allow us to tackle major societal challenges. Gene engineering is even being applied to humans, with the use of gene therapy. Gene therapy is an experimental technique that uses genes to treat or prevent among others severe genetic disorders.  However, major concerns are raised about the misuse of gene editing techniques, particularly for human enhancement . Gene doping,  the misuse of gene therapy to enhance athletes’ performances, is one example. To promote responsible use of synthetic biology and to help eliminate gene doping from sport, we developed a complete gene doping detection method: ADOPE, the Advanced Detection of Performance Enhancement (figure 1).
Figure 1. The fusion protein consisting of Tn5 transposase and dxCas9.
ADOPE is based on targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), reducing the amount of data generated with NGS and effectively identifying gene doping DNA. We accomplished this by creating an innovative fusion protein ( BBa_K2643000 ) used in rapid library preparation required for sequencing . Our fusion protein consists of a cleavage deficient nuclease specific dxCas9 and a Tn5 transposase. The dxCas9 part loaded with a single guide RNA (sgRNA) will interact with the specific target DNA sequence via complementary matching between sgRNA and target DNA. Whereas the Tn5 part will integrate two small DNA molecules (adapters) required for nanopore sequencing. Thus, the fusion protein is capable of performing dxCas9 guided adapter ligation for targeted sequencing library preparation, allowing us to identify gene doping in blood samples with our method ADOPE.

Industry Collaboration
During our initial planning of the project, we sought input from leaders in industry to better guide our efforts. Before we started our project, we wondered how potentially reducing the cost of antibodies could impact detection methods in industry and what kind of implications it could have on public health. We contacted the Battle Creek, Michigan branch of Covance Incorporated, an established pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation that provides testing services for the food and environmental industries. In addition, Covance provides custom antibody products for the research community.
Meeting with Christine Gwinn, a microbiology supervisor in the department of nutritional chemistry and food safety, we gleaned valuable information pertaining to our project’s direction.  In any application of antibodies for detection, Gwinn stressed the importance of specificity and time.  For industrial use, detection methods must be highly specific, as any cross reactions reporting false positives would prove highly costly, especially in the food industry.  Furthermore, detection services demand quick turn-around times for results, in order for this data to be delivered to clients on strict timetables.
Through this meeting with Covance, we were able to gauge the practicality of and modify our project to demonstrate the possible applications of our construct. She advised against an aspect of our project that aimed to improve current probiotic supplements with secretable antibodies. For instance, probiotic supplements could have implications in the cattle industry. E. coli is a naturally occurring bacterium in the intestinal microbiome of cattle, and probiotics are used extensively in the industry to promote good health in the cattle. By inoculating currently used probiotics with E. coli capable of secreting antibodies specific to antigens on the surface of Salmonella cells, we could effect agglutination and removal of harmful bacteria. However, Christine advised against this due to the required resources, length of project, and complications with animal testing. We were able to narrow the focus of our project by concentrating on producing overexpressed antibodies that could"

This definitely was very cool. However, brainstorming can still be hard. For example, for Semantic Search, we couldn’t really break through the loop. We kept on going in circles and circles and no one really could think of an idea that could solve our problem.
Overall, all this brainstorming is exhausting. I was tired at the end of the day. And tomorrow is an even larger brainstorming session. I hope that we can have some kind of product. That we will find a good idea to work with that will be baller for igem and that we will have a lot of fun with it. I know we can do it. Just gotta wait and see what our combined of brain power can come up with.
June 14: Brainstorm and more
Today, we spent a whole day brainstorming even more. Everyone was tired at the end of the day.
What was really cool about today was that in our research lab, we are also going to have a CS + Art project (MAS) going on. When this group is brainstorming, our instructor invited an Art Swells prof to come and give insights. And then when we were discussing about the idea of an eLabNotebook (an electronic smart lab notebook), the MIT prof who taught us synthetic bio engineering came too and gave her insights.
The fact that we were able to work with so many diciplines across the field was really amazing. But what I really learned today was the fact that people from different subject areas really do view objects/ events differently. Though we may only be undergraduate students, a CS major student vs a Bio major student already have some perceptible perspective differences. Interesting, huh?
June 15: BioEthics
I went to a (Bio) Ethics talk and it was very interesting actually. We went through several topics- plagarism, self-plagarism, etc. and some case studies as well. For example, I learned about self plagarism. Apparently, when you publish articles, though you might’ve written them, these article ultimately belongs to the journal. Thus, in order to use an article that you wrote, you would still have to cite it (unless you got the Journal’s permission/ copyright). Interesting, huh?
I learned that in biology, notebooks are the most important things you could ever keep. It’s your work and it doesn’t leave the lab report. As we work with our eLabNotebook project at Wellesley, this made me reflect on some of the things"

☑ Integrated Human practices
More than engagement, we integrated supporting research in our human practice. To know common pesticide contamination and public biosecurity awareness, we sent three kinds of customized questionnaires to different people. The questionnaires made us know the TCP， which is harmful. Subsequently, we learned about the presence of a large number of TCP by detecting soil from soil survey. We know that we cannot solve the problems well which related to human development only by research. With the help of experts’ power, we can make it more professional and more in-depth. Therefore, we have built a ‘Global League of Professors’ to guide our projects. So we contacted with experts from several countries and universities all over the world about plants or environment by emails, videos and face to face interview, More importantly, our project has been widely concerned in the academic community with the help of their contacts and resources.

Overview
First of all, we evaluated the possible impact of our work in practical production by visiting one of the most notable synthetic biology companies in china, Bluepha. According to their suggestions, we accomplished our project design. We                     then visited three experts, respectively majoring in biochemistry, microbiology and phycology, creating an interdisciplinary communication environment. Based on their feedback, we successfully designed a series of educational lectures                     about synthetic biology for high school students. Furthermore, we successfully collaborated with OUC, UCAS, UESTC and took an active part the CCiC conference. To intuitively demonstrate the core idea of synthetic biology and inspire                     people to participate in gene-designing process, we deigned the first electronic-display system of synthetic biology, e-SAM©, and we hope this device can facilitate future iGEM teams to promote their ideas to public.

The problem of degradation always lies in industrial production, whereas the abuse of antibiotics has lead to the emerge of antibiotic-resistant superbugs. It's the researchers' responsibility to deal with this safety issues raised by                     the interaction between the application and the human society. Our iGEM project aims at the application of self-screening advantageous mutant selection, which can provide a growth dominance to the strains with beneficial mutation.                     As a result, we conducted an biosafety-investigation about the medical application of antibiotics in FuXing Hospital, Capital University. Besides, we participated in a series of academic conferences, during which we exchanged our ideas                     with other participants and sought out for chances of collaboration.

Anaerobic cultivation of Escherichia coli
Anaerobic cultivation of Escherichia coli
Hole anaerobic work takes place in a two-hand Glove Bag .
All media and buffer has to be degased  with nitrogen (N2) gas via a sparger befor starting cultivation.
Grow preculture under aerobic condition at 37°C.
Cells were cultivated in a gas-tight 15 ml tube additional sealed with parafilm.
Cultivation volume is about 10 mL. Fill cultivation tube with 8.5 ml steril degased cultivation medium.
When preculture reaches OD600 of 0.6-0.8, take 1.5 ml into a steril tube.
Centrifugate 1 min at 5,000 rpm and discard complete supernatant.
resuspend pellet in 1.5 ml steril degased PBS buffer .
Repeat previous step but resuspend in steril, degased cultivation medium. This two steps avoid residual oxygen in the inoculum.
Inoculate culture with 1.5 ml washed and resuspended cells at OD600 of 0.1.
Tubes are filled and opened for sampling only under nitrogen atmosphere.
Tubes are incubated in a shaker at 37°C.
At the beginning of anaerobic cultivation residual oxygen from preculture would be consumed. Therefore faster growth could be observed in the first period of cultivation until cells shift to anaerobic metabolism.
There should be more frequent sampling at the beginning about 4 to 6-hour intervalls (two times) after inoculation.
Regular sampling takes place at 1-day intervalls.
Sampling volume is about 1 mL, using 500"

Uppsala,2017,Team:Uppsala#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," the kind of considerations needed at the beginning of and through an ethnographic study differ from the considerations due in a study involving animal research. However, some ethical requirements are common to all research fields. I can try to pinpoint some of them. First of all, the research must be valuable for society, i.e., it has to be reasonably expected to bring about some kind of improvement (directly or by increasing knowledge, even if such knowledge does not have immediate practical consequences). Thus, the very first question a researcher should ask herself is: ‘is this research needed?’. If the answer is yes, the it is a matter of how to perform it. To be valuable, a research need to be scientifically accurate. Therefore, a methodologically rigorous design, the involvement of competent parties, honest scientific conduct and ‘acceptance’ of results (even if negative) are required. Doing otherwise can lead to the production of wrong and/or unreliable results and, ultimately, to a waste of resources. There should also be a favourable risk-benefit ratio. For instance, in the case of research involving human beings or animals this means that what the subjects are subjected to, should somehow be compensated by the expected gain for themselves and/or the society. ·
How do you best lead an ethic discussion during a project that is controversial?
Unfortunately, I’m not aware of any ethical discussion technique which is considered to be the best. However, I think that it is worth highlighting at least one requirement that should be fulfilled in order to have an ethical discussion. While we all have thoughts and opinions, the capacity to successfully express one’s own viewpoints on ethical matters is not possessed by everybody. Saying ‘this is my opinion’ may not suffice. Students (and not only them) need training in ethics so to be able to appreciate the ethical issues involved in a project and to learn to discuss through tenable arguments.
What do you think is important to think about while doing an iGEM project?
I think that the ethical requirements suggested for when starting up/working on a project can provide a good framework to think about an iGEM project as well. I would like to focus on the requirement of the favourable risk-benefit ratio. In iGEM projects, there are no humans or animals involved. Only microorganisms. As you rightly pointed out in the booklet, researchers must think ahead and ‘be able to produce a thought-through statement about the future usage of the product’. The reason is that the potential risks involved may be particularly hard to foresee (e.g., interactions in the environment) and be linked to misuse and dual use practices in connection with the"

It is frequently found in water sources that are contaminated with human faeces, and is a major cause of illness in developing countries. The symptoms are very similar to those of cholera, and fatalities are caused in much the same way.
Shigellosis infects around 163 million people worldwide and causes 1 million deaths annually.
Surprisingly, both of these bacterial infections are actually fairly easily fought off by the human immune system. The problem for people in developing countries? They can only be successfully fought off if the affected individual is properly hydrated.
We created two modular synthetic devices called S.O.R.D and spiRNA, that work together to target these infections. You can read all about them here

In order to see if our cells were secreting osmY (a protein naturally secreted by E. Coli) and so our sRNA, we needed a way to track it. To do this, we added a HA tag to a pre-existing part in the registry from the Washington 2012 team, BBa_K892008 , to be able to detect in western blot tests whether our cells were secreting osmY."

Why we deserve the Silver Medal
The Human Practices are an integral and fundamental part of our project. It was mandatory for us to question what we were doing outside from laboratory manipulations and all the consequences of our commitment. We have so thought important issues related to very different questions such as Ethics, Safety, or the place of women in nowadays science.
WOMEN IN SCIENCE
This year, chance has brought together 8 girls and only girls to create the 2016         IGEM Toulouse team. This peculiar and quite funny situation has somehow triggered our thinking         about the actual position of women in Science, specially taking into account that our principal         supervisors are only men…
Results of a vast survey on the role of women in scientific research conducted by the Boston Consulting Group were published in March 2014 in the European Union, show that only 11% of the highest academic posts are occupied by women in science subjects. The percentage of women heads of scientific institutions varies from one country to another: only 6% in Japan, 27% in the US, 29% in France or 34% in Spain. Clearly, women are underrepresented in scientific professions.
Nevertheless, these percentages are slowly increasing, mainly because women are fighting for to reach the goal that the parity would be respected in all levels of society. Regarding specifically the scientific area, many women have raised the flag of parity such as Caroline Herschel, the first woman recognized as scientist but also the first one to publish a scientific paper in 1786 about the discovery of a comet, or such as Marie Curie who obtained two Nobel prizes in physics and chemistry. However, efforts are still needed for a much fair treatment of women in order to grant full equality in all countries around the world.

Thus today, what is happening is that only 8 young women are involved in the iGEM adventure in Toulouse. Actually the selection to be part"

This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

Medway Research Festival
On Wednesday the 10th of September our iGEM team attended the 2nd annual Medway research festival. This event was hosted on the Medway campus; this is a university space that is occupied by three universities, the University of Kent, University of Greenwich and Canterbury Christ Church University. The event now in its second year, is an opportunity for staff, postgraduate students and people from industry to meet each other in a informal setting to present posters, stalls and demonstrations relating to each of their respective research topics. At the festival, we had our own table, were we put up the poster that we took to YSB 2.0 describing the aims, goals and background of our project. Throughout the day we took the opportunity to speak to people within the scientific field, getting them to take part in our questionnaire and impact of our project on society activity.  This activity involved the individual first being informed of the project, from the scale at which we were working, to the bigger and idea of the project.  We then asked them to write on a post-it note the best possible outcome of our project, the worst possible outcome of our project and then what communication problems if any they had in getting their research through to the public and politicians. As the day went on we gained valuable insight into the opinions of our projects from scientists and academics, things we had not considered ourselves. The results of the surveys and the activities can be found in our human practices pages.  Throughout the day we also took the opportunity to view posters and talks from the others at the event.  Overall the day not only gave us valuable feedback on our project but we were able to gain an insight into real academic study.
Sheffield
The Sheffield iGEM team held a UK iGEM meet up at Sheffield university.  It gave iGEM teams from across the UK a chance to meet together and talk about each other's projects and give feedback on what they thought.  Each team had to prepare and present a 2 minute presentation about their project and provide a poster for a poster session in the afternoon.   The meet up was a great way to interact with other teams and get a chance to see their work.

Gold Medal Discussion:
Integrate findings of Human Practices investigation into design and execution of project:
Taking advantage of a medical summer elective at UCC, we decided as part of our project to send one of our members to an African hospital in Malawi. Donnchadh spent the month of June there investigating the usefulness and potential application of our detection system. While he was there he took this opportunity to explain the scientific concepts of synthetic biology and of our Basehunter System to the medical and laboratory staff. He spoke to the local people and at schools about the upcoming field of synthetic biology and our aims    with the iGEM project. He also spoke to a witchdoctor about modern science and the medicine it is capable of producing using synthetic biology.
While Donnchadh was in Malawi, he identified a potential application for our novel DNA detection system. He discovered through interviewing the laboratory staff at Nhkoma, spending time on the hospital wards and from our survey that there is a need for more rapid testing of certain    diseases which can be done cheaply and simply. He found that running machinery in"

Overview
For our lab experiences, we’ve encountered an enormous number of failures which brought us up to the point we are                  now at; having an extreme feeling of joy, content and tiredness.
Summary of Achievements in our experiments
We have successfully cloned 5 of our parts to pSB1C3 backbone in order to submit to the registry; and 3 of them to pSB1A3 backbone for our biochemical assays.
We have confirmed that our parts were correctly inserted by means of PCR.
We’ve conducted biochemical assays in which we verified our hypothesis and proved the improving effects of our genes.
Abbreviations:
NC: Negative Control
Comp.: Composite
Clonings:
In our project, our aim was to increase the tolerance and resistance of KO11, ethanologenic strain of E.coli, to byproducts and inhibitors that occur before bioethanol production,                  specifically during the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass. In order to achieve that, we focused on FucO and GSH as our targets.
We’ve designed 5 parts, 2 of which are basic and 3 are composite.
One of our basic parts included only FucO and the other only GSH as the protein coding region. On the other hand, our composite parts were designed to include                  GSH and FucO separately and simultaneously.
As a part of our lab journey, we’ve done 8 clonings in total. 5 of them were to be submitted in the registry and 3 of them were used for our biochemical assays.
In order to be able to submit our parts to the registry, we inserted all of our parts to pSB1C3 backbone and cloned them to DH5α.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#html5_-_-_TEXT.html,"UB. A general algorithm for all 6 type part is designed and we will illustrate this via an example. Consider a ST block with all ANY type parts (we use X to indicate ANY type part in the figures). We find matchings of the first part of the block. There may be many possible matchings because part of type ANY implies arbitrary matching of parts on one chain in MoDeL definitions. For each matching found, we deal with the next, and do the same thing recursively until the end of the template or matching fails. An easy example is shown in the figure to illustrate this simple idea.
After all possible matchings for each chain in the template have been found, we could choose any one from each to form a combination. Matching alternatives of two different chains in the template should not be the same. For example, there are two chains in the template, T1 and T2, and three chains, C1, C2 and C3 in the species. If T1 has one matching to C1 and one to C2 and T2 has one to C2 and one to C3, the possible matchings are (T1,T2)->(C1, C2), (T1,T2)->(C1,C3) and (T1,T2)->(T2,T3). (T1,T2)->(C2,C2) is not allowed. (这里已修改)This is based on the assumption that the writer of template is always sure about the structure, he won't write a two-chain template if the parts are actually on one chain. The general matching relations could be written as (n1,n2,n3...)->(m1,m2,m3...), where (n1,n2,n3...) represents chains in the template and (m1,m2,m3...) represents the chains matched in the species for (n1,n2,n3...) respectively. However, it is only  part of the matching relation because details, such as the matching positions of parts in the template, are ignored.  The next question is: how to validate each matching?
As defined in Chain-Node model, details of distribution of binding are stored in the forest. Matching of chains could not solely determine the overall match -- whether the template and the species have the same structural pattern. However, it is not easy to compare tree structure directly. We designed an algorithm to do this based on the principle: If the template and species have the same structural pattern, it must be possible to isolate the template from the species after replacing the ST part with its matchings"

In iGEM, the only one you're competing with is yourself.
Fudan_China
The relationship between Fudan_China and Fudan has always been intimate since the setting up, December 2016. All-round in-depth communication among teammates of two teams were frequent, and fully engaged to share resources and promote respective projects. Besides, Fudan_China lent enzymes to us and helped to develop our software. We shared our methods and equipments to them.
NYU-Shanghai
We provided iGEMers of NYU-Shanghai with equipments and lab space to conduct Interlab study. Since we finished the Interlab work earlier, we shared our experience, so their work progressed smoothly and efficiently. Beside, we showed them around the laboratories of School of Life Sciences, Fudan University for further cooperation.

Switzerland signed the Cartagena Protocol for Biosafety in 2000, and it was first enforced in 2005. For more information on the Swiss role in the Cartagena protocol, click here .
Interview with Dr. Stéphane Karlen, Biosafety Coordinator at the EPFL
Is there a Biosafety Committee at the EPFL and if so, how does it work, say, in the case a new laboratory opens?
There is a biosafety coordinator for the whole EPFL campus. The coordinator, who happens to be me, oversees a new domain at the EPFL, similar to the DIT for technological infrastructure, called the DSPS which is short for Domaine Sécurité, Prévention, et Santé. This domain was added last month to the EPFL governing structure and has networks in each group. The Biosafety Officer in this case plays two important roles for the DSPS: he or she does the work of the biosafety coordinator and also manages security.
Going back to your question about the protocol for new labs, I should mention that there are some new rules on how this works. First, there is a list of legal obligations which requires, among other things, that all lab directors or principal investigators announce any work involving genetically-modified organisms (GMO) or infections. Second, on top of EPFL's own investigations of lab work, the Fonds National -- Switzerland's main scientific funding agency -- does not release funding money until these notifications about GMOs and infections are made. Finally, the EPFL Biosafety group visits all the labs that are at a level 2 of risk or higher and checks in regularly on their safety measures.
Is there any biosafety training available at the EPFL and is it a requirement for working in a lab?
There is a monthly biosafety course that brings out a good number of bachelors, masters, and doctoral students. However, it has not been made a mandatory requirement for working in a lab. That being said, we divide all the labs at the EPFL into four categories of risk. Level 1 represents the lowest level of risk, meaning that no healthy average human can be harmed in this lab and only a very specific set of individuals with special conditions can be injured (a specific allergy for example). And then there's Level 4 that represents an extremely high level of risk (working on the Ebola virus for example). The EPFL mostly has level 1 and level 2 labs. Anything involving normal E. coli is a level 1 biosafety risk. To give you some idea, you run the"

Edinburgh,2015,Team:Edinburgh#Practices#Morality#Essay_-_-_TEXT.html," those who use drugs problematically, (3) those who use drugs recreationally and (4) those who do not use drugs but have no strong feelings related to their use. Granting the premise that drug use, as a whole, is detrimental to society’s well-being, and given that the function of our biosensor is to provide an additional amount knowledge the user would not have otherwise (i.e. whether his drugs are contaminated), the question now becomes whether this additional knowledge is enough to realistically spur individuals in one of these four groups to use drugs more frequently.
Our device will probably not have an impact on the first group because these individuals harbour strong convictions against drug use, and these convictions are unlikely due to a lack of knowledge concerning the purity of drugs.The second could certainly be affected by our biosensor, but in a positive way. Indeed, problematic drug users will either not bother with our biosensor because discovering that their drugs are contaminated will make little difference in the final decision of whether to use, or they will use the biosensor, indicating that they have reached a unique stage in terms of recovery - viz. they are not ready to abstain from drug use altogether, but desire to minimise the associated risks.
Unlike the first two groups, the third and fourth groups could use drugs more frequently as a result of the implementation of the biosensor. In the case of recreational drug users, there is no prohibitive barrier - e.g., moral opposition, ingrained societal prejudice, first-hand negative experience, etc. -  in place that is enough to deter them from drug use, like there is for the first group. This is similarly true for the fourth group, because, despite not using drugs, they have no strong opposition to their use. For both of these groups, then, the fact that there is an additional measure of safety provided by our biosensor means that it is plausible that some may engage in drug use more frequently.
Still, an important question remains: can Edinburgh’s biosensor be used legally in countries that do not have drug consumption rooms? The answer is certainly yes. Take the United Kingdom as an example. Perhaps the most similar harm reduction measure to consumption rooms currently implemented in the UK are needle exchanges, where medical staff distribute clean injecting equipment to users. However, unlike consumption rooms, users are neither allowed to use or possess drugs while in needle exchanges, as it is a breach of NHS policy. Yet this does not eliminate the possibility that they could be distributed in a similar fashion as needles and be used at an individual's discretion in the privacy of his/her home.

Different synthetic pathway of colors and flavors 
1. Dyes (red pink orange yellow)
Red pigment : lycopene
Lycopene is a red compound of the terpene family from Farnesyl phyrophosphate (a substrate present into L.bulgaricus).
Terpen pathway : to get red
Three enzymes are required to get lycopene : crtE, crtB and crtI. Those enzymes already exist in biobricks (Edinburgh 2007-2008): BBa_K118002 and BBa_K118003. Our goal was to reuse these biobricks, make them express in E.coli, and then transform L.bulgaricus with a constitutive promotor of lactic bacteria. To construct the biobricks, the coding sequence dxs of E.coli JM109 have been added to increase yields of carotenoids. The biobrick from Edinburgh 2008 have been reused: BBa_K118004 :  rbs + dxs
Four new biobricks have been designed :
BBa_K1148000 : crtE under hlbA promoter (phlbA)
BBa_K1148001 : crtB under hlbA promoter (phlbA)
BBa_K1148002 : crtI under hlbA promoter (phlbA)
BBa_K1148003 : crtE + crtB + crtI under hlbA promoter (phlbA)
Orange and yellow pigments
Orange and yellow colors can be acquired from lycopene with two more enzymes.
Terpen pathway : to get orange and yellow
Two new biobricks have then been designed:
BBa_K1148004 : crtY under hlbA promoter (phlbA)
BBa_K1148005 : crtZ under hlbA promoter (phlbA)
2. Purple, Dark green and Light green
Three new biobricks have been designed, based on existing biobricks (BBa_K274002 (purple), BBa_K274003 (dark and light green)).
BBa_K1148006 : VioA-E under hlbA promoter (phlbA)

Ethics and technique in iGEM
This philosophical essay intends to think about iGEM as a human practice. Indeed it seemed important for the team to better understand its practice. Bioethics is not all about safety, it is also about knowing what we do. Thus, elaborating a team reflection on synthetic biology was an interesting experience of embedded philosophical research and dialogue. In order to enable the reader to get a feel of our debates, we chose to show the team reactions towards philosophical points of view (that are not necessarily those of the writer).
From this collective reflection emerges progressively the certainty that, despite we are only establishing proofs of concept, the best interest of the patients should be our absolute priority. Of course, our project will not enter in a clinical testing phase anytime soon, and it will not have any clinical result, but patients must already be appropriately integrated in it. Competition or not, they remain the only ethically valid end.
Introduction. Synthetic Biology: Science or Technique?
It is obvious that iGEM is about synthetic biology but is it a scientific competition or a technical one? Many members of the team replied simply that iGEM is all about applied science. Though the pertinence of this definition, the difference between science and technique matters to philosophy, because philosophy does not consider science and technique in the same way throughout its history. iGEM requires philosophy to contribute to the reflection on human practice, thus in return philosophy must ask iGEM “what kind of human practice are you”?
Science seeks knowledge and is globally positive throughout philosophy. On the contrary the aim-oriented use"

To ensure enough protein for further experiments, the second best fraction, which is fraction 5 % 3 was added to fraction 50 % 1. The first number indicates the percentage of used elution buffer, whereas the second number stands for the fraction number of this elution. In total, both fraction contain 4,4 µg mL-1 .
Figure 7: Activity assay of each purified fraction of the new cultivation with TTHL. Samples were re-buffered into H2O and the protein amount in each fraction has been adjusted. The measurements were done using the standard activity assay protocol over night. The first number indicates the percentage of used elution buffer, whereas the second number stands for the fraction number of this elution.
Since Regionals: TTHL activity depending on different ABTS concentrations
In order to find the substrate saturation, laccase activity was measured with ABTS concentrations ranging from 0.1 mM to 8 mM. 616 ng TTHL laccase were used for measurements with ABTS concentrations of 0.1 mM to 5 mM, 308 ng TTHL laccase were used for measurements with ABTS concentrations of 5 mM to 8 mM. Measurements were done in Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 5) at 25 °C for 30 minutes taking the OD420 every 5 minutes. Comparing the graphs in Figure 8 and Figure 9, the substrate saturation is not reached with 5 mM ABTS. An application of 8 mM shows less oxidized ABTS as measurements with 7 mM ABTS. Further experiments were done with 7 mM ABTS.
Figure 8: Activity assay to determine the substrate saturation with ABTS as a substrate. Measurements were done with 616 ng TTHL laccase in Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 5) at 25 °C. ABTS concentrations ranged from 0.1 mM to 5 mM.

Multipurpose plasmid construction
In this section, the synthesis of a BioBrick encoding for Cas13a is explained. Firstly, the sequence for LwCas13a was extracted from Gootenberg et al. 2017 . This DNA construct (7.7 kb), was ordered in three separate parts, denoted part 1 (2.5 kb), part 2 (1.6 kb) and part 3 (0.3 kb). See Figure 1 for an overview of how the assembled plasmid should look like (see the Cas13a notebook for the entire process of assembling this plasmid). After Gibson Assembly (GA), a PCR was run on the resulting GA mixture and the product was loaded on a gel. This showed that part 2 and part 3 were successfully assembled.
Figure 1: Schematic overview of our multipurpose Cas13a construct. The insert was delivered in three parts: part 1 (green), part 2 (blue) and part 3 (red). The backbone ( pSB4A5 ) is depicted in yellow.
This part was PCR-amplified from the GA mix (see Figure 2). Subsequently, another Gibson Assembly was done with part 1, the ligated part 2 and part 3 and the backbone ( pSB4A5 ). We transformed the GA mixture several times unsuccessfully (see the Cas13a notebook ). When amplifying the ligation mixture we obtained a band corresponding to the size of 7.7 kb, which indicated the presence of the fully assembled plasmid (Figure 3), at least in linear form. The plasmid was linearly amplified by PCR and blunt-end ligation was performed. The ligation was then transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells. Colonies of this transformation were screened with colony PCR which gave a positive result for colony 1 (Figure 4). Plasmid DNA from colony 1 was purified and sent for sequencing, see Figure 5 for the results.

But remember, the sky is the limit! iGEM teams could use metagenomics and public databases to develop great chassis for specific challenges. Developing tools for new organisms is challenging, but the reward could be the virtual elimination of pathogenic species. Good, isn’t it?
In our experimental part, we used for the first time the organism Pantoea agglomerans in iGEM, as an example of interesting chassis. Check it out here.

XMU-China,2018,Team:XMU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Dr. Tang also told us those frequently-used and classical clinical detection methods, like ELISA, CLIA and so on. Most of which are time-consuming, expensive and complex, compared with Fang. As for Fang, Dr. Tang agreed with our proposals that we are going to make Fang widely used among basic medical institutions, especially in remote, and poverty-stricken areas because of its convenient and practicability. But it's worth noting that today there is an authoritative method for disease-diagnose, i.e., pathological diagnosis. So our detection method would just serve as a kind of screening tool rather than diagnosis method, according to Tang's suggestion.
The professor affirmed the feasibility of our project and gave us some invaluable advice. Under the suggestion of Prof. Zhi Zhu, we chose EpCAM and aptamer SYL3C. In addition, we are very grateful to Prof. Zhu for her support on many instruments and materials provided during our experiments.
Visiting Prof. Zengfu Xue
We visited Prof. Zengfu Xue, deputy director of the Cancer Early Screening Diagnosis and Treatment Center, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University. We exchanged and discussed with Prof. Xue about the design of cell free detection system of tumor markers and detection carrier of microfluidic chip. Prof. Xue fully affirmed the innovation and feasibility of this project, and appreciated the original intention of the team to solve the problem of difficult access to medical services in large hospitals, which helped to improve the current ""hierarchical diagnosis and treatment"" policy system to some extent. We communicated with Prof. Xue about the next clinical trial plan of the detection hardware Fang, and reached a preliminary cooperation agreement. If possible, we could take the instrument to the lab in hospital, and use the patient's blood sample to verify the performance of the instrument, such as stability and sensitivity.
Visiting a grass-roots Health Service Center
We visited Health Service Center of Datong Street, Tong'an District, Xiamen city. We learned about the development of tumor markers detection work in primary hospitals from director Zhan. We found that primary hospitals were mostly able to carry out screening of basic tumor markers such as alpha fetoprotein. If people want to carry out more systematic and specific tumor screening, they had to be referred to higher-level hospitals. In addition, due to the implementation effect of China's medical security system and Xiamen's health policy, the screening of tumor markers at the grassroots-level health center could save about 50% of the cost compared with the large hospitals. Therefore, to sum up, president Zhan"

However we were unsuccessful in loading the two prepared plasmids into the gel in our electrophoresis attempt. When inserted into the wells the DNA immediately floated and dispersed within the running buffer of the gel electrophoresis apparatus.
The reason for this anomalous result was that the samples still contained a high concentration of ethanol, which should have been completely washed away prior to loading into the wells. Washing solution 2 contained ethanol as an ingredient. After analysis of the situation, a few conclusions were drawn:
For the washing process 15ml falcon tubes should have been used instead of 50ml falcon tubes.
The centrifugation step should have been allowed to run for longer to ensure all of the wash solution had passed through the buffer column.
However all was not lost; the plasmid DNA was still there and in usable form. The challenge was how we could extract it successfully.
The answer to our problem is ethanol precipitation. By precipitating the ethanol from our DNA sample, we could then process the plasmid DNA and run on the gel as usual.
In the meantime we also need to grow up cultures containing the plasmid backbone pMUTIN4, which will allow us in the near future to transfer our chosen BioBricks from the E.coli cells we are working with into Bacillus subtilis.
Another task which we have to complete is to prepare the BioBricks which are needed for our system and are found in the Spring Distributions.
Practical Outline
Three of our prepared BioBricks being kept on ice
Precipitate the ethanol from our DNA plasmids (containing the RFP and GFP genes) and analyse them through DNA gel electrophoresis.
Grow up some DH5alpha E.coli cells containing the pMUTIN4 plasmid vector
Hydrate and prepare BioBricks present in Spring Distributions.
Ethanol Precipitation
We used the ethanol precipitation protocol and carried out these steps:
Added 0.2ml of sodium acetate (a tenth of the volume of DNA) to 2mls of DNA from both GFP and RFP samples.
To these mixtures, 6.6ml of 100% ethanol was added.
The 8.8ml of GFP DNA + sodium acetate + ethanol solution was then divided into 8 Eppendorf tubes – each Eppendorf tube containing 1ml of solution.

Overview
Welcome to BioHub! This is an open and fantastic platform with practical functions for synthetic biologists. For scientists whose goal is to make discoveries in biology, steps using bioinformatics can be seen as the most basic but rather troublesome part. To solve this, our team created BioHub.
BioHub is a platform with several plug-ins, which means that users can not only employ the functions we provide, but also develop new and useful ones which can meet their special needs, without caring for servers and network transmission. Others include Pathway finder, which means find the correlation among genes, Pano, meaning designing genetic circuits like an artist, Simulation, which can imitate real experimental circumstances, and other splendid functions.
Module:Pano
Pano is a visualized editing interface which is designed to arrange the relationships between genes. It can be used to find pathways between genes and simulate related substances according to controlling ODEs.
The relationships of genes are represented by graphs, which include nodes and edges. Each node represents a gene while each edge represents a relationship. Users shall build up a graph in order to input relationships network between genes. Users will be capable to process the network further such as operating a simulation and so on.
Module:Pathway finder
Pathway finder is one of the most powerful plugins of BioHub. In traditional circumstances, searching for the relationships among components in the genetic circuit can be rather arduous, so users must read plenty of papers and inquire several databases. To rescue biologists from this, Pathway finder is born now. Select any two components in genetic circuit, and by searching the database of gene routes in the server we can rapidly know whether they have strong relationship, and whether the feature is of interest. It combines metabolic network databases, cell signaling pathway databases and gene interaction databases, and the path between components means produce, combine, influence activation, promote degradation or others.
Pathway finder is a module integrated in the Pano to provide more convenient and faster ways to find paths from a specific source node to another target node, select appropriate paths, and add them to the Pano. Biologic scientific workers using the Pathway finder"

EcNR2∆HisB∆PyrF∆rpoZ+kan-ZFB-wp-his3-ura3 + (zif268+GFP) spec plasmid (selection strain with the matching ZFB and ZFP, should fluoresce)(columns 4, 8, 12)
We will take one fluorescence reading before placing it in the plate reader, and one after we finish it.
In addition to the plate reader, we are curious to see how IPTG affects fluorescence levels. We made LB+spec plates with 0, 6.25uM, 25uM, and 100uM concentrations of IPTG
Each plate was spread with 1uL of EcNR2∆HisB∆PyrF∆rpoZ+kan-ZFB-wp-his3-ura3 + (zif268+GFP) and left overnight at 30C
Tomorrow we can compare fluorescence levels between the different IPTG concentrations.

We ran the ligation products through a min-elute column, eluting in 10 ul of water, with the following yields:
Cut: 22.4 ng/ul
Phosphotased: 24.2 ng/ul
2 to 1: 25 ng/ul
3 to 1: 25.9 ng/ul
5 to 1: 20.1 ng/ul
8 to 1: 20.9 ng/ul
Later we ran a transformation, using the turbo competent cells protocol. We used 100 ng of ligation product for the transformation:

phosphotased: 4.13 ul
2 to 1: 4 ul
3 to 1: 3.86 ul
5 to 1: 4.98 ul
8 to 1: 4.78 ul
We then plated 1 ul and 10 ul of cells on spec plates, and let them incubate at 37* for 12 hours. Only 10 ul plates were made for the controls. We took the rest of the transformed cells (excluding the controls) and let them incubate for 12 hours on the shaker at 37* in 20 mL LB"

      Our team has always                                         focused on solving the existing issue seen in the society, and we value our                                         connection with the vast public as well as the society. According to our shared                                         daily experience, nowadays many people have trouble with sleeping, one of the most                                         important and dominant, yet mysterious activity in our life. For the youth,                                         social                                         pressure brought by both work and family may lead to irregular sleeping time or                                         even                                         sleeping disorder, while many elders also suffer from difficulty in falling                                         asleep                                         or awakening easily – problems involving sleeping has become more and more                                         common.
      However, in order to determine more                                         precisely                                         the current sleeping conditions of the                                         public and to evaluate more objectively about the people’s knowledge on                                         melatonin –                                         the core of our project, surveys are to be made. Though there are surveys on                                         people’s sleeping quality made by CDC 1, The Sleep Council of the UK 2 and China                                         Sleep Research Association 3 etc., the data are always too generalized and from                                         a                                         few years ago; more importantly, there’s no existing research on the public’s                                         awareness and acceptance of melatonin.
      Therefore, our main focus in this survey is                                         to                                         answer 1) how is people’s sleeping                                         quality, 2) what are the common problems that stalls people from sleeping. For the                                         special groups that will go for night shifts, we also seek to know 3) frequency                                         of                                         their night shifts and the effect of night shifts on their sleep. To access the                                         practicality of our project, we also investigated 4) how people regulate their                                         sleep                                         and the acceptance, usage of sleeping pills and 5) how are the understanding and                                         acceptance of melatonin of both groups who have regular schedules and who have                                         night                                         shifts.

Suspension of Cells in Lysis Buffer
The flask is removed from the shaking incubator and the contents are divided into two 500mL containers. The containers are weighed and a few drops of water is added to the lighter one to ensure proper counterbalance in the centrifuge. The two containers are centrifuged at 5,000g at 4 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes. The supernatant is decanted and the cell pellets are weighed, and then suspended in 1X Lysis Buffer in a 1 to 3 weight of cell pellet to volume of buffer, respectively, ratio.
Weight of Empty 500mL container: 80.56g
Weight of 1st 500mL container with Cell Pellet: 84.06g
Weight of 2nd 500mL container with Cell Pellet: 84.55g
Weight of 1st Cell Pellet: 84.06g-80.56g = 3.5 g
Weight of 2nd Cell Pellet: 84.55g-80.56g = 3.99g, round to 4 g

Ivy life's Science Alive!
Following up on our desire to help those in our community we have made an effort to be involved in local events. Our most recent effort was time that our team took to help with the Saint Joseph County Public Library's ""Science Alive."" This is an event to help get younger students all over the city more interested and more excited about science!
Our team cares!
Our team cares about creating a biosensor for everyone in the country and everyone around the world. But the initial inspiration came from local reservoirs. We are located in the nothernmost part of Indiana. A stone's throw away from one of the Great Lakes, Lake Michigan.
We noticed that that it is often closed due to inclement weather, however there was no way to warn visitors against the harmful bacteria and viruses that can be present. We wanted to help our community by providing them with the security that they're families are informed and aware of what they can see and what they can't.

今年，我们和iGEM的新队伍ECUST iGEM队建立了密切的合作关系。
SJTU-BioX-Shanghai作为一支更有经验的队伍，我们尽己所能帮助新的队伍。在7月30日我们拜访了ECUST，和他们进行了面对面交流，他们也带我们参观了实验室。在会中，我们帮助他们理解了什么是建模，社会实践，同时也就项目设计，队伍合作和签证申请给予了建议。
除了持续的交流，两个队伍在实验方面也有所合作。当华东理工大学队伍的实验遇到困难时，我们帮助他们转化了他们需要的片段。作为回报，当我们在转化CrtI失败很多次后，他们帮助我们转化了这个基因，帮助我们推进了实验进程。同时，他们也在我们质粒骨架紧缺的时候提供我们pSB1C3，缓解了我们的燃眉之急。

Abstract
Non-ribosomal peptide (NRP) synthesis is a biochemical process of remarkable hierarchical organization. Vertically it can be described stepwise starting from the coding DNA sequence that is translated into a giant enzyme catalyzing in turn the actual NRP assembly. Horizontally its complexity is established by a modular order of functional proteinogenic units. Due to this systematic composition a bioinformatic approach appears most suitable, if we aim for the automated design of fully synthetic NRPs.
Here, we introduce a comprehensive software tool, the NRPSDesigner , which facilitates the prediction and synthesis of non-ribosomal synthetases (NRPS) that catalyze customized NRP-assembly. The predictive power of the NRPSDesigner is based on a curated database storing information of about 200 NRPS modules, their DNA coding sequences and substrate specificities. It is used to calculate the optimal domain sequence according to the weighted phylogenetic distance between domain origins. Additionally an integrated domain recognition algorithm allows for curated expansion of the database. To accelerate the process from in silco NRPS design towards experimental validation we embedded the Gibthon iGEM software tool of Cambridge 2010 for Gibson primer construction. With this framework we want to suggest"

Penn,2012,Team:Penn#Perceptions_-_-_TEXT.html," Therapeutics
Many iGEM teams produce projects that they hope will one day be applied to human health, or in some cases, are actually designed to be consumed by human beings. Any project that has consumption or medical use as its ultimate goal would undergo scrutiny from a wide array of regulatory agencies. This process can take a great deal of time and money, and is a major consideration for any biotechnology startup, including ones that may arise as a result of an iGEM project. Here, we focus specifically on the US regulatory agencies, but many regulatory practices in other regions follow similar guidelines.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the primary regulatory agency for medical devices and pharmaceutical compounds. Historically, the agency has guided and reviewed clinical trials for medications, as well as outlined standards for the testing and approval of medical devices. The rapid development of the biotechnology industry has also prompted the FDA to make further distinctions between ""chemical small molecule entities,"" (SME) and ""biologics,"" which are defined as ""any virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin or analogous product applicable to the prevention, treatment or cure of diseases or injuries of man."" This definition has since been applied to products of the biotechnology industry, including future products based on the work of the 2012 Penn iGEM team. Essentially, the FDA makes a distinction between products that are manufactured in a well characterized fashion, such as traditional pharmaceuticals and recently some recombinant proteins, and products that are produced in processes which are more variable, such as the growth of viruses in bioreactors [18].
The FDA is divided into two large divisions, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), which is responsible for evaluating SME drugs, and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), which is responsible for evaluating biologics. It is likely that any bacterial-based therapeutics, such as the ones developed by the 2012 Penn iGEM team would most likely fall under the jurisdiction of CBER.
Under such regulations, a bacterial-based therapeutic would be required to undergo the biologic licence application process (BLA). During this process, the FDA would review not only the safety and efficacy of a biologic, but also the process by which a biologic is produced. SME drugs are often produced through established industrial processes, and are therefore biologics are extremely sensitive to small variations during the production process, and are therefore more strictly regulated. The FDA BLA process can be divided into five distinct stages [19].
The first stage is the ""Filing Determination & Review Planning Stage,"""

Aim of the experiment: Picking of of E. coli XL1 blue transformed with the ligation products of F52+F53, F59+F58, F59+F54, F59+F55, F59+F57 and F59+F56
Procedure:
The picked colonies were transferred into cell-culture tubes with air-permeable, sterile cover containing 4 mL of LB-medium + 4 µL chloramphenicol(1000x) or ampecillin (1000x).
2 colonies of each agar plate were picked.
These tubes were transferred in a cell culture shaker at 37 °C and were incubated overday.
The ligation of F42 and F51 was not successful and has to be repeated. One reason for the failure could be secondary structures of the promoter. Therefore the new ligation batch should be heated to 95°C for a while before adding the T4 ligase.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html," rates of RelB were combined with production rates of RelE at 35 and 100 molecules per minute, corresponding to relatively medium and strong expression levels respectively. This revealed that variation in RelB had a higher impact on the time required before the dormant state was reached when the RelE production is lowered. Out of the established configurations, the RelB2:50-RelE:35 configuration showed promising results. Compared to the RelB2:35-RelE:35 configuration, where only few bacteria reenter an active state within the modelled time set to 2.5 hours, the RelB2:50-RelE:35 configuration revealed a high sensitivity to the expression level of RelB. This indicated a need for the expression of RelB to be higher than RelE, but as the best results were achieved at low production rates of RelE, it is important to stringently control the expression of RelB to ensure that the bacteria are able to enter dormancy.
Figure 3. The variation in time required for the bacteria to enter an active state for different expression levels of RelB is dependent on the level of RelE expression. All configurations achieve dormancy within the modelled time.
Figure 4. RelB2:50-RelE:35 induces an active state within minutes, whereas RelB:35-RelE:35 only causes few of the bacteria to enter an active state. In the remaining configurations all bacteria remained dormant.
Discussion of Model Regarding the Artificial Dormancy System
Model Limitations
As the model only simulates the dormancy for 2 hours, not all configurations have reached equilibrium, therefore these configurations might attain a higher concentration of free RelE than modelled. This could result in a prolonged phase reentering an active state. The activation model has a rather weak predictability, as the half-life of RelE is quite high. This essentially means, that the model is unable to reduce the total amount of RelE, given by RelEtot=RelEfree+RelEbound, because of the short simulated timespan. Thus, in activation runs, where the number of free RelE molecules reaches a high level, the amount of RelEbound is equally high. The problem arises, since the model works under the assumption that bound RelB is not completely stable, causing RelE-RelB complexes to dissociate, whereby RelE is freed. This causes the induced RelB expression to approach equilibrium, implying that the decrease in free RelE is rather slow. It is therefore not only the amount of free RelE that determines the activation time, but"

Results Overview
Having spent our summer in the lab, we are proud to present our accomplishments. Up to the European regional jamboree in Lyon, we have created 72 BioBricks and devices, transformed and selected 20 different transgenic GM-mosses and characterized our effectors as recombinant proteins produced in E. coli and in our moss Physcomitrella patens, a chassis newly introduced into iGEM. We took further steps to put our phytoremediation project into practice by developing concepts for the implementation of our PhyscoFilter in the environment and by analyzing the economic potential of this innovative technology in our Entrepreneurship section. Additional to our wetlab work, we contributed a very powerful software tool for the annotation of BioBricks from the Parts Registry and created tutorials to pass this summer´s experiences and skills on to the subsequent iGEM generations.

However, a major hindrance to Indian participation in iGEM is the large costs associated with the same. We estimated that our iGEM project would cost US$ 20,000. Such large funding is difficult for undergraduates to obtain in India, where the per capita income is approximately US\$ 6000 (GDP PPP per capita).
In response, the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India started a new grant program for iGEM teams called iBEC – Indian BioEngineering Competition, in 2016. iBEC is a pre-iGEM competitive grant program for undergraduate Indian iGEM teams. The 2016 iBEC involved the submission of proposals by teams across India, of which four were selected. The maximum grant per team was Rs. 1 million (US$ 15000) and we received the same amount from iBEC for participation in iGEM.

From these experiments, we help Jilin_China to confirm their TA system can work. For further information, here is the link to their wiki .
Jilin_China for BIT-China:
Jilin_China helped us build a part, which we can test the expression of membrane protein by detect blue color(bcp).
In this process, we are concerned about whether our sweet receptor can be successfully expressed and located on the cell membrane , the strategy is to fused BCP（Blue cytochrome protein）to the N-terminal of T1R2，so that we can observe the protein T1R2 on the membrane by fluorescence confocal microscopy. The member of Jilin_China synthesize the expression cassette of PGal1 + T1R2 + BCP + CYC1t gene for us.

The activity of the promoters raises during the pass from the transition to the stationary phase. This maximum (t=1h) reaches from 200Lumi/OD600 (promoter J23115) to a maximum of 1500 Lumi/OD600 for the strongest promoter (J23101). Afterwards the activity goes down to the beginning level (t=2h). The oscillation of luminescence (Lumi/ OD600 in the beginning of the curves are due to the small OD600 and do not mean a high promoter activity. The luminescence of one clone of the promoters J23107 and J23114 do not show activity where in future a second clone with promoter activity should be measured. In comparison to all the other evaluated Bacillus promoters these Anderson promoters showed a very low acitivity in B. subtilis.
To measure the activity not only with the lux reporter operon, four promoters of the Anderson collection were cloned into the reporter vector pSBBs1C-lacZ to do β galactosidase assays and then to compare the results of the strength of these promoters in B. subtilis. (Fig. 2)

UST_Beijing,2016,Team:UST Beijing#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," that the enzyme efficiency of E.coli containing BBa_K2072000 is greater, and the catalyze efficiency of E.coli with adding arabinose is faster than non-arabinose. So it prove that our part can be Induced by arabinose to express β-glucosidase. We speculated that a small amount of enzyme background expression led the E.coli which was not induced by arabinose to decompose PNPG.
We added E.coli with or without BBa_K2072000, ONPG and arabinose with varies concentration in different wells. After a period of time culturing, absorbance was measured under 450nm light, the result showed that catalytic activity of β-glucosidase reached peak when arabinose concentration in the culture medium is 7mM, and then it went down while concentration increasing. It was even inhibited when concentration kept increasing.

Imperial_College,2013,Team:Imperial College#Enzyme Kinetics_-_-_TEXT.html," absorbance at 405 nm. Figure adapted from TU Darmstadt 2012 iGEM
The assay was run in the Eppendorf BioSpectrometer was used to automatically read the absorbance of the reaction mixture every 30 seconds. The concentration of 4-Nitrophenol produced from the reaction was calculated using the Beer-Lambert Law; the extinction coefficient of 4-NP is 18,000 M-1 cm-1 at 405 nm.
The results below show the concentration of 4-NP produced by the three different PUR esterases and compare them to the Empty Vector and Substrate alone as negative controls.
The increase in absorbance that accompanies the cleavage of para-Nitrophenyl butyrate by PUR Esterase EstCS2. Figure by Imperial College London iGEM 2013
The concentration of 4-Nitrophenol released by PUR Esterase EstCS2 activity. Empty Vector and Substrate alone were used as negative controls. Figure by Imperial College London iGEM 2013
The above graphs clearly show that PUR Esterase EstCS2 is active and cleaving p-NP. The recorded concentrations of 4-NP, in the presence of this PUR Esterase, are much greater than with the Empty Vector or the Substrate alone. Is PUR Esterase EstCS2 active? Yes!
The enzyme activity of PUR Esterase PueB. The graph shows the concentration of the 4-Nitrophenol released during 10 minutes incubation of para-Nitrophenyl butyrate with PueB and Empty Vector, as well as the p-NP substrate by itself. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM

The enzymes expressed by both PueB and PulA do not appear to have esterase activity for this substrate. There is a tiny increase in 4-NP concentration for PueB, PulA, Empty Vector and Substrate alone. This probably indicates that the substrate is slowly degrading by itself. Other constituents of the cell lysates are likely to be causing a slight increase in p-NP degradation, as PueB, PulA and Empty Vector show"

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"1 plasmids with different fusion sites are needed. In our system, this is also achieved through the connectors in contrast to the destination plasmids which are used in other cloning methods.
In already existing toolboxes, the combinatorics that come with choosing oris and resistances would be multiplied by the number of required positional vectors which provide the fusion sites for LVL2 assembly. A toolbox with five possible positions, four resistances and three oris would require 60 LVL1 destination plasmids. To enable inversion of transcription units, a built-in feature in our toolbox, the previous number would be multiplied by two, resulting in 120 required LVL1 destination plasmids.
Unsurprisingly, this theoretical toolbox would not be convenient to be built and used.
The Marburg Collection presents a novel approach that achieves maximum flexibility with a minimum of required components. We provide two sets of connectors. The first set, the “short connectors” solely provide the fusion sites for subsequent assembly. The fusion sites are identical to the ones that are used in building LVL1 plasmids to avoid having to design a complete new set of fusion sites. This also enables using LVL0 ori and resistance parts in LVL2 plasmids. Inversion of individual transcription units was also achieved by designing fusion sites that match in reverse order.
Figure 6: Inversion of transcription units is feasible with our connectors.
To achieve inversion, the respective transcription unit has to be built with connectors that match the neighboring transcription units. The function by following pattern: 3'Con(N)inv connects to 3'Con(N-1) and 5'Con(N)inv connects to 5'Con(N+1)
The 5’ and 3’ connectors can be chosen independently to build a LVL1 plasmid. This allows the user to combine any number of LVL1 plasmids between one and five into a LVL2 plasmid without end linkers that are required in other toolboxes (Andreou and Nakayama, 2018). An unusual example is shown in figure 7 to demonstrate the number of possibilities. The only logic that has to be followed for designing multigene constructs is to follow the formula 5'Con(N) connects to 3'Con(N-1). In the default set up
TU
(N) is built with 5'Con(N) and 3'Con(N) This will result in a LVL2 plasmid harboring five transcription units.
However, any other combination that follows the previously given rule will result in"

UVR8-TetRDBD
Fig. 1 UVR8 homodimer [Christie2012]
We introduce and implement a novel two-hybrid screening for E.coli using the TetR-DNA binding domain. TetRDBD on its own is unable to bind to the Ptet promoter. After fusing it to the dimerizing UVR8 (Fig. 1), a UV-B-detecting-protein from plants, in different ways  - repression occured.
Decoder
Our decoder (Fig. 2) aims to combine blue and red light to distinguish between different lightsources like sunlight or room light. For this we use LovTAP and Cph8 and perform the calculation with the help of three NOR gates each represented by a new designed hybrid promoter. LovTAP is a fusion of a photoreceptor with a transcriptional regulator TrpR. This fusion protein can be activated by blue light and therefore act as a transcriptional switch. We want to use this system for the light intensity measurement and as an input for our decoder. Cph8 consists of the light-receptor Cph1 that is deactivated by red light and the histidine kinase EnvZ responsible for the downstream signaling. We aim to use it for our decoder as a red-light-sensor.

The 4th iGEM Asia-Pacific Conference 2016
Introduction
The 4th iGEM Asia-Pacific Conference 2016 Taiwan was organized by iGem NCKU and held grandly at National Cheng Kung University Tainan from Aug. 8, 2016 to Aug. 14. We, iGEM NCKU, are the first university from the southern Taiwan to attend iGEM  Competition organized by MIT, Boston. By involving in Synthetic Biology and iGEM Competition, our team is confident to make a breakthrough in this field via multidisciplinary cooperation and can proudly present our work on the international platform.  In turn, this Asia-Pacific Conference was the first step for us to introduce the idea to other teams from different countries in Asia.
We invited 20 teams from different schools in five countries to this Meet-up Conference. Professional scholars and entrepreneurs were also invited to provide us academic knowledge and suggestions. The approaches for meeting people and expanding ideas in this conference are presentations, poster exhibitions, team experience sharing, Round table, and Tainan cultural tours. After this Asia-Pacific Academic Exchange Conference, we believe that we make others understand our intension and indeed makes NCKU a step closer to spreading the idea universally.
Team's Project
Several presentations were made by the professors and representatives of our sponsor. Besides, our team presentation which was about our device was also performed to gain valuable feedback from the audience. This 20-minute English presentation, including the present and future research, objective, device and Q&A session.
Poster
There was a poster presentation from every team to enable every team sharing their research works and findings.
Experience Sharing Workshop -- [Random Group Formation]
One very exciting part in Asia-Pacific Conference is a variety of workshops to share attendees’ thinking. Within the workshop, attendees were randomly grouped. One member from iGEM NCKU_Tainan led the group discussion to elicit their iGEM experience along the iGEM journey. In those sharings and discussions, we could view the"
Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"5a with the synthesis of our part linked with pSB1C3. When they were disseminated in the LB medium with chloramphenicol, there was a presence of colonies which meant that they had been correctly transformed. However, when performing the electrophoresis of plasmid extraction only one band of the size of pSB1C3 was observed. First, we thought that the protocols of digestion and ligation that we carried out were not the correct ones or there was a bad manipulation. This idea was discarded when using a control with RFP. Doing more research, we discovered that the parts that we sent to synthesize in IDT lacked base pairs next to the restriction sites of EcoRI-HF and PstI. This means that the enzyme has no way to attach to the DNA sequence and digest it. Why did we have colonies that grew on LB + CAM? We believe that the re-circularization of the plasmid was possible.

Eight months are not enough to address the full scope of our project. This does not end here!

In humans, it is known that copper occurs naturally and in normal amounts. It can protect neurons against oxidation. However, several studies have shown that copper plays a key role in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. It is also increasingly referred to as an ""environmental illness"". Indeed, when it is accumulated in the body in large quantities, it is supposed to affect the removal system of the beta-amyloid protein in the brain. This is harmful to the nervous system and is implicated in Alzheimer's disease. The protein, in excess in patients, is a peptide which is mainly aggregates in the case of disease, and is present in soluble form in healthy patients.
2. Curdlan
Not dangerous for Humans Our project aims to use a polysaccharide which is synthetically produced by our genetically modified organisms. This molecule already exists in nature, it is naturally present in the yeast’s wall. No bad impact on the environment has been identified. Compared to copper sulfate which is a toxic compound, this molecule seems to be more environmentally friendly.
In 2013, the “Savoy ADAbio” tested on vine plants the effect of very low doses of different sugars in order to replace the copper treatment in the fight against pests. For example, they tested the effect of fructose against mildew. After different doses were tested, an encouraging result emerged : the weekly fructose application of  100 g / ha had a similar effect than a treatment of 600 g / ha of copper. According to this testimony, we now know that sugar helps fight against mildew.
Also used in many different applications, Curdlan doesn’t seems to have bad effects (see Other Effects Curdlan). However, we also collaborated with the Oxford iGEM team to test the toxicity of this molecule on the bacteria that already live in nature. This experience is useful to know the impact of Curdlan on other organisms. Another experience would have been interesting : a toxicity test on plant cells or animal cells. Unfortunately, we didn’t have the capacity to carry this test out in our laboratory. For now, we are still waiting for the results.
In food industry, the additive E424 (Curdlan) is used as a thickener, stabilizer, gelling and firming agent. This is reassuring because it is a common product in the food chain, and not reported as toxic.
We are not using the entire cell Another important theme is the spread of new organisms in nature. Indeed, this could alter biodiversity. If we want"
