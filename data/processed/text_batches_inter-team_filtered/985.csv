Thessaloniki,2018,Team:Thessaloniki#Model#Tale_-_-_TEXT.html,", Repressor TALE will display weak DNA binding when                     it is to bind in the presence of LacI, increasing the dissociation constant                     KT of TALE. This means that the binding affinity of the enzyme will be                     reduced, but can be readjusted in the presence of IPTG in the system by                     reacting with the free LacI reducing the likelihood of it, binding to the                     promoter. The dissociation constant for binding to the free promoter site                     is KT for TALE binding and KL for LacI binding. Similarly, when Tale is                     bound to the promoter, the affinity of LacI with the corresponding operator                     site will be reduced. The new dissociation constants will be k times bigger                     and we assume that k is the same for both ligands since interference                     between them will cause the same difficulty for each.
The expression of the hill equation, as described for TALE, is transformed                     as, the maximum transcription rate function for sfGFP, multiplied by the                     competitive equation, in the presence of LacI and includes the                     concentrations of the TALE repressor, LacI inhibitor and dissociation                     constant KT, KL, kKT, kKL. Despite the fact, that LacI does not interfere                     with the same operator site on the promoter, the interaction has a                     competitive nature, because of the steric interactions. As a result, TALE                     affinity to the DNA decreases.
Τhe production rate of sfGFP expressed as
where kKT >> KT because of reduced affinity.
For the differential equations that were added to the model:
We did not include IPTG as although in high concentrations it can                             reduce the concentration of LacI and smooth it out, it cannot                             neutralize this phenomenon to some degree. We have studied the case                             with only LacI regulating sfGFP expression.
Repressor TALE also represses the production of LacI with a similar                             dissociation constant and cooperativity characteristics with the                             sfGFP promoter.
The rates for LacI were found bibliographically and added to the                             TALE model.
Parameters
TALE rates are characterized above as well as dissociation constant KT = kd                     is equal to 106 nM.

The project  sounds amazing, work with other peoples, discover new things  in biology, do research. Enpowering my mind. I'm very  interested because I think that I can learn different things with  this competition than if I do another classic internship. It will be  a special experience to live and this is the moment maybe  when ideas of mine and the team could change our world.

Baptiste Couly
3rd Year, Engineer, Ecole des Mines ParisTech
I am an engineering student in his final year of study at Mines ParisTech. I discovered synthetic biology almost by chance during an introductory course I took because I remembered dimly that I liked biology in high school. I never regretted it. Synthetic biology is for me the opportunity to design complex systems using the strengths of life to create devices that ""traditionnal"" engineering can not. It is also the perfect time to work with a team with all kinds of backgrounds.
Oleg Mikhajlov
1st Year, Engineer, Ecole des Mines ParisTech
I'm a first year student at Ecole des Mines de Paris. Before that I studied at the physics faculty of Saint Petersburg State University, Russia. Now I would like to see how physics works in biology. Synthetic biology seems to be an excellent example of the interdisciplinary science that regroups biology, physics, computer sciences etc. That's why I joined the iGEM team.

Transformation of the yeast
pGADT7-HRH4-mcherry was transformed into CEN.PK2-1c ura3::far1 his2::sst2 trp3::ste2 △leu2 △ura3 Saccharomyces cerevisiae to test the expression and localization of HRH4-mcherry.
pYES2.0-pfua1-EGFP was transformed into original CEN.PK2-1c △his2 △trp3 △leu2 △ura3   Saccharomyces cerevisiae to test the reporter.
Both pGADT7-HRH4 and pYES2.0-pfua1-EGFP were transformed into CEN.PK2-1c ura3::far1 his2::sst2 trp3::ste2 △leu2 △ura3 Saccharomyces cerevisiae to consist our complete yeast for histamine detection. For confirming both of these two plasmids were transformed successfully, colony PCR was performing to detect the existence of these two plasmids.

Test and Result
To insure our system can work as we expected, we did a serious of test.
HRH4-mCherry expression and localization
After transforming the CEN.PK2-1c ura3::far1 his2::sst2 trp3::ste2 △ura3 Saccharomyces cerevisiae with plasmid pGADT7 contains part BBa_K2583001, 30℃ cultivate on △leu solid medium for one day. Select monoclonal and enlarge culture for several days. We chose to feature the expression of H4 at a relatively stable stage to make the result more referable for the modeling analysis.
Location observation by fluorescence microscope
We observed the fluorescence under the microscope with 580nm exciting light. The red fluorescence shows the position of HRH4-mCherry fusion protein.

The location of HRH4 indicates that our pioneering work to try to produce Histamine receptor H4 from Homo sapiens in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was basically a success. Because the function of HRH4 requires at least that the protein should be"
ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#labblog_-_-_TEXT.html," AHL at the same time point into different bacterial colonies. The factor that we want to observe is the strength of the activation of the Lux promoter. The read-out is made by the fluorescence. The data was gathered over several time points in order to be able to observe the dynamic behavior. More precisely, the read-out of the promoter activation is made by the relative fluorescence, which corresponds to the ratio of the absolute fluorescence over the Optical Density (OD). We consider that the concentration in GFP per cell is proportional to the relative fluorescence. As we try to avoid fitting the saturation events, we chose to normalize with respect to the highest value before a certain amount of time, which corresponds for each experiment to the apparition of the saturation.
As a first approach, we only try to fit the steady state value. As the signaling molecule is inducing the production of GFP, we chose to use an Hill function to fit the function [GFP] = f([AHL]) at steady state.
If Hill functions fit these two curves good, the parameters used are surprising. For our system, we suppose that AHL binds to the regulator protein LuxR. This complex called Rlux dimerizes before binding to the promoter to induce its expression. Thus, the dimerization event makes cooperativity emerge from AHL molecules. It is translated for a Hill function by n > 1. In this particular case, one could expect to find n=2 (as it is a dimerization event). Nevertheless, the n found are on the order of magnitude of 1 (0.89 for the non-riboregulated promoter plasmid and 1.22 for the ribo-regulated promoter plasmid). The data points were collected in triplicates and this allow us to have a look at the variability (namely standard deviation) around each value. Where the switch happens, the variability is higher (it is expected because the output GFP is more sensitive to variation of the input [AHL] around the switching point). Therefore, the inflexion points could need some improvment, by taking more points around this identified sensitive region. Moreover, this critical concentration of AHL was the one that was expected given the litterature and our system. We observe that it needs a higher [AHL] for the riboregulated system to be activated than for the non-riboregulated system.
We modeled leakiness as an offset in the Hill function : [GFP] = g([AHL]) = f([AHL]) + aLeakiness. We obtain the expected information that the signal over noise ratio is"
EPFL,2016,Team:EPFL#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," puts a constrain to what it can evolve to.
We use synthetic biology to address evolutionary questions. I think it’s a nice approach because you can easily build different topologies. It is actually also known in nature that the same phenotype can be caused by quite different gene regulatory networks but of course it is much harder to study this in let’s say fly development than with synthetic networks in E. coli.
In January I’ll move to the Department of Fundamental Microbiology at the University of Lausanne and where I’ll start as an assistant professor in synthetic biology.
And do you see you research going in the same direction?
Yes, similar to what I just explained. We will build synthetic gene regulatory networks to improve our understanding of them and their evolution.
We would like to start by trying to tie this into the ethical                              part. So our first question for you is whether you are ever faced with                              suspicion about the application of your work.
Dimitri: I’m from the US and I know that in the US specifically there is a lot of tension between the scientific community and the general public especially when it comes down to genetic manipulation or regulation people are skeptical, to say the least, and suspicious most time.
So our first question is; are you ever asked about if your research falls into the realm of the unethical and how do you respond to those question if they come up?
I see what you mean, but personally I don’t think I had any such situation. The research I do is really basic research. It stays in the laboratory, so I think that people don’t mind that much if it stays in the lab. Currently, it is not intended for any application and no modified organisms are released. And I work on bacteria, where ethical questions are less of an issue.
But I see the issue, the public can be skeptical. This is our job to communicate to the general public and explain what we are doing.
How do you personally go about this? Or in other words, do scientists that have the obligation to explain what is going on - in their view - or is that something that should be dealt with politicians, by social groups of organizations of this nature?
I think it is part of the scientists’ job. I guess we should actually educate scientists better because we never learned how to communicate with the public. But apparently [the rapport has] changed. You are the proof by doing this interview that communication becomes more and more important.
I think public outreach is important. We need to try to speak to the public. In the end they’re paying our research, right! They should have a right of deciding what we are"

Washington iGEM
Collaboration
Our collaborations this year were quite diverse, from engaging with our satellite campus to connecting with a team from Japan to being active locally in helping to found the first completely high school based iGEM team in Washington State!
iTesla-SoundBio
Previous Next
In the past, our team received numerous emails from high school students interested in joining our team.  However, this rarely worked out, due to liability at our university, logistical issues, and our team’s limited space and resources.  As our team has grown in the last few years, it became even harder to take on high school students, and as the only team in Washington State, we began looking for other ways for high school students to participate in iGEM.
Thus, last year, we set out a plan to start a high school team in partnership with multiple schools in our area.  We worked with high school students Roya Amini-Naieni (Bellevue International School) and Anna Vasyura (Tesla STEM HS) to recruit members from five East Side high schools.
That’s when SoundBio stepped in. SoundBio Lab is a DIY Bio lab near the University of Washington that allows citizen scientists to develop their own personal projects, and also engages with students of all ages through community outreach programs.  Despite a long commute, the high school team migrated their work to the SoundBio lab space and SoundBio researchers stepped up to participate as instructors.
Members from Team Washington provided training materials for lab safety based on safety certification programs from the University of Washington Environmental Health and Safety Department.  We helped plan initial meetings at Tesla High School, Microsoft Headquarters, and SoundBio Lab, developing a plan with the iTesla-SoundBio leadership team and brainstorming project ideas.  Members of our team led lab training at the SoundBio lab at the start of the season, and gave guidance in brainstorming sessions and project selection.  Throughout the season, we have been available for advice and troubleshooting.  Finally, we have coached the team as they prepare their wiki , presentation, and poster for the Jamboree.
This collaboration has given us an appreciation for the vast amount of work that goes into starting a new team, and we are very proud of the high school students who took on this challenge.  We are excited to have a new partnership with the SoundBio lab as well, and are looking forward to seeing this team grow and develop in the coming years.

Team Activity Tests:
There have been some discussions about the storage of our laccases. It was said that the freezing of laccase (once deluted) might cause increased enzymatic activity. To find out whether storing the enzymes in the refrigerator or in the freezer is a better choice we compared to different samples from TVEL0. One was stored cooled and one was frozen and then measured as usual. As shown in figure 1 the frozen laccases showed an increased saturation curve and also reached the saturation slower. This seems like a clear hint to better store our enzymes in the refrigerator.
Tuesday August 28th
Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
Ligation of pSB1C3 with promoters J23117, J23110 and J23103. The promoters (which are again primer pairs we  annealed) were diluted 1:1000 (0,1 pmol) before and boiled with 98°C and slowly cooled down for ligation of the forward and the reverse primers.
Colony PCR of ligated products with T7 promoter and insert. The PCR showed for the tthl_HIS and for ecol a band in agarose gel on the correct height. So we picked this colonies and plated them to isolate the plasmids.
Team Cellulose Binding Domain:
Gel-clean up of the digested pSB1C3-backbone.
Colony-PCR of CBDcex(T7) and CBDcex(T7)+GFP_His with four positive colonies of CBDcex(T7) .
Plasmid-isolation of one CBDcex(T7)+GFP_His followed by restriction with no positive result.
Plated another CBDcex(T7)+GFP_His -colony for plasmid-isolation.
Plated small dots of 25 colonies of the CBDclos(T7)+GFP_His -transformation to look if they are red.
Plasmid isolation of <partinfo>J61101</partinfo> and digestion with SpeI and PstI
Team Fungal and Plant Laccases:
Digest of tvel35 PCR product for cloning in pSB1C3.
Team Cultivation & Purification:
The band appearing in the SDS-PAGE of the cultivation of the 08/14 was analysed via MALDI-TOF and we got a positive result: we got our laccase!
We made a SDS-PAGE from yesterday's cultivation and got the same band for cultivation of BBa_K863005 , so we reproduced our result:) It seems"

G-Block design of Cld:
G-Block designs are shown below in Figures 1 and 2 as schematics or sequences. In their original work, Thorell et al. cloned, sequenced, and functionally expressed the natural coding sequence for Cld from I. Dechloratans. They determined that the gene was capable of converting ClO2 to O2 and Cl- and that its activity was localized to the periplasm, even though its putative signal peptide had not been cleaved. In light of their results we decided to design a Cld gene (Cld SP+) where the putative signal peptide was replaced with the MalE signal peptide from E. coli that has been previously shown to be a superior signal for periplasmic localization that is cleaved (Samant et al. 2014). In addition we designed a Cld gene that lacked the signal sequence (Cld SP-) as a negative control. We also appended a C-terminal histidine tag to each in order to purify the enzymes in the event that O2 production from living cells proved inefficient.  Flanking these BsaI sites were XbaI (5’) and the BBa_ std 1 suffix (3’) to facilitate parts creation for the registry. We note that the natural coding sequence contained none of the standard BBa_10 restrictions sites, but did contain a single internal BsaI site which we eliminated with a single base silent substitution (Fig 1)
Figure 1.
Shown is a schematic, of the natural chlorite (Cld) dismutase coding sequence from I. Dechloratans as originally characterized by Thorell et al. and the G-Block designs for Cld with (+SP) and without (-SP) the periplasmic localization signal peptide. In Cld(+SP) the signal peptide from the E. coli MalE gene replaces the the putative signal peptide of the natural gene. Both G-Blocks duplicate the RBS driving"

Investigations and Impact
Our team started researching and seeking to understand the implications of water contamination, water testing, test affordability, and water safety early in our project and continued to analyze the role of our system within the scope of this research throughout the year. As a part of understanding the niche and scope of our kit, we consulted with experts in various fields to receive feedback both on water safety as a whole, substrates we could use in our kit, and how we could improve our test kit to fill an appropriate role within the water testing industry.
Community and Global Needs
We began by researching and compiling data establishing the importance of water testing and water safety, and the need for new water testing systems for the direct public consumer.  Water testing is incredibly important for the reduction of water contamination worldwide. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control (the CDC) recommends various standards for water testing and safety that are then regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
In spite of the significant infrastructure and strict requirements for water purification and usage in the United States including potable water standards, wastewater effluent requirements, and recreational water usage standards, incidents of individuals being impacted by various forms of water contamination are reported each year. For example, high amounts of lead were found the drinking water of Flint, Michigan, just 4 years ago in 2014. In 1993, 69 people died and an estimated 400,000 people were sickened as a result of the Cryptosporidium parasite in the water in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Regular water testing is a necessity even when adequate filtration systems and regulations are in place. In rural areas, however, it becomes much more difficult to ensure the safety of water supplies through testing and management as in many cases, individual homes are fed by wells that can be contaminated. While generally only impacting small numbers of people, contamination of well water can still be dangerous not just for those individual well users, but also for other individuals with wells that tap into the same deep aquifers."

There was also fluorescence  measurable in the flowthrough and wash fractions. This indicates that the used 1 mL HisTrap FF crude (GE Healthcare) was overloaded or the protein was bound weakly at to the affinity matrix. The resulting purity in the elution fraction, the saving of time and the simplicity makes this procedure the prefered purification method.

Scheme of purification strategy for SgsE (fusion) proteins with His-tag:
First, SgsE is expressed in E. coli under the control of a T7 / lac promoter for separation of growth and production phase due to metabolic stress of the S-layer expression. Because the SgsE protein is forming inclusion bodies in E. coli, the cells were mechanically disrupted (Sonification on ice) in binding buffer containing 6 M urea.

Meetup
The ""Mexican Teams Meetup"" had several activities. Amongst them were a collaboration in Human Practices, which laid the foundations for the Laboratory Handbook, a guide that aims to introduce children from elementary school to science; and a presentation of the progress that we had until that point regarding our project, which aside from giving us an idea of how it will be to present in english, it also made us see our areas of opportunity, which consequently allowed us to improve and be able to be more competitive in the Giant Jamboree. Although these were the technical aspects of the meeting, it was thanks to this meetup that we were able to establish relationships with the members of the various teams that participated; this has not only helped us with things related to the project but has also made the iGEM community of Mexico closer and stronger than ever.
IONIS PARIS
The IONIS Paris team contacted us for a team collaboration. We worked together for several months, mainly focussing in Human Practices and Modeling. The IONIS modeling team helped us to visualize one of our enzymes: “yhjH”, based on bibliography and the enzyme optimal conditions, they managed to simulate it in silico, helping us to establish and assume model parameters and enzyme behaviors, among other things. Besides it, our teams managed to collaborate in Human Practices. Based on the IONIS human practices project, some of our team members contacted winegrowers and oenologists to interview them about how climate change has affected their vineyards. The information gathered was used for a comparative framework between French and Mexican wine production actual adversities. During the meetings with the experts, we also discussed the IONIS team proposal, so they could let them know their points of view and their opinions about it. Therefore, the IONIS team got an international perspective of their project impact.

The following luminescence assay procedures is based on kit protocol with some modifications. First, we created standard curve according to the kit protocol to estimate ATP-to-ADP conversion rate from luminescence data. This performed by creating series of 1 mM ATP+ADP mixture with varying percentage of ADP relative to ATP+ADP (Table 1) in first row of microplate well. Series of 100 µM, 10 µM, and 1 µM were created by serial dilution in subsequent rows. The luminescence was then determined using Promega GloMax®-Multi Detection System.
Table 1.ATP+ADP mixture with varying percentage of ADP relative to ATP+ADP in microplate wells for standard curve.
Next, the reaction between lysed cells and purified DT with the amount of 180 nM (i.e. from Part III we found that Kd for HB-EGF/Tar and DT binding is 88.43 nM in 250C, then the maximum binding activity in 250C is expected to be achieved at twice of Kd) was carried out under 1x kinase reaction buffer consisting of 40 mM Tris pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/mL BSA. Ten µL from each reaction was aliquoted into wells in microplate and 10 µL of ADP-GloTM reagent was added to each well to stop the reaction and deplete the remaining ATP in the samples. After 40 minutes of incubation, 20 µL of kinase detection reagent was added to each well to convert ADP to ATP which will be used to generate luminescence and introduce substances (i.e. luciferin and luciferase) for luminescence. After 30 minutes of incubation, the luminescence was measured.  Further details regarding ADP-Glo methods could be accessed in the protocol page.

Oxford,2014,Team:Oxford#what are microcompartments_-_-_TEXT.html," not significant.
Another assumption made in these calculations was that the enzymes could be treated as homogenous. They are of very similar dimensions, varying by no more than 20-30% on any axis, and also have very similar sphericities- the key variable in determining the packing efficiency of the molecules. Sphericity is defined as:
φ = sphericity
V_p = volume of ellipsoid (nm^3)
A_p = surface area of ellipsoid (nm^2)
For ellipsoids, a surface area approximation was used:
a = length of axis 1 (nm)
b = length of axis 2 (nm)
c = length of axis 3 (nm)
After calculating the sphericities of the enzymes, the porosity of the system could then be determined through empirical data from literature. Because the DcmA and FdhA sphericities were very similar (0.953 and 0.981 respectively), we considered the system to be composed of a homogenous spheroid species of porosity 0.973 i.e. the weighted average of the two species.
The image in the top right is a visualization of the ellipsoids packing in the microcompartment
The graph on the right shows the empirical ellipsoid packing efficiencies as defined by sphericity
Results
Because enzyme-enzyme interactions are very difficult to predict, and it is difficult to assign an analogous friction factor to their movements, we took the average of the predicted porosities across a range of different friction factors and alternative methods to give a predicted porosity of 37.3%.
Combining this information with the relative expression rates of the two enzymes, we predict that:
We should note that these numbers are a first approximation and do not take into consideration the strain placed on the cell involved in expressing this amount of protein. This model is based entirely on volumetric and geometric laws rather than biological ones and should be considered a first assumption and theoretical maximum given optimum conditions.

Targeting into the microcompartment
Proteins can be inserted into the microcompartment when they have an N-terminal targeting sequence.  In order to show that this targeting mechanism works for our constructs, we have constructed a plasmid with sfGFP fused to the N-terminal tag. When transforming this vector into E.coli along with the pUNI-ABTUNJK vector, we observed high-density fluorescence spots in those cells that expressed both the microcompartment and microcompartment-tagged sfGFP. This is shown in the image on the left, whereas"

In addition, the contribution of a working of a second system for bacterial cell to cell communication (i.e., in addition to AI-1 signaling) within the Registry would drastically increase the range of future projects that could be undertaken by providing the users with an additional input (i.e. AI-2) for their genetically engineered machines.

Furthermore our toolbox will include a secretion mechanism for the synthesized products, various intra-compartmental sensors, modules for the integration of proteins into the peroxisome membrane, as well as optogenetic control for some of these parts for a more precise spatiotemporal control.
As a proof of concept for the functionality of the toolbox and the customizable compartment two metabolic pathways will be integrated into the altered peroxisome: (i) Violacein biosynthesis and (ii) nootkatone biosynthesis. Violacein, a bisindole formed by condensation of two tryptophan molecules, is a violet pigment and thus easy to quantify in the cell. Nootkatone on the other side is a natural compound found inside the peel of the grapefruit, which gives it its characteristic taste and smell. In addition, nootkatone is a natural mosquito and tick repellent that is already being commercially used and industrially manufactured. Unfortunately, the production costs are extremely high. Furthermore, the production of nootkatone inside yeast is challenging as it is toxic for yeast and thus, the production efficiency is rather low. A successful implementation of the synthetic compartment will show increased yields in the production of these compounds and showcase the potential of this approach for similar future applications.
Cloning strategies and the Yeast Toolbox for Multipart-Assembly
While describing our cloning strategies we mentioned several levels, which stand for different stages of our plasmids. They are further described in the work of J.M. Dueber and colleagues, who designed the well established yeast toolkit we used in this project (Dueber) .  The toolkit offers the possibility to design plasmids with desired antibiotic resistances, promoters as well as terminators from standardized parts. It also provides fluorescence proteins, protein-tags and many more useful components as part plasmids. These part plasmids are distinguished in different part types due to their specific overhangs to ensure their combination in the correct order (e.g. promoter - gene of interest - terminator) all in a versatile one-pot Golden Gate reaction without time-consuming conventional cloning steps.
Figure 1: The yeast toolkit starter set comprises of 96 parts and vectors. The eight primary part types can be further divided into subtypes. (Dueber)
The cloning steps regarding the plasmid levels are implemented in E.coli in order to reduce the required time to generate the final plasmids. The different levels are therefore defined by their part content and their antibiotic resistances.
To generate a level 0 plasmid, the gene of interest"

Key Questions
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety?.
Our system primary goal is hydrogen production. This gas is known to support deflagration (combustion at a subsonic velocity) when its concentration in air ranges between 4% and 70% (1), and several cases of spontaneous ignition have been reported (2). For the iGEM competition, our work will be focused solely on small containers with our bacteria (petri dishes and flasks with a capacity smaller than one liter). These containers pose a low combustion risk. However they will be handled with care, avoiding direct exposure to ignition sources.
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of public safety?.
Yes. Our project includes the development of broad host-range plasmids, which include antibiotic resistances (e.g. gentamicin). However these plasmids are intended for use only in laboratories, under controlled conditions. This ensures that resistances won’t be horizontally transferred to any pathogenic organism.

British_Columbia,2017,Team:British Columbia#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"atches closer to the PAM cause relatively greater changes in free energy, while mismatches further from the PAM site had less effect overall on the energy released (Figure 2b). The values for nucleotide matching and distance factor were obtained experimentally via deep sequencing (Farasat & Salis, 2016) and allow biologically relevant ∆G values to be assigned to each nucleotide pair. A simplified version of the Farasat & Salis equation is:
Where k is the number of bases away from the PAM site, dk is the distance factor from Figure 2 and  ∆GRNA:DNA is the value obtained from Figure 1.
Figure 1. Experimentally derived ∆G values (kcal/mol) for sgRNA:DNA binding from Farasat & Salis 2016. For example, the ∆G value for AC:AA binding is 0.75 kcal/mol, shown in green and blue.
Figure 2. Relative importance of each nucleotide in the sgRNA based on distance from PAM site. This information is experimentally determined and shows a general trend of decreasing pairing importance moving further away from the PAM site.
∆Gsupercoil
This is the energy required to ‘unzip’ the supercoiled DNA to allow for binding to the exposed nucleotides. ∆Gsupercoil is a constant in this model, based on the average superhelical density of the E. coli genome and the amount of energy it takes to unwind it to 1/10 of its original density.
The British_Columbia team consulted the research group responsible for calculating the Gibbs free energies for guide binding and obtained preliminary code, provided by Dr. Howard Salis. The initial model would compare a short input nucleotide sequence (or sgRNA) against an input DNA sequence and calculate the Gibbs energy for each protospacer match. The protospacers would then be ranked based on their energy released, and a partition function of each protospacer would be calculated. The partition function is the relative likelihood of binding to a protospacer, when all available protospacers are considered.
For our model, we wanted to functionalize the code provided by Dr. Howard Salis to work with genomic DNA (the initial system could not allow inputs larger than a few hundred thousand nucleotides), allow the ability to input multiple DNA inputs (so plasmids can be included in the search), and we wanted the ability to search multiple guides at once and compare them directly. Another design requirement was a matching nucleotide location of the guide to the genome,"

Tsinghua,2018,Team:Tsinghua#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," catalyzed by protein luxI. Due to the scarcity of luxI protein in our system, it can be seen as the rate-limiting factor in the synthesis reaction. Thus, we assume the rate of synthesis of AHL is directly proportional to the concentration of luxI.
2) Diffusion of AHL out of the cell
- Event: AHL (in the cell) $\to$ AHL (outside the cell)             - Rate:$v=r(H(t)-H_{ex}(t))$             - Relevant parameter: $r \Rightarrow$ coefficient of diffusion             Explanation: In reality, diffusion of AHL across the membrane is a relatively complicated process. If we see the diffusion of AHL across cell membrane as simple diffusion, the process can be described using Fick's Law, which assumes that the flux of molecules across a membrane is proportional to the gradient concentration.
$$J=-D\frac{dc}{dx}$$
Approximately, this means the change of number of molecules on one side of the membrane is proportional to the difference of concentration across the membrane. In our model, we assume that the diffusion of AHL across the membrane is fast enough so that we can omit the process in which AHL travels within the membrane. Also, it is assumed that the distribution of AHL in the medium and inside cells can come to a steady state in a very short time, which means the system is generally homogeneous when it comes to AHL distribution. Previous iGEM teams have discussed the details of AHL diffusion in the extracellular medium, and we believe these details prove to play insignificant roles in our prospect so they are not included in the model.
3) Diffusion of AHL into the cell
- Event: AHL (outside the cell) $\to$ AHL (in the cell)
- Rate:$v=pr(H_{ex}(t)-H(t))$
- Relevant parameters: $p \Rightarrow$ coefficient of population density.
Explanation: This process is the reverse version of the previous one. A coefficient of population density is multiplied to the gradient concentration, as the number of bacteria in the system would affect how quickly the external AHL concentration changes.
4) Formation of 3OC6HSL-LuxR Complex
- Reaction: 2*3OC6HSL + 2 LuxR $\to$ 3OC6HSL-LuxR Complex

In order to evaluate the future prospects of our project, it must be analysed from an industrial perspective and compared to the current methods by which the typical L-DOPA supplement treatment is synthesised. Since 1967, L-DOPA supplements have been used for dopamine replacement therapy [1], and they continue to be the standard today. In 2005 the L-DOPA market reached a total sales volume of 250 ton/year, with a market worth of $101 billion [2]. Although our approach produces a fundamentally different product, both treat the same problem and must therefore be considered in comparison for viability as medicines. The key factors for industrial comparison include waste production, efficiency and energy consumption, general safety of reactions, as well as time taken for processes to run to completion. In our analysis we considered all of these aspects.
Current production methods
Figure 1 Summaries of chemical L-DOPA
The industrial processes employed today for the production of L-DOPA are the Hoffmann La-Roche, the Monsanto, the Ajinomoto, and the Sankyo process. The Hoffmann La-Roche, Monsanto and Sankyo processes all are linear, start with vanillin, and through interaction with protected glycine and aldehyde condensation yield a carbon-carbon double bond. Hydrogenation of a double bond in an L-DOPA synthetic precursor produces L-DOPA.
Resolution-based Hoffmann La-Roche synthesis (HRP) was developed in 1960 and is considered a not particularly efficient process, being a linear chain of four reactions (Fig 2). In the first step, Erlenmeyer–Plöchl condensation of vanillin and hippuric acid is followed by phenol acetylation and hydrolysis which gives azlactone (an enamine). In the second step the carbon-carbon double bond is hydrogenated and azlactone is reduced to the corresponding N-benzoyl amino acid. The third step separates the (S)-enantiomer by resolution with half-equivalent (+)-dehydroabietylamine. In the fourth and final step, the (S)-enantiomeric salt is decomposed and deprotected by hydrogen bromide. Even though three steps are highly integrated, the overall yield is low due to the resolution step at 19.2% [1].

ZJU-China,2015,Team:ZJU-China#Practices#Public Promotion#Community Lab_-_-_TEXT.html,"Our lab in March.
During March, we displayed the experiment of fruit DNA extraction to some young children and instructed them to do the experiment by their own. A seminar with some high school teachers and students was held in the museum and a discussion about how to start and get involved into IGEM took place, which partly contributed to the foundation of Hangzhou No.4 High School and Hangzhou No.14 High School iGEM team.
Later in June, we presented an activity especially for high school IGEMers and other students interested in synthetic biology. Dr.Zhang Haoqian, who was the team leader of Peking iGEM 2011 and now a doctor doing research about synthetic biology, was invited to give a speech. The high school IGEMers then got the chance to try an experiment called Rainbow Kit, which is one of the achievements of the University of Alberta iGEM 2009. All students participating in the activity learnt a lot while having great fun.
In August, a carnival of synthetic biology was held in STM with our unique “Poly Cards” game, which taught citizens to know more about synthetic biology and our project.
ZJU-China has a plan to keep going on the construction of our community lab, which counts a lot. It’s a nice try of getting public to know something about real science and technology in such a vivid way based on the community lab built by us. Till now, we’ve got some essential equipment in the lab such as pipettes, clean benches, centrifuge, water bath. We will definitely buy new equipment to fulfill the lab. White board and microwave oven is right on the way while dry block heaters are on our list already.  To promote influence of our community lab, we start to work out more interesting activities for public. Since we’ve got those science equipment, it will be much easier for us to achieve that goal. ZJU-China will go on collaborating with ZJSTM to share science knowledge as well as synthetic biology with citizens.

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!
Best Basic Part Special Prize
To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.
Please note: Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize."

Flow Cytometer Notes
Overnight cultures of CB008+AFRP+GFP diluted ~100x (to a final concentration of OD600 0.5-0.1, Saturated overnight cultures should be OD600 of ~7) in SD complete media, and grown for 3 hours, 1000rpm shaker, 30ºC. Growing in 2mL well plates
Induce with Alpha-factor. Stock is in 3mM. Final concentrations are 0, 1nM, 10nM, 100nM, 1000nM.  Alpha-factor cannot be refrozen, so throw leftover away.
Induce for 90mins, but no longer than 120mins
Transfer 250u of each well into a V-bottom 96-well plate containing 10ul of the fixing chemical Cyclohexamide. (thats 4 ul for every 100ul of culture)  Cyclohexamide stops protein production by inhibiting ribosomes.

Worldwide obesity has nearly doubled since 1980, while in 2008, more than 1.4 billion adults, 20 and older, were overweight.               In particular, many low- and middle-income countries face “double burden” of under-nutrition and obesity. Rates of malnutrition is much higher in low income countries, while there is a greater exposure to high-sugar, high-fat, high-salt foods which are low in cost and nutrients. Such dietary patterns result in low levels of physical strength and sharp increase in childhood obesity with under-nutrition existing side-by-side.
2. In obesity, fatty acids delivered to liver may outpace fatty acid oxidation in hepatocytes, resulting in triglyceride accumulation. Obesity leads to health hazards, including cardiovascular disease - mainly heart disease and stroke, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders, especially osteoarthritis – a highly disabling degenerative disease of the joints, and cancers, such as endometrial, breast and colon cancers.   Combined: http://www.healthcentral.com/common/images/1/19473_13187_5.jpg Cardiovascular: Obesity and other health conditions associated with obesity, including hypertension, insulin resistance, diabetes and hyperlipidemia, are risk factors of cardiovascular disease.  http://www.beltina.org/health-dictionary/obesity-cardiovascular-disease-bmi-table.html Diabetes: Patients with type 2 diabetes are insulin resistant, in which high levels of blood fats, cholesterol and triglyceride levels inhibit cells from absorbing blood sugar needed.  http://www.bubblews.com/news/560642-cause-of-type-2-diabetes Musculoskeletal disorders: Those with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 26.4 had rate of osteoarthritis of the knees 6 times greater than those with a body mass index of less than 23.4. (Ref. J. Rheumatol. 20 (2) 331-5) http://pharmaworlds.com/obesity-a-growing-burden-for-physicians-and-patients/
The fundamental cause of obesity is an energy imbalance between calories consumed and expended. To increase expenditure of fatty acids (calories), HKUST 2013 Team aims to introduce glyoxylate shunt as an artificial futile cycle in HepG2 cell.

SEMI-RATIONAL TARGETED MUTAGENESIS METHOD:
A fully randomized mutagenesis approach certainly allows to englobe every single possible mutation and possibly every single mutation combination but going through such a gigantic library would be time consuming and not very efficient. Furthermore such a library would include a very high number of uninteresting mutants. That is why we decided to target mutations to regions in our protein that were previously identified (Spagnolo et al., 2010) (cf. background ) as playing a role in the hermeticity of the gating portion of the protein.
We not only wanted to create leaky porins but regulable leaky porins and for maximum effectiveness we thought that our mutagenesis design would have to encompass this regulatory objective. As shown by Mathonet et al. (2006), we decided that the easiest way to achieve regulation would be to use the histidine affinity for transition metal ions, such as Ni2+ or Zn2+, and the potential conformational effect the binding of the two together has on folded proteins. Those conformational changes could be a great mean to open and close our gates and thus create a regulatory system. With all this in mind, we decided not only to target certain region but to limit the degeneracy and favor histidine content in those targeted regions.
Two Gating regions were identified by Spagnulo et al. (2010) and we decided to design two primers over each of these regions. One lightly degenerated allowing only the wild type codon, histidine codons and the intermediary codons. The other one, heavily degenerated, includes any codons but STOP codons. We were expecting higher viability of the proteins with the lightly degenerated primers but the heavily degenerated primers create libraries with higher diversity. We thus build a total of four libraries with two oligonucleotides designed over each gating region as shown the figure 2.
Figure 2: Library Construction Model
Our final design represented 65 536 amino acid combination, ranging from the wild type sequence to a sequence including only histidine codons for the lightly degenerated primers and 67 108 864 amino acid combination, ranging again from the wild type sequence to a sequence including only histidine codons for heavily degenerated primers. The figure 3 illustrates the effective design of lightly degenerated primer for our"

The TU Eindhoven team of 2017 has won a golden medal and was nominated for Best New Application!
Overview of generated results
During iGEM we generated many different sorts of results. In the beginning of iGEM we mostly worked on getting the right DNA plasmids, by using different methods, like Gibson assembly and Traditional Cloning. In this period, the most important results included agarose gels and sequencing result (they are presented in ""DNA results"" ). After this period, we had to test the expression of our designed proteins and instead of agarose gels, SDS-PAGE gels became more important. The last period is marked by the ""real"" experiments, where we could finally test if our designed system indeed worked as planned. To get an overview of all the steps we performed in the lab, go see our ""Notebook"" page.
The results of our Proof of Concept can be found here. As iGEM is a broad competition based around synthetic biology, we also did many other things, for example thinking about safety and the future, which are part of ""Human Practices"" . Another important part was making a model of our system. It took a lot of time to start up, but in the end we got to simulate our system ( ""Model Results"" ). During our collaboration with Potsdam we discovered that they had no team member with experience with modeling, so we offered to also model their system, the results can be found below our own results, but also on their WIKI page: ""Potsdam"" ). Additionally, their lack of experience an the time it took for us to start up with the model, inspired us to design a software tool: ""NFsim manual for dummies"" .
Accomplishments in short
Successfully designed, expressed and characterized multivalent constructs that will gelate after an inducer is added.
Modelled the behavior of GUPPI and made a general tool for simulating other constructs with the same principle.
Contacted stakeholders and integrated their input for a safe and useful design of GUPPI.

Survivor selection: Since a hard threshold test of \(X_{\mbox{toxin}}>0\) does not resemble the biological situation sufficiently,                         we implement a soft criterion. The death probability \(p_{\mbox{dead}}(X_{\mbox{toxin}},\theta)\) compares the actual toxin concentration                         to the toxin threshold and allows for fluctuations around the toxin threshold \(\theta\).
Mutation: Given a mutation rate per ODE parameter \(\eta\), the overall mutation rate is computed by \(\eta_{\mbox{overall}}=\eta\cdot\left|k\right|\)                         with \(\left|k\right|\) as the number of parameters used in the ODE model of the kill switch of interest. With a probability of \(\eta_{\mbox{overall}}\),                         a mutation occurs: One ODE parameter \(k_i\) from the set of all parameters \(k\) is chosen randomly. Subsequently, the mutated parameter is                         computed by \(k_i'=mutate(k_i)\) with \(mutate\) modifying \(k_i\) in a way that is motivated by individual binding strengths of proteins on DNA.
Parental selection: The parents who replace the dead individuals are selected proportional to their fitness values [9] . The                         individuals are assigned intervals between 0 and 1 proportional to their fitness. Subsequently, a random process will most                         likely pick the fittest individuals but still does not hinder weaker individuals to be picked.
Transition to next time step: After the mutation process has been performed, taking the last time step’s concentrations \(\vec{X}(t_{i-1})\) and                         time \(t_{i-1}\) as the initial value, the integration of the ODE system is performed. The integration is executed until a steady state                         in all substances’ concentrations is reached: These concentrations are considered as \(\vec{X}(t_{i})\) in time step \(t_{i-1}\). This step is the                         computationally most expensive one. Unit tests verify a successful integration routine.
The algorithm takes various input parameters: The kill switch to simulate, the population size \(N\), the mutation rate per parameter \(\eta\) and the generations in                 incubation \(g\). The major result is the escape probability: The probability that an individual survives a release into wild life even though the kill switch should                 have killed it. Since mutations gradually change the kill"

Aim of the experiment is the preparation of a SDS- page, to make a subsequent western blot and to compare the samples, taken at different expression times.
Operational sequence:
The SDS- gel was prepared as previously described (12%). 20µg protein crude extract of each sample were loaded on the gel. Running- time: ca. 2h at 120V. Additionally to the prestained protein marker, we used an un- prestained marker, which contained a 45 kDa protein. Afterwards, the gel was immediately used for the western blot.

Sequencing of structural genes of Xanthohumol including the promoter
Investigator: Ingmar
Aim of the experiment: Check wheather the gene constructs have mutations in the promoters
Results: The following geneconstructs were sequenced including the promoter:   P194 4Cl- in pYes P263 APT in pYes P197 OMT+ in pYes P198 OMT- in pYes P200 PAL- in pYes P236 PAL+ in pYes All of these sequences did not show any mutation in the promoter. Therefore the fact that our proteins were not detectable might be a result of errors during the transformation. Hence the transformation will be repeated. Parallely our gene constructs will be cloned into a pYes vector backbone of the Limonen group who could successfully express and detect their proteins.

RFP without barcode ( BBa_K2382014 )
This part encodes a RFP that has the same amino acids as BBa_E1010. The barcode of BBa_E1010 is removed, so this part does not contain stop codon. Therefore, future iGEM teams could fuse other protein at the C terminal of this RFP.
Composite Parts
FOR ANTIDOTE
T7 promoter + Thioredoxin-FGD fusion protein ( BBa_K2382005 )
This part contains a T7 promoter and Thioredoxin-FGD fusion protein, and terminators are included. By ligating these two different parts as a fusion protein, it is supposed to raise the solubility of our protein, F420-dependent glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (FGD).
T7 promoter + Thioredoxin-MSMEG_5998 fusion protein ( BBa_K2382006 )
This part contains a T7 promoter and Thioredoxin-MSMEG_5998 fusion protein, and terminators are included. By ligating these two different parts as a fusion protein, it works better than MSMEG_5998 alone.
FOR TEST STRIP
Anti-aflatoxin scFv fusion protein construction DNA sequence ( BBa_K2382010 )
By ligating the constitutive promoter (BBa_J23101), strong ribosome binding site (BBa_B0034) and scFv-EAAAK- RFP-Histag, we were able to detect aflatoxin by the purified protein expressing in E. coli. Moreover, we designed a restriction site, BamHI, between scFv and EAAAK, so future iGEM teams could take advantage of this composite part to fuse their scFv with RFP as indicator, and make their own test strip!"

Central China Conference Conference
In mid-July, our team visited Wuhan, China to participate in the 2018 Central China Regional Exchange iGEM Conference, which was held by HUST, to share our project with other teams. This year, five teams came together to discuss and exchange ideas. We presented our project ideas and the audience gave us some great feedback. During the question and answer section we were asked about some topics that we hadn’t considered, such as the cost of our bacteriocin production. Additionally, we saw some interesting topics presented by other teams, and also made some great friends along the way. Overall this event really helped us prepare a more well-rounded project!

[Slide: Spatial Kappa graph]
MATLAB
[Slide: MATLAB graph]
We also tried MATLAB modelling, but found we couldn't model synergy without knowing the equations to use (which we didn't). Our MATLAB model is of the non-synergistic system only, and uses ordinary differential equations to model the progress of the reaction over time. We found that it works best within certain limits; if allowed to run indefinitely, the results violate the laws of thermodynamics; for example the amount of cellobiose going negative.
Other things
[Slide: Modelling wrap-up]
We also modelled:
Phage replication. We developed a model of phage replication in MATLAB using ODEs, but our project never got to the stage of using phages.
Artificial selection: we showed that it is easier to select for enhanced cellulose degradation if the cellulases remain attached to the cell.
Biology
[Slide: Biology - the question]
The fundamental biology problem we had to solve was how to actually get different types of cellulases close together.
[Slide: Cellulosome]
Nature has evolved a method called a cellulosome, in which various proteins connect to form a scaffold on which the cellulases sit. But such a structure won't work with E. coli due to its Gram-negative double membrane. E. coli has long been the workhorse of synthetic biology, so we wanted a solution compatible with it.
[Slide: Phage display schematic]
Our first thought was to use phage display technology to place several enzymes on an M13 phage. Such a phage would be constructed as follows: fusion proteins would be created containing both a cellulase and a phage protein, and this fusion would integrate into the phage. The phage would then be excreted from the cell.
[Slide: Phage display]
This approach has a number of difficulties, and has not advanced much beyond the theoretical, though we have made preliminary attempts to fuse the phage major coat protein to an amylase gene, using a phagemid vector. If we have more time we will assay this construct for activity and swap it into vector pSB1C3.
[This might change by the time of the final presentation.]
[Slide: Cell display]
A different approach is to place the various enzymes on the cell surface. If they can be placed there at a high enough density, the synergistic effect should appear. Enzymes can be placed on the cell surface using Ice Nucleation Protein (or INP), which seems to automagically transport itself"

1.3 Results
6/26/2015
A re-reading of Briggs et al. indicates that the amount of initiator used was very small. (5 uL of 10 nM initiator)
Our previous experiments used much more initiator (1 uL of 5 uM initiator)
Excess initiator may be interfering with PCR, or binding of pieces, so we decided to repeat ICA testing using reduced initiator.
We decided to test making IABCT with and without caps, and IT using less initiator this time compared to 6/19/205 .
ICA with 5 uL of 10 nM initiator
Used 3x 10 uL of MagnaBind Beads.
washed 2x using 2x BW buffer.
Incubated in a 10 uL reaction containing:
5 uL of 2x BW buffer.
1 uL of 50 nM initiator.
4 uL of ddH2O.
Incubate at RT (~23 C) for 45 min with rotation.
Subsequent steps followed the same protocol as 6/19/2015 with the following modifications:
For one ICA reaction, no caps were used, and were instead substituted with water.
A-caps, however, were used for both IABCT reactions in order to reduce formation of IT construct.
Washes were performed using 100 uL of solution, rather than 15 uL.
Final elution was performed at 95 C for 5 min, rather than 3 min.
PCR Amplification of ICA
Set up 25 uL reactions for each ICA reaction. Used 1 uL of eluate as template.
Same protocol as yesterday .
Modified to anneal for 25 cycles, instead of 20.

Helping other people carry out research for their project
Being our first year in iGem, one of our concerns was that nobody knew us. However, we have received a lot of requests from other teams from other countries to answer their surveys and collaborate with their human practices. We have also helped them to diffuse their surveys to other professionals and students interested in the topic, and even to some secondary education centres with curiosity in synthetic biology and iGem competition in general.
Social networks, crowdfunding campaign and media
From a very beginning, we wanted to make our community part of our project by involving them in our advances and activities. With this aim we created a Facebook page, a Twitter account and a Wordpress blog where we have been posting about our laboratory work and social engagement and advances in general.
Furthermore, we have launched a crowdfunding campaign in platform called Goteo because we loved the kind of projects they hosted in their platform and the philosophy they have. Since then, we have been proven right, they were extremely helpful and gave us personalized attention, reviewing our campaign in detail and giving us incredible insights.
Finally, we had a lot of media exposure. We have been published in several well-known blogs and newspapers. The complete article can be read by clicking the following links:

Giving lectures at the Theatre Freiburg
On the 3rd of July we went to Freiburg to participate at ""RE-ENGINEERING LIFE oder WOLLEN WIR UNENDLICH SEIN?"", an event organized by a group of artists to help the dialogue between science and the interested proceed.
In addition to many informational lectures and events, we were invited to take over the role of scientific experts in a speed-dating like conversation: Many different people with various backgrounds sat down and started a conversation about synthetic biology, our motivations, iGEM, and the big picture behind our actions. It was very interesting to see that people had different approaches to get in touch with synthetic biology and we were surprised that this topic is accepted by a greater percentage of people than recent studies report.
At the end, there was a panel discussion with international professors and the artists about synthetic biology and art, which was the main theme of this event. They, among others, examined the difference between design and art; in which way is the synthetic biologist an artist?
Generally speaking they came to the conclusion that bioengineering is more design than art, because it is 'engineered' and therefore not supposed to depict the things art is supposed to do. However, we left the discussion with mixed feelings about it. For us, bioengineering is a kind of art."

During discussion, we came up with the idea of experimenting with auxotrophic marine yeasts, whose diffusion can be regulated by controlling the amount of nutrition. In the end of the discussion, Prof. Zheng gave credit to our creativity and said he was willing to offer us further help on this project.
After meeting with Prof. Zheng, we gained deeper understandings on microbial silt reinforcement. These new insights strengthened our resolve in employing clearer and healthier material to build the artificial reefs. After information exchanging and discussion in our team meeting, we decided to choose Yarrowia lipolytica as the chassis, which has a preferable survival rate in the marine environment. We will put the strain together with sandy soil into the ocean at fixed point to form artificial reefs. Another benefit of this material is that the carbonate deposition generated by the strain will cause natural death of the strain without introducing new toxic or chemical materials to the environment. It also mitigates the diffusion problem, which is the highlight of our project. After deciding the topic and main direction of our project, our next step is a field trip to artificial reefs.
Visit to Zhejiang Marine Fisheries Research Institute
Before our field practice, we visited Zhejiang Marine Fisheries Research Institute (MFRI) and met Professor Wang Wei Ding, an expert in aquafarm and artificial reefs. He is the scientific advisor for aquafarm construction in Zhejiang province and senior engineer at Zhejiang MFRI.
Zhejiang aquafarm has gained impressive achievement in the past half year and has achieved the goal of preliminary ecological restoration: the artificial fish reef released was full of moss and small amount of fish live in it. CCTV has filmed a documentary series based on Zhejiang aquafarm.

Prof. Wang introduced two sorts of artificial reefs to us. The first one is casted by reinforced concrete with certain shapes of molds. The structure of the molds is essential and studied by many scientists in China now. The second kind of reef is constructed by throwing waste tires and subway carriages in to the ocean. This method is widely applied in America and Japan. Prof. Wang found our idea of building artificial reefs in the way of synthetic biology very interesting. He told us that the effect of waste materials was not satisfactory and massive reinforced concrete consumption also brought lots of trouble in transportation and manufacture. Employing new materials will bring new dynamic to this study. Therefore, he believed that our idea of using microorganism to reinforce sandy soil in the ocean was very"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

Product design
Our ambition since the start of the project was to create an elegant approach that integrates the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb) technology into pre-existing expression systems. We believe that good design constitutes standardization of the internal components, a systematic integration process and flexible customization for the intended final application. This philosophy has been fundamental to us throughout the entire design process.
We believe that many biotechnical processes would benefit in terms of productivity by supplementing with VHb to improve the oxygen utilization. As we explained earlier in design overview, we realized that the main obstacle we would face in realizing this idea is that each expression scenario is unique in terms of oxygen requirements. Different host organisms require different amount of oxygen for their proliferation and production of the recombinant protein. In certain cases, such as high cell density cultivations [1], the oxygen demand is high while vice-versa during fermentation [2] . VHb has been studied in both of these conditions and many more. The results have been significant enough to consider applying the technology at a larger scale [3][4].
However, there exist no practical methodology of integrating the VHb technology into pre-existing systems. On top of this, each expression system has its unique oxygen requirement as mentioned above.
Assembly
All of the constructs come pre-assembled with the VHb gene and a slot for the target protein gene of which the productivity should be improved. By using the collection of Anderson promoters from the iGEM registry, a library of plasmids containing the VHb gene expressed at different levels has been achieved. The user only needs to insert the gene encoding their protein of interest as well as its promoter. See Design for further details of the constructs.
Screening
The different construct are cloned in the organisms of interest using the preferred transformation method of the company and them expressed in small scale (e.g. shake flasks) to verify the success of the transformation through the isolation and quantification of the protein of interest . Later, once all the construct had been successfully cloned and expressed in the organism, they are screened in a bioreactor under the standard conditions of the process to find the optimal promoter strength for the intended application.
Selection
The results of the fermentations are analyzed and the best candidates are chosen based on the product yield and its specific productivity considering that the conditions of the bioreactor resemble the ones used"

Policy and Practices
Working in the CIDAR lab space, our iGEM team quickly became interested in integrating technology with biology. Once we were introduced to the topic of bio-design automation (BDA), we became curious about the current state of the art for BDA. We wanted to know not only if there were workflows for integrating computational tools into wet lab work, but also how much these tools are actually used in the lab. As we began thinking about a project, our leading question became: Can we develop a more integrated BDA workflow that is better than the current state of the art?
Fortunately, we were able to volunteer at a the sixth International Workshop on Bio-Design Automation ( IWBDA ) at the beginning of summer. This was the perfect opportunity to learn about the current state of Bio-Design Automation and identify obstacles to BDA integration. Through conversation with one of the conference's keynote speakers, Professor Orit Shaer, we also became interested in answering the question: Can we integrate Google Glass into that workflow? (Refer to Google Glass section below).
IWBDA
As volunteers, we signed in the workshop speakers and attendants, helped with the posters, and set up the event venue. We were also able to attend the talks and poster presentations. This workshop was an important influencing factor on our project design. It gave us an opportunity to learn about the current research and concerns in the field, which shaped the direction and goals of our project.
One of the keynote speakers, Orit Shaer from Wellesley College, spoke about   Human-Computer Interaction. She focused on tools that use reality-based interfaces   and the considerations necessary for developing these tools. After listening to her   presentation, we had the opportunity to talk with her.

Parents whose children was engaged with our other activities can come and listen. We got great feedback from them. They asked many questions and learned a lot in this section.
Figure 1. we are explaining synthetic biology.
II DNA model building
     In this section, we taught the children to build a paper DNA double-helix model, provided by China Science and Technology Museum. Before starting to make the model, we introduced the knowledge of DNA to let them make sense of what DNA is and what function it has. Children participated in the activity in great passion and enjoyed the process. Everyone involved took home a wonderful model and our exquisite souvenirs.
Figure 2. children are building their DNA models.
III E.coli DIY workshop
     The purpose of this section was to develop ideas of synthetic biology in children’s mind using their imagination. We introduced how the scientists manipulate the gene in microbes to help them solve problems. Then we let the children design bacteria with a possible application using color pens in their hands. In the workshop, we were surprised by children’s creative thoughts from time to time. Some of their fascinating ideas are listed below:
    “My bacteria can produce enormous ozones so that it can repair the damaged ozone layer for us.”
    “My bacteria can absorb PM2.5 and refresh our air without sunlight!”
    “I want to creat a group of bacterium that can sing songs for me when I go to sleep!”
——“I will design a kind of bacteria that can make me sick if I wanted it to…”
——“Why? Because I can stay at home when my friends go to school and have exams.”

IV The war of E.coli
     As we mentioned in our project, we created a game based on liquid and solid culture medium. In this section, we presented our games on iPad. The games attracted a large amount of both children and adult players, who not only enjoyed the game, but also learned the way bacteria talks. What's more, they even give us more possibility in considering spatial effects on results of population interactions. See more at Game Discovery .

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria"
Heidelberg,2015,Team:Heidelberg#Sandbox_-_-_TEXT.html," sense specifically small molecules in biochemical reactions is problem that scientist tried to solve since many years.
In this project we developed an innovative method that can be applied as a tool box, enabling us to sense small molecules in real-time (real-time SMS) using a fluorescent readout at two different emission wavelengths. Using a spinach aptamer fused to an ATP aptamer we can sense ATP concentrations in real-time during a biochemical reaction. Thus we were able to analyze classical in vitro transcriptions in detail by monitoring simultaneously the ATP consumption as well as RNA strand synthesis.
A major achievement of our fluorescent tool-box was the validation of our own implemented JAWS software. ATP Aptamer-stems were successfully predicted which were causing a high turn-on effect of the fluorescence in presence of the small molecule. The ATP AptamerJAWS2 Spinach RNA shows a stronger interaction with ATP resulting in a higher fluorescence maximum than the ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach RNA. However, the tight binding to the small molecule ATP can result in a decreased bioavailability of this NTP for the polymerase. This results in decreased transcription efficiency. Due to this effect we decided to apply the ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach for our fluorescent read-out system. Nevertheless live-cell imaging might benefit from the good binding properties of ATP AptamerJAWS2 Spinach RNA. Imaging of ATP in cells might be also an interesting target to study.
Another important achievement was the monitoring of the change of ATP concentrations during the in vitro transcription. We can show that the concentration of used amount of polymerase changes the final RNA yield. We increased the polymerase concentration and observed low Spinach and high malachite green fluorescence levels. Thus ATP was consumed and RNA was successfully transcribed. In addition we were able to show the influence of different buffer systems, inhibitors and different polymerase. Using this huge amount of generated Data, we were able to model in vitro transcription reactions and to analyze the speed of nucleotide incorporation. By application of our tool-box, a in vitro transcription reaction can be optimized within a few hours. Thus difficult transcription targets can be easily optimized.
Furthermore, we were able to set-up a method to quantify the RNA yields in real-time. Similar to classical colorimetric assays like Bradford, we successfully applied instead of BSA, our Malachite Green Aptamer RNA to generate a calibration curve with a really good correlation coefficient. In addition, the JAWS generated ATP aptamer Spinach can be applied in several other biochemical reactions that depend on ATP. In interesting target would be the Poly(A) polymerase

TP_CC_SanDiego,2016,Team:TP CC SanDiego#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," is generally utilized to secrete degradative enzymes such as chitinase. Additionally, the pBR322 contains inherent ampicillin resistance; as such, by using ampicillin as a selective agent, transformed e. coli was easily isolated and cultured.   In order to break down the chitin in the cell wall of fungus, our team has chosen to utilize E. coli and have them secrete a chitinase that will break down the chitin. Chitinases essentially break down glycosidic bonds in chitin, suggesting that by getting E. coli to secrete chitinases, we can successfully combat fungal infections. The particular chitinase we chose was LbCHI31, an enzyme that is known to be able to degrade the chitin in Fusarium oxysporum. Through transformation, we will introduce a plasmid with the gene that encodes for LbCHI31 into E. coli.
Abstract
Fungi producing harmful mycotoxins flourish on a variety of widely consumed crops, notably bananas, tomatoes, potatoes, and grains. Such fungal infections significantly reduce sustainability and food production in developing countries, where mycotoxin exposure from lack of advanced food storage are responsible for severe economic losses and 40% of diseases. As such, our team developed regulatable plasmids encoding secretable chitinases that hydrolyse the glycosidic bonds of chitin, a key structural polysaccharide in fungal cellular walls. By fusing LbCHI31 and LbCHI32 chitinase genes with a signal sequence from the alkaline phosphatase phoA gene, we successfully generated an Escherichia coli line that secretes chitinase specific to Fusarium oxysporum, a major pathogenic fungi. LbCHI31 and LbCHI32 expression and extracellular secretion were further quantified through characterization and analysis. This project will provide easily accessible, cost-effective methods for producing effective chitinases to combat fungal infections, thereby increasing crop yield, stabilizing financial growth, and reducing famine globally.

Our strategy: The Fec operon
Main | Transduction | Our strategy | Construction
The Fec operon | The trick TCS
Few ABC transporter such as FecABCD (iron transporter) are able to induce a response regardless of the tranlocation, due to the activity of FecA, moreover some mutant can also have a constitutive expression of FecABCD .
The plan would be to use FecA- mutant  receiver and FecA+ mutant donor to transfert the constitutive FecA protein to the receiver. In this case the receiver will express the FecABCD operon without being induce by ferric citrate in the medium , and so we could place under the control of the Fec ABCD promoter, which is called pfec, the gene sequence encoding for the response. For the moment a response that would be easy to detect is the fluorescence of the RFP and the biobrick BBa-J61002 is the perfect candidate to test the system.
We also discovered that some fecR and fecI mutants can be use to amplify the signal because they have a constitutive activity. So we put under the control of pfec a FecR and FecI mutated. When they will be expressed, they will be activators of pfec and consequently of RFP. Normaly we would be able to obtain a increasing fluorescence.
problems : the message is unidirectionnal and unrepeatable. It would just be a proof of principle that a vesicle-mediated controlled communication is possible.

RBS Strength to Translation Rate
Altering the RBS strength of the ribosome binding site in a plasmid, can be completed by altering the genetic makeup of the RBS. This was modeled through the utilization of the RBS Calculator created by Dr. Howard Salis, at Penn State University. Using the forward implementation of the calculator, one input's their protein coding sequence, organism, and target translation initiation rate. The calculator then outputs the RBS sequence required to achieve such a translation initiation rate under the conditions outlined.
Relating Translation Rate to Proteins Produced
Translation Rate to Proteins Produced
Maximum Threshold of Secretion
Is There a Maximum Threshold of Secretion?
Is diffusion the rate limiting step? Do CsgA pile up in the cell?
After 1 second, a spherical particle of radius 10 nanometers, has a displacement of 6.6 micrometers due to Brownian motion in water at room temperature. Determined via;
Assuming this model represents movement of CsgA, diffusion is not the rate limiting step.
Degradation Rate
Degradation Rates
The degradation rate of mRNA is on the order of 2 to 5 minutes.
The average protein half-life is approximately 23 hours.
Therefore, degradation rates do not impact curli protein production, as this would imply most of the curli proteins being degenerated during biofilm formation (which can take days). Given this is not the case, and curli protein are fully present in our biofilm, the degradation rate of curli proteins is negligible.
Anderson Promoter Library
Anderson Promoter Library
The Anderson Promoter Library was utilized by QGEM, given the specific measured promoter strengths, as seen in the table below. By incorporating these known strengths into our ratiometric program (as a factor of transcription rate), QGEM was able to precisely model the outcome ratios of proteins in our biofilm.
The promoters/parts, BBa_J23101 through BBa_J23119, are a family of constitutive promoters - BBa_J23119 being the consensus promoter sequences. Their sequences simply differ in the -35 and -10 consensus regions.
The promoter strengths listed are relative promoter strengths - hence, having units [RPU]. The relative promoter strength of external promoters, those not found in the Anderson Library, can be measured via a procedure found with the RPU Measurement Kit , provided by iGEM. QGEM tried to utilize this measurement kit, creating our own family of T7 promoters. Unfortunately, the T7 promoter failed the test, and no conclusive measurements were obtained"

Do regular PCR with an ordinary polymerase for amplification of the remaining mutated ssDNA. The final product will be a pure sample containing only mutated dsDNA.
Improvement of a BioBrick
Our original idea was to learn the SAMURAI procedure in order to apply it to our laccase, the main part of our project, in a later stage. We knew that we wanted to mutate our laccase based on computational rational enzyme design. While we were working on the modeling, we also started with the production of the native laccase. As the weeks passed we realized that we needed a quick way of introducing our mutations in the laccase gene, otherwise, we would not have time to express, purify and test it. In our search, we came across the recently developed SAMURAI method. This technique suited our needs perfectly since it would solve our problem of inserting multiple mutations with limited time on our hands.
We decided to try out the SAMURAI technique to learn how it works. To do this, we chose to introduce two distantly spaced mutations to an already existing BioBrick, BBa_I13502, designed by the MIT team 2005. This BioBrick consists of a monomeric fluorescent protein (mRF1) gene with a ribosome binding site (RBS). The part is not compatible with assembly standard RFC25 since it includes two AgeI restriction sites, the first at 573 bp and the second at 685 bp.
Figure 1. A map of the the BioBrick BBa_I13502, containing an RBS and an mRFP1 gene. Mutation 1 and 2 show the positions of the point mutations we chose to introduce to make the part compatible with assembly standard RFC25 by removing the two AgeI sites.
To remove the two AgeI sites with SAMURAI, we designed two types of forward primers (one with biotin and one without) and one reverse primer. We also designed two oligos where we introduced our point mutations to remove the AgeI sites: G → A at 576 bp and C → G at 687 bp (Figure 1). We chose these bases since they do not change the amino acid sequence, and therefore should not affect the function of the protein. As we performed the SAMURAI method, we encountered some problems, troubleshooted these and found solutions. Our main"

Beyond the Bench[mark] Initiative: Engage. Educate. Excite!
“There is an inherent need for scientific experiments, labs, or models that go beyond curriculum goals and open up the eyes of a student to the highly engaging, educational, and exciting world that exists out there. It’s the wonder and awe that is missing. It is our duty to bring that back to society.""-Nicole, CMU iGEM 2014
The Platform
Liner's analysis of ""Promoting Scientific Literacy,"" claims that “scientific literacy is primarily a concept about curriculum goals.” All of us in iGEM know better. While scientific literacy is currently based on achieving curriculum goals, CMU iGEM is working on changing that. This summer, we created the Beyond the Bench[mark]initiative as answer to surpassing the current standards we have for the science education in our society. Just getting off the ground, we plan to expand this initiative over the upcoming months, years as a way to encourage current and future iGEM teams to answer this societal problem.
""Beyond the Bench[mark]"" is an initiative to create learning tools, such as models, labs, classroom kits, etc. that fully meet the related state standards or ""benchmarks"" set forth by the board of education. However, the goal of each tool is to supersede these benchmarks by introducing or including another element dedicated to a subject that is not necessarily found in the standards, but can allow for higher learning engagement since it is built on a solid foundation. In this way, new materials that students may not have heard of or know very little accuracy about may be brought to the table without causing a disruption in the classroom curriculum. As of right now, the Carnegie Mellon iGEM Team was determined to go beyond the bench[mark] for students and teachers around the greater Pittsburgh area with one classroom kit and one stochastic model related to synthetic biology and endocrine disruptors. In the autumn season, our initiative focus extended to different cities across the United States and to an orphan"

Fatih-Medical,2012,Team:Fatih-Medical#Survey EN_-_-_TEXT.html,"
The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition, is a worldwide Synthetic Biology competition aimed at undergraduate university students. It is organised by the iGEM Foundation, located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.
iGEM developed out of student projects conducted during MIT's Independent Activities Periods in 2003 and 2004. Later in 2004, a competition with five teams from various schools was held. In 2005, teams from outside the United States took part for the first time. Since then iGEM has continued to grow, with 130 teams entering in 2010.  Within the competition, student teams receive a kit of biological parts at the beginning of the summer from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells.
