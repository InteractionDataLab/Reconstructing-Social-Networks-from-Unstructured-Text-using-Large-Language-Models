A simplified overview of the hemoglobin-based sensor.
roGFP-based sensor
In parralel we planned to develop a separate method of detection, based on a redox state reporter - roGFP protein. A fusion of roGFP with human glutaredoxin is a highly specifc reporter of redox potential of cellular glutathione pool (Gutscher, M. et al.). Considering the fact that conjugation with glutathione (by glutathione S-tranferase) is a key pathway of detoxication following acrylamide exposure, its effect on the redox state of gluthatione pool should be easily observable (Cui, S. et al.).  roGFP is a derivative of GFP with two additional cysteines introduced via site-directed mutagenesis. Depending on the redox state, they can form a disulfide bond. This leads to a shift in excitation maximum. This effect is more reliable than mere decrease in fluorescence and requires only one simple negative control. As the measurements will be conducted in E. coli cells, we designed two fusion proteins roGFP with human glutaredoxin and with E. coli glutaredoxin. Unfortunately, due to delays in our gene synthesis, we were not able to test either of the detection systems in time before wiki freeze.

Gate 1
Detection of AHL
Gate 1 of the alpha system should produce AHL molecules when aTc is present in the bacteria environment. In order to check if our gate works as expected we collaborated with BGU_Israel iGEM team.
The BGU team conducted an AHL detection experiment (Marks R.S.and Kushmaro A., 2011) to help us test the gate.
Positive control:
For a positive control the indicator strain, CV026, was incubated with a synthetic AHL (3-OXO-C6). When this strain senses AHL it changes color to purple. A plate was covered with soft agar containing the indicator strain, and then synthetic AHL was added. After incubation the plates were purple as a response for the high levels of the AHL.
Picture 1. Positive control- soft agar containing the detector strain CV026 after incubation with synthetic AHL
TOP10 bacteria containing gate 1
The TOP10 bacteria containing Gate 1 were spread on LB agar plate and after half an hour the plate was covered by soft agar containing the indicator strain CV026. After incubation, a purple color appeared on the plates.
Although aTc wasn't added to the bacteria, the leakiness of the Ptet promoter enabled sufficient expression of AHL. The results means gate 1 was assembled correctly and functions as expected.

The study trip of our team to the largest and most internationally representative computer expo
This year iGEM Hamburg attended the CeBIT expo in Hannover to establish contacts for possible collaborations with our project. We were invited to attend by the Haspa, a german savings bank.
More than 200.000 people attended more than 2000 exhibition booths presenting their technological advances, machines and instruments, concentrating on digitalization and robotics. One of the main topics covered was d!conomy, which was focusing on digital security, communication & networks, also showing developments in consumer electronics as well as data analytics & AI.
Also research and innovation were centred around d!tec, exhibiting new technologies in future mobility, like exoskeletons and drones, also concentrating on AI robotics and virtual reality. We also found a booth with microbiologists, who developed electronic devices to facilitate gene decoding of up to 24 samples at the same time. Scale11, as a part of d!tec gave multiple new and fresh kickstarter projects the opportunity and platform to present themselves and their project to a broad spectrum of people.
During multiple podium discussions of d!talk, many pioneers and unconventional thinkers from all over the world featured the themes of digital trends in a compact, captivating program.
Another part of the CeBIT was the d!campus, where emotion meets technology. It features a platform for getting together and networking, as well as a stage for experiences and showcases.
Before it was time to leave we were able to have a couple of words with her about a possibility to support iGEM in Hamburg and how to potentially mingle the aims of their projects with ours.
Lectuere series about antibiotic resistances
The importance of antibiotic resistances was also emphasised by the Chemistry Department of our university that organised a lecture series about this topic. During the previous semester, everyone interested was invited to listen to lectures which focused on different aspects of antibiotic resistances on a weekly basis.
Of course we used this chance to pick up some background information and new ideas, get in touch with scientists working in this field and hit them with questions related to our project.
This was the first time we met Prof. Dr.  Peter Heisig and his wife Dr. Anke Heisig who later became our instructors when they gave a general introduction to resistance mechanisms and a lecture on next generation sequencing.
But they were not the only people we met there who provided us with further information and help: Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Streit gave a talk about Pseudomonas aeroginosa which is our target organism, Prof. Dr. Holger"

Electroporation or electropermeabilisation is a significant increase in the electrical conductivity and permeability of cell plasma membrane caused by externally applied electrical field. It is usually used in molecular biology as a way of introducing specific substance into a cell, such as loading it with a molecular probe, a drug that can change the cell's function, or, as in our case, a piece of coding DNA. Pores in the cell wall are produced when the voltage across the membrane exceeds its dielectric strength. If the strength of the applied electrical field and/or duration of exposure to it are properly chosen, there will be no permanent damage to the cell - the pores will close upon a period of time, while the molecules will have enough time to enter the cell. If a cell is exposed too often or too strongly to electrical field, it can result in apoptosis or necrosis.
 
DNA constructs were isolated using Mobius 1000 Ultra plasmid isolation kit (Novagen), diluted in sterile PBS at the final concentration of 1 mg/ml. All constructs were applied subcutaneously (50 µl) using a  thin needle 29G (Myector, Terumo Japan). Some constructs (c, e) were also applied intramuscularly to the right leg  muscle (musculus tibialis cranialis), to which 20 µl of the DNA solution was injected. Mice were anaesthetized by isoflourane- nitrous oxide and oxygen inhalation. First, the hair was removed from the area of application. Two parallel electrodes made of stainless steel (30mmx10mm, 6mm distance, IGEA, Carpi, Italy) were placed to the area of DNA vaccine injections and electric pulses were triggered using the Cliniporator (IGEA, Carpi, Italy). Subcutaneous electroporation was performed using a pulse of  600 V/cm, 100 ms followed by a pulse of  84 V/cm 400 ms, 1 Hz. Between the pulses there was 500 ms pause. Intramuscular electroporation was performed by a pulse of 360 V/cm, 100 ms followed by 4 pulses of  48 V/cm, "

During the winter vacation, Team leaders Gopinath and Karthik circulated an email outlining what iGEM is and called for a session for interested candidates.
Jan 2017
First,iGEM meeting was held outlining the core essentials of iGEM.
Feb 2017
The team was finalised; Sandeep and Richa joined as advisors to the team. Started ideating on a new project. Came up with about five to six different ideas which were thoroughly discussed for their merits and demerits.
March 2017
Decided on the idea to base our project on Microbial ElectroSynthesis(MES) a pathway to produce biofuel from electricity. Started working on the requirements. Split into groups working on different aspects of the project, viz. Microbiology, Molecular biology, and MES.
April 2017
Continued to work on the MES project. Work temporarily stalled due to end semester examinations.Faidh, Aditya, Kushal, Gopinath and Vinayak decide to stay back for the summer to work on the project. Break for the summer vacations.
May 2017
Many difficulties were encountered because of working on an unconventional chassis. Well established protocols were hard to come by and whatever we did find was not well characterized at all. Ordered the strain. Met Sidhyansh Saxena, a senior in our department and a student entrepreneur to talk about the possibility of corporate funding. Met professor G.Suraishkumar, who works with biofuels to talk about the reactor requirements.
June 2017
The strain did not arrive for a month and a half. When it did arrive, we had more problems, including being unable to grow the organism and not being able to find a suitable vector for transformation. Decided to keep trying to work on it for another two months. iGEM Indian Institute of Science(IISc) sent the protocol for their collab. Started working on it Srinath joined us as the thirteenth member of our team.
July 2017

Sarah and Grant performed a PCR purification using Qiagen’s PCR purification kit; however, the resulting DNA was of low concentration(20 ng/ul for ECphy and 25 ng/ul for ECClc)
Prof. Mordaq suggested to continue with digesting the DNA despite the low concentrations of DNA. However, he also suggested to do another round of PCR just in case.
Thursday
The PCR products from last night’s redo of ECPhy and ECClc was ran on a gel
The PCR products had small bands of nucleotides and primers, but were otherwise at the correct position on the gel
The digested products from the original PCR were isolated well and were pure. The bands lined up at the correct nucleotide positions

LovTAP
Results
We tested the LovTap construct with RFP as an output. Light activated LovTap is supposed to act as a repressor at the Trp operator and therefore we would expect a reduction of the RFP signal. Measurements with the plate reader lead to confusing results, therefore we switch to single cell analysis with FACS. The results show a decrease of RFP the first 5 hours, which might be due to the inoculation and RFP maturation.
If we compare the signal strength of the negative control: reporter only, in the two different conditions, light and no light, we are not expecting a decrease of RFP. The decrease of RFP shown in Fig is a result of bleaching the RFP. Also for the LovTap construct we see a different output between the two conditions, but this is most probably also due to bleaching.
Plans
Since we are not able to get reliable results due to bleaching, we are switching our read-out system so that we will have a Galactosidase as an output. As a next step we will measure the LovTap construct in the same conditions using a Miller assay.  Also an important change we would like to make is to invert the signal output, which means that we are not repressing our output with blue light but activating it instead. (see constructs) We are working on cloning this construct and will test it soon.

In the simulation we can clearly see this series of events:

when dark blue(ribokey) starts to decrease, red (T7) also starts to decrease, but much slower. The lactonase also starts to decrease, as it should be.
The short lifetime of the ribokey compared to the lifetime of the T7-protein, guarantees that the AND-GATE always works perfectly fine: when there's"

Common problems are the limited use outside of a gene laboratory due to the use of genetically engineered cells, the low durability because of the usage of living cells and the appearance of undesired signals induced by endogenous metabolic pathways.
To solve these problems, the iGEM-Team Bielefeld 2011 aims to develope a cell-free bisphenol A (BPA) biosensor based on a coupled enzyme reaction fused to S-layer proteins for everyday use. Bisphenol A is a supposedly harmful substance which is used in the production of polycarbonate. To detect BPA it is degraded by a fusion protein under formation of NAD+ which is detected by an NAD+-dependent enzymatic reaction with a molecular beacon. Both enzymes are fused to S-layer proteins which build up well-defined nanosurfaces and are attached to the surface of beads. By providing these nanobiotechnological building blocks the system is expandable to other applications.""
Our approach is a cell free biosensor. One advantage is that no living organisms need to be used outside the lab for the application of our system. We want to provide S-layers as nanobiotechnological building blocks for cell free biosensors. By fusing different enzymes to these proteins, a variety of biosensors can be build. Further cell free applications are possible and we think that when more projects are focusing on cell free systems this is also a contribution to more safety and security. All GMOs can stay in the lab, therefore are grown under controlled conditions and only qualified personnel has access to them.

Double Click
We’re inspired by double-click of computer’s mouse. It doesn’t react to the first click but does react when it is accompanied by the second one. This is one of the most accepted, familiarized, and proven mechanism to diminish the erroneous operation. This fail-safe technology should find various uses also in biotechnology.

Carotenoids
Background Design Characterisation Datasheet Reference
Background
Carotenoids are organic pigments naturally present in plants, algae and some bacteria. There are more than 600 carotenoids, which can be categorised into xanthophylls (hydrocarbons containing oxygen element) and carotenes (hydrocarbons containing no oxygen). Carotenoids perform a range of functions, including light energy absorption, protection against photo-damage, acting as antioxidants, and as precursor to other organic compounds. In human, for example, beta-carotene is the precursor to vitamin A.
Biochemical pathway of carotenoid synthesis
The common starting point for carotenoid synthesis is farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), which derives from two precursors, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). In general, there are two pathways for synthesising IPP and DMAPP: the Mevalonate Pathway (starting with acetyl CoA) and the Non-mevalonate Pathway (starting with pyruvate and glyceradehyde-3-phosphate). While the Mevalonate Pathway is present in all higher eukaryotes, the Non-mevalonate Pathway is present in E.coli.
Mevalonate Pathway (image adopted from Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mevalonate_pathway )
Non-mevalonate Pathway (image adopted from Yuan et al. 2006)
After IPP and DMAPP go on to form FPP, a series of enzymatic reactions convert the colourless FPP to coloured compounds: red lycopene and orange β-carotene.

Prof. Juliana Chan
Introduction
Professor Juliana Chan is a professor of medicine and therapeutics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). She is also director of the Hong Kong Institute of Diabetes and Obesity, CUHK, co-director of CUHK-Prince of Wales Hospital International Diabetes Federation Centre of Education (IDFCE), and chief executive officer of the Asia Diabetes Foundation. With extensive knowledge on diabetes, obesity and clinical practice, Prof. Chan brought to our attention practical aspects of developing treatments for medical purposes. Meeting Prof. Chan helped us to understand more about the biochemistry of diabetes. Also, by giving us information on current treatments for obesity and diabetes, she allowed us to consider our work in context. Towards the end of the interview, we also talked about the regulations for the development of new treatments in medical fields.
Main Discussion
Professor Chan thought that our project was interesting because she has been keen to solve problems related to obesity and diabetes. She mentioned that obesity is a disease that many people disregard, but that has great potential to cause complications such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. As more studies related to obesity are done, it seems like the cause of obesity is more than unbalanced lifestyle and diet. Professor Chan said that the underlying reason of obesity could be genetics and/or epigenetics.
In the case of diabetes, dysfunctional proteins from the deficient genes and high levels of free fatty acid could provide a stressful environment for the beta cells of the pancreas that produce insulin. Prof. Chan explained that this kind of stress on beta cells can cause insulin resistance and ultimately lead to type II diabetes. We have investigated if our project could alleviate diabetes. Prof. Chan mentioned that our project could definitely help to reduce the stress on the beta cells by decreasing the amount of free fatty acid and ultimately alleviating diabetes. She, however, acknowledged that in the long run, our project itself"

In addition, we have added an AntiMicrobial peptide to insure that all bacteria and infection that is potentially in the wound is sterilized. We have deployed the AMP LL-37 which punctures the outer membrane of bacterial cells causing their organelles to become exposed, ending in the cells dying. We have paired the AMP with a thrombin cleavage site that when introduced to the venom serine protease Cerastotin from our original construct, will cut the AMP that is bound to Factor XIIIa at the thrombin site, and at that moment become a functional protein that sterilizes the wound."

In the media, we are used to seeing TV adverts of people in developing countries being forced to choose between drinking unsanitary water or dehydration. These adverts often contain a message along the lines of 'every drop could kill'; what is it precisely that's making this water so dangerous? Disease-causing bacteria. And that's where we decided to come in:
We chose to focus on the diseases cholera and Shigellosis - two of the main culprits contributing to unclean drinking water related fatalities - due to the sheer scale of deaths they cause per year and as neither has an affordable, readily available cure for affected people in developing countries. Their respective bacteria (Vibrio cholerae for Cholera, Shigella for Shigellosis) are also similar both to each other and to the bacterium we chose as a model, E. coli, meaning they were a perfect fit for our project.
Ultimately, our final product developed into what is mainly a preventative method; it stops Vibrio cholerae and Shigella from becoming virulent, and so renders them harmless.
We have achieved this by utilising the natural process of RNA interference (RNAi). For this, we have designed, constructed and/or characterised a number of different basic and composite parts which would work together to effectively inhibit the virulence of our target bacteria.
More about our target conditions...
Cholera
Cholera is a bacterial infection of the small intestine caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which enters the body via ingestion of contaminated food or water. Without proper treatment, severe dehydration and even death can occur within hours due to the infection's three main symptoms of vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea.
Cholera infects around 3-5 million people worldwide and causes around 58,000-130,000 deaths per year.
Shigellosis
Shigellosis is caused by the bacteria belonging to the genus Shigella. It is another food and waterborne illness, which rarely occurs in any animals apart from humans. It is frequently found in water sources that are contaminated with human faeces, and is a major"

June
Week 1
Week 1 in the Manchester iGEM house... Exams are over and we’ve officially started full-time work on the project! At the start of the week we had a big group meeting, complete with instructors and advisors, and were presented with our very own pins and stickers set. The pins quickly vanished, but we held on to the stickers for an Outreach activity we have in the pipeline (more on that on the Outreach page!). We took advantage of the rare sunshine and had our first (almost) group photo taken, to go in an article in the uni newsletter (and to also reveal what Team Manchester looks like to the rest of the world). We were introduced to our beautiful lab space, and are all really eager to get our hands/gloves dirty!
The wiki designers have begun tweaking the page to make it a little more presentable for the masses and, apart from a little accident where Ali’s face was pasted over everyone else’s on the Team page, it’s going quite swimmingly!
After quickly realising that biology is SO COMPLEX, the main bulk of the team began an intensive literature search, looking for anything and everything that may be of use to us in the following weeks. We’ve located a BioBrick that we would really love to use and attempt to improve, but are having doubts about whether or not it is available for us to order. Hope so, or it’s back to square one! Fingers crossed.
Preliminary modelling research has also begun. None of the team has firsthand experience of modelling biology, so this should be interesting. We’re currently scouring the internet and some 1970s handbooks in search of kinetic information for the enzymes involved in prokaryotic fatty acid biosynthesis. One small step for man and all that. Wish us luck!

HeLEX - Centre for Health, Law and Emerging Technologies
Introduction:
HeLEX specialises in investigating the relationships between law, ethics and practice in the area of emerging technologies in health. We initially spoke with Dr Michael Morrison who is the Principal Investigator in biomodifying technologies at HeLEX. He is interested in the application of insights and perspectives from Science and Technology Studies (STS) and medical sociology to the study of novel and emerging biotechnologies. We had an email conversation with him throughout the summer and met with him in person twice to have more detailed discussions. He also introduced us to Dr Louise Bezuidenhout from InSIS.
Cell Free:
In our meeting with Dr Michael Morrison we outlined our project in order to gain his insight on important things to think about regarding law, ethics and safety. As we had been considered a cell-free device we decided to ask for Michael’s thoughts on this. He said that a cell-free device solves a lot of the current problems in emerging synthetic biology technologies. One of these issues is that there are different regulations and laws in this area in bordering countries and so containment can be a real problem especially with living organisms, however cell-free would solve this.
When talking about our diagnostic, Michael mentioned whether there was any regulations surrounding the use of cell-free systems in the field. After this meeting we went away and researched this area and were not very fruitful in our results. We then went back to him a few weeks later for more discussions and he said how regulations can often support innovation as they give a clear cut way of for scientists to know what they have to do in order for their research to get to market. Both of these meetings with Michael and further research led us to decide to create some kind of report on the regulations surrounding cell-free technology. This can be seen by following the link below.
Applied Design:
The target area being in Latin America could introduce problems around delivery and different lab resources. Michael advised us on how our device should ideally not require specialist equipment as that would limit its use in more rural areas (which may in fact be more in need of this technology). And also the elimination of the cold chain is a good advantage of cell free technology, in decreasing the price and allowing for more realistic conditions.
This led us to thinking about the medical infrastructure in these countries and how we would have to think about this for our final design. This comes into the portability of our"

We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.

Education and Public Engagement
This year, our team wanted to truly diversify our outreach programs and engage with more members of our community As a result, we first developed a comprehensive methodology that deconstructed the key aspects of a successful public engagement activity. Following that, we built our outreach plan and followed it all the way through. Our team wanted to dissect what helps distinguish an effective public engagement activity. For that, our team analyzed many projects from the last several years and also reflected on our personal intuition about how to engage with scientists and non-scientists. We also wanted to communicate our findings to other iGEM teams in the future, and hope that they can build upon this foundation.
People
Engaging with a specific demographic or subset of the population: Our team found that the most effective outreach happens when teams focused their energies on specific subsets of populations and designed activities tailored to their preferences or methods of learning.
Design and Dialogue
Informed design of the activity: after identifying a specific segment, it is important to interact with this community of individuals; having an ear to the ground can be exceedingly helpful in the subtle nuances of designing your activity because you and your team can get a better understanding. From the outset, our team believed that interest in synthetic biology and the science behind it is not a one-time spark, but rather a continuous interest that must be maintained. We wanted to clearly communicate our vision and maximize our impact.
Reflection
Public engagement is supposed to be two-sided; instead of talking at people, it was important to us that we talk with them. One of our team’s collective favorite parts were seeing our personal growth through each activity, whether that be in our technical knowledge or our communication style. Too many times, activities are just a one-time thing, but our team wanted to ensure continuity and sustainability of our actions.
With these principles in mind, our team wanted to maximize our impact and reach out to as many different target groups as possible. To accomplish this, our team performed the following activities:
Wrote a 200-page textbook about relevant topics in synthetic biology and are working to implement it globally (in Nigeria) as well as California

It is because these two countries already have relatively higher percentage of participation in the competition. Also, in Korea and Hong Kong, the number of new universities being established is lower than that of China. This may explain why the increase in participation from Chinese universities is most rapid.   The ratio for Hong Kong is significantly higher than other countries because Hong Kong is a city. Comparing Hong Kong with other countries might not be conclusive. Of the four East Asian countries that we have researched, Japan has the highest ratio of participation. This also correlates with the fact that the highest number of SynBio Map entry was in Japan. These two indicators suggest that Japan is the leading East Asian country in synthetic biology.
Synthetic Biology Regulation in East Asia
In general, countries/regions in East Asia do not have specific regulations that address bio-safety issues regarding synthetic biology. They instead enforce pre-existing guidelines that were originally formulated for the regulation of genetically engineered and genetically modified organisms. These regulations were developed in the early or mid-2000s. Experts in Korea, Japan, and China argue that new specific regulations for synthetic biology is necessary for the safe development of the field in these countries.
Currently, no countries in this region have proposed initiating the development of such regulations. This may be due to the fact that in 2010, the United States, a leading country in synthetic biology, announced that new regulation or modification of existing regulations that govern synthetic biology is not necessary. The Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues of the United States explained that instead of coming up with stringent regulation, they will “choose a middle course” to maximize the potential benefit of synthetic biology. It instead recommended self-regulation by synthetic biologists (Wadman, 2010).
The following table summarizes the current regulation imposed on synthetic biology activities in East Asian countries and the United States.
Many people and organizations are worried about this loose regulation of synthetic biology. Over 100 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have called for greater international supervision of synthetic biology. They worry that synthesized organisms could have unforeseeable risks for human health and the environment. Friends of the Earth, an environmental organization, even came up with The Principles for the Oversight of Synthetic Biology which outlines how synthetic biology should be regulated (Hoffman, 2012).

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!

In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point

The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice"

We initiated a collaboration with TU-Delft team in order to compare the efficiency of our two approaches and determine if the overproduction of curli is the best strategy to optimize the adhesion of E. coli strains.
Collaborations with Osaka and NYC teams should be considered to optimize the radioactive cobalt bioremediation of our ""Cobalt Buster"" strain.
To go further, outside the context of electronuclear pattern, we considered a wider use of the biofilter. The system could involve a large variety of bioremediation strains, each optimized for the capture of one metal and why not other pollutants (hydrocarbons, antibiotics...). These strains could be associated in a complex biofilm to create a broad-spectrum biofilter, as shown in the following video !

To go Further :
Economic analysis of the electronuclear pattern
The electronuclear pattern
Because of the implied technologies, ways and the potential risks, nuclear and electronuclear pattern are strategic fields. There are four sectors :
The Upstream aims to supply centrals in nuclear fuel. It groups together several links : mines (mining exploration and natural uranium extraction), chemistry (purification and conversion of uranium to uranium hexafluorure), enrichment (augmentation of isotope U235 content from 0,7% to 3-5%).
The Construction put together conception, studies and engineering for each project of central, fabrication of components, installation and starting of centrals.
The operators of Exploitation are cautious about the well functioning of centrals daily, and calibrate the power of  reactor according to the needs of electric network. Maintenance includes activities necessary for upkeep, modernization and extension of the lifetime of nuclear centrals. The outages are important points of this activity: indeed reactors are stopped sometimes during several weeks to refill  in fuel and large-scale maintenance operations.
The Downstream of the pattern is divided in two different activities: used fuel (recycling in MOX for a reuse), and life-ending of nuclear installations (dismantling, redevelopment of areas).
Because of the huge financial and technological means needed for the development of a business in the electronuclear field, threat of new competitors (new businesses incoming into the market) is low. Consequently, just a few large groups share the four lines of business"

AlkR, when coupled with an appropriate alkane, activates transcription from pAlkM. Experiments in Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 suggest AlkR is responsive to alkanes from heptane to octadecane. [1]
AlkR/pAlkM system has been shown to be capable of creating a biosensor in Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1.[2] There are, however conflicting results for utilizing this system in E.Coli. Wu et. Al. reports that this system is unusable is E.Coli, even when AlkR is successfully produced. [3] Tianjin 2013 iGEM reports an opposite result. Their AlkR-PAlkM based alkane sensor assembled in pSB1C3 output a nearly 2-fold signal when induced with 10mM Octane. So we decided to try this system ourselves and if functional, characterize it.
HxlR
In previous researches, it is shown that the patients having prostate cancer have higher formaldehyde concentration in their urine samples compared to healthy people. [4] The designed construct aims to get a correlated GFP signal with formaldehyde concentration.
In this construct, HxlR transcription factor from Bacillus subtilis which belongs to the DUF24 protein family and the promoter pFor are utilized. HxlAB operon is characterized from Bacillus subtilis and it regulates formaldehyde metabolism. In this construct, HxlR is the DNA binding protein which acts as a transcription factor and it regulates the formaldehyde operon.. Hence, it is known that in the presence of formaldehyde, the operon is active. Although the mechanism of the activation is not well known, it is suspected that formaldehyde leads conformational change in HxlR protein which promotes its activation. Thus, active HxlR protein can bind the upstream  of pFor promoter and activate the HxlAB operon. [5]
HxlR/pFor system is produced in order to create a formaldehyde biosensor in E.coli. This biosensor aims to detect elevated formaldehyde concentration in prostate cancer patients.

Mycobacterium smegmatis strain MC2 155 and Mycobacterium goodii strain 12523 use propane and acetone as carbon sources. These molecules are used in the metabolism due to mimABCD gene clusters playing role in the oxidation of propane and acetone. [6]

During my 2 years’ journey in the nano world, I got to know iGEM and joined in USTC Software team with great honor. Just as NEW YORK TIMES says, iGEM is a Do-It-Yourself Genetic Engineering Program. I am strongly attracted by this idea and cannot help imaging the science fiction picture where our daily life is changed by our genetic machine. It is unforgettable to have a brainstorm with talents from different academic background and turn our imagines into reality. Thanks to iGEM, I experienced a new trip in the synthetic biology and benefited a lot from my partners. Also, to compete against more than 1,000 other students from 100 schools, including many top-flight institutions is exciting.
I love traveling and always enjoy trips with my friends. I have a dream that one day I can travel around the world to discover the great scenery make new friends and experience different culture. Sports is also my favorite, I am good at playing football and gifted in table tennis.

Overview
Precisely controling the mechanical stress applied on cells is an important key to open the door to explore the mechanism of cells' sensation to sound vibration. However, the current research methods used for mechanically activate cells are not pay much concern on the magnitude of mechanical stress. Here we designed a microfluidic chip to quantitatively tune the shear force exerted on cell membrane, and both channel are responsive to such mechical stress. Surprisingly, we discovered that Piezo1-expression CHO cell response to shear force in an biphasic manner and a maximum responsive of ~0.1 pa, which haven't found similar report in the past.  We also examined the intracellular calcium response to various combination of frequency and intensity of sound, including both the audible and ultrsound range. We discovered that Piezo1-expression CHO cell can sense the sound that above 15kHz, which indicate the previous identified touching sensing Piezo1 channel could detect sound wave of particular frequency range.
1.  Biphasic Response of Piezo1 Channel
Fig.1 Optimal range of shear response
We found that Piezo1 channel exhibits two properties: high sensitivity at 0.1Pa, and biphasic response. To the best of our knowledge, both are novel discoveries.
2.  Acoustic Stimulation
Fig.2A Optimal range of frequency response.
Fig.2B the sensible range of Piezo1 channel in the audible range
We found that Piezo1 channel can sense acoustic wave from ultrasound to the margin of human audible range. Best response is at 20kHz when using piezo buzzer as sound generator. In microfluidics, the shear stress， about 0.1 pa, apply on cell is continuously dragging Piezo1 channel to open it, however, the mechanism to stop it in higher shear stress is remains unknown. While in acoustic stimulation, the pressure generated by our designed sound wave oscillation is bigger than "

Selection of the project
In order to make a chance to reach the iGEM competition finals, we have to choose an impressing project! To be inventive, it is important to know what is renewing within the field of synthetic biology and within the iGEM competition. Therefore, we regarded all projects of previous years and discussed the most remarkable projects during several group meetings. Furthermore, all new and interesting articles of the 'Science' and 'Nature' journals have been read.
To stimulate the creativity within the group, we held a brainstorm session. We came up with a great variety of topics, from bacterial anti-aging cream to oil detecting bacteria and from bio batteries to anti-hangover medicines. Of all these subjects, the most interesting and most significant topics were chosen to be elaborated. After extensive research and decision making, we presented our four remaining topics to our supervisors:
Bacterial CSI
Facebook
Tumortargeting
TV Screen
Together we considered the possibilities and limitations of the knowledge and technical and biological requirements of the Eindhoven University of Technology. Because of many uncertainties, ethical problems and the lack of guarantees for results, we ended up with our final topic: building a television screen using genetically engineered yeast cells!
Let’s start!
So finally we decided on our project... Yet it’s time to start our biggest challenge in science! Before the first week of the summer, the project of the iGEM team of Valencia in 2009 was our basic guideline. We did not only read their wiki, but also considered their outlook, tips and bibliography.
We discovered their use of a model of sympathetic ganglion 'B' type cells of a bullfrog"

Introduction: Helping the Melbourne team by creating models for their star peptide
The degradation pathway of DCM by DcmA produces a number of intermediates. Some of these, such as formaldehyde, are suspected to be toxic to our host bacteria above certain concentrations. Alongside using microcompartments for our project, we have also collaborated with UniMelb iGEM and considered attaching our different enzymes to the arms of a star peptide (https://2014.igem.org/Team:Melbourne) . Doing so would increase the likelihood that the reaction product of the first enzyme encounters the second enzyme in the pathway rapidly due to their proximity, therefore preventing the buildup of metabolic intermediates.
Our reaction
Our reaction
Our reaction pathway is as follows:
Reaction 1: DCM + DcmA --> toxic intermediate (formaldehyde)
Reaction 2: toxic intermediate (formaldehyde) + FdhA --> neutral product (formate)
The Melbourne star peptide length can be varied in order to control the rate of reaction. Melbourne, however, were unsure of the form of the relationship between these length and rate and asked Oxford to develop a model of this. We hypothesized that, broadly speaking, the effect of increasing the length of the tether would result in a decrease in reaction rate due to two factors- the increased time taken to diffuse from one enzyme to the other and the decreased likelihood of colliding with an enzyme as the distance of diffusion increases.
A visualization of the star peptide- the key variable is the distance between the active sites of the two key enzymes. We were asked to propose a relationship between this distance and reaction rate.
The star peptide model
The model
The star peptide- building the model
To isolate the effect of increased diffusion time, our simulation released 100 molecules from the same starting point and tracked their motion through stochastically driven diffusion. It then tracked the time required for 50 of these molecules to reach radii of varying length.
This is again based on another implicit assumption – that a collision between an enzyme and a substrate is a necessary but not sufficient condition for reaction to occur. Therefore, we have assumed that reaction rate is proportional, but not equal to, collision rate. As such, we cannot state the exact reaction rate and have normalized our data so that our highest data point takes a value 1 and"

The LacI induced promoter ( BBa_J04500 ) was induced with 0.8mM IPTG for four hours at 0.6OD for the cultures. The protein was either not expressed or was too difficult to distinguish from the background proteins in the cell. Protein trials will be repeated once we assemble BBa_K1189018 in iGEM’s pSB1C3.
Also continued on with the ABTS kinetics experiments. We were able to create graphs showing the effectiveness of our catalyst under varying pH (Figure 6).
Figure 7. pH optimization of Prussian blue ferritin with ABTS. Data is presented as a relative activity based on the highest activity seen during the experiment. Absorbance readings were taken at 415 nm to detect the colourimetric change in a 242 uL solution. Standard error of the mean bars are based of a sample size where n=8.
Week 16: August 12 - August 16
Finished off the ABTS kinetics experiments for Prussian blue ferritin, which involved finding the optimal temperature for the reaction. But the spectrophotometer available to us is limited to 25-45C. This limitation is still within our expected prototype temperature and therefore it is not a big worry. We will then continue on with determining the kinetics for TMB and find out which substrate is better for our system.
Week 17: August 19 - August 23
Due to multiple failures of the plasmid switches of both ferritin and other parts, we conducted tests on multiple aspects of our procedures, including ligase, phosphatase and buffer. None of these parts were determined to be problematic, therefore we attempted higher DNA concentrations on controls, which worked. Therefore we will attempt the plasmid switch of the ferritin parts at some other time.
We also began initial tests with TMB, but realized our stock concentrations were at 1mg/mL. As these results would be incomparable to our ABTS experiments, which were at 10mg/mL, we remade the TMB stock solution to 10mg/mL and redid the experiments.
Week 18: August 26 - August 30
Our first attempts at observing one of our fusion proteins on SDS-PAGE were conducted, although the bands do not appear to contain the protein, which may be due to a large amount of background or low expression of our desired protein. We’ve read about a technique that can stain iron, which is essentially the same as the creation of Prussian Blue ferritin"

Week 1
Monday June 18th
Today was the first day of out iGEM team officially meeting in the summer. We got a look around the laboratory space we would be using, and since almost everyone on the team is new to iGEM, we went over the things we had to accomplish over summer. We rehydrated some parts from the distribution kits to get practice, and those parts were: J23101 E0240 E0040 R0010 pSB1C3 pSB1A3 pSB1AK3 pSB1K3 B0034 I13602
These parts were later transformed into the E. Coli strain DH5α.  We cultured 4 parts from the glycerol stocks for more practice. The parts were: J45120, which emits a wintergreen scent. This was done in 2mM salicylic acid. J45200, which emits a banana scent, respectively done in 5mM isoamyl alcohol. R0010, as a promoter E0240, or more commonly known as GFP! Our team took time to discuss our project, and comparing our interest with the research that has been conducted thus far, we narrowed our project down to three ideas:
1. Producing spider silk proteins in bacteria.
2. Degrading plastics in bacteria.
3. Creating an Archaea toolkit and using them for bioplastic, biofuel, and isoprenoid production.
We realized that more research had to be done to understand what each project specifically requires to judge how feasible and successful it could be.

Ithaca Sciencenter’s “Building with Biology”: This year we volunteered at a Sciencenter event which is part of a series of Building with Biology pilot events being held at 8 science centers across the U.S. iGEM team members helped carry out various activities related to science experiments that were designed to educate visitors of all ages at this event. All the activities were developed by 12 science centers and museums in partnership with scientists (universities, AAAS, Synberc, BioBuilder). We taught kids how to spread plates, demonstrated the possibilities of 3D printing, and simulated rearranging genes with legos. Next year, a kit of activities (selected from this year's materials) will be sent to 200 sites across the country. In fact, the 2015 iGEM competition in late September will showcase the activities.
Public Awareness
PSP Panel:  Following the PSP lab tour of the iGEM space, we participated in a large panel where PSP students could ask questions about joining research on campus. Not only did we discuss with students the benefits of engaging in synthetic biology research at Cornell, but we also strived to spark discussion on the ethics surrounding synthetic biology.
RAW Expo/Spring Forum: The RAW Expo was designed to connect people from various disciplines who have created something. We were able to feature our 2014 iGEM device and garner design feedback from science, architecture, art, and fashion organizations.
Charter Day Weekend: Student Innovators in Action: Charter Day Weekend was a series of events held to celebrate Cornell’s Sesquicentennial, and was attended by hundreds of alums, trustees, and current students. We were chosen to be one of 50 student groups featured during the Student Innovators in Action forum, and through this, were able to represent our school.
Humans and SynBio: We believe that it is important for members of the community to be informed about synthetic biology, which the public is often misinformed about. To this end, the team has developed a novel social media platform, Humans and Synbio , as our take on the popular Facebook page, Humans of New York. We ask members of our local Ithaca community as well as friends around the world for their opinions on synthetic biology, and share the responses on our platform, allowing us to better understand the vast opinions on this rapidly"

DESCRIPTION
OUR JOURNEY
Working with water purification has always been our primary goal throughout this season. In light of goal six of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, universal access to clean water and sanitation, we began by tackling the most prevalent water-related issue around the world—the lack of fresh potable water. To solve this problem, we developed our system, which we named ""Ctrl-Salt-Del"", with the purpose of desalinating seawater by sequestering sodium ions. However, with some initial calculations, we determined that the concentration of sodium ions in seawater is higher than what our system could possibly handle. The concentration of sodium chloride in seawater is 0.6 M, while the maximum acceptable concentration for human consumption is 3.4 mM, or 0.0034 M. Going from 0.6 M to 3.4 mM is a 95% reduction rate that requires the removal of literally billions upon billions of salt particles per liter of water, which is well beyond the estimated capacity of our system.
Understanding the challenges of large-scale purification, we pivoted and took a less ambitious path — municipal wastewater treatment. We toured the Lethbridge Wastewater Treatment Plant and interviewed the process coordinator, Duane Guzzi, who informed us of the possibility of integrating our system into the secondary clarifiers of the existing plant to take out heavy metals present in the wastewater (for more information on this tour and interview, click here ). By integrating our system into existing treatment plants, we can also take advantage of safety measures that are already put in place, such as ultraviolet radiation treatment, that will eliminate any surviving microorganisms potentially harmful to the environment before the treated water is released.
However, during a second interview we had with Dorothy Lok, an approvals engineer for Alberta Environment and Parks, we learned that the presence of heavy metals is not a major concern in municipal wastewater (for more information on this interview, click here ). Therefore, although the integration of our system with existing treatment plants seems highly compelling, it will not have a significant impact in the community. Ms. Lok suggested that we look into the increasingly alarming problems posed by oil extraction tailings ponds in our province.

Berlin,2014,Team:Berlin#Project cn_-_-_TEXT.html," E. coli. (See Figure 1)       Two heavy metal binging proteins were combined and co-expressed on one plasmid. Peptides called phytochelatins are produced in fungus and plants to detoxify the cell from harmful heavy metals. Structurally phytochelatins are (gamma-Glu-Cys)n-Gly (n=2-7) peptides and function as metal ion accumulators through formation of peptide-metal conjugates. In this study the phytochelatin synthase from Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia leave) was used (ATPCS). The other peptid that was used in combination with ATPCS was a metallothionein from Pseudomonas Putida KT2240 strain (PPMT). Metallothioneins are low-molecular proteins with a high content of cysteine and bind well cadmium, zinc, nickel and copper.       For expression of ATPCS a trc promotor was used while PPMT was expressed using a T5 promotor. After co expressing both proteins in an standard E. coli strain(DH5alpha) for 4 h the culture broth was centrifuged and fresh metal rich LB media added. (1 – 5 mM of corresponding final metal concentration (see table 1.).       After further incubation at 37°C for about 6 - 12 hours the cultures and the biogenic synthesized nanoparticles can be harvested.       Park et al reported further that by incubating these ATPCS and PPMT co-expressing in 1.0 mM FeSO4 and MnCl2 magnetic nanoparticles where obtained and cell moved by high magnetic fields (see figure 2).

Q：What are the characteristics of liver cancer compared to other cancers?
A: Liver cancer cells are active and invasive, and there are rich sinusoids surround them. So the liver cancer cells can easily invade the capsule and blood vessels, resulting in easy local spread of the tumor, bloody metastasis. To a certain extent, for the liver is the main metabolic organ, the impaired liver function affects metabolism greatly. The side effects of taking medicine can be greater than others.

Q：What do you think of gene therapy for liver cancer? Is it promising for our RNAi strategy to be applied?
A：There is no mature gene therapy for liver cancer till now. However, we still need new treatment methods for liver cancer. If you have done quite well in your experiments, it will be really promising. The high specificity could reduce the side effects greatly, which is very significant.

Als een cel geen telomerase synthetiseert kan het zo een 30/50 keer delen voordat de telomeren te kort zijn en het delen stopt. Een kankercel kan eigenlijk eeuwig doorgaan. Het verhinderen van telemorase expressie (antisense RNA, siRNA) of het verhinderen van telemorase zelf (antilichamen etc..) zou dus kunnen helpen in het stoppen van kanker. Een mogelijk probleem hierbij is tijd voordat de kanker stopt met delen, een tumor is namelijk meestal pas groot genoeg voor detectie na zo een 80 delingen.  Mogelijke oplossing zou een detectie/sensor bacterie kunnen zijn dat je eens in de zoveel tijd inneemt en telomerase activiteit meet, boven een bepaalde treshold (om geen sperma cellen of andere cellen te mollen) kan deze dan alarm slaan of de aanval openen of iets dergelijks.

Overview
This year Tsinghua-A iGEM Team is trying to explore the ability of genetic regulation pathways to reduce noise and accurately convey information. Here we are going to share our experience in safety control.
Safe Project Design
Does your project include any safety features? Have you made certain decisions about the design to reduce risks? Write about them here! For example:
Project design is foundational:
we do not have a specific real-world application. And all of our experiments are only in the lab. So there is little risk our project will pose. We just want to figure out the ability of genetic regulation pathways. It is theoretic and will cause no harm to the society.
Choosing a non-pathogenic chassis:
We use E. coli (lab strains that are non-pathogenic) for doing the cloning and carry out the measurement in HEK293 human cell line.Experiment with any other organisms besides the chassis is not carried out.
Choosing parts that will not harm humans/animals/plants:
Harmful parts are not allowed in our project. The parts in our project are most commonly used florescent proteins, which are harmless. So none of our parts would raise any safety issue according to the current professional knowledge.
Safe Lab Work
According to the requirements of iGEM policy, in our daily bench work we never performed any dangerous experiments or faced any unusual safety issues. Our bench work followed some basic regulations as below:
Duplicating a key to the laboratory without permission is strictly prohibited.
Experiment participants need to understand the experiment completely.
Necessary steps should be performed in bio-safety cabinet.
Fire, electric heaters, microwave oven should not be left while being used.
Sterilize all liquid waste and solid waste containing living organism.
Sterilize the lab using UV-light every week.
The last person to leave the lab should make sure that water, electricity, gas, and air conditioner has been closed, and doors and windows has been locked before leaving.
We take a lot of actions to reduce the risk at the laboratory stage:W"
Kent,2015,Team:Kent#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," had much time to do much research on it.
Raneem: That’s ok. I’m an electronics engineer, so I wasn’t very familiar with the biological parts of this. This is just an unbiased opinion that we are looking for.
Terry: I did see something when I was reading, about E.coli. One of my questions was going to be how safe is it?
Raneem: We’re using a non-pathogenic strain of E.coli, so basically its harmless.
Terry: So it is harmless.
Raneem: Yes. There’s no worry with that. I just wanted to ask you what is your outlook towards renewable energy?
Terry: Well, it’s the way to go. We’re exhaust of a lot of the fuel energies, coal and that sort of stuff. It used be coal at one time, but now you’ve got renewable energy with the wind farms, with some people for it and some against.
Raneem: Are you personally for or against?
Terry: I don’t know how effective they are. A lot of people say they are not really that effective. They are high maintenance and sometimes they are a block on the landscape. I haven’t made up my decision about whether I am one way or the other around that. Regarding panels on roofs, I think that’s a good one. Again, it doesn’t always look very nice sometimes.
Raneem: It’s not very visually appealing
Terry: No, they can spoil the look of a property and the state. And also, these fields they put them in with all these panels. And sometimes they graze sheep underneath them. I think that’s a good one.
Raneem: There are a lot of new renewable energy sources being developed and I think they are improving
Terry: I am not one for supporting fracking.
Raneem: Yeah there are a lot of mixed opinions about renewable energy. There is never a set answer.
Terry: That’s something I will not support, most probably fracking. It’s just a personal thing. I don’t think it’s doing any good to the Earth actually. I think one day it will go too far.
Raneem: The next question is about synthetic biology, which is just a standardization of biological parts and I was just wondering what roles do you think synthetic biology will be playing, within the UK, within the upcoming 10 years?
Terry: That’s something I never thought about before. I know we’re exploring different ways of doing things and it’s a good thing this research is going on."

(1)We obtained 10 mL of broth containing our transformed F2620 cells. We centrifuged 2 mL four times until we had a total of 8mL worth of cells in our pellet.
(2)We added 250 microliters of resuspention solution to the pellet and vortexed.
(3)We then added 250 microliters of lysis solution and inverted. Then, we added 350 microliters of neutralization solution and inverted again.
(4)To isolate our DNA from the solution, we centrifuged for 5 minutes.
(5)Then, we transferred the lysate supernatant to our mini spin/vac column and centrifuged that for 1 minute.
(6)After decanting the flow-through, we added 750 microliters of wash solution. Then, we centrifuged again and decanted the flow-through.
(7)We centrifuged once more for 1 minute to get rid of any residual wash solution.
(8)Finally, we eluted with 50 microliters of elution solution and centrifuged.
Once we had our purified DNA, we measured the concentration. We measured it to be 31.3 ng/microliter. We stored this in the refrigerator for Thursday, when we will electrophorate it.

June 1
We decided to transform E.coli with the F2620 part as a back up.
(1)105 E.coli cells were added to 100uL BioRad Transformation Solution.
(2)1ul of F2620 DNA from the Registry was added to the cells which were incubated 30min on ice.
(3)Cells were heat shocked by swirling in water at 42 degree water bath for 2mi and then returned to ice for 30min.
(4)1ml S0B butter was added to the cells and they were incubated for 2 hrs at room temp.
(5)100ul of the transformed cells were plated on a fresh LB/AMP plate.
June 2
We have invaders! Our plates, along with three other parts from the other teams in the lab, were contaminated with fungi. So, we attempted to get some bacteria from the plates. We created a few streak plates for each part on LB AMP. We are hoping tomorrow we will have fresh, uncontaminated, transformed bacteria.
June3
No luck. Our streak plates gave us no growth.
Conclusion: The fungus that was growing on our plates broke down"

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
ADD PARTS
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:

Tsinghua-E,2013,Team:Tsinghua-E#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," our mutation strategy. However, the mixture exhibited lower productivity. The mixture was a survival from high tetracycline concentration for its resistance tolerance, another evolution type of our mutation.
Week12(9.13-9.19)
Figure 17. Tryptophon production of rbs30 mutation stains
In this week, we started to evolve Bl21 with mutation part and another bitter defender part(rbs32). Mutation part and Bitter defender part (rbs30) were transferred into E.coli Bl21. Colonies were picked up from agar plate to culture in LB. Seed culture was added to 1.5mL M9YE media(initial OD was 0.02) in 24-well plate with 50mg/L ampicillin, 24mg/L chloromycetin, 24mg/L IPTG and 80mg/L tetracycline as the first round mutation. After 270 minutes, the first round products were as seed culture added to another new 1.5mL M9YE media like above, but with higher tetracycline concentration as the second round mutation. After the third round mutation, the culture were coated on LB agar plate, picked up 24 single colonies to culture in 24-well plate for 48h and detected tryptophon production by HPLC. Result was shown in figure 17. With the help of mutation part, we also got mutation mixture with different tryptophon yield range from 0-2.028mg/L. The yield was obviously improved.
Week13(9.20-9.27)
Figure 18. Tryptophon production of control and mutation stains
We got high productivity stains during three rounds mutation, and we picked up the highest yield of rbs30 and rbs32 to culture in LB. Seed culture was added to 1.5mL M9YE media(initial OD was 0.02) in 24-well plate with 50mg/L ampicillin and cultured for 48h to detect tryptophon concentration. The result was shown in figure 18. The control Bl21 almost did not contain trptophon and the other two controls rbs30 and rbs32 with shown low productivity. Obviously, the two mutation strains had higher productivity. The yield of rbs30-16 was 2.4 times higher than control rbs30 and rbs32-3 was 2.7 times higher than control rbs32. That proved our mutation strategy successfully accelerates evolution to produce more tryptophon.

Then, we introduced our project—how to effectively decompose the kitchen waste with low osmotic pressure (high salinity) osmotic pressure. We basically talked about the factors which can affect the efficiency or the ability of yeasts which are used to decompose the kitchen waste, and our own solution.
Sponsor
Face-to-face raising fund
Our team members also introduced our project in the real life: they visited some companies which are related to biology and explained our project to them.We got the funding from Nanjing Zhengbeicehui Equipment Inc., Hunan Tianxingjian Project Management Inc., Shanghai Songyuan Cork Foam Inc., Beijing Shiyuan Business Inc., Kanglihua Company and Beijing Huaxiafengxing Advertisement Inc, etc. Through this practice, we not only challenged ourselves in negotiating with adults, especially the managers of some enterprises, but also expanded our influence in the society such as the marketplace. 
Online funding
We wrote an article on the internet to describe what synthetic biology and iGEM are, and what we were doing in our own research. The article attracted more than 100 net citizens to read. They browsed our webpage and got to know some details about our project. Many of them are really interested in our project; they not only donate money to support us, but also gave us many inspiring comments, which encouraged us a lot for further study.
Propaganda in Families and communities
Most of our family and community have no idea about the synthetic biology. We gave lectures to our parents and our neighbors. Most of people are confused with or held some wrong opinions about synthetic biology. Through our introduction and explanation, they realized that synthetic biology is not as horrible or scary as what they used to think. We changed their opinions, also taught them some basic knowledge of the synthetic biology that they have never thought of.  We also helped many children understand that biology is really useful and interesting. We not only introduced our project, we also spread the influence of the synthetic biology and iGEM.
Impact
Environmental impact
Our product can help the environment in three ways. First of all, with our modified yeast, food waste decomposition rate will be greatly increased, and then we no longer need to worry about the soil pollution which is brought by traditional kitchen waste digestion-landfill. As the amount of kitchen waste that is digested by landfill decline, salt and other toxicant will gradually stop entering into the soil. Secondly, after decomposition by our genetically modified yeast,, some of the useless kitchen waste might be efficiently changed into"

Looks like most of the mutator expressing plates have few colonies compared to wild type for whatever reason. Did colony PCR on the ARM and IPTG-GFP ligations from previous days, and found a few suitable colonies to send in (MutL specifically), though we need to do more colony PCR on some of the ligations (DinB, EmrR and DnaE specifically). We also have been collecting lysate from cells transformed with the various mutators we’ve been ligating, and ran it on an SDS-PAGE gel to confirm that the IPTG-GFP plasmids are properly expressing the mutators. We have a pic of the gel on the next day. Ladder

TUDelft,2008,Team:TUDelft#Ethics macro_-_-_TEXT.html,"Designer enzymes are big business as the need to produce viable biofuels grows - but can they offer a long-term alternative? […]Even with an agricultural system tuned to extract as much biomass as possible, there will not be enough land to supply all fuel. […] Clearly, our need for designer enzymes is growing urgent.” – The Guardian
Biologists join the race to create synthetic life – “The new discipline, established by scientists such as human genome pioneer Craig Venter, involves stripping microbes down to their basic genetic constituents so they can be reassembled and manipulated to create new life forms. These organisms can then be exploited to manufacture drugs and fuels or to act as bio-sensors inside the body. However, some researchers warn that synthetic biology - which is accelerating at a dramatic pace - also poses dangers. In particular, they fear it may already be possible to create deadly pathogens, such as polio or smallpox viruses, from pieces of synthetic DNA ordered over the internet. In future, completely new - and highly dangerous - microbes could be made this way.” – The Observer
Can we create life? – “Our knowledge of, and ability to, alter DNA remains rudimentary, in spite of notable scientific advances and the persistent dream of genetic perfection. […] This technique is called synthetic biology and it combines science and engineering to build new biological functions and systems. The US group J Craig Venter Institute hopes eventually to use engineered genomes to make bacteria that can do useful things, such as produce clean fuels or take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. But many people are extremely concerned by the possibilities of bio-error (or bio-terror) that artificial life creates. They say artificial microbes could have dangerous consequences if they escape into the environment or if they are used to manufacture bioweapons. At present there are no international laws or oversight mechanisms to assess the safety of synthetic organisms.” – The Observer
From these articles, it seems that people do see the benefits of synthetic biology, but there is also attention for bio-error, bioterrorism, ethical issues, etc. In a way, the benefits are recognized, but the drawbacks also receive attention.
One can debate whether this attention for the potential risks and risk perception is a good development for advancing science, but at least one can notice that this development is in large contrast with the progress in genetic engineering from the 1970s to 2000: here, much less ethical considerations are generally observed.
Yet still, when we consider scientific evolution of synthetic biology, with a focus on ethical issues such as biosecurity, biosafety, intellectual property and artificial life, one can wonder when the public"

For BL21, we waited an hour and then infected with 100 microL phage. We then placed it back into the 37 C incubator for 48 hours. T4 will be infected tomorrow, due to its shorter incubation time.
DL 05/13
We found Dr. McCleary and he explained to us that we don’t need to use the special centrifuge until the later steps.  We will be able to run the experiment at 10,000 g with a different one that we already have the tubes for.  We should be running the purification on Wednesday. To prepare for it, we began growing BL21 and W3110.  After an hour we infected BL21 with 100 microL T7 phage.  Tomorrow, we will infect T4.  We placed both back in the 37 C incubator.

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," the model
Firstly, it is important to bear in mind that the model is an alpha-version, and not fully optimised or debugged. The code is also written expressly in mind of integration with VCell for visualisation purposes, and makes use of the VCell format for compartmentalisation rules - if you do not wish to view the results within VCell, the syntax will need a large re-write.
Secondly, the code is still awaiting reaction constants, due to large discrepancies in the literature. You are heartily encouraged to improve upon this - regrettably, the team needed to focus on other areas of the project more immeadiately. However, there will hopefully be updates in the future.
Assumptions / Justifications
The model gets around the problem of not knowing exactly how every reaction progresses in the patway by making specific assumptions:
The main assumption is that all products of CpxR-induced transcription that are not of interest can be packaged into a singular promoter and product, labelled ""denats"". The concentration of the promoter (pdenats) must then be set appropriately relative to the remaining promoters - in our case, this should be aound 100 times the amount of pGFP. This allows the reaction mechanics to follow a simplified path, without invalidating the stochastic interaction rates.
The next most important assumption is that CpxP can only be inhibited by direct binding of a misfolded protein unit. Consequently, the model does not account for the effects of pH, temperature or cellular breakdown upon the components of the pathway. The justification for this is that the Cpx patheway is normally invovled in regulating against these external stress factors, hence we can assume that the metabolites involved are reasonably stable under small fluctuations in these conditions.
Finally, the model assumes that products such as GFP, denats and phosphates either degrade at constant rates or are consumed in explicitly stated interactions (e.g. phosphorylation). This means we assume that the prescence of these molecules does not affect the rest of the pathway through other regulation mechanisms. This is fair for GFP, as it has an explicit half-life and degradation rate, but is tenuous for the bundled denaturants (they could potentially affect other species involved in the reaction mechanics). However, without thorough agreement in the literature and more direct data measurements, it is impractical to attempt to model these at this stage.

Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and meaningful data. This part not only furthers the development of ratiometric measurements in molecular biology but due to the choice of promoters and terminators it can be used to characterize the difference in activity between E. coli and B.

Then we put the two protein into lots of 1.5ml EP tubes,each contain 50ul protein,Quick freezing and keeping under -80℃.
Common operation
All of our experiment can be describe as three processes, the preparation of reaction system, the reaction and the detection. In order to describe easier, some common operations are explained in this part.
1.   The preparation of reaction system
All of our reaction system have a final volume of 100ul, and each system contain one piece of plastic (3*3*0.25mm). The reaction vessel are PCR tubes.
2.   Reaction
We put those PCR tubes which contain the reaction system in a table, the speed is set at 220 rpm, the temperature is set at 50℃.Each reaction system are mixed uniformity before put in table.
3.   The method of detection
As the plastic have a degradation, the turbidity of reaction system would changed which can be monitored at OD600.
Pre-experiment
To find a appropriate condition for our main experiment, we did some Pre-experiments.
1.   Decide the detecting time.
We set three detecting time: 3h, 6h, 18h. In this experiment, the concentration of the two protein are set at 2 mg/ml. The pH of buffer are 7.0.As to each protein, we set three reaction system which have the same condition except the detecting time. To study how the proteins themselves would change as the time change, we also set a control group which have no plastics in the reaction system. All kinds of reaction system can be seen as follow table.

Safety
Safety has always been a major concern through our project, both in the experiments design and operations. We used two kinds of bacterium, which all belong to Enterobacteriaceae. One is Escherichia coli (DH5α) and the other is Enterobacter sp. FY-07. According to the official iGEM guidelines of Risk Groups, E. coli is categorized as Risk Group 1 organisms that “do not cause disease in healthy adult humans” when used properly. Enterobacter sp. FY-07 is categorized as Risk Group 2 organisms that “can cause disease in humans, but the disease is treatable or preventable”. The safety level of our lab is P2, which is safe enough to perform all our experiments. We highly valued the individual safety, environmental safety and biological safety.
1. Individual Safety and Environmental Safety
All the iGEMers in our project have taken safety training courses in our department experiment center. The safety training includes fire-fighting strategies, disposition of biochemical materials, proper usages of microwave oven and so on. All members have carefully read Safe Project Design, Safe Lab Work, Safe Shipment and other requirements proposed by iGEM Safety Committee. All members are required to wear nitrile gloves, masks, closed shoes in the lab to prevent potential threats of personal health. What’s more, we separate resting areas from experiment areas and confine eating and drinking in resting areas. Biological materials were not allowed to be taken outside the laboratory without sterilization and regular cleaning of the laboratory trash was arranged every day to maintain a clean and safe environment.
2. Biological Safety Concern Based on the Project
With the advent of synthetic biology, more and more genetically modified microorganisms are used for biomedical, industrial and environmental applications. To avoid diffusion of the genetically engineered Enterobacter sp. FY-07, we have come up with three strategies. I. Introduce the plasmid carrying xylose operon and lyase gene. The expression of the lyase is induced by xylose. II. Knock out the colicin gene in Enterobacter sp. FY"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html,"M CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

We made the gel from the previously mentioned PCR  of AF-ER (MS4), FF-GR (MS5), EF-FR(MS6), GF-HR (MS7) and also 3 L0 (MF3=MS1,  SJ3=MS2,  SJ4=MS3)
Alll the L0 failed and the L1 showed bands
We performed gel extraction on the 4 L1 primer  based amplification. We performed    nanodrop quantification of  the products of the gel extraction.
We performed restriction digest (SpeI, BSA, Buffer 4)of the products of the gel extraction.From the restriction digest of MS4-7 we performed PCR clean up.  We nano dropped the PCR clean up product.
We transformed iGEM plasmids with competent bacteriafrom stock, and plated them.  We grew them overnight in 37C incubator: pSB1A3 plate 1 well 1G  (1A3), pSB1AT3 plate 1 well 13A (1AT3), pSB1C3 plate 1 well 3A (1C3), pSB1K3 plate 1 well 5A (1K3). We picked colonies from the plates that were stored in the incubator and allowed the picked colonies to be incubated in a 37C shaker.   We performed miniprep on 3 of the 4 overnight cultures(1k3 was not used due to minimal growth while 1A3, 1AT3 and 1C3 were able to grow sufficiently). We performed nanodrop quantification on the products of the miniprep and then performed restriction digest (SpeI, BSA, Buffer 4)of the products of the miniprep.
  We made a second generation of culture of the plasmid carrying bacteria by injecting 20 uL of the original culture into 5 mL of fresh LB broth with the appropriate antibiotics. Using the generation 2 culture of the bacteria with the 1K3 plasmid, we mini prepped it. We nanodrop quantified the mini prepped material. We then ran restriction digest(Spe"

The First Generation of Dr. Familict
The first generation hardware design is very simple, consisting of only one square box, cool                         polarizer, one card slot, and one chip. This also brings the trouble of the user, the user needs                         to time and rinse. Below is the structure diagram and physical map of the first generation                         product.
Fig.1 The First Generation of Dr. Familict
The Second Generation of Dr. Familict
Instruction
Dr. Familict, the visualized liquid-crystal-based urine protein detector, is a 20cm×20cm×10cm                         brick-sized box. It consists mainly a slide holder slot, a wash buffer chamber, a waste                         collector, a liquid-crystal cell, polarizer and analyzer. Up on using, just plug in a                         antigen-coated glass slide to the slot, a drop of antibody solution is loaded automatically when                         the slide is placed properly. The user then only needs to add a drop of urine to the test zone,                         and press the bottom to start timing. The following operations will be done automatically. After                         the reaction is completed, the slide is rinsed for 30 s. Then it is drove slightly to the                         detection area. Upon slide positioning, liquid-crystal is loaded and the bottom light is                         switched on upon slide positioning. After the polarized light passes, visible color changes are                         produced. Users can take a picture and upload the result to the Mobile APP and get medication                         advice.
Liquid-crystal Cell
The liquid crystal cell is the most important part of the test box. When the upper slider slides                         to the observation area, it is assembled with the upper slide of the liquid crystal cell into a                         self-assembled film spaced 6 micrometers apart, and then the liquid crystal cell on the left                         side of the slide is opened, and the liquid crystal enters between the upper and lower slides                         due to capillary action. At this point, the microstructure of the slide will affect the orientation change of the liquid crystal. After turning on the light at the bottom of the test                         box, the light passes through the polarizer, then through the cell, and finally through the                         analyzer above the cell, so we can observe changes in brightness and color.
Wash buffer chamber and waste collector
These two components are used to wash unfixed antigens, antibodies and other impurity proteins on                         the slide. When the user drops the urine and the antibody solution, the test box starts to                         timing. After the reaction reaches"

Apparently there is no big difference using various CPEC conditions. We will continue with the standard protocol.
PPTase test (Ralf)
pRB3-10 are plasmids containing indC (pRB-3-6) or bpsA(pMM64) (pRB7-10) and a PPTase (sfp, svp, svp(pMM65), entD).
This week the blue colonies are screened and sequenced for validation.
colony PCR screening #1
Two blue colonies are picked from each plate and screened with the primers of the PPTase they should have and the
ones which they could have if something went wrong. PPTase PCR products werde used as a positive control and TOP10
without any plasmid as a negative control. So numbers 5 to 18 are subdivided into alpha and beta.

Transformed 1,2,4,6,7,10,11,12, and negative control.  The negative control grew colonies so the backbone may have liated back by itself so we are using phosphitase to remove phosphates so that it cannot ligate together.
They then colony PCRed and sequenced.

Today we are miniprepping 2 of each successful colonies from the colony PCR
YDR124W ⎫ PRM6    | All grew 100+ colonies SAG1    ⎭
We are doing colony PCR on 5 colonies of each transformaiton. All 5 colonies are also patched as a stock and are circled on the plate when colony PCR confirms that they have the gene knock in.
Anneling temp at 50ºC for 30secs Polymerase extension at 72ºC for 1min Length of PCR product should be 940bp
