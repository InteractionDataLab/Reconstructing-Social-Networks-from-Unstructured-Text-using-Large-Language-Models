Biofilm studies and evaluation:
pTrcHisB, pLuxS, pLuxSMtn, pLsrACDB, pLsrACDBFG, pLsrACDBK, pLsrACDBFGK were diluted to OD~0.05 and reinoculated at a total volume of 200 μL at a 1:1 (v/v) ratio. IPTG (1 mM) was added at OD ~ 0.4, and biofilms were cultured for ~24 h (&plus;/−30 min) at 30 oC in static conditions. After incubation, optical density was read on a plate reader at 600 nm. The supernatant was gently decanted, and each well was washed 3 times with 300 μL of sterile PBS to detach loosely adhered cells. The plate was then incubated at 60 oC  with the lid off for 60 min, and afterwards, 250 μL of 0.1% crystal violet was added to each well and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Crystal violet stain was aspirated with a pipette and excess stain was washed off by gently submerging and mixing in a tray filled with distilled water until washings were free of the stain. After the microplate was airdried, the dye was resolubilized by adding 250 μL of 95% ethanol, and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 30 min. The optical density of each well stained with crystal violet was measured at 540 nm.

Preliminary Project Description
Dealing with Nitrogen in Wastewater
Wastewater and sewage often contains an excess of nitrogen, usually in the form of urea and ammonia. When the wastewater is discharged into a larger body of water, the nitrogenous waste can be harmful to the local marine life. Wastewater facilities use a combination of chemical or biological treatments to remove the excess nitrogenous compounds. Depending on the method used, energy and infrastructure costs can be significant. The biological processes commonly utilize communities of microbes, some with the capability to convert Ammonia to Nitrate, others with an ability to convert Nitrate to Nitrogen gas. Maintaining these microbial communities is energy intensive, and usual requires supplying both oxygen and methanol.
Anaerobic Ammonia Oxidation
Multistep conversion of ammonia into nitrogen gas, requiring several bacteria species, is not the only route for nitrogen to return to the atmosphere. Instead, anaerobic ammonia oxidation, also known as anammox, combines ammonia and nitrate to generate Nitrogen gas and water. Bacteria such as Kuenenia stuttgartiensis can carry out these reactions alone and without oxygen. In addition, these bacteria can derive metabolic energy from these reactions, which further reduces the need to supply an energy source. While these bacteria do not have the same demanding metabolic requirements as the microbial communities traditionally used, they present their own unique challenges for growth and application in an industrial setting. A few sewage treatment plants, such as the treatment center in Rotterdam (Netherlands), have successfully piloted the use of anammox bacteria. This success is despite difficulty cultivating and growing this particular species of bacteria.
Our Project Goal
The ultimate goal of the Kingsborough Community College team will be to import the enzymes needed for the anammox pathway into a more amenable microbial chassis, such as Escherichia coli. Other teams in the past have attempted to address the issue of biological nitrogen removal, but with limited success. The 2013 DTU Denmark team attempted"

METU_HS_Ankara,2018,Team:METU HS Ankara#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," of FucO and GSH
FucO: L-1,2-Propanediol Oxidoreductase
Our first solution, NADH-dependent propanediol oxidoreductase (FucO) has been seen to reduce the amount of furfural output as it increases the furfural tolerance by 50% and permits the fermentation of 15 mM furfural. FucO, basically, is the gene responsible for the production of L-1,2-propanediol oxidoreductase which is an enzyme that converts furans; HMF and furfural, to non-toxic alcohols without interfering with the NADPH metabolism.
This is crucial as when furfural is present in the field, the organism’s automatic expression of oxidoreductases go active, such as YqhD and FucO. However, the problem is that, YqhD  has the priority to be synthesized which is NADPH-dependent.
This suggest that YqhD will also have detrimental effects on the growth and living of the bacteria as it will compete with the biosynthesis of NADPH during fermentation in E.coli (Zheng, 2013). The native conversion of NADH to NADPH in E. coli is already insufficient to revitalize the NADPH pool during fermentation, so the actions shouldn’t be interfering with NADPH metabolism (Wang et al., 2011; 2012).
Thus, when FucO is overexpressed, the organism’s need to express NADPH dependent oxidoreductases is decreased, providing the cell a sustainable intracellular environment.
Figure 3: Possible reaction pathways for furfural hydrogenation
GSH: Bifunctional gamma-glutamate-cysteine ligase/Glutathione synthetase
In normal circumstances, simultaneous detoxification of ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species), the conversion of HMF and furfural drag the cell into a more oxidized intracellular environment and deteriorate the antioxidant defense system of the cell (Ask et al., 2013). Here, increasing the cellular levels of  antioxidants are essential.
In our case the expression of  glutathione (GSH) stands the best chance, as it is the master antioxidant in living organisms coping with ROS, oxidative stress and increasing furan tolerance (Kim & Hahn, 2013; Höck et al., 2013).
Additionally, a GSH derivative, glutathione S-transferase, reacts with a number of harmful chemical species; such as ROS"
Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Human Containment_-_-_TEXT.html,", is a big issue. Dr Robert Griffiths also advised us that while engineering naturally occurring soil bacteria might lead to better persistence and cause our project to be more efficient, containment would be more easily achieved by using bacteria that do not normally occur in soil such as E. coli as they are more likely to be outcompeted.
These arguments caused us to pin-point our chassis choice on B. subtilis, a natural spore-forming bacterium that naturally occurs in soil and E. coli. We initially codon-optimised our genes for both of these species. At the first human practices panel, we thoroughly discussed the advantages and disadvantages associated with both chassis choices (Figure 1).
3. Result
Containment and possible contamination of other areas is a very big human practices issue. With B. subtilis as our chassis we would never be able to ensure complete containment. On the other hand, enveloping E. coli in a seed coat is mostly  a mechanical issue that we should be able to overcome. We therefore chose to use E coli as the chassis for AuxIn.
Survivability of our chassis
1. Goal
Although E. coli have been shown to be able to survive in soil for significant amounts of time (more than 130 days in the case of the pathogenic strain O175, as shown by Maule, 2000[3]), the ability to survive even in manure sludge varies greatly between different strains[4]. We wanted to ensure that our chassis is able to survive in the soil for long enough to complete its purpose. At the same time, we wanted to test how long the bacteria would be able to retain their plasmid in an environment where it would be unfavourable to the survival of the bacteria and if we could observe any horizontal gene transfer.
2. Action
To investigate the survival of lab strains of E. coli in soil, we set up a separate experiment. This experiment was started by our work experience student Kiran and carried on by us after he left.
Figure 2. Our work experience student Kiran and James discussing the survivability experiment set up (picture by Imperial College London iGEM team 2011).
We inoculated small discs of filter paper with GFP-expressing E. coli and put these into sterile and non-sterile soil. The fluorescent protein is expressed on a plasmid that also gives the bacteria antibiotic resistance against ampicillin and kanamycin. In the absence of antibiotic and presence of competition (through other soil bacteria, fungi and protozoans) we would expect the bacteria to mutate the pl"

Both falcon were kept to the dark by using silver paper and let them growing for 2 hours at 37°C.  1 ml of bacteria sample has been collected and transferred inside 1ml eppendorf and  spinned at 6000-8000 rpm for 3 minutes. The supernatant has been throw away and the pellet  resuspended for the slide preparation. This procedure gave the uniformity of induction to all the sample and the Fig.4 shows that GFP synthesis is started in all the bacteria population.

In order to prove that these constructs can be used in the bi-stable circuit without interference between Lac Operon and SOS System, a test with LexA site binding construct and 256Promoter + Laci + T + Plac + RBS + GFP LVA was used. The first and the latter construct were induced by H2O2 or IPTG and in Fig.5 is possible to see the results.

As expected the Lexa construct induced by IPTG and Lac-Operon-based-circuit induced by H2O2 didn’t produced GFP synthesis, instead the other two sample correctly induced presented good level of fluorescence.

NCTU Annual Biotechnology Fair
At this year’s biotechnology fair in NCTU, we presented our project to future NCTU biotechnology majors to get them interested in synthetic biology. Every year, the event is held a few months before school starts as a way   to give incoming students a glimpse at the many different paths available in the field. Of course, synthetic biology is all about collaboration between different fields, and all of our non-biology major teammates shared how other fields, such as nanotechnology and engineering, could work together with biology to achieve great things.

Polypeptide Classification
Polypeptides are classified according to their size and functional properties. Peptides are short chains of amino acids that often play a role in signalling and enzyme inhibition. At the other end of the spectrum, we have proteins which are much larger with complex three dimensional structures. Enzymes are a class of proteins which serve to accelerate the rate at which chemical reactions occur in the cell.
To demonstrate The E.ncapsulator's versatility, we have chosen to showcase it with both enzymes and peptides. These two classes of polypeptide have very different properties that we have considered and catered for in The E.ncapsulator's design.

Popularization
This year, IGEM Bordeaux took a particular interest in talking with people about synthetic biology and Genetically modified organisms. You'll find in this section a preview of what we did this year
Cap Sciences
Cap sciences is an animations center in Bordeaux open to all which try to help people discover and understand scientific phenomenons, new technologies and their industrial applications. They try to make science accessible to everyone and to engage a large variety of people  in scientific activities (most commonly people which are interested by sciences in general). They were glad to hear about our project and we have been in contact with them all throughout the year, presenting what we've done on popularization.
During the first meeting on the 17th of December, we created the group ImagineLife composed by iGEM team members and other people interested by sciences.
We talked about how we can explain synthetic biology to non-scientific people. After a long discussion, we were agreed to do a survey about synthetic biology to find out:
✵ What people already know / don't know about this field
✵ What what scares them
✵ What do they believe that synthetic biology can do for them
With the results of this survey, we hoped to have a better overview of the situation and be able to explain synthetic biology in simple terms to the general public.
So we worked on a survey, and interviewed people in the streets. Emilie, Charlotte, Hiba, Caroline, Gilles and Diego spent a few afternoons in the streets of Bordeaux trying to get in contact with walkers.
These conversations thought us that in Bordeaux the main concern about GMO's is that people are unaware about what they really are and the possibilities that synthetic biology offer us. Furthermore it made us start to realize the importance of scientific communication and for the need to think about our project from an ethical and safety point of view. For more information on the questions we asked ourselves please see the Ethics page! Then we have presented our work during the next meeting, on the 20 of February. Below is a link to the presentation of our interviews and the pdf of the questions we asked. We apologize in advance that the video is in french but you can find the subtitles in a"

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#projectAlgorithm_-_-_TEXT.html," if both have same partReferenceand partType attribute values. Though the above sorting strategy takes binding positions into consideration, it ignores the binding details of those parts: the details are hidden in the nodes of all trees. Hence, similar to the chain sorting, we need to find another strategy to sort nodes as well as trees. Our weighting scheme will be first introduced below.
Assume the chains are sorted already. Each part will be assigned a weight based on its position in the chain list. The weight of the jth part on the ith chain is (i,j). For example, the first part on the first chain posses a weight (0,0) (in C style, counting number from zero). After assignment of parts' weight, we turn to weights of the nodes in trees. Since leaf nodes in trees are actually the representation of parts in bound state on chains, the weight of each leaf node could be inherited from the weight of its corresponding part. For parent node, its weight equals to the maximum of weights of all its children nodes (we define a weight (i, j) is greater than another (i',j') if i < i' or i = i' while j < j'). The recursive definition of nodes' weight of trees makes it possible to sort all children of each node, which is a prerequisite for generating Huffman codes (see below). And then the tree order in the forest could be uniquely determined by sorting the root node of each tree.
Exchange of the first and second chain. The tree structures are different before and after exchange: the two chains are not equivalent.
Back to the question above, if two chains are equal in the first stage sorting, which should be arranged in front of the other? The answer could be obtained by exchanging them. The exchange will change the parts' weight on both chains and thus the weight of some nodes of the trees and subsequently the tree and forest structure. If the forest structure is not changed, the two chains are equivalent, which means that it makes no difference to arrange either chain in front of the other. If the forest structure has changed, we must find some ways to determine which tree structure is preferred and based on this to arrange them. We know each tree could be uniquely converted to a binary tree by taking the first child of each node as the left child and its siblings as its right child. The Huffman algorithm is used to generate the Huffman code of each node in the binary tree. Since the Huffman code of each node represents its path to the root node, we can restore the tree structure from the Huffman codes of all leaf nodes. Hence, the Huffman"

Figure 2-1: Light-mediated isomerization of the retinal Schiff base (RSB). Top: retinal in the all-transstate, as found in the dark-adapted state of microbial rhodopsins andin the light-activated forms of type II rhodopsins of higher eukaryotes. The absorption of a photon converts the retinal from the all-transto the 11-cisconfiguration. Bottom: 11-cisretinal is found only in type II rhodopsins, where it binds to the opsin in the dark state before isomerizing to the all-trans position after photonabsorption.
Opsin genes are divided into two distinct superfamilies: microbial opsins (type I) and animal opsins (type II). Bucause we study C.elegans, we only introduction type II here. Type II opsin genes are present only in highereukaryotes and are mainly responsible for vision (Sakmar, 2002). A small fraction of type II opsins also play roles in circadian rhythm and pigment regulation (Sakmar, 2002; Shichidaand Yamashita, 2003). Type II opsins primarily function as Gprotein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and appear to all use the11-cisisomer of retinal (or derivatives) for photon absorption(Figure 1, bottom)

Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2),was later characterized from the same organism.Similar to ChR1, ChR2 also conducts cations (Nagel et al.,2003; Tsunoda and Hegemann, 2009), and both ChRs exhibitfast on and off kinetics. When introduced into neurons, ChRscan insert into the plasma membrane and mediate membranepotential changes in response to blue light (Boyden et al.,2005; Ishizuka et al., 2006; Li et al.,"

Safety
Do the biological materials used in your lab work pose risks to lab members, security, the general public, or the environment?
None of the biological materials used in our lab pose pose any sort of risk. The main biological part that we are using in this project, the mtd, does not affect any organism other than Bordetella bacteria. Furthermore, all of our work is done in-vitro, and our product is not packaged within a vector. As such, there is no chance of our materials impacting the public or the environment outside of the controlled laboratory environment.
If your project was scaled up from a lab study to a widely used industrial product, or if the knowledge and methods produced from your project became widely available, what new risks might arise?
No new risks would arise. Our project has no inherently malicious utilities.
What are your institution's biosafety guidelines?
All biological research at UCLA is overseen by the Environment, Health, & Safety department's Biological Safety Division . Per EH&S's requirements, Members of our team took the Lab Safety Fundamentals Concepts course taught by UCLA's Environment, Health, & Safety department. The course covers fire safety, chemical safety, and mitigation of hazards in the lab. We also consulted with EH&S regarding the safety implications of our project. Initially, we had planned to conduct our experiment in-vivo using the BPP-1 phage and its host, the Bordetella bacteria. However, Bordetella causes infections in humans and smaller mammals, and our lab facility was not equipped to handle such a hazard. As such, we decided to switch to a completely in-vivo approach.
In the USA, the Center for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health provide biosafety guidelines for the nation.
What is the BioSafety Level rating of your lab?
Our lab has a BSL rating of 2.
Does your project involve any high risk organisms?
Our project does not involve the use of any chassis organism. We only use standard strains of E. coli for the transformation/replication of our plasmid (XL-1 blue), as well as for screening purposes.

Interaction analysis
When you use interaction analysis for a Part on the design platform, any other parts or protein that might interact with the chosen part will be displayed and can be added to the platform. We had built an interaction database ourselves, the sources of data were iGEM Registry and STRING Database. Scores for parts come from the STRING Database.
Simulation & Plasmid Design
S-Din allow our innovative users with fascinating idea to combine various genetic parts together to form a brand-new genetic circuits that may never exist before.To help them have a deeper understanding of how the genetic system that they created works, we construct an ODE system to simulate the dynamic behaviors of the genetic system mathematically. The main challenge of simulation is the uncertainty of genetic circuits since the users can construct them arbitrarily. Therefore we built a rather generic model capable of simulating various genetic circuits.
After your Design, you can choose to convert your circuits into Plasmids (Customizable) for further synthesis.
Techniques
As a web application. Django with Python 3 was choosen for back-end which is fast, strong, robust and friendly to developers; MySQL with Django models binding give us fantastic database support; Algorithms including Word2Vec, K-D Tree are also coded in Python 3 with the famous SciPy. For front-end, we build the view with customized Semantic UI, and control the logic behind beautiful widgets using jQuery. Some other open-source JavaScript libraries are also used to build the site, such as Chart.js for chart, jsPlumb for links in the design page, etc.. Advanced TypeScript was used to build the interesting game BioLab Rescue, hope you will enjoy it!
Wet-Lab Validation
Overview
At S-Din, we want to help bio-builder design genetic circuit seamlessly and simply. After we finish building it, we carried out a validation experiment of this workflow. We tested the efficiency and reliability of S-Din in this wet lab validation, and the experimental data can also validate the simulation part in our software.
Motivation
In the recent few decades, due to the depletion of the ozone layer, the potential risks of skin cancer and cataract has been growing. Our journey with S-Din began with a curiosity of how to detect UV. But we didn’t have a clear idea and didn't know where to start. Luckily, S-Din can light up one's path.

Wet-lab Validation
Overview
After we finished the software, we decided to carry out an alpha test which involves the main functions of our software. Therefore we designed a circuit and build it up in a vector with the help of our software. Expression data are measured and can be used to validate and calibrate the software. Here we show the whole detailed process of the experiment.
Motivation
We would like to build a circuit that turns yellow under exposure of sunlight. With this circuit, bacteria can warn people of strong sunlight and help prevent skin cancer. Therefore we picked a UV sensor and a toggle switch that gives the bacteria two states of different color. If the circuit works, the expected result would be green in normal condition, and yellow under sunlight.

    To simplify and mimic the complex relationships between populations in real ecosystems, we use methods of synthetic biology to construct a more simple system using E.coli. The system involves two groups of E.coli, with each group having three characters. By secreting AHL molecules, warriors attack the enemies but not E.coli from the same group. Farmers provide nutrients for everybody by the secretion of invertase. Beggars sit there doing nothing, growing and waiting to be killed by warriors from the other group.
    Concretely, the gene circuits are designed as follows.     
Fig.1 Gene circuit for our six types of E.coli
See more description at Design of characters
    Therefore, our main task is to construct three characters of the two groups.
    Our achievements are shown below.
I Construct a new part--invertase
    The invertase used by farmers supports other E.coli when sucrose is the sole carbohydrate source.
    In our system, we hope farmers can produce invertase and secrete it outside the cell to help other E.coli survive. To test if invertase can work as we expected, we transformed invertase and its transport system to E.coli and co-cultured it with cells that can express RFP. We found that E.coli that can produce invertase can truly support the survival of other E.coli. (Fig.2)

By transferring the cellulose production operon from its native organism Gluconacetobacter xylinus into the lab and industrially friendly host Escherichia coli, we aim to improve cellulose production per unit time to achieve more cost effective pellicle growth and to encourage further synthetic biology with microbial cellulose. E. coli grows considerably faster plus tolerates higher temperatures and more vigorous aeration. The ease of genetic engineering and the wealth of other characterized Biobricks increases the potential for exciting future projects
Engineering
The cellulose production operon in Gluconacetobacter xylinus is a 10kb genomic region, consisting of four main elements:
acsAB, known as cellulose synthase, is made up of two domains: acsA being the catalytic domain, and acsB being the cyclic-di-GMP-binding domain. This modular enzyme requires the second messenger cyclic-di-GMP in order to carry out efficient catalysis. (Lee et al., 2014)
acsC codes for an oligomeric element that gets embedded in the extracellular membrane and allows transport of the growing polymer across the cell membrane into the extracellular environment. (Lee et al., 2014)
acsD is believed to be a non-essential element, although it is a key player in the control of cellulose crystallinity and required for maximal cellulose productivity. (Lee et al., 2014)
The native operon is highly regulated at transcriptional, translational and post-translational levels. Cellulose production responds to a wide set of internal signals and environmental cues. The native ribosomal binding sites (RBS) are predicted to be weak by translation rate calculators (The Salis Lab RBS calculator and Postech UTR designer ). This is perhaps to reduce noise in gene expression (strong promoter, weak RBS is less noisy that weak promoter strong RBS). The promoter region has not yet been characterized in Gluconacetobacter xylinus, however. (Kawano et al., 2002)
The first step of our computational design engineering was to identify the coding sequences and extract them from NCBI. We removed some native regulation by codon-optimizing the sequences for expression in E.coli and replaced the native RBS’s with the strong B0034 sequence. The 6 base pairs either side of the B0034 RBS were edited with the Salis Lab RBS calculator design function to tune RBS strength output to better preserve the natural stoichiometry.
Finally, in order to allow for even more customizable fine-tuning of"

The level of production has led to low overall production, low production capacity, and difficulty in industrialization. Among them, limonene is a very important anthraquinone fragrance. Similarly, limonene encounters chemical synthesis, which is complicated in process and has a great impact on the environment. Therefore, in combination with the characteristics of products and microorganisms, select appropriate hosts and develop corresponding genetic manipulation tools and methods. On the one hand, it helps to understand the metabolic regulation of organisms and form excellent chassis cells, on the other hand, it is beneficial to promote the commercial production process of biosynthesis of scented spices.
In previous studies, Yarrowia.lipolytica is a non-traditional yeast with great industrial application potential and is currently used in the industrial production of single-cell proteins, single-cell lipids and organic acids. Yarrowia.lipolytica has several advantages over other common industrial microorganisms and has been proven to be useful in the production of a variety of fine chemicals such as organic acids, sugar alcohols, DHA, carotenoids and the like. Numerous studies have shown that Yarrowia.lipolytica has the potential to become a good cell chassis, especially due to the synthesis of secondary metabolites derived from acetyl-CoA (such as terpenoids). However, there are few studies on the synthesis of terpenoids for this yeast, and the genetic manipulation tools and methods are relatively simple and inefficient.
In response to this bottleneck that needs to be broken, the project uses the high-efficiency biosynthesis of the important quinone-flavored limonene as a starting point, and the Yarrowia.lipolytica, which has been widely proven to be an excellent acetyl-CoA derivative, is a highly efficient strain. Enzyme self-assembly system.
The compound is an important part of the flavor. It is also a major ingredient in a large number of high-end flavors and fragrances, mainly found in plants. Terpenoids belong to the class of compounds, and their research is also within the scope of research on terpenoids. The synthesis of terpenoids is carried out via mevalonate pathway, MVA pathway, or 2C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway, MEP pathway, to obtain isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, followed by anthraquinones. The synthase catalyzes the formation of the corresponding backbone by IPP and DM"

Made competent cells. Grew up the DH5A in two 50mL tubes. Stopped and put the tubes on ice at different cell densities. The first of the two was stopped (put on ice) at around 0.22 OD600. The other was around 0.32 OD600. For both I centrifuged at 4 degrees and generally followed the protocol outlined here. One change (made after first centrifuge of the 0.22 OD600 cells (marked in blue with ""5"")) was to centrifuge at 4500rpm, rather than 6000 rpm. This was because the pellet was too firmly attached after the first centrifugation run. Additionally, I no longer used a pipette to resuspend. Instead (for the last 3 res"
USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#projectAlgorithm_-_-_TEXT.html," trees of the species. It should have same structure with template species after replacing ST part with matchings if it has the same structural pattern with the template one.
The basic idea is simple. We first consider the structural pattern matching between one chain and a chain template. There are two kind of parts on a chain template: substituent-type part (ST) and non-substituent-type part (NST). The whole template chain could be separated into blocks of ST parts and NST parts. Then we could break down the task to the matching of each small block. For each NST type block, we find all its matching regions on the chain to be matched and there may be more than one regions. Each of the combinations of all NST blocks forms a NST frame and restricts the matching regions of ST blocks. Therefore, the task is reduced to find matchings of each ST part block within a restricted region on the chain to be matched. At the present version of MoDeL, there are 6 ST part: ANY, ANYUB, NZ, NZUB, ONE and ONEUB. A general algorithm for all 6 type part is designed and we will illustrate this via an example. Consider a ST block with all ANY type parts (we use X to indicate ANY type part in the figures). We find matchings of the first part of the block. There may be many possible matchings because part of type ANY implies arbitrary matching of parts on one chain in MoDeL definitions. For each matching found, we deal with the next, and do the same thing recursively until the end of the template or matching fails. An easy example is shown in the figure to illustrate this simple idea.
After all possible matchings for each chain in the template have been found, we could choose any one from each to form a combination. In each combination, matchings of different chains should not be the same. For example, there are two chains in the template, T1 and T2, and three chains, C1, C2 and C3 in the species. If T1 has one matching to C1 and one to C2 and T2 has one to C2 and one to C3, the possible matchings are (T1,T2)->(C1, C2), (T1,T2)->(C1,C3) and (T1,T2)->(T2,T3). (T1,T2)->(C2,C2) is not allowed. The general matching relations could be written as (n1,n2,n3...)->(m1,m2,m3...), where (n"

She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.

She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

I have just finished my second year at the University of Calgary in biomedical sciences in the Bachelor of Health Sciences program. In the summer of 2008, I worked under a private investigator in the field of pulmonary surfactant. This year I am quite excited to be part of the iGEM team primarily because it is student-directed research and as a result, we are encouraged to provide input to the research tasks. This year, I will be part of the wetlab team working on mutant circuits in order to test the overall signaling circuit, and I will also be helping with the iGEM team wiki. I expect to learn about all the relevant laboratory techniques in the field, as well as receive a thorough understanding of the second life and marketing aspects of the project which will be required to ensure the overall team's success. Outside of my interest in biology, I am quite involved in all types of sports, in particular, being part of the U of C Dinos swim team.

I’ve just completed my second year in the Biomedical Sciences program at the University of Calgary. In 2007, I participated in the Sanofi Aventis biotechnology Challenge. This year, as a member of the iGEM team, I will be involved in developing community outreach to educate the community, mostly junior high and high school students about synthetic biology through the creation of a 3D virtual learning environment. I hope to better understand the use of technology in developing initiatives that promote education through exploration. I am excited to work with students from different disciplines to further explore the technology and applications of synthetic biology through multiple aspects, from the mathematical modeling of systems to the marketing of projects. Outside of the iGEM, I’ll most likely be baking, playing video-games, or going out with friends. I believe this summer will be an incredible learning experience. (^▽^) V  - <3

NortheasternU-Boston,2017,Team:NortheasternU-Boston#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," The reaction “MetAP Control Average”     contained all components of the cell-free reaction as well as MetAP DNA.     The reaction “Cells Only Control” contained only media and cells.
In the first attempt of the killing assay, we tested all twelve of our AMPs under both long and short promoters and in the presence of MetAP. The goal of this broader assay was to identify which AMP’s under which configuration were effective. Most of the AMPs under all configurations had OD’s within range of the 95% confidence interval of the control reaction. This control reaction contained cell-free buffer and water at the same volume as the AMP reaction in order to account for toxicity. However, ISGCock ( BBa_K2431022 ), BP100 ( BBa_K2431002 ), and Micrococcin ( BBa_K2431000 ) showed slightly lower OD’s than the control at most, if not all, of the promoter and MetAP configurations (Figure 1). However, due to the lack of DNA for replicates of these AMP reactions, no statistical conclusions could be drawn. In addition, for all of the AMPs there was a steady decrease in OD after about 5 hours, leading to widely varied data points that could not be analyzed. This was likely because of the evaporation of the media, due to a lack of a seal on the plate. Therefore, the data shown in Figure 1 only includes data points up to that point. In order to achieve replicates, we proceeded to do a second killing assay using only ISGCock ( BBa_K2431022 ), BP100 ( BBa_K2431002 ), and Micrococcin ( BBa_K2431000 ). Our second assay was run with sealed plates, which helped eliminated cell death due to evaporation. However, this assay indicated no difference in cell death between AMP reactions and control reactions (Figure 2). The OD’s for all reactions were remarkably consistent, indicating that our AMP was most likely not expressed at a meaningful level in our reactions.
In addition, the control containing only cells had a higher OD in general than all reactions containing cell-free buffer components, indicating that any toxicity was most likely due to the presence of this buffer. The discrepancy between the two killing assays could be due to multiple factors. Firstly, the AMP DNA for the second assay was prepared separately from the first assay. Any impurities in the final DNA template, such as ethanol or guanidinium may have contributed to cell death. Another factor that contribute to this discrepancy was the evaporation of the liquid cell cultures. This evaporation could have"

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html," are present. After taking into account the RFP generator we were still missing ~2000 bp. We decided to get this product sequenced in order to determine exactly what parts of the vector were being amplified by our vectors. For the thrC vector we saw a band around 4000 bp, which was exactly what we were expecting after taking the RFP generator into consideration!  Only one of the three replicates produced a band, and as mentioned previously, many unknown samples were found in our gel. We plan on modifying the protocol in order to receive more favourable results.Next week, we will try our PCR again using confirmation methods suggested by the 2012 LMU iGem team (threonine test for the thrC vectors, starch test for the amyE vector and colony PCR with their primers).
Week 11: July 7 - 11
During our weekly meeting with the faculty advisors, we further discussed the variables we will be manipulating to optimize our B. subtilis transformation protocol. Our supervisor Dr. Tony Schryvers suggested we not shake the cells in the incubator after exposing them to our plasmids. Based on his experience he warned us that vigorous shaking may sheer the pilus; a vital structure bacteria used for the uptake of DNA. -> (reference literature here)
In the lab, we continued with the task of optimizing our transformation protocol by testing the effects of higher xylose concentrations, using fresh comK cells, and omitting the shaker step following the addition of plasmids to our B. subtilis cells. In addition, we prepared MNGE-agar and starch plates in order to determine whether our integration vectors are being inserted into the proper loci.  -> (Nice pictures)
We also heard back from the LMU iGEM team regarding the unusual bands we saw in last week’s colony PCR of the integration vectors. They suggested that it may be an RNA contamination, thus we tried using RNase to remove the RNA. Unfortunately, no bands were seen on the gel created thereafter.  -> (Maybe a picture of last week’s gel beside the gel with no bands?)
Week 12: July 14 - 18
We did not get accurate results from last week’s optimization due to plating the bacteria on the wrong resistance plates. We redid the experiments but this time just focusing on transforming the ComK strain with the thrC vector and compared the effects of the following on transformation: 1% and 2% xylose, shaking and not shaking following xylose induction, and ComK cells that were stored in 10% and "

Involve open recruitment or connections. One of the teams at the finals had a computational team that created an evolutionary model of gene dynamics. (Prof. Bhalerao involved heavily in the computational side) o Bhalerao – it shouldn’t be done if it’s not 110% - The pep talk: Don’t lose commitment, you are chosen to represent Illinois. Don’t quit and do your job. o Bring it on! o Watch past presentations to realize the level of competition that we’re facing. They’re mind blowing. - 2 aspects to this experience: the synthetic biology (the idea, the research, the quality of the physical project), marketing (broad vision, best presentation, a sense of a dynamic vision is important, the judges like videos!) - Understanding synthetic biology: this is the big idea, understand it before anything else. Cut through the jargon. Take advantage of its flexibility. o When presenting to the judges, need to let them know that we’re doing synthetic biology, not nanobiology. - Meet with the advisors regularly to keep on track. Summary of Advisor’s labs: - Dr. Jin: Doing yeast and e. coli metabolic engineering. Engineer a pathway to create a phenotype of interest. All projects are about genetic manipulation and perturbation (also some environmental perturbation) in order to produce a phenotype faster, easier, cheaper. Will learn genetic manipulation, how to culture the cell in large scale and small scale (fermentation/bioreactors), mass spect to analyze the metabolic product. Also some computation in order to analyze results (but not a good idea to focus on in this time frame of 2-3 months). - Dr. Bhalerao: Pathogenic research. What happens to the stress response of the cell and the cell’s evolution in response to a metabolic engineering/gene circuit that you have put in the cell? Well it’s hard, so you look at evolution on the population scale. Can we control the evolution of the bug? If we so we can build better vaccines or harness these bugs for more work. (Example: can we control the evolution of pesticide resistant bugs?) Project: bacteriophage system. How does system change under different stresses? It’s complex to measure, so can we genetically modify these bacteria to visually tell us things? Will learn"

These solutions are shown in a figure X. As smaller droplets are being reinjected, we keep their volume constant through the range of volumes of produced droplets .
Figure 1. Droplet coalescence time dependence tcoal on fused droplet volumes V1 and V2
As we can see the coalescence time for the single value of V1 has some variation with a maximum. Scanning values from the smallest volume of produced droplet to the largest, there is a range of V2 (the produced droplet) with a longest coalescence time. When we look at the results for the larger droplets V1, the coalescence time increases. Also, we notice that the interval of coalescence times is shorter and variation is smaller. This means that if we are increasing the volume V1, the coalescence time increases, but the interval of possible droplet coalescence becomes smaller. If there’s no solution found, it means no coalescence is occurring for given conditions (droplet volumes, voltage and other).
Figure 2. Droplet coalescence time tcoal dependence on fused droplet volumes at different applied voltage Uapp values.
Next we compared the coalescence time results for various applied voltages Uapp. We chose 3 different values of the applied voltage (0.3V, 0.4V and 0.5V). We have found that even a small increase (0.1V) of voltage strongly affects the coalescence time. With our calculations, the tcoal reduces approximately by factor of 3 as we increase the voltage from 0.3V to 0.5V.
What is even more interesting, is that the interval of possible droplet coalescence does not shorten when we increase the voltage. It becomes shorter only when the volume V1 is increased as we discussed previously.
Having the results for various conditions (V1, V2, Uapp) we now need to determine which of these conditions are suitable for our droplet merging experiments. It is our goal to find a range of droplet volumes which can provide an efficient droplet coalescence.
Firstly, we need to have flow rates tuned appropriately so that the droplets do not pass the whole coalescence chamber without merging with a droplet from another droplet population. For that reason we chose tflow as an upper limit of the time it requires for the droplets to pass through the coalescence chamber. The flow time is"

After pouring it into the mold, great care was taken to ensure there were no bubbles left in the PDMS mixture. After being left to dry and hardened, a plasma generator was used to bind the cut out piece to a glass slide. The patterned wafer negative mold microfluidic chamber width is 14.562mm.  Its height is 21.3μm at the sidewall and 22.3μm in the middle.  A single pillar width is 1.611mm and “height” is 20.8μm.  The three microfluidic channel widths are 0.6688mm, 0.5472mm and 0.6080mm while the middle microfluidic channel height is 20.9μm. It can hold a water sample of 6.75 uL. Unfortunately, after testing it with ink we got negative results. Two chambers were tested and both collapsed. We are going to try again using shorter channels and combining pillars so there is a better support system.
Week of 9/29/14 through 10/4/14
This week our team had to split up. Two of our members-Kevin and Lyuda- went along with our adviser Professor Twaddle to Posters on the Hill for CCURI (Community College Undergraduate Research Initiative) in Washington D.C. While they were away, Karinne worked on subculturing into fresh broth so that we can make sure to have clean cell lines to work with.
Also, after an exchange of emails with the Carnegie Melon iGEM team we realized we would be able to help test a beta kit of theirs that make the DNA of wheat germ visible after only a few simple steps. It was easy to use and easy to understand and we thank the team profusely for the fun experience of this experiment!
We also started delving into the nanotech side of our project by running a protocol of various monolayers to test adhesion for the most favorable surface for biofilm adhesion. We are doing this to make a more optimal environment for the lyophilized cells that will be kept in the chamber of our device until a sample is introduced. 2% solution in acetone was used. After monolayers were added to slides they were incubated while being soaked in broth cultures of Top 10 E. coli cells.

In addition to this, as it was discovered later, the people present at the meeting were specialized namely in economics and jurisprudence, and only one geologist was present. It was difficult to explain the details of the project to people without the scientific background, and we found out that there is the significant misunderstanding of synthetic biology in Kazakhstan. Many people in our country still believe in stereotypes of the potential danger of GMO and that is why we decided to work more on the public engagement (you can see more detailed information in the section of PE).
Ecostandard LLP
Ecostandart KZ LLP improves technology for obtaining biological and technological bioremediation of oil-contaminated soils. This company produces biological products for the purification of oil-soil and water on a large scale. We had 3 meeting sessions and our collaboration was productive. On the first meeting, we presented projects to each other and discussed the current state of oil waste management problem in Kazakhstan. During the second meeting, we visited Ecostandard’s laboratory in the Technopark of the Nazarbayev University and we observed how purification of soil takes place at the initial stage. This experience was very valuable because we witnessed different methods of oil waste purification.  On our 3rd meeting, we were allowed to get samples of oily water wastes from Ecostandard’s laboratory and take them into our laboratory in university.  Additionally, we acquired lots of knowledge about oil water composition, its properties and optimum conditions for bacterial growth in it.
Shyndau LLP
Shyndau is a design and survey company that focuses on infrastructural support for other companies within Kazakhstan. Their work includes topographical and geotechnical investigations, development of appropriate project design with its necessary documentation and drilling of geotechnical boreholes. Our meeting with Shyndau in Atyrau was aimed to understand the geotechnical approaches of oil companies for the further development of our project design. With the help of their company, we were able to determine which type of oil is extracted from where with what type of process. Their geotechnical and geological skills assists us with our future plans to model a specific reservoir where our model organism will perform the process for bioremediation. They also suggested companies whom we may contact for further analysis of the oil fields and projects. In the future, they are happy to collaborate and sponsor our project.

Figure 1.4.1 2012 Freiburg gel result
The protocols we took to connect the parts of TALE
1. Freiburg's protocol
2. Restriction enzyme digestion of plasmid and TAL direpeats, followed by gel extraction. By the mole ratio, plasmid to TALE is 1 to 5 and TALE to TALE is 1 to 1. Ligation with T4 ligase in 22 ℃ over night.
3. With the same ratio of plasmid and TALE direpeats, add the TALE direpeats one by one and connect them in 22 ℃, 30 minutes.
4. Every two parts connect at one time, and try to make three intermediates of 400bp. And then mix the plasmids to make the complete TALE.
5. The same ratio and connect following the program of 22℃ 2min, 40℃ 30s, 25 repeats.
The motivation to improve 2012 Freiburg’s parts
Unfortunately, all of our attempts failed. We didn’t manage to make a complete TALE, or even make two of them together. However, what is important for us is that when we tried the 5th protocol, we noticed an unexpected result. When we analyzed the sequence result, we found that our left adaptor, 1st part and right adaptor connected together. Why did we get this result? We noticed that their sticky ends are TGAC, GCTC, and ACTC. That is to say, GCTC and ACTC might have connected with each other by mistake. In another word, if the sticky ends are very similar, they probably connect with each other. Although we failed again, the result gave us confidence to improve 2012 Freiburg's parts.
How do we connect certain monomer?
Some advanced tips for TALE protein
1. Given a sample sequence with repeating amino acids:
Figure 1.4.2 TALE amino acid sequence
What XX means is that it determines the certain kind of base. For one unit of repetition, other amino acids can be identical.
2. A fully functional TALE protein contains a segment of sequence before repetitive units, recognizing first base T. It also contains a similar segment sequence but it is only half length as the repetitive unit which can recognize the last base"

TAS_Taipei,2015,Team:TAS Taipei#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," (Lonsdale et al.). This models negative flux entering a closed surface. For our model, we want to model the flux that leaves the closed surface, which is our bandage. Thus, we use the model
, where J is a positive flux.
[Concentration] is the concentration of molecules inside the bandage, in our case the GzmB inhibitor. The thickness of the membrane is inversely related to J. D is the diffusivity, or the diffusion constant, of a certain configuration – a greater D generally represents a greater rate of diffusion. In our model, the diffusivity of our cellulose ester membrane was found to be 5.7x10^-6 cm^2/sec. Therefore, our diffusion model is
.
When graphed, the 3-dimensional equation looks like Figure 3 below:
Figure 3. Flux relative to concentration and membrane thickness. Fick's first law was used to predict the rate of flow across the membrane.
As demonstrated by the graph, thickness is inversely related to the diffusion rate; on the other hand, concentration is directly related to the diffusion rate. As part of future work, we can try to combine this model with the calculator to find proper treatment concentration, perhaps mathematically integrating the flux to determine an effective concentration that the bandage delivers. However, this would likely require experimental data to verify the accuracy of our current models.

We Helped Five other iGEM teams
1. UGA-Georgia iGEM Team
We helped the UGA-Georgia iGEM Team by characterizing their mCherry-based reporter system
The Genspace iGEM team helped the University of Georgia iGEM Team by participating in the Archaeal InterLab Study to further characterize the reproducibility of their mCherry reporter system. We received frozen  cell lysates from them and followed the protocol below to develop the mCherry RFP overnight with shaking at 30C. The samples were then read in a plate reader with an excitation wavelength of  590nm and an emission wavelength of 645nm. The data were submitted to the UGA-Georgia team via their data submission form. A table of the data is presented below.
Here is the UGA Archaeal Collaboration Study Protocol:
As soon as you receive your samples in the mail, place them in a freezer (-80C) in order to reduce potential protein damages that may incur from freezing and thawing.
We recommend that you place your samples in the freezer and take time to read over our protocol as well as prepare  your plan of action.
You have been given 30 total samples, (i.e., triplicate cell extracts obtained from 10 colonies, and please stay in accordance with our labels throughout your experiment.)
&nbsp
Each sample contains 10 ul of cell extracts. The buffer used is 25 mM PIPES pH 6.8. The PIPES should act as a negative control in your experiment. If PIPES is not available, a buffer with the same pH may be sufficient.
Remove samples from the freezer and place in a shaker at 30C for overnight incubation. (This step is necessary because our cells are grown anaerobically but the fluorophore of mCherry fluorescent protein requires sufficient oxygen exposure for maturation.)
Using “8B” determine the linear range for your measurement device.
We recorded the highest fluorescence from sample “8B,” so if this is found to be in the linear range, then all the other samples will be as well.
Our device required a 200 ul sample, so"

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Bacteriocins_-_-_TEXT.html," Class IV, complex bacteriocins. In our project most of the bacteriocins are class II, because they are small and typically not modified post-translationally.
Class I Include lantibiotics, which are denominated by the presence and unusual amount of the modified amino acid lanthionine in the peptide structure. The lantibiotics are small, have a low molecular weight (<5 kDa), heat-stable peptide inhibitors that contain several post-translational modified amino acids. The amino acids are modified in a two-step process that includes enzymatic dehydration by specific amino acids followed by thiol attack from neighboring cysteine amino acids, which results in a condensation between two neighboring residues and thus the formation of a fully structured and functional lantibiotic. The lantibiotics can be divided into subclasses according to the overall structure, as they form more complex operons when needing additional genes encoding enzymes for posttranslational modification Balciunas, E.

Alginate Beads
To think the project through to the end, we spent some thought on the application of our system. The purpose of E.colipse is sun protection and warning if the radiation is harmful. To actually protect and warn, we need to apply the bacterial. Our first thought was the intelligent sunscreen, where bacteria like E.coli live in alginate beads. These beads contain media and bacteria and can possibly deal with the safety issue of liberating genetically modified bacteria into the environment. The tiny beads can be used as an emulsion for a sunscreen product.
Skin flora
Another idea would be to implement our system into bacteria like Staphylococcus epidermis that are naturally part of human skin flora. The engineering of natural occuring bacteria with our system would enable a area wide covering of the skin and a reliable protection independent of whether one uses sun screen or not! This science fictional application of engineered bacteria can increase human health in far future.
UV resistant bacteria
During the European Jamboree in Amsterdam, another possible application of our system became evident: Some iGEM projects, specially those in the Environment track, imply that, at some point, bacteria operate outside in the wild. Our system can make bacteria themselves more resistant to dangerous UV radiation, thus avoiding mutation of the bacterial DNA and increase the bacterias fitness.

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

ICT-Mumbai is working on dealing with the problem of excessive ammonia in toilets and chemistry labs. They contacted us via email after reading our abstract and found out that we both deal with excessive ammonia. We collected air samples from the toilets and chemistry laboratories in Huairou Campus of UCAS, and assayed them following their standardized protocol. We are glad that this data is helpful for improving ICT-Mumbai’s project.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food. Wish them good results!

Education
“From Lab For Society”
Doing research and explore a new thing which will be useful for society is really important, but, the other thing that also important is the socialization to society. So, we bring synthetic biology to solve society’s problem.
We are visiting Indonesia Child Cancer Care Foundation in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia. The foundation is established on the basis of concern for the rise of cancer that occurs in children. By the time we tell the management of the foundation that our focus was cervical cancer, surprisingly the foundation said that there are some children infected with cervical cancer, myom and a cyst ( to fyl further kept secret for the sake of patients ). The foundation also suggested students to socialize more often to society from all age  so cancer prevention can be done.
According to Ms. Novi, as Volunteer Coordinator, many cancer patients due to lack of knowledge about cancer in society. It causes people less careful and many new cancer cases have been detected at late stage. Therefore she really supports our research on early detection of cervical cancer.
We made several visits to the foundation. There, we aided by Gencorp organization from Surabaya in giving encouragement to cancer patients. We also discussed about things that we can do for cancer patients. One thing that we will never forget is that we were invited to visit hospitals and meet cancer patient directly. We are so far, only serves in the scale of laboratory in developing the treatment of cancer, a direct view of how the treatment of cancer research is needed. It gives us spirit in resolving this research. Be closer to patients aforetime and feel how this research has a lot of meaning.
Besides being active in activities at the foundation, we also give the material to friends in the traveling community GAMANANTA, which is a large community of traveler Indonesia, about how to maintain the health of vital organs during travel. This was greeted with great enthusiasm, we even double enthusiastic. We believe that, by sharing, the knowledge that we have will provide a double benefit to the community.

KillerRed's structure, chemistry and biophysical properties
Figure 1: Crystal Structure of KillerRed (PDB ID: 3GB3) with the QYG chromophore shown2,3,4
Figure 2: ß-barrel shape of a KillerRed monomer.2,3,4 PDB ID: 2WIQ
KillerRed is a red fluorescent protein that produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of yellow-orange light (540-585 nm). KillerRed is engineered from anm2CP to be phototoxic. It has been shown that KillerRed produces superoxide radical anions by reacting with water. Superoxide reacts with the chromophore of KillerRed, causing it to become dark, which ultimately gives rise to a bleaching effect. KillerRed is spectrally similar to mRFP1 with a similar brightness. KillerRed is oligomeric and may form large aggregates in cells. Expression of KillerRed and irradiation with light may act as a kill-switch for biosafety applications.
The structure of KillerRed has been analyzed and the structural basis for its toxicity has been explored. The relevant PDB IDs are 2WIQ and 2WIS for the fluorescent and dark states, respectively.
The surface of KillerRed is predominantly negatively charged (indicated by red areas) as shown in Figures 3-6. The theoretical charge at pH 7.4 is approximately -13 (pI=5.1), which may play a role in its toxicity by interacting more closely with positively charged proteins and positively charged regions of proteins.

Sequencing results, when aligned to our original construct using Geneious, confirmed that pSB1C3 contained Seq9. This sequence was sent to the registry as Bba_K2616002 .
Figure 20: Alignment of sequencing results for BBa_K2616002. Sequencing perform in pSB1C3 and two primers were designed (FOR1 and FOR2) to cover the whole sequence. Image from Geneious. Pairwise Identity: 100%.
The construction was successfully assembled. In Figure 20, we show that we used two different primers, allowing us to cover the whole sequence without mistakes. As visible, the mismatches are only present at the extremities of each primer sequencing. The final basepair identity is 100%.
Test of kill-switch efficiency
To test the efficiency of our kill-switch, we decided to cultivate transformed BL21(DE3) pLysS E. coli at several temperatures (15°C, 20°C, 25°C and 37°C). We used BL21(DE3) pLysS E. coli transformed with the empty pSB1C3 plasmid as the negative control. The bacteria growth was followed by measuring the optical density at 600 nm every 30 minutes for 6 hours, followed by two additional points at 18 hours and at 72 hours. Each experiment was done in triplicate and the standard deviation was calculated for every point. We showed that bacteria transformed with the kill-switch presented no measurable growth at 15°C and at 20°C during the 72 hours of the experiment, whereas the control population grew normally (Figure 21).
At 25°C, the kill-switch population grew more slowly than the control for the first 18 hours, but the growth eventually started to reach normal values at 72 hours.
Finally, at 37°C there was no difference in the growth of the kill-switch population compared to the control bacteria.
Figure 21: Effect of different temperatures on the growth of Cryodeath kill-switch transformed BL21(DE3) pLysS E. coli
Thus, we successfully guarantee that our engineered bacteria will not be able to grow if they happened to be released in the environment.

Bait attractiveness
Our experiment shows that the bait we use is strongly attractive to termites. When facing with baits and normal wood, termites will always choose our baits. This ensure that our device will successfully attract the termites even there is many other food.
Fig 1. Wood powder has been placed in the petri dish for 10 min. (A) 0 min after baits added. (B) 1 min after baits added. Termites begin to move to the baits. (C) 5 min after baits added. Most termites are surrounding around the baits.
Chosen compound toxicity verification
We prove that Avermectin and the mix of our toxic protein are both toxic to termites. Using the Streptomyces and TT01, the Avermectin seems to work better.
Fig 2. Toxicity verification of Avermectin and toxic protein. Avermectin works well at killing termites.
Cellulase and lysozyme activity measurement
When worker termites are taking the food back to their nest, they will keep the food in their mouth. According to our result, the cellulase activity in termites’ head is relatively low"

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," identify biosensor based projects (Aalto-Helsinki iGEM team, 2014). The search terms used to identify potentially relevant projects were “sense” and “biosensor”. 121 projects were identified by these search terms. In projects including multiple sensors, the most well characterised sensors were used for this review. Sensor designs, rather than constructed biosensors, were used for analysis, as time constraints in iGEM often prevents project completion. Ten projects were unable to be reviewed because their wiki was broken. Of the remaining 111 projects, 18 projects were deemed not eligible for further analysis. This was either due to a lack of information regarding biosensor mechanism provided by the team or their project was irrelevant. Three projects were excluded as the sensing component of their project was unchanged from a previous project, to prevent the overrepresentation of biosensors in our database. Therefore, a total of 93 biosensors were used for analysis in our systematic review (Figure 3 and Table 1). The systematic review revealed that all biosensors could be split into four components: 1) Detector: The part responsible for detection of the target molecules. For example, riboswitches and transcription factors. 2) Processing: Adds downstream processing to a signal, which enables response turning. For example, logic gates, signal amplification and sensitivity tuning. 3) Reporter or output: Produces a response to the target. For example, fluorescent proteins and beta-galactosidase. Additionally, some biosensors may produce outputs which interact with the target molecule once it has been sensed, such as the production of degradation enzymes in bioremediation projects. We have termed these outputs as “effectors”. 4) Adaptors: If the molecule is hard to detect, adaptor components can be placed before the detector unit, to convert the target molecules to something able to be sensed by the detector component. For example, for target that degrades into an easily detectable molecule, a biochemical conversion adaptor could be placed before the detector component which enzymatically degrades the target molecule into the molecule detected by the detector module.
Figure 3: Frequency of projects based on biosensors development in iGEM.
Table 1: Percentages of biosensors components used in iGEM.
We propose that splitting these modular biosensor components into different cells, as shown below, and co-culturing the cells together, will greatly reduce the complexity of biosensor circuit development.
Implementation
To prove that our concept of splitting biosensors across multiple cells would work, we designed an IPTG sensor. The design of this system can be found"
TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Project#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," lot here. Looking at the underlying problem a huge amount of PET is used for package. A focus on regional products would help to prevent ecologic cost not only concerning plastic but also exhaust gases (transport). Why is PET used in clothes? Are there no natural alternatives? What about forcing producers of washing machines to include filters for extracting PET?  There are a lot of things which might be changed to reduce the amount of new PET in marine environments. Additional to these restrictions for commercial activities, politics should also give more funding for extraction methods (of PET from sea water) and basic material research. Materials from nature are often healthier and bio friendly then chemical synthesized ones. So why do not use them? Is it really true that politics can take no rational decision as long as there are economic interests and lobby work.  If synthetic biology can be used to help mankind to clean the planet why should we not use it responsible and sensitive? For politics this means that there has to be more focus on long range plans and sustainability. Decisions should be taken in order to improve life quality for everyone. Maybe it is time for a value change. Maybe it is time for synthetic biology?
