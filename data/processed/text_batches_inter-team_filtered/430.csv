Design of our sub-projects
Protein Import
Control over the peroxisomal proteome is an essential requirement for our project. Our objective is the obtainment of a fully orthogonal import system by utilizing the two peroxins Pex5 and Pex7.
Engineering of Pex5 and PTS1
Designing our receptors
To achieve the engineering of an orthogonal import pathway, we followed two approaches regarding Pex5. The first is based on targeted mutagenesis based on educated guesses which is first verified by molecular dynamics and later experimentally in the laboratory.    The second approach is based on a recently published paper: We searched for literature dealing with the modification of the peroxisomal import machinery. During our research we came across a paper of Alison Baker et al., published in 2017, in which they present a synthetic construct of the Pex5 protein, partly Arabidopsis thaliana and partly Physcomitrella patens. Compared to the wild type Pex5, this one shows different binding affinities since it interacts with a PTS1* variant that does not interact with the wild type Pex5. Since the protein sequences of yeast's and plants's Pex5 differ quite a lot, we aligned both sequences to understand where the mutations were set.
Figure 1.1: Alignment of the Arabidopsis thaliana's PEX5 and Saccharomyces cerevisiaePex5
Figure 1.2: Alignment of the yeast’s Pex5 with the Pex5 variant R19
The alignment shows three red marked amino acids we changed in our receptor sequence. Interestingly, these mutations are located within the TPR motifs of our Pex5 protein and this persuaded us to try out this receptor, we call it R19. Due to lack of time we tested this Pex5 variant in silico and in vivo simultaneously. We started molecular dynamics simulations with a couple of PTS variants that we already tested with our previous designs − one of them was actually the variant they used in the paper (YQSYY). The details and results of our structural modeling can be found in the modeling section .
Furthermore, we synthesized this variant and together with two receptors we designed based on educated guesses we got three receptors for our experimental work.

Meet Dinula De Silva
I am a grade 12 student at Winston Churchill High School. I enjoy programming, playing the guitar, and watching movies. When I’m not stuck indoors, I like going running and biking. I joined iGEM because the feats of synthetic biology fascinated me and I wanted to learn more about the processes involved. I additionally wanted to develop my computer programming skills by working on the wiki and software aspect of the competition.
I wish I were adenine, because then I could get paired with U ;)

Meet Eyram Asem
Howdy! My name is Eyram and I am in grade 11 at Winston Churchill High School. I joined iGem because I thought that it would be a great opportunity to gain lab experience, learn about synthetic biology, and meet some groovy people; all of which happened! I love reading novels, hanging out with my friends, eating food, and having spontaneous dance parties (with only myself present of course).  I hate the sound of Styrofoam, wearing my glasses, and waking up late.
You're so hot, you might be the cause of global warming ;)

Introduction
Our optogenetic toolbox enhancements can be divided into three subgroups: controllable protein import via Pex5, controllable protein import via Pex7 and controllable gene expression. Each of these sub-projects are of different design which will be illustrated in the following.
Pex5 import with LOV2
LOV2 is an optogenetic protein derived from Avena sativa’s Phototropin 1. In its dark state the J$_{\alpha}$-helix located at the C-terminus is bound to the core of the protein. Upon irradiation with blue light (~460 nm), a covalent bond between a cysteine residue on the LOV2 protein and a flavin mononucleotide chromophore causes the J$_{\alpha}$-helix to unfold, which in turn exposes the C-terminus (Spiltoir et al, 2016) .  This property is very useful, as short amino acid sequences can be attached to this end of the LOV-protein, for example a PTS1. The idea for this project was to attach PTS1 to the C-terminus and the protein of interest to the N-terminus. Upon irradiation with blue light, the fusion protein would be imported into our compartment. We used a mutated version of LOV2 whose C-terminus has an increased dark-state binding affinity. This is caused by the substitutions and T406A and T407A. These mutations greatly reduce the possibility of the J$_{\alpha}$-helix being exposed in the dark state. Our PTS1 sequence consists of the amino acids LQSKL. As a proof of concept for this construct we fused sfGFP to its N-terminus:
Figure 9.1 Level 1 plasmid containing the sequence coding for the GFP-LOV2-PTS1 fusion protein
This was done in order to visualize our experiment’s results during microscopy: upon successful import of the fusion protein, one would observe GFP fluorescence localized to our compartment. Otherwise, the whole cell would be illuminated.
Pex7 import
The idea behind this project is to initially block the protein of interest’s PTS2 with a fluorescent protein which can be removed by an optogenetically activated TEV-protease. For this project we use the protein Phytochrome-B from Arabidopsis thaliana and its interaction partner PIF6. These two proteins, also derived from Arabidopsis thaliana, bind together upon irradi"

Theory of USER Cloning
The Registry of Standard Biological Parts and most iGEM teams use the conventional 3A Standard Assembly protocol to gather BioBricks together.  However, we are using USER, uracil-specific excision reaction, cloning. Why? The method uses neither restriction enzymes nor ligase, it is simple and rapid, and it enables the simultaneous assembly of multiple target DNA sequences into a plasmid vector. In addition, it avoids any troubles with illegal restriction sites and it leaves no scars thus making it ideal for protein fusions etc.
The USER concept was introduced to the iGEM competition in 2009 by the DTU Denmark team. Two years after, the DTU-2 team took it a step further and made a standardized system based on the principle of USER cloning. They named it the Plug’n’Play system.
The recipe is simple: Mix pre-produced PCR product and backbone vector with USER enzyme and your parts are putted together.
More detailed, the template DNA is amplified using primers designed with an upstream row of 8-9 nucleotides with one deoxyuridine directly upstream of the gene. In this way, the PCR product will be flanked by linkers on both sides. To allow assembly of multiple PCR product in a specific order, each given part need to have its own unique linker sequence.
The concept is shown in the figure below where six different BioBricks are assembled.
(figure made by DTU-Denmark2 iGEM 2011)
Linker tabel provides information about each individual linker sequence and the primer design.
(figure made by DTU-Denmark2 iGEM 2011)
Upon mixing of the PCR products, the solution is treated with Dpn1 in order to remove the template DNA. The USER enzyme will afterwards remove the uracil bases creating 8-9 nucleotide overhangs in the 3’end. These sticky ends will hybridize to matching overhangs created in the assembly backbone vector. The final step is to incubate and transform the solution into E.coli, which will later grow agar plates.
The figure below illustrates the easy steps:

The difference between the initial density of                         a target σI and a non-specific region                         (σNS) will affect to the difference in the                         free energy needed to untwist the on-target DNA                         region:
As we could not determine the chromatin state and its                         evolution during the time that CRISPR/Cas9 was working                         on the plant, we could not study this parameter. Nevertheless, information about the chromatin                         supercoiling has been indirectly introduced in our                         model.
Since high transcription activities can be synonym of relaxed chromatin (12, 13), we can assume that supercoiling will not be affecting to our Testing                         System, as it has the 35S promotor (a                         constitutive promotor with high activity (4)). Moreover,                         the difference in DNA supercoiling between the target                         and off-targets, can be considered nearly zero because                         potential off-targets will be those genes of Nicotiana benthamiana which are highly                         transcribed.

Main remarks
In order to reduce the random influence of                         three-dimensional diffusion of the complex, we                         suggested introducing the gRNA and the Testing System                         constructions one next to the other. Single mismatches                         positioned downstream the 11th-10 th nucleotide of the gRNA, lead to a                         positive free energy increment, i.e. they make unable                         the R-loop between that gRNA and the DNA target.

Restriction
In our laboratory, we experienced some trouble with restriction ligation cloning. Therefore, I aimed for checking the efficiency of all restriction enzymes used in the cloning process. I used the pACYCDuet-1 plasmid and restricted this plasmid with the restriction enzyme XbaI and one of the restriction enzymes EcoRI, KpnI, NotI or FseI. To compare, I restricted the pACYCDuet-1 plasmid only with XbaI and as negative control I used no restriction enzyme to cut pACYCDuet-1.
The following table shows an overview of what fragment(s) were cut with what restriction enzyme(s).

Community Outreach
We had several meetings this week one of which was with      Dr. Shaman, a skin swabbing expert, to discuss our idea      for community outreach. Dr. Shaman had collaborated with      the Museum of Natural History to swab skin biomes in the      skin biome exhibit. He suggested that we avoid      collaborating with the museum due to the extensive IRB      process and provisions of the board of trustees. He also      cautioned our timeline and monetary expenses.
Keratinocyte Experiments
We met with Dr. Prince who is a skin bacteria specialist      to discuss collaboration. We planned to conduct      experiments to determine how the bacteria strains and      rhamnolipids affect skin cell viability. Dr. Prince liked      our idea and put us in contact with a graduate student in      her laboratory to gather more information. She agreed to      provide her lab space, human skin cells (keratinocyte),      cell media, and other reagents to aid in our experiments.

Molecular Cloning
Our Gibson assembly worked for two different promoters; we      now have two constructs transformed in E. coli including a      strong promoter from Streptococcus pneumoniae and a weak      promoter from Propionibacterium acnes. We started to work      on the construction of BioBrick parts. We began to build      BioBricks for different promoters for the RhlAB operon. We      made plans to characterize the promoters in E. coli,      P. aeruginosa, and P. putida. This week, we also continued      experiments to transform recombinant plasmids into      P. putida using electroporation. We contacted Dr. Jiang      from the Marraffini Rockefeller University to obtain the      S. epidermidis strains, recommended plasmids, and shuttle      vector for transformation/conjugation. He also sent us      specific protocols to utilize with this strain.
Rhamnolipid Quantification
We conducted more CTAB experiments in which we made test plates with different concentrations of rhamnolipids to      make a standard curve using the diameters of the halos for      our quantitative measure. Unfortunately, we determined      that the halo diameter varies with the thickness of the      CTAB on plates in that thicker plates give bigger halos      for the same concentration of rhamnolipids. This      characteristic created inconsistency across different CTAB      plates. There were no visible halos for low concentrations      of rhamnolipids indicating that we might need to"

The supernatant was decanted and the cells were re-suspended in 40 mL M9 minimal media and incubated with 10 mg of lysozyme for 10 minutes. This cell extract was spun down at 10000 rcf for 30 minutes. The supernatant was taken off and spun at 30000 rcf (S30) for 1 hour. The supernatant of the S30 samples was divided. Half the samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80oC. The second half was spun at 100000 rcf for 45 minutes (S100).
In order to measure the 2-HMS production we needed to determine the concentration of protein per volume of cell extract. To determine the total protein concentration of the S30 and S100 extracts a Bradford assay was conducted using a standard curve of BSA. Concentrations of the negative controls (Escherichia coli DH5α hosting the pUC19 plasmid) for each of the S30 and S100 samples were also determined. Absorbance readings were taken at a 595 nm wavelength and concentration reported in µg/mL.

Protein mass of S30 and S100 (and S30 Control/S100 Control) extracts were normalized to between 2µg and 10µg in 1mL of either 20mM Tris pH 8.0 or double distilled water. Catechol was added to normalized cell extract at a final concentration of 0.05 mM. The subsequent production of 2-HMS was observed as a function of time by recording absorbance at 375 nm over the ten minute period immediately following the addition of catechol.
Results
Figure 3 displays that catechol 2,3-dioxygenase can degrade catechol in vitro, producing 2-HMS. We also observe that when approximately twice the amount of S30 extract is added to an excess catechol solution, production of 2-HMS is increased approximately twofold. This suggests that the enzyme (rather than substrate) is the limiting component in catechol degradation by catechol 2,"

Outline
We aim to establish Aspergillus niger as a promising host in synthetic biology and in iGEM in particular. Therefore we introduce a range of simple bio-reporters such as pH, ATP sensors and chromoproteins, to increase the usability of the Aspergillus toolbox. Here, we focus on chromoproteins which are pigments obtained from corals. Chromoproteins have been characterized, codon-optimized and standardized in E. coli before by the Uppsala 2011 team . However, even though multiple different pigment coding genes can be found in the standard biological parts registry , none have been tested in filamentous fungi.
Introduction

Figure 3: A submerged egg yolk with visible white membrane structure (chalaza).
After some purification relatively pure membranes can be obtained. White like sheet can be manipulated using pincers or any similarly shaped tool with no sharp edges.
The membrane should be cut to appropriate size (smaller is better).
Figure 4: Purified membrane in a petri dish.
""Fixation"" of the membrane
After several attempts a glue was found to be a better alternative to wax. The membrane had to be held tightly against the bottom of the chamber covering the holes, so that no liquid can pass between the membrane and the chamber bottom. Since any mechanical pressure system i.e. with rubber bands pressing against the membrane would inevitably result in its penetration, a glue was used instead. Dropping melted wax seemed to be a better solution at first, since it allowed for a very fine manipulation, but after it hardened it tended to separate from the base of the chamber thus destroying its purpose. The following figure (figure 5) illustrates the crude design of the chamber:
Figure 5: A schematics of the ""hardware"". Into plastic cups the holes were made, which were later covered with membrane.
Tests for quality - leakiness
Each membrane was tested for leakines. Some water was placed in the chamber and a paper tissue was placed below. Upon any signs of water on the tissue the chamber was discarded.
Final setup
In the final setup two chambers were separated by glued egg yolk membrane with different orientations. Initially the outer side of the membrane (that was originally facing the white of the egg) was facing the medium with bacteria.
The overnight culture of needed strain was incubated in 1% arabinose (w/w%) and 1mM IPTG for 2 hours prior to being poured over membrane (In next experiments this time was increased to an overnight incubation). Approximately 1 mL of overnight culture was poured into upper chamber while in collection chamber there was LB media (3-4mL) with antibiotic Chloramphenicol. Previous experiments characterizing the pBAD arabinose promoter  suggested that 1% arabinose was optimal for our setup.
Figure 6: As can be seen from the pictures improvisation was an important part of the experiment. Two plastic cups were cut and on the upper one holes were made with heated needle. After gluing the egg yolk membrane and testing for leakage, the setup was placed on the petri dish to minimize further contamination.  In the presented picture the violet red colour comes from the mCherry fluorescent protein that was produced by strain having"

RNA Interference
RNA interference (RNAi) is the inhibition of gene expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules binding to complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences and so stopping translation of that protein. Our team has decided to use this method to stop the translation of a virulence gene required for our target bacteria to cause infection.
spiRNA
By using the process of RNAi we needed to create a siRNA that specifically targets Vibrio cholerae and Shigella. It will then inhibit the target bacterium and bind to a virulence gene blocking the production of that important protein. We have decided to rename our small interfering RNA Agent spiRNA.
S.O.R.D.
In order for us to even begin to target the bacteria Shigella and Vibrio cholerae we had to come up with a way of getting our spiRNA outside of the E. coli. We decided to focus on the protein OsmY naturally found in E. coli that is regularly secreted from the bacteria. As Hfq is an RNA binding protein it will be able to bind with our spiRNA and fusing it with OsmY creates a predicted RNA secretion device that we have named S.O.R.D. (Secretor Of RNA Device).
Expression system
Each spiRNA can be separated into two main parts, each having their specific function; the first being a sequence specific to binding with Hfq and the second being a sequence specific to the gene we want to target.
The blue area is the part that will bind to the Hfq in our fusion protein - using the binding site from micC for E. coli and chiA for Serratia. Then to make the spiRNA specific to the bacteria we want to target, we’ll add in a target-binding sequence. This is the red area and the sequence will be complimentary to the first 24bp on the mRNA strand.
A future plan for our project would be that both our expression system and our fusion protein would be on one plasmid.

The overnight reduction of methylene blue and neutral red, which is visually obvious from the color change but also checked with a plate reader, comes from the bacteria’s ability to reduce the chemicals appropriately.   Based on Dr. Parra suggestions and its widespread use, methylene blue was used as the exogenous mediator in all future experiments after we confirmed that our strains were able to reduce it.

Considering the Equation 1 and Fig. 13, we try to map the difference of Gibbs free energy to the binding constant K for approximation approach. Due to the fact that the relationship of delta Gon and difference of Gibbs free energy is hard to investigate, we use the MM/PBSA method to mimic the binding constant K. It is intuitive that higher difference of Gibbs free energy and the stronger the binding constant.
Equation 1. The relationship of Gibbs free energy and the association constant KA.
Figure 13. The Gibbs free energy for sRNA-mediated binding.
The calculations with PBSA are listed in the Table 3. The RNA or DNA structures are often stabilized by the hydrogen bond (H-bond). This H-bond, however, does not affect the binding energy of RNA duplex a lot in our study, meaning that there is no obvious fact of lower Gibbs free energy with higher CG. The distortion of structure is the main reason to affect the contribution of H-bond in RNA binding. According to this issue, the variations of MD calculations exist in the absolute binding energy [15]. For correction this, we analyze the fitting for the experimental binding energy vs. calculated energy in PBSA model. Some important papers for describing MM/PBSA methods indicate that the usage of PBSA are more reliable [16, 17].
Table 3. The MD calculation for Gibbs Free energy for sRNA-mediated binding.
We illustrate the good-fitting in Fig. 14 for the relation of experimental energy vs. MD calculated energy. This result implies the existence of linearity relationship among the binding energies of experimental and MD calculated. Therefore, it is possible to use this result to mapping the binding constant K from RyhB-sodB to the others sRNA-target.

Aachen,2015,Team:Aachen#Practices#Community Labs_-_-_TEXT.html," a variety of different DIY Biology projects. When we mentioned that this year only one European Community Lab is participating in the iGEM Competition, they revealed to already consider a participation in 2016. We would really appreciate that and hope that they can act as role model to encourage more people in Europe to found a Community Lab.

Conclusion
As our journey through the multifaceted world of Community Labs comes to an end, we completed it by having a concluding skype call with the people who accompanied us at the start, the members of the iGEM Team Darmstadt.
After our last meeting, the iGEM Team Darmstadt had lead a panel discussion about the ""Risks and chances of community labs"" (please visit their wiki for further information). They shared their results and we shared our experiences in outlining how we helped Community Labs and how Community Labs helped us. We then came to a joint conclusion.
Concluding discussion with iGEM Team Darmstadt
While they focussed on legal aspects, especially the detailed German laws concerning the creation of a lab at home, we layed our focus on infrastructural, educational and social aspects. The iGEM Team Darmstadt found out that the very strict laws in Germany make the establishment of a biohackerspace rather difficult. This matches the disparity in governmental support for the different Community Labs we have met. While the German Technik Garage is subjected to a lot of rules and restrictions, the Dutch Waag Society is even promoted by the government to teach about and enable DIY Biology at home.
Having a realistic risk assessment, most of the public concerns can be resolved easily. Especially the putative threat of bioterrorism is an emotional fear rather than a rational one. On the contrary, a spreading of Community Labs promotes “open science” and possesses an inherent beneficial potential. One of the great benefits would be to give the people the chance to make chemical and biological tests of water quality, food, medicine etc. This would largely increase the consumer protection. In addition, Community Labs are often very ambitious in their efforts to educate the public. They also contribute to society on other levels e.g. driving forward exeptional aspects as BioArt.
To conclude, we are convinced, that a further growing European Community Lab scene will have benefits for society and science. However, to promote the establishments of more Community Labs in Europe, we need to review the strict restrictions and increase connectivity through cross-linking networks like Medlife.

Runs Before Failure
To characterize the amount of runs the XY-stage can perform before failure, we ran TERRA through a set of 15 trials in which fluid was dispensed into two different wells ten times. These trials were run independently from each other by resetting TERRA in between trials.  In each trial, two outputs were simulated--one outputting at location 45, and the latter outputting at location 90. The experiments allowed us to understand how many loops TERRA would run through before it fails to output into a correct well location, and therefore requires a reset.
Terra averages around 8 runs before it requires a reset. A reset consists of rehoming the device from its starting point, readjusting the tubing, and resetting the plate on the plane.
Speed and Time
A set of 15 trials were run in order to determine the speed of the plate support of the XY-stage. The plate support traveled a distance of 108mm. The time taken to travel was recorded for each trial and then averaged. To calculate the average speed, the distance traveled was divided by the time per run.
The average time taken to transverse the 108 mm was 39.306 seconds. From that, we determined that, with a microstep of 1/4 steps, the XY-stage moves at an average speed of 2.75 mm/sec. The average time taken to travel between wells on a 96 well plate was 3.28 seconds.
Since the time taken to travel is dependent on the distance between the center of each well, we can extrapolate from this data to find the average time taken to travel from well-to-well on multiple types of microtiter plates.

Investigate Mutation Rates by High-throughput Sequencing
Determine Mutation by High-throughput Sequencing
After showing mutation by reversion, we wanted to analyze our mutation parts by next-generation sequencing (NGS) in more detail. NGS presents a method to measure mutation rates and the mutation spectrum with extreme precision. Examples for this application are the determination of E. coli (Lee et al. 2012), Yeast (Zhu et al. 2014) and Human (Xue et al. 2009) mutational rates and spectrum.
We used Illumina sequencing (MiSeq) to correctly asses the mutation frequency and spectrum of the error prone polymerase I and our genome wide mutator. Furthermore, we used the obtained data to quantify plasmid copy numbers and ratios between plasmids with the same origin of replication inside one cell. Different plasmids were analyzed by re-sequencing and de novo assembly, respectively.

Then we detected the concentration of riboflavin through measuring the absorbance under 444nm and found that riboflavin production basically response to the change of metal ion concentration as it present a linear relationship with Cu2+  concentration, which indicated that BBa_K1755301 can work as we anticipated.

We connected BBa_K190024""CueO+RBS"", as a, with BBa_1755002""ribB CDS+B0014""to get BBa_K1755302.  The former part is a sensor and the latter is a reporter.
1.2.2  How does it work
CueO can express periplasmic copper-binding proteins, CueO , a multi-copper oxidase for detoxification[1], which belongs to CueR Regulon gene and can be regulated by copper-responsive transcription factor CueR, too. CueO can oxidate Cu+ to Cu2+ and decrease the toxicity of copper[3, 4]. On the CueO promoter, CueR protectes -41 to -17 on top strand and -42 to -19 on bottom strand to repress the expression of CueO[1]. And it can be derepressed by Cu2+, too. So the CueO promoter can sense the concentration of copper and linkage it with the production of riboflavin.

TMMU-China,2017,Team:TMMU-China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," capacity can reach to 207 different types. The peptide configuration is far more diverse than the AHL molecules, which will limit the cross talk of the signal peptide. Further more, the peptide molecules can be commercially synthesized at very low price. The peptide can also be degraded by the proteinase K or inactivated using physical or chemical methods. Thus, we envision that the development of communication systems using peptide-based QS system will facilitate the synthetic biologists to construct more sophisticated systems.
Synthetic communication systems using peptide-based Quorum sensing systems
Currently, almost all of the synthetic communication systems that have been developed to date are functional in and between Gram-negative organisms based on the AHL QS systems, and most of the synthetic networks have been implemented in Escherichia coli. However, no communication systems using peptide-based QS systems have been developed. In this project, we want to develop synthetic communication system using the two types of peptide-based QS systems.
Gram positive bacteria comprise diverse species. Some species can cause severe human infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Some species are important industrial producers, such as L.lactis and B.subtilis. What is more, the balance between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in the microbiota is crucial for human health. However, no synthetic communication systems have been developed for the Gram positive bacteria. In this project, we want to use the L.lactis and B.subtilis as our Gram positive bacteria chassis to implement them with the synthetic communication systems.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which"

-KP Today as we compared our individual findings on methods to destroy the biofilm on cholera, we realized that there are many different approaches to take. We can try to stop biofilm production by disrupting the quorum sensing, destroy the internal mechanism that makes the biofilm, or we can attack the biofilm from the outside. We have decided to focus on that last approach. Our goal now, is to find an enzyme or chemical of some kind and then see if it will break down the biofilm of cholera. There are plenty of enzymes already discovered that break down biofilms on other bacteria, but we cannot find anything specific to cholera. We will probably have to experiment with different proven methods for other bacteria and see what effects it has on cholera. We can also possibly incorporate phage as a deliverer of a substance that breaks down cholera biofilm, but right now we are in search of that enzyme.
-KK We reported on our investigation of various genes and enzymes that last year’s iGEM team had identified as candidates to disrupt the biofilm. Their approaches appear very disjointed: some proteins were meant to directly degrade the biofilm, some were meant to hydrolyze the QS autoinducer molecule, some (appear) to interfere with transcription and translation of HapR related genes. While the advantage to their multi-front approach is that perhaps one of their various technique could work, the disadvantage of being spread too thin I believes overrides the advantage. So, we’ll be homing in on only one approached: direct removal of the biofilm. Dr. Gro"

Grenoble-Alpes,2017,Team:Grenoble-Alpes#LabBook_-_-_TEXT.html," Red fluorescence is observable as soon as there is some IPTG under natural light (top) and UV light (bottom)
These results drove the choice to biobricks having IPTG inducible promoters for mRFP1: BBa_J04450 and BBa_K801100, for which emission of red fluorescence is quite fast and strong.
Digestion profile of the two plasmids :
As previously mentioned, the plasmid backbone requires:
one EcoR1 site, to insert the probe
no BglII and BmtI restriction sites, necessary for the activation of the probe
To check these criteria, both BBa_J04450 and BBa_K801100 parts were digested with the three enzymes.
Figure 7: Left: 1kb Plus DNA Ladder. Right: Digestion profile of BBa_J04450 and BBa_K801100 with BmtI, BglII and EcoR1. UC=uncut.
In both cases, no digestion with BglII and BmtI is observable (3 forms, like the uncut well), and one cut is visible with EcoR1 (1 band:linearization), so the two plasmids can be used as backbone for the probe.
Leak of the promoter
In amplifying both BBa_J04450 and BBa_K801100 parts, we noticed that the overnight cultures were frequently pink, displaying a leakness of the LacI promoter. Then a question rose: is addition of IPTG an absolute necessity to get a strong and fast production of RFP ?
Experiment has been designed the following way: 2 cultures of DH5ɑ transformed with J04450 and 2 cultures transformed with K801100, one with 1mM IPTG, the other not. Bacteria grew overday at 37°C under agitation.
The bacterial count and the mean fluorescence intensity have been measured in parallel by flow cytometry every 20 minutes for 5 hours, with 15µL sample of each culture.
Figure 8: Evolution of the ratio mRFP1 fluorescence intensity, in J04450 and K801100 transformed DH5a.
This experiment highlighs the role of IPTG, at least from 180 minutes after induction. IPTG appeared to be important in the detection because it triggers a shorter rise of the fluorescence.
Beside,  no notable difference is observed between the fluorescence of J04450 and K801100 (neither in the intensity neither in the time of production).

Our final fusions of OmpN::SspB and OmpN::RFP are shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5. Final OmpN::SspB and OmpN::RFP fusions. The OmpN fragment in each fusion is shown in red and the SspB/RFP CDS in black. The complete CDS of our fusion is shown in capital letters, while the upstream UTR, including the RBS, is shown in lower-case letters.
With these fusions, present in the State 2 of our bistable, and expressing the asRNA under the same promoter as in State 1, State 1 machinery will be able to repress State 2 more efficiently (see Figure 6). As in the proteolysis mechanism, we needed bacteria without the RybB asRNA. We have performed the mentioned deletion to our Sspb- and Clpx- strains by using the lambda red protocol ( Datsenko & Wanner (2000) ).
Figure 6. When State 1 of our bistable is being expressed by temperature (42 ºC), we are not only expressing the LacI repressor of the Lac promoter but we also are expressing the asRNA under the same promoter. This RybB asRNA binds the mRNAs that have the beginning of OmpN mRNA fused, being these SspB and RFP of State 2. When this asRNA binds to SspB and RFP mRNA it inhibits their translation and, therefore, their expression. In conclusion, when the State 1 is active we are repressing State 2 promoter and preventing both State 1 reporter’s and Sspb’s translation.

    Thus, we set 3 gradient of salt concentration, 0M, 0.05M, 0.3M, and 3 gradient of temperature, 25℃, 32.5℃ and 37℃, detected the fluorescence level took pictures under different conditions. We found the circuit is active when the environment is warmer and high osmotic. There is almost nothing under fluorescence microscope when it cultured at salt-free and 25 ℃. On the contrary, when temperature reaches 37 ℃ and salt concentration increases, GFP expression apparently increased.

    We controlled the optical density of engineered bacteria under different temperatures and did three parallel experiments to avoid inaccuracy. As the graphs showed, the circuit has apparently effect on the temperature changing, the osmotically control did have some effects but not obvious enough. The analysis of two results shows that the expression of two conditions between salt-free with 25 ℃ and 0.05M with 37 ℃ have obvious difference. We also try to change GFP into PLA and get further data to analysis the circuits, but limited by time.

    Goal: The Tet-Off system has been applied to several organisms, which turns expression of its controlling genes OFF. Base on the metabolic state switch, we have switched between production mode and suicide mode. We characterize the working effect of our circuits by the fluorescence expression levels of GFP and RFP.     Reaults: 1. Determine the optimum content of the inducer. 2. Quantitatively detect the fluorescence expression level. 3. Verify circuit implementation mode switching.

Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

Surface and latent topics and their relationship. Z axis: ""Awareness""
Four planes from top down: the plane of immediate benefit and tradeoffs; of judgement and beliefs; of perceivable emotions, or attitudes; irrationality.
     Actually, the plane idea is inspired by the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a topic model in natural language processing which is also widely used in bioinformatics to find the themes of a corpus.[2] However, the LDA is all about machine learning and data mining, and like any machine learning, needs a training set and is based entirely on what we already have. This model is exactly the opposite, for what we already have is nothing, and if anything, we are not intending to use it. Because, since synthetic biology is a rising field, the combination of synthetic biology and ethics might give rise to something entirely new. So instead of seeking the best of existing beaten paths, why don't we try to find some new paths even it's not as elegant or mature as the best of beaten paths? Why not try to bring something new into it when it's still early? After all, we are dealing with the unknown, not the known. Trying, succeed or not, is not a shame. So, this model is not a data-mining tool; instead, it is a thinking tool hoping to help us gain some more perspective when addressing an ethical concern.
2. Adding the 4th D, The Dimension of Stages, or Time
Inspired by our project design, the rewirable circuits, we thought deeper on the three modules that compose of our information processing system. Actually, we found that it has an underlying philosophy that has much broader applications other than in electrical and biological circuit designs.

Basics of Cell-Free Expression
The Components
Figure 1: Basic Components of a Cell-Free Expression Mix. A standard cell-free expression systems consists of a DNA template, the cell extract and additives containing all the components needed for energy regeneration, buffering, and generation of the protein.
Two basic components are needed to conduct in vitro protein expression as seen in figure 1:
the genetic template (mRNA or DNA) encoding the target protein
a reaction solution containing the transcriptional and translational molecular machinery
Cell extracts supply the reaction with most of the beforehand mentioned molecules, including:
RNA polymerases for mRNA transcription
ribosomes for polypeptide translation
tRNA and amino acids
enzymatic cofactors and an energy source
cellular components essential for proper protein folding
Regular cell lysate already contains most of the components needed for cell-free expression. The machineries that usually conduct the translation and transcription of various proteins in the organism now only produce the protein of choice. The basic components, the amino acids and dNTPs, are already present but are also supplemented to increase the efficiency. As the normal energy regeneration system is missing in a cell lysate, an artificial one is added; for this we use creatine phosphokinase.  Other components present in a cell-free expression mix buffer the sensitive system and imitate the cytosolic environment.
Figure 2: Prokaryotic vs eukaryotic cell-free expression. While prokaryotic expression enables higher yields and is more cost efficient, eukaryotic expression offers more advanced features.
Comparing the currently available cell-free expression systems reveals advantages and disadvantages depending on the field of application. An E. coli based system convinces with simplicity, cost-efficiency and its high yield production. However, for the production of complex eukaryotic proteins, it might not be the best option as it does not provide post-translational modifications such as core glycosylation or phosphorylation, and natural membrane components (e.g. microsomes) for membrane protein insertion. Eukaryotic cell-free systems based on wheat germ embryos, rabbit reticulocytes, insect cells or other animal and human cell lines would be the better choice for expression of eukaryotic proteins. 4)
The Reaction

Gradually,  they   came  to  know  about  iGEM  in  greater  detail  and  the  opportunity  we  had  as  a  commendable   participant  in  the  competition.  On  their  return  to  Kharagpur,  they  called  in  all  the  interested   students  from  the  third  and  fourth  year  batches  and  held  regular  meetings  to  discuss  about   iGEM  and  explain  its  significance.  Students,  who  had  poor  background  on  synthetic  biology   were given articles to read so that they cleared their funda. Finally, after a few weeks, towards   the  end  of  January,  we  had  a  fairly  motivated  team  ready  to  brainstorm  ideas  for  the  much   coveted competition.
Formulation & finalization of idea:
For facilitating the idea formulation process, the entire team of third years and fourth years was   divided into five sub­teams, each composed of 1­2 fourth years and 2­3 third years. Each team   was allotted the task of going through literature and coming up with new ideas that could act as   potential bases for our iGEM project. Each team used to discuss independently, meet frequently   in the library, and prepare presentations on the idea that they thought upon. As the exams were   approaching and the deadlines were less than 2 weeks, the teams had to go through a really   rough patch. Some members were not able to come regularly due to some urgent problems and   the other members used to take up their job and do it religiously. It was real teamwork at display   then. On the day of the idea discussions, each team presented their idea before the fifth years and   other teams. It was subjected to rigorous scrutiny and a torrent of questions basing on which the   ideas were evaluated. Out of the five ideas, two ideas were eventually shortlisted and the entire   team  was  now  re­grouped  into  two  sub­teams  working  independently  on  the  two  ideas.  The   existing  knowledge  from  the  previous  level  was  augmented  with  in­depth  book­reading  and   feasibility analysis. After a week, the two ideas were consolidated and extended presentations   were made to be presented"

Modeling: Insulin Secretion
Abstract
In this model, we simulate the insulin  secretion behavior of pancreatic β cells, trying to realize the similar curve in a single β cell, as  that of glucose-insulin secretion which has been shown in literature, according  to the reported insulin secretion mechanisms.
In general, we divide the process from  glucose sensation to insulin secretion into three sessions. The first session  covers the metabolic process from glucose intake to production of ATP. The  second session covers the behavior of ion channels after the change in [ATP]/[ADP] ratio. The last session depicts the insulin secretion activated by  cellular [Ca2+] rise.
This single-cell model is key to the overall insulin secretion curve due to the synchronization of the cells in the  same pancreas islet.
Introduction
In physiology, the secretion of insulin is  tightly regulated. After food intake and rising of blood glucose concentration, insulin is quickly secreted to down tune the blood glucose. Lack of insulin as  well as its overproduction causes harm to human bodies. Thus it is really a  need to determine the physiological parameters during insulin secretion. Of the  first priority is the [glucose]-insulin secretion curve.
Fig. 1 Insulin-related metabolic pathways in β cells (adapted from [1])
Task Analysis
Our model is in fact a time-amount model addressing the total insulin secretion amount with time under given glucose concentration.
The secretion of insulin is considered as the result of a series of regulation, which includes acceleration of metabolism, opening of ATP-sensitive K+ channel, depolarization of membrane, influx of Ca2+, etc. While this is not the whole picture, there is another pathway leading to the secretion of insulin, as is shown in the graph above, but due to its complexity and lack of studies, we focus on the major and clearer part of the pathway.
There are two phases of insulin secretion. First of them comes from the drastic reaction to glucose of β cells in all islets, and the second comes from the difference of secretion paces"

10. Verify the colony phenotype, it should be expressing GFP, because the cI repressor doesn’t have a promoter, thus it´s not repressing the GFP production.
Although we successfully got the cI inverter we didn’t have enough time to ligate it to trpL promoter due to both constructions are in the same antibiotic resistance plasmid psb1c3 and the PCR reactions to obtain the whole  cI inverter were not obtained on time.

E. Chrono
Vanderbilt University Microfluidics
E. chrono attempts to merge synthetic biology and microfluidics into a novel hybrid system. The goal of E. chrono is to leverage quorum sensing in ''Escherichia coli'' to produce a microfluidic based fluorescent watch.  The E. chrono project focused on 3 major goals
1)Learn the microfluidic device design process and select a software platform capable of rapid design
2)Develop a cheap and efficient means for rapid prototyping of microfluidic devices
3)Fabricate and test microfluidic designs
Additionally, E. chrono sought to produce a cheap and efficient methodology for the rapid fabrication and prototyping of microfluidic devices. It is our hope that the designs and methods implemented in our project can be utilized in future competitions by other iGEM teams.
Below is an artist rendering of our intended E. coli watch.

[Formula: RFP/OD_light off ÷ RFP/OD_light on], numbers on top of bar graphs represent the fold change.
Figures 4a and b represent the comparison of RFP/OD of persistent light on and off conditions for PBLrep-RFP and PBLrep-RFP-YbaQ. There is a clear increasing trend for the fold change for PBLrep-RFP-YbaQ, while the fold change for PBLrep-RFP increased over the period of 0 to 4 hours, then dropped for the subsequent 4 hours.
This characterisation experiment tells us that the degradation rate of RFP-YbaQ is required for this promoter to work as intended.
Varying Blue Light On-Off Patterns
To verify that the degradation rate of RFP-YbaQ is indeed the most optimal for PBLrep to work, we carried out further characterisation experiments with different blue light on-off patterns.
Figure 5. 2 hours in the Dark, 4 hours with Blue Light On.       Figure 6. 3 hours in the Dark, 3 hours with Blue Light On.
As observed from the Figures 5 and 6, even under different light on-off patterns, PBLrep-RFP-YbaQ still performed the best, showing clearer oscillation patterns with the absence and presence of light, while PBLrep with just RFP alone or with RFP-DAS showed relatively poor responses with the rate at which light is being switched on and off.
Modelling PBLrep and Verification of Model
We also modelled the activity of the promoter and our model shows that for PBLrep to reflect better oscillation patterns, we should incubate the cell cultures in the dark for 45 minutes, and under blue light for the remaining duration of the experiment.
Figure 7. 45 minutes in the Dark and 7 hours with Blue Light On.
Our wetlab experimental data verified the recommendations made by our model. A dip is no longer observed at the start of the graph, and the change in RFP/OD could reflect our light on-off pattern.
Conclusion
Our improvement of changing the coding region sequence of a common reporter gene, RFP, by adding a degradation tag, YbaQ, has allowed us to better understand how we can use this the blue light repressible promoter PBLrep. Based on our characterization results, we recommend future users to use a coding region with similar degradation rates as RFP-Yba"

Collaboration
We collaborated with several other iGEM teams, this helped us improve our project. Our collaborations can be divided into human practice and wet lab collaborations. They range from podcasts, the Düsselorf postcard collaboration, and our own dear diary, to a wet-lab collaboration with iGEM Lund.
Wet-lab Collaborations
Collaboration with iGEM Lund
Since we are both working on protein production in E.coli we started a collaboration with iGEM Lund. During this collaboration we exchanged biobricks in order to verify them. We also tested any interaction between our plasmid BBa_K2671337 (GroES) and their BBa_K2602021 (VHb-GFP) plasmid.
Human Practice Collaborations
Podcast - a Collaboration with iGEM Chalmers
Following the Nordic iGEM Conference in Lund we started a collaboration with the team from Chalmers University. During the summer, a representative from iGEM Chalmers visited us and recorded an episode for our podcast ""Attempting Science"" with us. In the episode we talked about their project and problems that have been faced during the course of the iGEM competition.
Postcard Collaboration with iGEM Team Düsseldorf
We collaborated with iGEM Düsseldorf on their postcard collaboration as a part of our human practice. This is a worldwide collaboration where different iGEM teams design their own postcards. These are then distributed to the participating teams with the help of iGEM team Düsseldorf. Namely, to raise public awareness about the field of Synthetic Biology. We then distributed the cards we recieved to students and to the public during events hosted by us.
Dear Diary
In order for us to get a better connection to some of the other iGEM teams we decided to start a diary collaboration. We asked teams to write texts on what they did in- and outside of the lab during summer, and take pictures. We then compiled these stories into a document that was published here and on our facebook. The teams that took part were: Dalhousie iGEM (Canada), team AHUT China (China), iGEM NYU Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates), and LiU iGEM (Sweden).

How iGEM UFSCAR-Brasil collaborated with iGEM Teams
Our Team collaborated with the national and international Times project, along with mentoring  two new Brazilian teams. We contributed online surveys of 4 teams and we think that this type of contact should be encouraged. Follow along as we share and collaborate with different teams:
Help Stockholm , Finland , iGEM_nankai and iGEM Korea_U_Seoul Teams by completing their survey forms. We also cooperate in filling the iGEM Global Cooperation, a form developed by several times, including Brasil-USP Team . The highlight was Team of Stockholm ,     which dealt with the negative results presented in Wikis, a point discussed in our weekly meetings. We Thank the three teams in question for their contact and hope that the answers have helped their respective Human Practice activities.
Aid the Stockholm and IISER iGEM Teams in the g-blocks design for the construction of the gene circuit for their project. Our idea was to contribute to and give instructions on how to design and provide the best results in their amplification experiments and construction of their gene circuits.
One of the great experiences we had as a team was the help we offered to future Brazilian teams  ( UNESP-Assis and Unifei-Itajubá ), who got to know the iGEM participation in Jamboré and 4Biotec events. To our excitement, those who are interested in setting up new teams are students inspired by projects such as Brazil-SP , represented     by members of our current staff. This shows the power iGEM presents and its growth potential in Brazil. As well as perform in-person contacts with students during the previously mentioned events, we are also assisting the assembly of teams via Skype. Below we list the main aspects that deal with competition and the challenges of creating a team in Brazil:

NCTU Formosa - Safety
For iGEM 2009, teams are asked to detail how they approached any issues of biological safety associated with their projects. Specifically, teams should consider the following four questions:
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry?
Experimental Safety
In our university, National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), the Environmental and Safety Center (ESC) is strictly responsible for Safety of all labs in the school. What we can do in our project should follow the rules they permit, and they manage all instruments and chemicals, especially for dangerous and toxic ones, in all labs. The ESC is to be informed on the basis of our project and on what we are doing and plan to do. Therefore, the ESC has permitted our project at first.
In addition, we do our wetlab activities in Common Instrument Rooms where are in charge of Biomedical Engineering Lab of Dr. Chih-Sheng Lin and Applied Microbiology & Biochemistry Lab of Dr. Ching-Ping Tseng. They would check whether the rules are followed or not everyday, and every time someone starts to work in these rooms, he or she should take down his or her student numbers in a log. Besides, when someone uses a common instrument, he or she should record the purpose for the instrument.
Briefly, under these requirements, the progress for our project would not raise any possible safety issues.
Safety Issues for Researcher, Public and Environment
As above we mentioned, we did our work under the control, so in fact, we did not get hurt during working. Our work also is harmless to the public and the environment. Since after we had finished our progress for a day or a step, we always dealt with the contaminated trash carefully. This is the most important in our work.

Bioengineering Summer Camp
The team took a week off from lab work to run a summer bioengineering camp for 9th and 10th grade students. We had a lot of fun teaching the students and used many tools gained from iGEM, like letting students streak out bacteria containing RFP (positive transformation control) and GFP (interlab positive control).
Week 10
Circuit testing
We started the process to test the complete arsenic circuit. In vivo testing of full circuits with reporters amilCP and spisPink was performed with 1uM/2uM/10uM concentrations of arsenate/arsenite. RAIN's 2017 iGEM team had ran an experiment testing 150uM arsenic which killed the cells during the experiment. A second experiment was conducted where 25uM arsenic was used. This did not kill the cells and GFP was produced. This is the maximum amount of arsenic we want to test.
The limits of detection for our circuit to be viable and to compete with current testing equipment is below 100ppb. At 50ppb soil and water is considered unsafe for consumption or play. At 100ppb the soil or water is deemed worthy for excavation due to its potential health risks. Therefore, we will test 1uM arsenic (equivalent to 75ppb), 2uM arsenic (150ppb) and 10uM arsenic (750ppb).
10mL of liquid culture was created for both spisPink and amilCP the cultures will be set up as follows:
The cultures were observed at 1 hour, 3 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours for visual solution color change. During the entirety of the experiment, no color change or production occurred.
Repeat circuit testing with higher concentration of arsenite/arsenate
Testing of the amilCP and spisPink in vivo was unsuccessful at 1uM/2uM/10uM. There was also an attempt to grow CFU plates, however, these plates were left in the incubator for two days and overgrew. RAIN's 2017 iGEM team was able to see production of GFP at 25uM concentration of arsenic so this experiment will lie closer to these values.
Three concentrations or arsenic will be tested this time: 17.65uM (equivalent to 1324ppb), 21.42uM (1606ppb) and 25uM (1875ppb).

F2620 Induction Test Setup
For direct comparison, we reference Dr. Barry Canton's (MIT) induction test from his 2008 study, which measured GFP production by F2620 induction by 8 AHLs. The key differences between our experimental design and his was that A)Dr. Canton's experiment attempted to find maximum GFP production using different AHL concentrations while our experiment measured GFP production over time and B)Dr. Canton's system utilized synthetic AHLs while our AHLs were produced using an E. coli chassis.
Canton (2008) GFP synthesis over AHL concentration
Our measurements were split into 5 curves, with synthetic AHL measurements at 2 concentrations as 2 curves, non-3-oxo AHLs as 1 curve, 3-oxo AHLs as 1 curve, and other acyl structures as the last curve:
Synthetic AHLs GFP Absorbance over Time
The figures above demonstrate a mix of orthogonal and intersecting(crosstalk) networks. Of the 10 systems measured, known crosstalk partners such as Esa, Las, and Rpa showed increased levels of GFP measured as compared to the F2620 control. Lux, the native system that F2620 was designed for, Las, Rpa, and surprisingly Cer showed an exponential increase in GFP absorbance with an increasing concentration, with much higher levels of absorbance at the 50% AHL concentration as compared to the 10% AHL concentration. Overall, Cer, Esa, Las, Lux, and Rpa showed a significant increase in GFP absorbance over the F2620 control, indicating some degree of crosstalk with F2620.
Meanwhile, the Aub, Bja, Bra, Rhl, and Sin systems showed evidence of orthogonality to F2620. All 5 systems maintained GFP absorbance levels near the F2620 control. BraI showed a slight increase in absorbance, making it difficult to conclude the level of interaction between the BraI AHL and F2620. SinI had lower absorbance levels in the sample runs than the F2620 control, but still remains in the margin of error for the plate reader. From solely these results, Aub, Bja, Rhl, and Sin are the strongest candidates to be orthogonal to F2620, with both AHL curves consistently close to control absorbance levels."

However, after about two hours of explanation, it dawned on us that what he said was all about one core concept:  excess is just as bad as deficiency. Training excessively is damage, while no exercise is unhealthy as well; too much intake of sugar is harmful, while too little sugar consumption is even more dangerous.
Similar to what Dr.Wu had told us, knowing how to adjust one’s own physiological stage and managing a balanced diet is the only way to live a healthy life. How wise it is. Perhaps this is the kind of thing we won’t be able to learn from the coach who’s pro in developing six pack abs. In the end of the discussion, he even taught us a breathing method used in training which helps regulate our breathing. To be honest, we had a special experience after today’s visit.
In sum, this interview has surprised us - even ordinary things such as breathing has variations, but also let us learn a lot about regulating daily nutritions. Before finishing, he also suggested us to consult to the nutritionist, assuming that we might receive a different response. However, the two experts made similar proposals in the end, showing us the part our work needs to improve.
We summarized our project to the fitness instructor. He told us about his work. He has his own workshop, where he focuses on designing lessons, trying ways to stimulate advances in physical function, such as improving the ability of impairment. He said that what he does is absolutely different from those who conduct training for the purpose of body strengthening. 
We: Can we say that, this is similar to what we call OT (occupational therapy)?               Coach: Probably yes. But, I am just a coach for assistant purpose.
We: Will you recommend any kind of health supplements to your clients?
Coach: No. Due to the differences of individual needs, I think it is more appropriate that doctors do something like that instead of me. But, I can give them advices on what efficacy they may need for their supplements. 
We: Any examples?
Coach: Sure. Let me take weight losing. It’s easy to understand that if a person want to lose weight, the amount of calorie he consume must exceed the amount he take in. So, in the initial phase, calorie consumption is what we focus on. As long as he get used to the diet, we started to focus on the nutrients in"

The ladies of iGEM once tried to expel Arun from the team for his distracting good looks.  He simply
winked at them
and they changed their minds.  Armed with his sparkling smile, baby soft cheeks, and boyish charm, Arun will melt your heart (and your agar plates).  But don’t be fooled.  This dastardly devil will always surprise you.  One moment he’ll be asleep, the next he’ll be chair jousting.  One minute he’ll be serenading you with sweet sounds from his scrumptious, supple lips; the next minute he’ll be rapping B.I.G.  One day he’ll be clean shaven, ten years later, he’ll maybe have a five o’clock shadow.  Despite these bipolar tendencies, two things remain constant in Arun’s life: he has a flair for dramatic pipetting and the ladies love him.  But I beg you ladies, calm yourselves and heed my last warning: he will take your grandpa’s style; he will take your grandpa’s style.  If you ever need it back, he will still be in Ithaca.  But actually though.

The Cornell iGEM team has a secret weapon. Her name: J-Chen. As a locally-grown, ‘hood-dwelling laboratory superhero, J-Chen skillfully navigates through the ins and outs of Ithaca in her Ganodermobile. Though seemingly unintimidating at first glance, beware: she can whip out her legendary ice cream maker at any given moment, and coat you in a lemony flavor of happiness so fast that you’ll forget what you were cloning. Not only is she powerful herself, her faithful minions, Solutions I, II, and III, are always within arms’ reach. Don’t dare question J-Chen’s seniority, either, or else she’ll hold your precious 97 cultures hostage, until you provide a box of those sacred yellow tips as ransom. And if there’s ever miniprepping to be done, don’t worry about it – J-Chen has already gotten started.

Based on this model, the 3D printed case was designed, consisting of only two parts: The upper part holds all the wires, interfacing components and fans in place. The case is designed with to be easily assembled, without the need for any screws or glue. The components are held by the case on one side and by the PCB on the other. The upper part of the case has four bolts, positioned at each corner of the rectangular design. These staves hold the PCB and the lower part of the case in place. The lower part is responsible for defining the optimal distance of the LED to the wells of the microtiter plate. It is easily interchangeable, for example the microtiter plate shall be illuminated from above or from beneath. We designed and printed lower parts for both use cases that ensure for minimal lightspill and optimal sample illumination.
LED panel with adapter for illumination from above the microtiter plate.
LED panel with adapter for illumination from beneath the microtiter plate. The integrated tilt sensor detects the absolute orientation of the device and the display content is automatically rotated in accordance.
Equal illumination of all wells of a microtiter plate with transparent lower surface.
Because we wanted to enable users to illuminate a microtiter plate from beneath and from above, we integrated a tilt sensor into our PCB design. Together with the software of the microcontroller, this sensor detects the orientation of the device. When the LED panel is turned over, the content of the display is automatically tilted too, making the usage of our LED panel very intuitive for every application.
Ordered interior of the LED panel. The interior of the LED panel is neatly ordered, without the need for screws or glue. All components and cables are held in place tightly by the 3d printed case.
Software & Bluetooth Application
Nowadays, an ambitious hardware project is always closely connected to software. Apart from in silico desgin of the electronics, the PCB and the 3D printed case, we needed to write the software running the microcontroller. Without the microcontroller, which comtrols the LED drivers and manages the user interface, this project would not have been impossible.
The program for the teensy microcontroller was written in the Arduino integrated development environment (IDE). The Android IDE provides a very easy interface for compiling and transmitting code for micro-controllers. The teensy microcontrollers are fully compatible with this development environment, making it especially easy to adapt the code running the LED panel for your own requirements. To further simplify software adaptations of our LED panel, we created our own Arduino Library that contains all necessary functions"

LoxP--SD--GFP--
Unfortunately, when we tested this construct it did not work. When we grew the cells on arabinose and then tested for both Gentamicin resistance and GFP fluorescence, the cells were all gentamycin resistance and non were expressing detectable GFP. We then decided to try a simpler system with our on LoxP terminator design as follows:
PBAD--Cre--PCon--LoxP--Terminator--LoxP--SD--GFP--
We are in the process of testing this system for green fluorescence following arabinose induction. Hopefully we will have some data to show you at the iGEM regionals!
Generating a Lactate Sensor
Our lactate sensors were generated using the findings of Looger et al. (Looger,
LL. et al., Computational design of receptor and sensor proteins with novel functions (Nature 2003). The MglB protein was mutated at the 7 sites reported by Looger et al., (Y10K, D14K, N91K, K92L, H152M, D154H, R158K, W183K, D236A and N256D) by proper primer design and use of the Strategene Multi Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit and protocol. Due
to the multiple mutations, two rounds of mutagenesis were necessary to incorporate all mutations, and several colonies had to be sequenced after each round in order to identify colonies that contained all of the mutations.
This sensor interacts with the Trz fusion protein when it binds lactate. Trz is a Trg-EnvZ fusion that phosphorylates the OmpC transcriptional regulator when activated. We received a plasmid with Trz as well as an OmpC-LacZ reporter from Dr Hazelbauer’s lab at the University of Missouri . The reporter we are using is this lacZ reporter, which gives a 4X induction with 100uM L-lactate when using the mutate Mgl2 protein. The Kd (2 uM) is within the physiological range of lactate concentrations for many cell growth conditions.
The Experiments
We generated a library of thermosensors via TAQ random mutagenesis.  Colonies were plated at 30'C and then shifted to 37'C to monitor the reporter gene expression, LacZ.  Colonies that appeared to express LacZ differently from the wildtype thermosensor were picked, patched and retested for their phenotype.  "

The Game
We thought that one of the most important groups to inform about Synthetic Biology was children and teenagers, since they will grow to be the scientists of tomorrow. We thought that a really good way to reach them was through a video-game.
The idea was to create a RPG game where you need to gather knowledge and information of Synthetic Biology in order to win.  We made the game in Spanish and English to spread our message even further and the statistics up to this date says that 450 people have played our game.

Don’t wait anymore and try it! Click here to start the download.
*Research was done with RPGmaker VX. If you don’t have the program, you will need to download this archive in order to play our game.]
What are those guys talking about so mysteriously? Discover it by playing!
In Research you, a girl that has come to the MIT in order to participate in the iGEM competition, discover that the contest has been cancelled, and no one is giving you a reason for the hasty decision.
So, you make it your goal to find out what is the cause of this, and discover that something much more important than a contest is at stake: the world as we know it.

What are threatening the world this time are not evil doctors, death lasers, the Everest meltdown or the sun approaching the Earth: is something much more common. Termites. But these are not normal termites: they are mutated insects that have evolved to reach the ability of eating plastic. In a world were plastic objects are everywhere, this capability is quite menacing, so defeating them is the mission that the main character of our game is going to face. She will have to find a way of fighting this bugs using Synthetic Biology and she will have to do it fast, before every plastic"

This code actually creates two intermediate images from which the similarity index is calculated. First the smoothed (disk-filter) input image is created and stored:
Smoothed image
Only white regions are candidate regions. After smoothing, the similarity index is calculated. As expected, edges are detected and limit the area from which the target region can be selected.
Smoothness Index
Finally the selected pathogen region is selected by the black area in the following picture:
Selected region
Combined with the input image, the final segmentation is received:
Final the analyzed image
Achievements
Measurarty is the image analysis logic behind our project. It is comprised of simple constructs put together into a pipeline, that is clearly laid out, easily maintainable and - if needed - easily adaptable. For example, changing from green to red fluorescence, only means to change the createMask function to select another target area.
Overall the results are convincing. We have not yet performed a comparison to a manual delineation, however, by eye the results look promising and have a low error.
Talking about computational complexity, the MATLAB code of course performs better than our own C++ implementation, which must be regarded as a proof-of-principle.
Space-wise, the code depends heavily on the image size $O( x \cdot y)$ (width $x$, height $y$, which also limits the number of edges in SRM between regions, as each pixel is one region to start with. However, it cannot take less memory, as the image is stored in an uncompressed format.
On the computational side, the thresholding, image conversion and gradient steps are linear in the number of pixels, and are thus in $O(x \cdot y)$. Unfortunately, the summation of the gradient for the smoothness index adds a heavy factor to it (k-neighbourhood for smoothness index). Due to the merging step in our C++-SRM algorithm implementation, our code has to do  $O(x^2 \"

In vitro production offers more versatility for bioproduction. By purifying an enzyme, one can avoid the limitations of the bacteria, therefore using the optimal conditions for the enzyme activity. There are new methods such as the Simulated Moving Bed Chromatography which seems to be promising for the production and purification of rare sugars like D-psicose [6]. This industrial process is used to purify reaction products catalyzed by epimerases, which ensures the enzyme never reaches it’s equilibrium.

Project Overview
Toxins In Our Environment
During petroleum extraction and refinement processes, toxic byproducts are produced. These compounds have an enormous environmental impact, burdening our ecosystems with land, water, and air contamination.  Common forms of air pollutants consist of NOx (nitrogen containing compounds) and SOx (sulfur containing compounds) which contribute to green house gas accumulation and acid rain (Schneider, 2006; Environmental protection agency, 1999).    Similarly, land and water contaminants often consist of complex mixtures including highly toxic phenols and aromatic compounds, toxic and corrosive carboxylic acids (naphthenic acids) as well as sulfur and nitrogen-containing compounds.  These often are recalcitrant, having complex structures that are difficult to break down, which causes them to persist in the ecosystem. Classical examples of water contamination include tailings ponds, which contain byproducts from the bitumen extraction process of oil sands"

Figure 14: SDS-PAGE of E. coli MG1655 BBa_K729004 [pBAD], 0% ara supernatant (A) and E. coli MG1655 BBa_K729004 [pBAD], 0.2% ara supernatant (B)
Figure 14 shows the successful DsbA-directed secretion of DNase across both cell membranes.
A is the supernatant of uninduced E. coli MG1655 BBa_K729004 [pBAD], whilst B is the supernatant of 0.2% induced E. coli MG1655 BBa_K729004 [pBAD]. The band is approximately 21 kDa, corresponding to the size of DsbA-DNase.
Figure 15: Expression host MG1655 BBa_K729004 [pBAD] biofilm growth assay
Figure 15 shows the effect of inducing the expression of BBa_K729004 [pBAD] on the ability of the host to form biofilms. The control (MG1655, pBAD/HisB, 0.2% ara) and MG1655, BBa_K729004[pBAD], 0% ara are both able to grow biofilms, as shown by the intensity of the crystal violet staining. When BBa_K729004[pBAD] is expressed, the intensity of the crystal violet staining is reduced, showing a diminished ability to grow biofilm. This data suggests that the secretion of DNase is able to inhibit biofilm formation.
Conclusion
Through our experimental work, we have successfully created and submitted 12 sequence-confirmed BioBrick parts, 7 of which we rigorously characterized for antibacterial and/or antibiofilm function. We validated that Art-175 and Microcin S are both potent antibacterials, the former of which is shown to be even capable of killing antibiotic-resistant biofilm-encased bacteria. On the antibiofilm side of things, we not only showed that the enzymes of interest, DNase and DspB, were successfully exported across both membrane layers of E. coli following our modification of them with secretion tags, but also proved that the enzymes are able to refold properly post-secretion such that they retain their enzymatic function.
In conclusion, we achieved our aim of creating bacterial ""living therapeutics"" - strains of bacteria genetically engineered to secrete functional antibiofilm and antimicrobial proteins towards the treatment of UTIs.
Future
To develop our project beyond a proof-of-concept design, we would adopt a more"
