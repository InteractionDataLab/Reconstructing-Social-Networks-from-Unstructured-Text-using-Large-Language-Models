Science at the Bar
On September 9 we held a lecture at a bar in Tel Aviv, according to the concept of ""science on the bar"" which is very trendy in Israel. We told the audience about the project, about our uniqueness and the competition itself. Moreover, there was a performance by stand-up comedian who recovered from cancer.  He created a stand-up show about his dealing with the disease and his personal process.  He claims that he  has been cured thanks to his humor.
 
Collaboration and panels
Round table
Mentors are one of the most valuable resources an entrepreneur should tap into. The idea of launching a project should no longer be a scary or daunting experience, riddled with unknowns. It should be a collaborative experience accumulating the learnings of the hundreds of local entrepreneurs who have already built successful businesses, and can help you move faster and avoid known pitfalls based on their years of experience.
Therefore, from the very beginning we have engaged the experts who have a deep understanding of Cancer in order to ensure that our project is addressing a genuine need as defined by those who know best.              On May we organized roundtable discussion with top researchers from the research fields of cancer diagnostics and therapy, Genetics and biology. We wanted the BEST mentorship and advices from the top experts.
We managed to bring together the following experts:
Prof. Roni Apte,  Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics expert [pic]

Project Description
World population has reached 7 billion 238 million people. This number is predicted to increase by 10% each year, and double in seven years.
The increase in population is not balanced with the increase in food production. Population increase in geometric fashion, while food production increase in arithmetic fashion, as stated by Thomas Robert Malthus in his renowed “An Essay on the Principle of Population”. In his work, he coined the word “Malthusian catastrophe”; the state of social unrest, vice, and misery caused by the limited resources and  unmet needs of the population.
This “Malthusian catastrophe” is not just a theory, in fact, it is happening as we are now. The extreme poverty, needs for education, and child and maternal death is few point of the “Millenium Development Goals” (MDGs), the formulation of problems arised from overpopulation crisis.
In pursuit of MDGs, population control is the key to solve the overpopulation problems. Thus, the need of contraception to solve the MDGs is principal. In Indonesia however, with the population of 237 million people, contraception program is far from success. Total Fertility Rate (TFR) that is increasing since 2002(TFR: 2,56) until 2012(TFR: 2,595) marks the problem in National Contraceptive Plans.
A factor that limit the application of contraceptive device is the convenience. Contraceptive pill needs to be consumed every day in the same hour, moreover, there are hormonal side effects to the pill. Injection method requires the user to be injected every month. Intra Uterine Devices are effective for long term treatment, however, not readily reversible. Barrier method such as condom is not convenient to be used every consummation. Calender based method and coitus interruptus are not reliable. Lastly, sterilization demands commitment of the user for not having any more child/children in the future.
Observing these problems, team UI_Indonesia try to create more convenient contraceptive method, we call it; BaContraception, short for Bacterial Contraception. Human Vagina contain 108-109 bacteria per gram vaginal fluid. More than 90% of these bacteria is Lactobacillus sp. which is commensal in human vagina. The culture of Lactobacillus sp. Creates acidic environment that is protective to human vagina, inhibiting the growth of pathogenic bacteria.
We sought to add spermicidal property to these Lactobacillus sp."

Currently, some of MoDeL syntaxes are defined for specific algorithms of iGaME. Being a language for automatic modeling, cooperation with algorithm is reasonable. However, we believe there are too many compromises, thus causing a number of inconsistencies. In the next version, we are looking forward to a more independent MoDeL.
New functions of iGaME
iGaME grows together with MoDeL. In the one-year process of software development, we have achieved many of our goals, and found even more to be achieved. Looking ahead, we have the following wishes for iGaME.
User-friendly output for both professionals and amateurs.
It is far from enough to provide only dynamic curves as output because users may want more information about the biological system. Professionals may want to know the whole picture of reaction network, how do the species react with each other, and what influence do they have on the network. Amateurs may not be interested in curves, and they want to have a more straightforward concept of the network.
We are planning to give a graphic display of the reaction network by showing the change of species quantities dynamically. Users could understand the underlying reasons why a curve reaches its peak from the network. We also plan to show the topological structure of reactions in network. By connecting species with reactions, users can get a clear picture of the interconnections between species.
User-friendly input with fun
Powered by MoDeL, iGaME has already relieved users from inputting massive amount of data. However, we are still looking forward to make the input process more fun. Besides providing a graphical scene, we are planning to have more elements like story telling and character selecting. Moreover, result grading and multi-user interacting are to be added to make our software a real game.
Database Development Kit
Though we have presented the detail document of RFC 55 for MoDeL, modelers may still found it a tough job to construct a usable database. The Database Development Kit aims at aiding modelers with easy-to-use development tools. To achieve this, graphical tools for creating, removing, modifying data in database are needed. Parameter estimation tools and MoDeL syntax checking tools are also wanted. We are planning to have this kit in our future version, which will greatly reduce the difficulties for users to construct their own databases.
We believe the future of iGaME is bright !

Lecture in high school
High school students are young, vibrant, and always open to new things.
Last year, our team had Lab open day for some high school students. One named Zhang Herui, showed great interest in iGEM competition and synthetic biology and was recruited into our team. This year, considering there are few references of miRNA mentioned in textbooks, we walked into her school to fill the blanks and introduce our project.
Moving our glow sticks for synthetic biology
In June, our team was invited to give a lecture on iTED Sharing held by the Squirrel Club of NUDT, the theme of the lecture is biotech 2.0-the synthetic biology and iGEM in my eyes. Through this lecture, we gave the present students an introduction of our research field. We aimed to share our ideas with undergraduates and get feedbacks form the interactive section. Also the popularization of synthetic biology is achieved."

Biological Modules: Logic Gates
An electronic full adder is composed of 5 logic gates: 2 XOR, 2 AND and 1 OR.
Transcriptionally regulated logic gates exist and have already been described. However, a major breakthrough in Synthetic Biology appeared during 2013 with two publications (see below) related to recombination-based logic gates. They inspired us and are the basis of our work.
Switching Gate Principle
A careful analysis of the full adder diagram demonstrated that the OR gate can be designed with no recombinases (see below). Therefore we only had to design the AND and XOR gates and we decided to use four different recombinases: TP901.1 integrase, Bxb1 integrase, PhiC31 integrase and FimE. The first AND and XOR gate have been design from Bonnet and al. 2013 , the second ones from Siuti and al. 2013 . Each recombinase is a one way recombinase, it means that its recombination sites have been designed to ensure an one-way switch only. When a sequence between two recombination sites has been switched, the sites are modified such that a second recombination event is impossible.

We developed a novel and easy to use system for the generation of binding proteins in E. coli via in vivo directed evolution. Resulting proteins called Evobodies have the potential to bind specifically to target proteins enabling various medical and analytical applications. Great advantages of our low-cost system are the short hands on time and the short generation time.
As the starting point of our system, we designed and synthesized genetic libraries encoding binding proteins based on Nanobodies as well as Monobodies.  The diversity of the respective library in E. coli is continuously increased by co-expressing a special DNA-Polymerase conferring plasmid restricted error-prone replication of the binding protein expressing plasmids. Finally, binding proteins with high affinity to the target protein are selected using a bacterial two-hybrid system providing growth advantage to antibiotics in relation to protein-protein interaction strength. Ultimately, desired clones are enriched during fermentation in batch or in continuous culture.
Binding capability of our libraries, efficiency of our selection system and potential of our mutagenesis system were demonstrated. Moreover, library diversity and mutation system characteristics were analyzed in detail by high-throughput sequencing.

Project Summary
Bacterial reporters or whole-cell bacterial sensors have always been an area of application for genetic manipulation and synthetic biology. As a matter of fact, constructing a bioreporter bacteria that has the ability to detect toxic chemicals is considered one of the first accomplishments in the discipline of synthetic biology (van der Meer and Belkin, 2010) . There are several advantages to using a bacterial bioreporter instead of a traditional physical or chemical sensors, for example, bacteria can offer the same specificity and sensitivity that traditional sensors offer, but they are much more portable and grow in inexpensive media. Furthermore, bacterial reporters also offer advantages over using other types of biosensors like enzymes and antibodies because they are living organisms and they are capable of analyzing samples through a process that involves many enzymes (Yagi, 2007)
The first bacterial reporters appeared 20 years ago (van der Meer and Belkin, 2010) although these early tests didn’t use genetically modified microorganisms. Further research and development in the areas of genetic engineering and synthetic biology have resulted in many more applications such as detection of contaminants (Willardson, et. Al., 1998) and sugar and amino acid availability in soils (Jaeger, et. Al., 1999) . Even though the reporters have gotten more sophisticated and sensitive, we realized that there isn’t much mention of a single bacterial bioreporter capable of detecting different concentrations of a substance and reacting differently depending on the concentration.
We thought the use of synthetic biology as well as the BioBrick standard could help create a “genetic circuit” (van der Meer and Belkin, 2010) capable of detecting different concentrations of a substance and reacting in a different manner depending on the amount detected. In our initial research we realized that the iGEM British Columbia 2009 team decided to do something similar, so we used parts of their project as a base and integrated parts of other previous iGEM projects in order to propose a new genetic construction"

Waterloo,2012,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," favourable or unfavourable opinion of synthetic biology?"" The purpose of this study is to determine the measurable effect of certain factors such as age and field of study or occupation on one's opinion of synthetic biology and its potential applications. This was to be accomplished via a regression model of the form yi = β0 + β1xi1 + β2xi2 +...+ βpxip + εi for i = 1, 2,...n,. Here y represents an individual's perception of synthetic biology, x represents each of the factors considered and β represents the corresponding quantifiable impact, positive or negative, of each factor on perception. Regression analysis was to be conducted using statistical software, most likely Stata or SPSS. The data needed for this analysis was to be collected via an online survey. Respondents will indicate the factors that correlate to them based on their answers to the questions in section #1 of the survey, while section #3 has been designed to reveal the respondent's current perception of synthetic biology. The second section of the survey is a short quiz to illustrate a respondent's level of knowledge and familiarity with synthetic biology. This factor is expected to be the major determinant in perception, along with age range and field of study/occupation. Other factors such as gender and geographic location within Ontario are expected to have no statistically significant impact on perception. The respondents were to come from a wide range of backgrounds in order to increase the robustness of our results.
The rationale behind this study is that by identifying the demographics that are most and least favourable toward synthetic biology and its expanding range of uses, the UW iGEM can more effectively target our efforts for raising awareness on the field. Despite synthetic biology's rapidly growing importance in a wide variety of fields including energy and health, it is still relatively unknown to the population at large. While some may have a vague notion of what synthetic biology is and its potential impact, most do not have anything to associate it with. In fact, some may even find the juxtaposition of artificial (synthetic) and natural (biology) confusing or contradictory. There are even organizations such as the ETC group that have published biased and one-sided reports (""Extreme Genetic Engineering: An Introduction to Synthetic Biology) that are threatening to greatly damage public opinion of synthetic biology. Biotechnology has faced a similar challenge as it has risen to prominence over the past two decades, with misinformation spread and the public lacking the fundamental knowledge necessary to critically interpret this information. In order to combat this reputation, we need to raise awareness of what synthetic biology is, along with an honest and unbiased assessment of its risks and benefits. As this"

Such design process is a computation intensive work, so ABACUS may not be able to handle certain samples due to memory limitation. By then a notification will be sent to inform you of the failure.
BioCircuit
The design of robust and sensitive biological circuit are always bothering. To rationally design synthetic gene circuits with specific functions, we write BioCircuit. The plugin is an adpatation of the project BioBLESS developed by USTC-Software 2015, with the ability to design digital circuit, biological circuit as well as analyze the performance of them.
From a truth table to abstract logic circuits:
In Biocircuit, a truth table dialog box will be displayed for users to input Boolean numbers 0/1. All you need to do is to click Boolean buttons and then “Create”. The corresponding designed logic circuits with different predicted performances will be automatically generated and displayed in order. You can immediately and clearly see the configuration of a designed logic circuit, which in most cases is supposed to be a compli-cated multi-input circuit. Besides the function above, gates list will provide many Boolean gates, and users can drag them freely to our canvas to design logic circuits.
See the detailed structure of a designed gene circuit:
A simple click on “Gene network” button will lead you toanother tab where the detailed structure of your designed gene circuit is shown. When a gene circuit consists of many Boolean gates, it is crucial to understand the internal sub-stances and mechanisms. In this tab, you can see how substances react with each other clearly, such as inhibition and activation in or between Boolean gates.

The 3HB peaks in the experimental sample matched the commercial 3HB sample, as well as 3HB spectra found in the literatures. However, the NMR spectra for the experimental and control samples had extremely large peaks from residual methanol and ethanol left over from the harvesting procedures, a problem corrected in later NMR readings by freeze-drying at the end of the harvesting procedure.   Future directions  would be to test the hypothesis to see if phaC can be manipulated to increase  4HB-to-3HB composition in poly(3HB-co-4HB) and to increase efficient production  of the bioplastic by engineering the FtsZ cell division protein to allow for cells  to accumulate larger quantities of PHA granules before dividing. Ultimately, once  an optimal biopathway is found, the goal would be to explore a model for mass  production of PHA bioplastics so that novel applications of bioplastics can be

Radio Show
In early July Team Gothenburg was invited to a local radio station P4 Göteborg to be interviewed in their morning program with thousands of listeners. The interview raised awareness of science and iGEM. We also explained how science works and why it is important in society. Several common misconceptions were debunked about synthetic biology and genetics. Since a lot people are afraid of what they yet don't know, this was an important task. Our idea, the generation counter, was explained to the general public. But also simple methods we used, like gel electrophoresis. An interesting discussion took place about the uses of the generation counter since it has no application in a normal day to day life. Here you can find the entry on the hompage of P4 Göteborg.
Swedish teams Meeting
In late July, representatives from the Chalmers iGEM team traveled to Linköping at the invitation of the team from Linköping University for a meet-up. Three swedish teams were present, the teams from Uppsala, Chalmers and Linköping. The meet-up consisted of a tour of the campus, presentations of the projects by all of the teams and, perhaps most importantly, an Ethics and Collaboration Workshop.
The collaborative part of the Workshop concerned the future collaboration between the swedish teams. One important discussion point was the establishment of a support structure for new iGEM teams in Sweden where older teams can coach and perhaps even share experiences and expertise.
The discussions about the ethics of biotechnology mostly centered around the more troublesome aspects of biotech. Examples include the difficulty of biological patents, the prevention of uncontrolled or accidental releases and preservation of natural environments. Solutions were discussed, such as sterile crops or built-in kill-switches.
A discussion was also held about the future of biotechnology. The importance of public acceptance as a prerequisite for widespread commercial use was discussed, as was how to generate interest and acceptance in the younger generation as well as the general populace.
The Ethics Discussion has been summarized by the Linköping iGEM team and can be found here at their wiki .

Next in the public speech was the introduction of several projects in the previous iGEM competition. Teammates displayed the ‘This is not a lemon!’ project from Paris Saclay, ‘E. Gr?tzel, Solar BioEnergy’ project from TU-Darmstadt, ‘Membranes from Bacterial Cellulose’ project form Imperial, ‘Magnetic E. coli’ project from Berlin, ‘Engineering a synthetic microbial consortium’ project from Braunschweig University of Technology. Attendees were surprised about those creative ideas and work from undergraduates. Dr. Meng said that he was amazed by those work that done by undergraduate students and some projects were exceed his exception.
Figure 4. Audiences participating in the public speech
The final part was the most important section, the announcement for our own projects. We revealed two projects, which came out after long time discussion and brainstorm. One is a novel protein expression system with circular mRNA and RNA thermometer. Another is the synthesis of crispr-cas system in gliomas cell to specifically knock out CD44 gene for inhibiting cell migration and activation. Professor Lv asked many questions about circular mRNA. He thought it could be used as drug to regulate gene expression; however he doubted that whether it could be used for the translation of proteins. Hence, James explained the mechanism of group I intron self-splicing RNA and results from literatures. Pro. Lv agreed and would like to help us with the project. Dr. Liu thought RNA thermometer was quite interesting and could be widely used. She hoped we could use RNA thermometer to create a fantastic project. Although the projects were replaced by another better idea, we still gained a lot from group discussions and research training.

After this public speech, many biology students strongly wanted to join our team. Unfortunately, we had enough team members so that we encouraged them to participate in the 2016 iGEM competition instead. We discussed iGEM and its projects with professors and all the attendees present.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html," cell stress. The inability of cells to effectively manage cellular stress over time has been linked to cellular ageing and age-related diseases (Haigis and Yankner, 2010; Poljšak and Milisav, 2012). Cellular stress leads to deregulation of intracellular processes, as both the structure and function of macromolecules are compromised. Furthermore, high amounts of ROS have been implicated in cellular stress and ageing (Poljšak and Milisav, 2012).
We performed an additional assay expressing lycopene under the mNARK promoter, to test if the cells could survive longer under hypoxia-induced stress. E. coli cells transformed with this construct were compared with the wild type TOP10 E. coli (W/T) monitoring growth and division via optical density (OD) at 600 nm, at specific time points – 3 hours and 16 hours following withdrawal of oxygen.
mNARK-Lycopene cells had a higher OD compared to the wild type cells. Cells exposed to hypoxia were also compared with the cells that were grown with oxygen. Most cells still survived despite the presence of hypoxia.
Furthermore, with regards to W/T cells, a depletion in the oxygen concentration caused a drop in cell growth and division, as reflected in decreased OD measurements. However, growth and division of mNARK-Lyco-containing cells was maintained in oxygen-deficient environment during the 16-hour time test period.
This shows that our BioBrick construct (mNARK-Lyco) was able to ensure cell growth and division in oxygen-deficient environment.
The mNARK-Lycopene device is induced by oxidative stress and produces lycopene as means to 'mop up' the oxidative stress in the environment, in the form of a probiotic.
Under various stresses, the mNARK-Lycopene device promotes E. coli growth. Characterisation was achieved by comparing the performance of the BioBrick against wild type E. coli.
Initially, the growth of mNARK-Lycopene was compared with the growth of wild type E. coli. The mNARK-Lycopene cells substantially outperformed the wild type cells, reaching a final OD600 of around 0.45 and, potentially, still rising, while the growth of the wild type cells had clearly levelled off over the equivalent time period and had began to die, reaching a final OD600 of around 0.12.
After carrying out the positive control, the mNARK-Lycopene cells were tested under conditions of simulated oxidative stress, with the LB media containing "

DOPA-DUO
LASA iGEM
Dopamine (3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is a catecholamine and phenethylamine family chemical that perform important functions within the brain and body. While its causes are still unknown, Parkinson’s disease is highly associated with the lack of dopamine in particular regions of the brain. Presently, one of the most common treatments for Parkinson’s is the prescription of levodopa tablets, which increases dopamine levels by introducing dopamine’s chemical precursor, levodopa to the body. Our project involves building DNA circuits that produce and sense levodopa levels using bacteria. One plasmid focuses on the production of levodopa, including the HpaBC gene, and the second plasmid, a multigene assembly, senses the levodopa produced by the first plasmid. The sensing plasmid includes a promoter ppddc, a cognate promoter for the L-dopa responsive transcription factor, pp2551, a LysR family activator. We have a Venus fluorescent protein assembled into the sensing plasmid so that we are able to visualize and measure the amount of levodopa produced via a fluorescence assay.

Penn_State,2014,Team:Penn State#Biodetoxification_-_-_TEXT.html," agricultural waste. Bioethanol and biodiesel can be blended or used as automobile fuel, among other uses. One way to produce biofuels from biomass is by using bacteria to ferment the sugars in plant matter to fuel alcohols. However, the bioenergy industry faces problems converting this inexpensive plant matter into high value fuels. Biomass is tough to break down and requires costly pretreatment processes before it can be converted to fuel. Pretreatment produces toxic byproducts, including furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF), which will kill cell cultures and inhibit the conversion of biomass to usable sugars.
To solve this problem, we intend to engineer bacteria with a recently discovered metabolic pathway that consumes furfural and HMF. Koopman et. al. identified the six enzyme pathway from Cupriavidus basilensis and showed that it functions in Pseudomonas putida.  In C. basilensis or P. putida, HMF can be used as the sole carbon source. Engineering bacteria with this pathway would allow them to survive and produce biofuels but also use the toxic HMF as an energy source. However, this pathway does not function in Esherichia coli is commonly used to manufacture valuable chemicals, including fuels, because it is fast growing, easily manipulated, and well-studied.  Based on our recent experiments, the pathway also does not function in Pseudomonas fluorescens, a microbial relative of P. putida.
The first and foremost objective of our research is to identify the genomic differences that allow the pathway to function in one organism, P. putida, but not E. coli or P. fluorescens.  We will do this using a novel approach, combinatorial dCas9 gene knockdown.  Cas9 is an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease that cleaves DNA at precise locations.  Cas9 binds CRISPR RNAs (clustered regularly spaced short palindromic repeats) in order to bind corresponding DNA sties.  The deactivated form of Cas9, dCas9, contains two mutations that block its endonuclease activity, but it still can stably bind DNA and block transcription.  Gene expression can be lowered 100- to 1000-fold. To carry out combinatorial gene knockdown, we will construct CRISPR RNA libraries containing all possible 3-gene combinations for the 19 target genes we have identified. These libraries and the dCas9 system will be co-transformed into P. putida construct containing the HMF pathway. These"

git clone git://github.com/jkdirac/igame.git
Build
We use cmake to manage the build progress, cmake can generate cross-platform Makefile, we intend to make our project could be built in different operating system. Until now, only Linux operating system is tested. Windows and Mac should be supported soon. Download all source code, run cmake-gui to configure the project. Pay attention to the configure information.There should be ""missing ***"" messages when Cmake fail to find the dependent libraries. To fix those messages, one need to assign the path of related libraries by Cmake GUI. When Makefiles are successfully generated, execute the Make command to build.

York,2017,Team:York#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"hardtii sample had (4.17 x 105) cells/mL and the G. sulphuraria had (3.02 x 105) cells/mL. We suppose, therefore, that Galdieria made up 42.0% of the resultant co-sample's organisms by number. Our count from figure 34 is 42.1% of the count in figure 33. Figure 33's count was found by considering the entire range of documented radii for both organisms [7][8]. Figure 34's count was the upper half of that range, within which G. sulphuraria has been documented to reach during its lifecycle [8]. We conclude that it is most likely that we have found the ratio between two organisms of slightly different size in a co-sample. This, we present as evidence that our microscope and software are a useful tool for the determination of cell density in samples containing multiple visibly distinguishable organisms.
In short, the above data evidences the promising potential of our software and hardware combination with respect to use as a non-intrusive and fast method of monitoring the growth of cells in monocultures and in co-cultures. All of the image processing and calculations as outlined above can be done, in minutes, on the same Raspberry Pi that is used to take the images.
Motility Observations
Below we present evidence that our microscope is capable of showing the movement of organisms. Unfortunately, C. reinhardtii was the only organism we captured moving autonomously. We also tried to modify E. coli to increase its motility (see the Description page), though this was unsuccessful. We borrowed another strain (DB5) that moves a lot, too. When we tried to look at it using our microscope, we couldn't see any moving cells, despite being able to see them under a light microscope. We did capture footage of E. coli moving due to the flow of liquid medium, however. It is presented below, also.

Figure 35: A GIF of a C. reinhardtii cell moving in a sample at 5x magnification.
Figure 36: A video showing a C. reinhardtii cell moving in a sample at 5x magnification.
Results: It is apparent that the cells, above, are moving autonomously when compared with the motion due to flow as seen for E. coli below. The movement of C. reinhardtii is considerably more erratic and does not follow a single line/smooth path.

Professor Matt Higgins
Professor Matt Higgins is based at the University of Oxford and works on interactions that human-infective parasites make with their human host, focusing on the parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma brucei). He uses structural and biophysical methods to characterize these host-parasite interactions, and to guide the development of improved vaccine components. We initially approached him to learn more about the detection of Trypanosomes within the human host but he informed us that the differences between the lifecycle of T.brucei and T.cruzi were too different to be able to draw direct parallels. However, we were able to use the insight he provided into other pathogens to improve the potential of our project being used as a platform technology, by swapping the input and outputs as required.

Reporter Module
Reporter module is designed to detect the existence of cytoplasmic stress by naked eye. One of the cytoplasmic stresses is the formation of inclusion body due to overexpression of LC Cutinase in degradation module. The overexpression of the protein may result in an inefficient protein folding where not 100% proteins are useable and probably, the misfolded protein will create an aggregate known as inclusion body that decreasing the system efficiency.
Inclusion body inducible promoter (PibpAB) then will detect the formation of inclusion body and report it by expressing amilCP, a blue fluorescent protein that detectable by naked eyes, make it easier to analyze whether the stress level of the cell is in the limit or beyond the limit.

(ii) All India iGEM meet-up 2017
This collaborative event was a huge success. 9 out the the 10 Indian iGEM teams(including IISER Pune) joined us in our Institute for a Mini-Jamboree. Team Peshawar Pakistan also joined us via Skype. The meet-up was 2 days of intense discussions and talks on various projects. Teams helped each other by posing potential problems with the projects and then brainstorming solutions for the same. We talked about safety, viability, usefulness of each project. This helped us a lot in improving our work.  We helped team Peshawar in selecting a topic for the project by discussing pros and cons of each topic.
(iii) Social media and whatsapp groups
We got to talk to many teams via our facebook page. We filled survey forms of many teams and also forwarded them to the others.
We had a very active iGEM India whatsapp group which was extremely helpful throughout the course of the project. Be it the Visa application or DNA ordering or troubleshoot of some experiment, this group always been of incalculable help.

SYSU Software iGEM team visualizations
Our team began to scrape team data and abstracts from the iGEM database using a web scraper, with the aim of                 identifying common themes between different teams, so as to create a tool that could potentially help teams                 find others with similar topics in the future. We wish to further improve the database by converting the                 csv file, which contains a lot of keywords, into a visualization where the output will be a visualized diagram                 that is easier to search, more creative and more user-friendly. Because our modelling team is not expert                 in making visualization using JavaScript, we decided to post our collaboration request on iGEM collaboration                 page to seek help from iGEM teams to improve the visualization for interested iGEM teams to use in the future.
SYSU software team was enthusiastic about this collaboration. We have achieved our final goal for this finished                 product, which is to put the Network Visualization on our wiki page!
This is how we make the visualization happen: CLICK ME
Modeling and characterization collaboration with CUHK
For modelling collaboration, our modelling team bidirectionally cooperated with CUHK's modelling team in the early summer.                 We contributed two Python scripts for CUHK team. One of them was for simulating and plotting an ODE-based                 model using Euler's method. The other was for simulating and plotting a stochastic model using a Gillespie                 algorithm. Both of these scripts were used for them to model the proportion of active and inactive toehold                 switches in their project.
In the opposite direction, we received from CUHK iGEM team a Python interface implemented with Cython that would                 allow us to call functions from a library called ViennaRNA which is written in C. Since it can be quite difficult                 to use functions between different languages like Python and C, and CUHK team’s interface greatly simplified                 our workload for modelling. We used this interface to estimate the dissociation constant for the antis"

Re-streaking of ccaS_EcoRI, pGEM-amilGFP and pSB4A5. We were supposed to re-streak pSB1A3-amilCP and pSB1A3-PcpcG2 as well, but the transformants had no colonies at all.  We suspect wrong plasmid backbone or no ligase added during the cloning attempt. To investigate this the transformation was redone and we re-cloned pSB1A3-amilCP and pSB1A3-PcpcG2 again. O/n of pSB1A3 from the strain collection to test whether we had the right backbone in the frozen stock. We also transformed pSB1A3 backbone, and plated the transformants on A, C and K-plates.

Glyoxylate Shunt
Overview
Our artificial  futile cycle design is based on the tested findings by Dean et  al, who demonstrated that by introducing the artificial glyoxylate shunt in mouse  liver cells, fatty acid uptake would increase and the mice would acquire  resistance against obesity when fed with fatty diet. (Dean, 2009) In essence,  we are reproducing their work from scratch but through the use of standard  BioBricks.
Dean, Jason T. Resistance to Diet-Induced Obesity in Mice with Synthetic Glyoxylate Shunt. 2009. Graphic.
In Dean et al.’s  work, the glyoxylate shunt was achieved by the expression of two key enzymes  from the bacterial glyoxylate cycle, isocitrate lyase (AceA) and malate synthase (AceB). When the two enzymes enter mitochondria in liver cells, isocitrate  lyase will convert a proportion of isocitrate into glyoxylate, which will then  be converted by malate synthase into malate. This process would bypass the pathway  through alpha-ketoglutarate, and therefore, bypassing the ATPs and reducing  equivalent generating steps. (Dean, 2009)
To reproduce  this masterpiece, we would first need to convert every single part into  BioBricks: we cloned out the glyoxylate enzymes genes aceA and aceB from E.  coli and assembled them with mitochondrial leader sequence (MLS). The two  translation units were then assembled downstream of mammalian constitutive CMV  Promoter and EF-1alpha Promoter respectively. Lastly, the hGH polyA signal  sequence was added to serve as terminator of the construct. These constructs,  when put together, should return the original constitutive glyoxylate shunt.

During this project we have learned so much about synthetic biology and Alzheimer´s disease. We are very proud of our project and eager to spread the word about our work, our organization and the iGEM competition. Since we started this project we have joined several events to get the knowledge of iGEM to spread. We have also been active on social media. We have been posting pictures of the daily labwork and other events to get people interested in our project.
Nordic iGEM Conference
The team from Copenhagen Denmark invited all the Nordic iGEM teams to a mini iGEM conference.         The conference was held through June 9th to June 11th and a total of nine teams from Denmark, Finland and Sweden were represented.
The conference started with presentations from two Danish iGEM-teams from 2016, CosmoCrops and DTU BioBuilders, where they told us about their projects and experiences of the Giant Jamboree in Boston.         This was followed by a barbeque, where the teams had a chance to get to know each other and get a sneak peek of what each team had decided to do for their project.
The second day had the full day scheduled, starting with workshops called Business & Innovation in iGEM and Communication, how to sell your project.         Later, there was a mini jamboree where all represented teams presented their projects.         The day ended with a nice dinner, where the winner of the mini jamboree was announced and team Lund was the lucky winner.         They received the prize, a golden pipette, and were asked to host the next Nordic iGEM Conference.
The last day started with a workshop called Feedback session, where the teams gave each other feedback on their projects and presentation. Another workshop followed in Ethics. The day then ended in a final lunch with the other teams.
Hike
In connection with the reception of new students at Linköping University, a hike is annually organized in order to inform and encourage new students to get involved in university associations. LiU iGEM took the opportunity to tell them about our project and our organization. We gave a short presentation about iGEM and what we do"
Tec-Monterrey,2012,Team:Tec-Monterrey EKAM#Modular_-_-_TEXT.html," fluorescence microscopy, using specialized software (ImageJ) for an objective appraisal of the images. The results here presented reveal the successful implementation of the promoters in the system and the functionality of this product of gene expression. Further characterization includes the detailed study of the effect of inducer concentration in the medium over time.  We are aware of the characteristics of GFP that make it a non-ideal reporter chromophore. The availability of molecular oxygen in its surroundings is a source of variability in its fluorescent activity. Also, the correct folding of the protein takes a certain amount of time and also depends on the medium’s conditions, inserting noise into the results. However, GFP provides an easy way to track gene expression in simpler systems. The data to be collected on promoter strength is purely relative and specific for its setup, providing a general baseline for their usefulness on other projects.  The availability of inducible promoters for a biosystem is useful when a tight grip on expression of the genes of interest is desired. Applying the modular biofatory design strategy, they come extremely handy if the purpose is for each module to be expressed at different times. It would be possible to construct a mathematical model quantifying the effect of each of the separate modules using distinct promoters for each group of genes associated to a specific function of the genetic construct.

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Project#DataPage_-_-_TEXT.html," unique collaboration between philosophers and scientists within our team, we formulated a new additional approach: Bottom-up or ethics from within. This approach improves the communication between different stakeholders and achieves reciprocal understanding in early stages of the project. From this approach the government, scientists, the public and even the industry can benefit. This new approach is bottom-up structured where the dialogue between philosophers, scientists and the general public is central. We have developed a new and strong framework for this approach in which we also explained why we should inform the general public using the ideas of philosopher Hannah Arendt and we examined the responsibility of synthetic biologists using the ideas of philosopher Hans Jonas . This is not only a first time in the iGEM competition that these well-known philosophers are read to provide a strong foundation, but has also never been done in the scientific literature!
In short, we consider this bottom-up collaboration between students a new starting point for approaching human practices within the iGEM competition.
Thanks to extensive dialogue we designed a product that interests both relevant industries like Biobest & pcfruit and the public. Furthermore, we also asked end users (farmers) if they would use our BanAphids and the results were very positive!
Our symposium for the general public was another opportunity for interaction with the public. We invited the other Benelux (Belgium, The Netherlands, Luxembourg) teams to present their project. We hope that this symposium will become a yearly tradition in the iGEM competition.
We also go the youth interested in synthetic biology! We went to high schools with our very own Plexiglas ""biobricks"" which the students can use to work get familiar with the BioBrick system and we made a 3D-bacterial model , which gives the students an idea of what a bacterium looks like.

Conclusion
Le cancer du poumon non à petites cellules, ou NSCLC, est un cancer dit agressif. Il se développe dans la lumière de l’organe à une vitesse relativement élevée. Cette localisation tumorale est fortement corrélée à la localisation des facteurs déclenchant la tumorogénèse (contenus dans la fumée du tabac par exemple). Les cellules tumorales perdent leur capacité apoptotique suite à la perte fonctionnelle de divers suppresseurs de tumeur jouant un rôle dans la voie de signalisation de la cascade apoptotique. L’application du DVS dans la lutte anti-cancer repose sur le fait de réactiver cette cascade apoptotique en apportant au sein des cellules tumorales une version wild-type des gènes codant une version saine des suppresseurs de tumeur non-fonctionnels. Le projet COSMIC de l’institut Sanger nous a permis de recenser les gènes les plus susceptibles d’avoir mutés dans le cadre d’un cancer du poumon. Ainsi nous avons pu déterminer la composition du plasmide thérapeutique appliqué à cette physiopathologie.
De nombreuses études ont montrées que le poumon est l'un des tropismes naturels de Mycobactérium avium chez la souris, comme chez l’homme. Après une injection en intraveineuse de M. avium, le vecteur tissulaire arrivera bien au poumon et pourra s’y développer. Le premier concept du DVS , pour cette mise en application, est donc validé. Concernant le second, la littérature montre que la création d"

Michael's entry
PEG Dialysis
Protocol according to Rockwood et. al (2011)
100 grams PEG in 900 mL ultrapure water
mix with stir bar. Solution should be clear.
add 10 mL of dilute silk to the dialysis tubing
dialyze for 20-22 hours. Cover the solution with aluminum foil.
remember to use the silk within 3 days after this concentration dialysis!
Observations
Our solution that we put into the tubing is 5.2% w/v.
the PEG solution is too dense. The dialysis tubing is essentially floating on top, buoyed by the dialysis clips.
I think this might slow down the diffusion of water out of the tubing. Maybe more dialysis time will be needed?
PEG dialysis start: 4:25 pm
should end the dialysis at like 2:00 pm tomorrow.
PEG dialysis start: 2:00 pm, May 21
the concentration dialysis does not look promising
most of the solution was unsalvageable -- it gelled up inside the dialysis tubing
solution is too difficult to retrieve from the dialysis tubing
ended up squeezing out about 100 uL of solution from it
pipetted 10 uL onto a weigh boat to determine concentration (uncertain if our milligram-sensitivity scales will be able to determine an accurate dry weight)
Dry weight is 2 mg. That is 20% w/v, very close to what we had expected.
solution looks extremely cloudy
after about 2 hours, the 100 uL that we had was completely gelled up. I think I exerted too much shear force when removing it from the dialysis tubing.
Lesson learned: the concentration dialysis must run for less than 22 hours
Also, use the dialysis cassettes instead of the dialysis tubing
What might have gone wrong
the dialysis tubing was horizontal, rather than vertical in the PEG solution. As such,"

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!

Human Practice for Silver Medal:
First step: We want to spread awareness among medical students and staff at AinShams University, Faculty of Medicine about Synthetic biology and its applications in the medical field, and to encourage them to think outside the box and participate in such competitions and researches.  Also we believe that we should work on children and raise them early on understanding the importance of science and research.
How: We started by questioning random students at the faculty of medicine Ain Shams University about simple facts regarding synthetic biology. The lack of knowledge about the subject encouraged us to meet up with the college’s dean to talk about spreading awareness among both students and staff. Upon his immediate approval, flyers were made containing simple information about iGEM, synthetic biology and its applications in medicine as well as other fields. This was performed through a small event at the faculty of medicine Ain Shams University. The event was a success; both students and staff alike were very interested at what we had to say and they kept asking for more information especially concerning the field of synthetic biology. Such enthusiasm only served to encourage us to extend our human practice beyond university doors.
This was performed in 2 high schools in Cairo where we sat down with a number of students in a class room and explained some fun facts about biology and shifted to the rising field of biology which is synthetic biology, we were very happy to see such a positive response from those amazing young people.
Second step: Our aim is to spread awareness beyond medical staff, researchers and hospital, hoping to reach all youth in Egypt and worldwide. How: This was performed by starting a series of animated web videos on our YouTube channel. These videos talk about synthetic biology in a simple and visually attractive way. We started this series to serve as a basic introduction to the wonderful world of synthetic biology. You can find our channel by clicking Here .
Human Practice for Golden Medal :
Aim is to spread awareness and knowledge among researchers and physicians at 57357 Hospital about Synthetic biology and to get their feedback and suggestions about our work.
How: An educational session was scheduled at 57357 Hospital. The whole team was there for the session, we started by setting up our poster, setting up the presentation and everything was good to go.

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Introduction1_-_-_TEXT.html," medicines: highly selective in a molecular way, they lead to endogenous metabolites, which mean non-toxic. However, physico-chemical characteristics and biomimetic of these molecules makes them hard to administer. They are, indeed, badly absorbed (at tissue and cell levels) and often quickly degraded and metabolized and unable to reach their target at tissue or cell level. This is one of the principal limits of the development of these molecules as medicine.
For all these reasons, the development of active principle vectors is considerably expanding during last years. Based on new physico-chemical concepts, the galenic research permits to imagine submicronic systems administration, biological or chemical, able to: (i) protect the active molecule from degradation and (ii) control its liberation in time and space.

Pharmacokinetic modification, pharmacodynamic and bioavability [1,2]
A “classical” medicine is distributed in the organism in function of its physico-chemical properties:
- pKa,
- Lipophily,
- Kd (protein fixation).
Furthermore, a « vectorized » vector is distributed in the organism in function of its vector properties:
- Vector size,
- Vector lipophily,
- Vector global charge,
- Vector stability,
- Vector immunogenicity.
Its distribution, so its bioavability is not the same. The bioavaibility acts directly on active principle efficacy and toxicity. If the injected dose is concentrated in one place, a better efficacy is obtained than if the dose is diluted in the all organism.
Thus, a vectorized medicine is not distributed in the same way and has not the same efficacy and toxicity than a “classical” medicine.
In the case of a “vectorized” medicine, the natural distribution is avoided. It allows to the active principle to be delivered to its target, and to concentrate the dose on the interested surface. Efficacy is increased and the toxicity is decreased.
Back to top
Vector components [3,4]
A vector is a nanotransporter composed of several elements.
First, there is a reservoir, which is the active principle storage element. It can be very different in function of the vector nature. For example, it can be composed of phospholipids like in the liposomes’ case, or proteins, as in the viruses’ case. But independently of its nature, the reservoir has a storage function and manages the active principle protection.
Then, there is the targeting system, this system permits to completely change vector bioavability and release preferentially the active principle in the wanted organ, tissue or cell"

Desiree Brösamle
Desiree Scamander -
The only actual wizard in our team
When Desiree arrived at the city of Hamburg to complement her magical studies with a Master of Molecular Life Sciences, far away from home with her magical bag of lab equipment, she did not know what adventure laid upon her. At night (mostly on Fridays) she hunts Nifflers and Bowtruckles with her wizard-orchestra-group. But at day she supports our muggle-team and due to her time-turner she has always the time to be at the lab, when everyone else is busy. Furthermore, her good attention at potion class helps us to understand biological background and not getting lost in things that have to be organised. Most of the time she runs the daily work of our lab with the aid of her house elves Annika and Franzi (our other master students). The only reason we know about her secret identity is her language, which indicates education far away from a muggle society, which she claims to be a dialect from southern Germany. But we see the Ravenclaw inside her, intelligent and creative, and therefore we like her and her wicked smile!
Timo Zeimet
The Nurse (beeologist)
His beard is probably iGEMs most epic beard. For this reason, he found a place among us. He believes that secretly he is related to Jon Snow hence he always claims to know nothing. Knowing nothing however leads to a lot of questions and he is not afraid to ask them. Which greatly benefits the Team by clarifying everything in complete Detail. So Kutte became a true biocatalyst who is able to promote our interdisciplinary work.
Geoffrey Youett
The newbie turning expert
Geoffrey has never been in a laboratory before this year’s competition, nor had he heard a great deal about biochemistry or synthetic biology, but he is a quick learner, meaning that he soon became of valuable support, especially for boosting the atmosphere in the lab.
Apart from his work in the lab he is highly involved in the Human Practices team, where he has been leading his own little side project which has focused on interdisciplinary work. We presented our “learning by teaching” concept to other students of"

UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB
We established a collaboration with the IGEM UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB team , after realizing that our two projects had one component in common: we were both targeting air pollution.
We first organized Skype meetings and discussed through Facebook to improve our projects.
In a second time, we collaborated on our questionnaire. Indeed, we noticed that some of our questions were similar, so we sent the results of our respective polls. We then reflected together on how to analyze these surveys and defined a common method of analyzing these surveys.
We have gone further in the areas of law and entrepreneurship. Thus, we carried out for the Chilean team a study on French regulations and laws concerning air pollution. In return, the Chilean team informed us about Chilean regulations. We used their answers to improve our report on air pollution. Finally, the Chilean team helped us for entrepreneurship by carrying out the SWOT analysis of our device. We also had discussions on the development of a business model in the field of depollution.
Paris_Bettencourt
We had a very fruitful collaboration with Paris_Bettencourt iGEM team. We invited them to take part in the 3rd iGEM Parisian Meetup (see below) we organized in early July. In return, we took part to the great escape game they created. We betatested it and gave them feedback !  It was a wonderful opportunity to enjoy the view from the Montparnasse tower ! We also helped them by providing them with the silicatein biobrick our team designed last year. It was quite a struggle to locate it in our freezers but we are sure they made the best of it !
3rd iGEM Parisian Meetup
We decided to host an event where French teams could have the opportunity to present their project in front of a public and jury, just like at the giant jamboree! The goal of this meeting was threefold: 1) we both wanted to place teams in competition-like conditions; 2) we also wanted to socialize with the French teams and have a great time and 3) we wanted to work together and"

Nordic iGEM Conference
Helping other teams
Collaborations between teams is the very foundation of iGEM, and this year the Uppsala team partook in three major collaborations. Firstly, we arranged and hosted the very first Nordic iGEM conference together with the Stockholm iGEM team. In this project, planning, innovation and physical work was done in total collaboration. Secondly, we assisted the Chennai team in the start-up of their very first iGEM project. Planning an entire iGEM project is hard enough as it is, and to do it without any previous knowledge of the completion is even trickier. As such we provided Chennai with all the help we could give. Lastly we had a survey collaboration with SDU Denmark regarding the use of antibodies in iGEM.
Apart from these major collaborations, we also assisted several teams by answering surveys and providing them with previous years Uppsala biobricks not present in the distribution kit. Among the most popular were the famous Uppsala chromo proteins that were shipped to both Australia and Taiwan.

SYSU Software iGEM team visualizations
Our team began to scrape team data and abstracts from the iGEM database using a web scraper, with the aim of                 identifying common themes between different teams, so as to create a tool that could potentially help teams                 find others with similar topics in the future. We wish to further improve the database by converting the                 csv file, which contains a lot of keywords, into a visualization where the output will be a visualized diagram                 that is easier to search, more creative and more user-friendly. Because our modelling team is not expert                 in making visualization using JavaScript, we decided to post our collaboration request on iGEM collaboration                 page to seek help from iGEM teams to improve the visualization for interested iGEM teams to use in the future.
SYSU software team was enthusiastic about this collaboration. We have achieved our final goal for this finished                 product, which is to put the Network Visualization on our wiki page!
This is how we make the visualization happen: CLICK ME
Modeling and characterization collaboration with CUHK
For modelling collaboration, our modelling team bidirectionally cooperated with CUHK's modelling team in the early summer.                 We contributed two Python scripts for CUHK team. One of them was for simulating and plotting an ODE-based                 model using Euler's method. The other was for simulating and plotting a stochastic model using a Gillespie                 algorithm. Both of these scripts were used for them to model the proportion of active and inactive toehold                 switches in their project.
In the opposite direction, we received from CUHK iGEM team a Python interface implemented with Cython that would                 allow us to call functions from a library called ViennaRNA which is written in C. Since it can be quite difficult                 to use functions between different languages like Python and C, and CUHK team’s interface greatly simplified                 our workload for modelling. We used this interface to estimate the dissociation constant for the antis"
Goettingen,2018,Team:Goettingen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,") Sequence of the promotores PyciAB and PyciC including the ribosome-binding site (RBS) were fused to the xylR gene by PCR. (B) Mode of action of the glyphosate detection system.
By performing a β-xylosidase assay we could determine that this system does not react to the presence of glyphosate. This might be due to the fact, that the promotores are not regulated or the regulation is not strong enough.
4. Competition assay for glyphosate detection
4.1. Competition assay with fluorophores
Unfortunately, current analytical methods, which are based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and mass spectrometry (MS) are very expansive, slow, need sophisticated equipment and well-trained technical staff. Therefore, the development of a rapid and straightforward method to detect glyphosate is very attractive because the intensive use of the herbicide may lead to its accumulation in the soil and food. The basic idea of the competition assay for the detection of glyphosate is depicted in Figure 15.
Figure 15. The basic principle of the competition assay for glyphosate detection. In the absence of glyphosate (no selective pressure), both strains grow with the same rate. When glyphosate is present, the herbicide-resistant strain (expressing an orange fluorophore gene) will outcompete the wild type strain. Thus, the velocity at which the wild type strain is eliminated from the co-culture is indicative for the glyphosate present in the culture or test sample.
Two B. subtilis strains that tolerate different amounts of glyphosate are labelled with different fluorophore genes (Figure 16). The fluorescence labelling of the bacteria allows to count the amount of each strain when co-cultivated in the absence and in the presence of selective pressure that is exerted by glyphosate using fluorescence microscopy. In the absence of selective pressure, we expect that both strains will survive the co-cultivation. By contrast, in the presence of glyphosate, the strain that tolerates glyphosate will outcompete the glyphosate-sensitive B. subtilis strain. Thus, the selective pressure (≈ [glyphosate]) correlates with the amount of glyphosate-resistant cells and glyphosate-sensitive cells.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,As some members of our team and supervisors have participated in the iGEM completion previously they were already aware of the procedures involved in shipping DNA to the registry. All of our DNA poses no real risk as we were aware of shipping restrictions within the UK and to the US when designing parts. The standard submission kit was used to send off all of the DNA requested by iGEM.

Culture and education
School workshop
Exposing children to science is crucial for creating the next generation of researchers and their supporters. Therefore, we wanted to make sure that we reach not only adults but children and teenagers as well, to get them thinking at an early age about synthetic biology and the challenges and possibilities it offers.
On the morning of 18th June, members of our iGEM team gave a lecture at Degania school (Hebrew-Arabic bilingual school). They taught 5&6 grade class and were amazed from the level of questions and knowledge they demonstrated! They introduced the basic knowledge of Synthetic Biology to the students. Afterwards, they divided the class to 2 groups and played a quiz game (the winning group received a prize).            We ended the workshop with an experiment on growing bacteria, using the bacteria they naturally have on their hands.
They were curious about the biology world and asked many questions related to our work.             Throughout all of our activities we consulted with iGEM BGU alumni polices & practices team.             They advised us to use the great ""SynBio Activity Kit for Kids"" (iGEM BGU 2013) , that includes detailed explanation about the activities plus all materials needed.
    
    
Synthetic and Computational Biology Mixer convention
Hosted by Innovation Endeavors
On July 7th, we participated in Synthetic and Computational Biology Mixer Convention that was held in Tel-Aviv, and was hosted by Innovation Endeavors - early stage VC co-founded by Eric Schmidt (Google executive chairman). We presented our project in front of entrepreneurs, researchers, and students.
Public outreach
Radio
On June 9th and September 20 we were interviewed by two of the leading radio channels in Israel. (South radio 101.5FM, Reshet-Bet 95.5 FM).
We explained about synthetic biology, and presented our project.
Social networks (FB, Twitter)
In addition to reaching out to people based locally and across the country, we wanted to communicate with people on a global scale. To achieve this; we utilized Facebook and Twitter to reach fellow iGEM teams, friends, family and indeed anybody who is interested in what we had to say! We posted news articles, updates on our progress, and more.
In total, we gained 3,674 followers on Facebook, and 214 followers on Twitter.
The majority of people who liked us on Facebook were based in Israel, but we also had plenty of ‘likes’ from people all across the globe.

Features
Our app works on both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa . We recommend trying it out - the usage instructions below detail how to set it up if you're unfamiliar with the platforms or just want more help. Our app can currently lookup parts and iGEM teams or lead you step-by-step through protocols.
One of the most important features is that it makes you feel like you’re in Star Trek .
Hands free
Being hands free eliminates the need to touch surfaces such as phone screens or keyboards. This reduces the contamination risk, especially while handling biologically hazardous materials. This in turn improves biosafety, but also means you’re less likely to  contaminate your own experiment.
Not requiring books or laptops frees up space on the lab bench. This means you are less likely to knock over tubes when leaning over to look something up (trust us, we’ve done it)!
Integration with existing services
It sources parts data from iGEM’s Registry of Standard Biological Parts API, uses Protocat (Michigan Software 2014-2017 iGEM) for protocols and iGEM’s teams API.
It’s very easy to use the software in existing workflows; if your protocols aren’t already on Protocat they simply need to be uploaded and they’d"

Groningen,2017,Team:Groningen#carlosinsert_-_-_TEXT.html," VOSvisualizer (<
>). VOSvisualizer is a software tool designed in Leiden University to visualize bibliometric networks. One of the modes of analysis is word co-ocurrence which can be done on any kind of text. We downloaded VOSviewer 1.6.5 and conducted the analysis using the command line call:
java -jar /path/to/VOSviewer.jar -corpus 2008_abstracts.txt -counting_method 2 -min_n_occurrences 2
This call makes VOS viewer do a word co-ocurrence analysis with full counting of ocurrences (counting_method), for all words that are repeated at least twice. The corpus used was a file that had all abstracts for that specific year. VOSviewer generates a co-ocurrence network based on the frequencies of the single words or larger strings (terms) that are found repeated in the corpus. VOSviewer also generates a tab-delimited “map” file that specifies the link strength, number of links and number of ocurrences for each node (terms) in this network.
Word frequency interpretation
We consolidated all map files into one table (map table) and specified in a new column the year of each entry. Therefore if a term was captured in the analysis on more than one year it would have more than one entry in the map table. We subseted from the table words that had 3 or more entries (were important on more thatn 3 years). Because the popularity of the iGEM competition is increasing, recent years have more teams than older years. Therefore, a term that ocurrs for example, 3 times per abstract may appear to increase in ocurrence if the number of ocurrences is not corrected by the number of teams per year. There fore we preformed a correction were the each ocurrence was divided by the number of abstracts of that year. After this normalization we calculated a score for each term.
Score = O_first - O_last
Where O_last, O_first is the number of nomalized ocurrences in the last or first year available for that term respectively. This score aims to capture the terms that are more frequently used in recent times (positive) and the terms that are falling in use in recent times (negative)
We manually labeled the terms with the most negative and most positive scores based on their likely origin; if they represented a part of the lab equimpent or lab techniques (lab_equipment), or an idea behind the project (idea) or if they had unspecific meaning (term). Some terms did not originate from the description but from"

Low levels of catalase have been demonstrated in the epidermis of patients with vitiligo.[3] UV irradiation of the skin is known to trigger free radical generation and resultant melanocyte damage. Human melanocytes in cell culture are especially sensitive to exygen radicals and melanocytes from vitiliginous skin require the addition of catalase to the culture medium to grow. The melanocytes from healthy skin proliferate without addition of catalase enzyme.

The rate of viral particle production p from the intact helper plasmid was taken to be 33 particles per cell per minute [4].
The age at which viral particle production begins in P1 mod cells, j¬1, and the age at which viral particle production reaches a maximum, j2, are assumed to be similar to that of wildtype M13, and these values are taken to be 10 minutes and 40 minutes respectively [4]
The rate of viral particle production through complemented helper plasmid with gene VIII knockout is taken as bp, where p is the rate of production from intact helper plasmid and b is between 0 and 1. It is assumed that picking apart the M13 genome for purposes of complementation will either reduce efficiency or have no effect.

Analysis of Model
Sensitivity to Reduced Efficiency of Viral Particle Production
Since we are using gene VIII complementation of the helper plasmid to control viral particle production in primary receivers, it is likely that efficiency of production will be reduced in these cells relative to senders. We asked the model, “What is the sensitivity to reduced efficiency viral particle production in primary receivers, leading to weaker transmission of Mmod?”

We asked the model, “What is the sensitivity to reduced efficiency viral particle production in primary receivers, leading to weaker transmission of Mmod?”
We simulated the system with varying values of b, the percent rate of viral particle production, relative to p, in primary receiver cells. The system performance measure was the ratio of secondary receivers that receive Mmod vs Mori, expressed as P¬2 mod/P2 ori, measured at the time when all secondary receiver cells have received a message (Figure 3). For these simulations, modification and retransmission were induced, and the half-life of the switch in the original message, once received by primary receivers, was assumed to be 30 mins.

UAlberta,2018,Team:UAlberta#Inclusivity_-_-_TEXT.html," inform structural change we can foster positive development.
Team UAlberta also recognizes that there has been an increase in general presence of women and non-White university students in North America, even in STEM fields. However, the inquiry was premised on the sociologically observed disproportionality of access to academic activities much like iGEM.
What were our findings?
As this survey was a preliminary survey, the sample size was very small and is only representative of a very small portion of the iGEM community. However, it was found from the responses that men and women each make up approximately half of the iGEM community. Despite this, the majority of responders feel that there should be a greater presence of women in iGEM. We think this important because it speaks to the idea that while women may be present in a group that does not mean their doles are given proper credence or held in high enough esteem. The majority of the people surveyed identify as Caucasian and all surveyed identified as cisgendered. This identifies two large issues in the iGEM community. To be a truly diverse community, iGEM should be striving to have more than just a few ethnicities represented, and there should not be a disproportionate Caucasian majority. Moreover, there are many non-cisgendered individuals, but they are severely underrepresented in the iGEM community. Both of these trends are emblematic of the issue within our society of opportunities being closed to those who are racialised and those who exist outside the gender binary. Among the individuals that did not identify as straight, the majority have not faced discrimination and feel iGEM is an inclusive space, though the majority of responders do not feel that iGEM has a strong LGBTQ+ presence. This represents a common issue of LGBTQ+ individuals being “welcome” in spaces, but not being able to properly celebrate their differences. On average, people feel their opinions are more valued in iGEM than outside of it. We think this is a very positive trend and think that it can only be improved upon. The average age of responder is 20 years old and started iGEM when they were 19. For most responders, this is also their first year in iGEM. This reinforces our statementin our original conceptualization of the survey that iGEM is young. We see this as a positive thing, because it allows for less embedded ideas to take hold and change to prosper.

Our survey is an expansion on the Gender Study conducted by the Paris Bettencourt iGEM"

Processing Silk Materials
Silk is an excellent substance, but it can't do anything until it has been processed. The materials processing team works on making functional fibers and hydrogels from the recombinant silk proteins produced by the other teams. Currently, our focus is on creating silk fibers and hydrogels, as well as characterizing their respective mechanical and chemical properties.
Fibers
Silk is originally produced in spiders as proteins in liquid solution. It’s not until this solution is passed through the spider’s spinneret that the silk comes together as a fiber that can be woven into webs and fabrics. A major part of our project revolves around emulating this natural process using laboratory methods to convert liquid silk solutions into durable threads. We will be using two different methods of spinning silk fibers, to see the benefits and drawbacks of each method.
The first method is directly inspired by the natural spinneret structure of spiders. In spiders, liquid silk solution is passed from silk glands and forced, or extruded, through tiny openings at the end of the spinnerets. This process compacts the silk proteins, and forces them to organize into solid threads. In a similar fashion, we can use a syringe to force silk solution through a needle into a liquid bath that promotes coagulation. The resulting fiber can then be drawn through additional chemical baths that stretch it and improve its elasticity. The end result is a silk thread much like one that would be produced in a real spider spinneret.
The second method adds an additional mechanical element to the process. This process draws inspiration not only from the spider spinneret, but also from a machine that we know and are familiar with – a cotton candy machine. In a machine called a Rotary Jet Spinner (RJS), a reservoir with a spinneret-like nozzle is filled with liquid silk solution. This reservoir is then spun at extremely high speeds, up to 20,000 revolutions per minute. The centrifugal force of this rotation extrudes the solution through the nozzle at a uniform rate, causing compaction and solid arrangement of the silk proteins. As the thread is ejected"

GFP zone
Today I added a new ""exhibit"" to the underwater kingdom!
What is it? Extracting GFP from a jellyfish and putting it in a bacteria, which then glows green.
How do you do it? Simply click the jellyfish to receive the protein. Then, open the inventory of the bacteria, put the GFP inside, click on it and watch it glow!
Why would I do this? This will help people get used to using the SL inventory system because it will be required in the lab portion of our island. At the same time, it will be a visual representation of how cool it is to extract this stuff from animals and put it to use in bacteria.
Problems: Once I put the GFP inside the glowing bacteria stays like that. I've been using a sleep script for it to turn off but that doesn't eliminate the original GFP in the inventory so if I left it like this the GFP would build up inside. This would not be optimal, so I've obtained a script from Katie (she also helped me with the inventory script) to delete the protein inside. I hope to get this working by tomorrow.
In other news, I brainstormed a few pathways for the Synthetic Kingdom so people don't get lost and wonder around like Brownian motion. I also visited other islands in order to get an idea of how to structure the Help Island the people who come to our sim teleport on. Soon, I will have a rough draft of the narrative and path people follow (the only thing I have decided on is glowing platforms. They are ESSENTIAL).

Materials&methods and results section work
Both are complete (save the culture conditions for the bacteria in the Materials/Methods), although I think that they’ll require substantial editing and reorganisation. I had to take extra time to prepare my sequence results in nice form with the biobrick sites highlighted, which took longer than it was supposed to. I’m sending you the PDF now and I’ll convert it to Word later tonight.

My adventure with biology and biotechnology dates back to 1995 when I became a biotechnology student at University of Warsaw. In the year 2000 I completed my MSc thesis and I guess I couldn’t stop there so I immidiately started PhD studies. Now I’m done with studying and my job is to take care of students and introduce them into science. Still, I like being involved in crazy projects so characteristic of Sudents’ Societies. The more crazy and incredible project the better. I guess this is the case so here I am!

Before natalie came in today, the iGEM team played a bit more around with the cornerstone SDK. Natalie came into today, and she was fabulous. She held a workshop for us, and covered everything from the basics of synthetic biology to summaries of a couple of famous iGEM projects from the past. We also showed her some of our previous projects such as Bac to the Future and Synflo. It was super helpful because she gave us a lot of suggestions about how to make synthetic biology more accessible and more approachable to the general public.  We also talked about how to convey that synthetic biology is still very new and it is quite a lengthy process to create new things. We also talked about the ethical concerns that come along with synthetic biology and how to approach in a museum exhibit setting.

We also had our potluck today. Johanna brought a beautiful dish and Christina made really yummy gluten free brownies.  Around 2:30, we skyped Romie and Anja from the Innovation Museum. They are our collabotors we are working with on this iGEM project this summer! We are super excited to meet them very soon! We presented our brainstorms that we thought of this morning. They provided us with some really great feedback! They told us that they really liked the idea of space exploration for our project, so that can be a project idea possibility!

Today, we fiddled around with the multitaction screen a bit more.  We introduced the multiple markers to the screen as well as experiment with the marker sizes.  We found the smallest optimal size of markers we could use, and we also looked more into the process of marker recognition.  For lunch, we went to a program-wide lecture about cyanococchus bacteria.  It was really interesting to hear about what other scientists in different fields such as microbiology were doing.  We also got free lunch at the lecture today. After lunch, we played around with the multi-taction screen more, and tweaked a couple of things like the background of the screen as well as marker recognition.

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#History_-_-_TEXT.html," Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as Global Goals, are a set of universal goals, targets and indicators that meet the most urgent challenges facing our world. SDGs came into effect in January 2016 and since then, with 15 years horizon, set the framework for the United Nations Development Programme. SDGs follow and expand on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in which all 191 United Nations member states declared commitment from 2000 to 2015 (21).
The success of the goals depends unsurprisingly on their translation into the introduction of new legislations, improvement of existing regulations and the implementation of action plans in both governmental and sub-governmental level. Therefore, as it seems paradoxical at first, “localization’’ is the key to attain these ambitious global goals. Localization means to put everything within subnational frameworks, from setting targets to deciding the mode of action and selecting indicators for monitoring progress. And from this local perspective, we would like to show Biotic Blue potential to contribute to fulfilling these goals, which in our eyes mirrors its impact on our planet and society in the most accurate way (22).
Biotic Blue, to different extent contributes to attain 10 out of the 17 goals, demonstrating its capability to influence society on multiple levels (Figure 9).
Figure 9. The Sustainable Development Goals 2030 Biotic Blue contributes to be attained. (The illustration is a redesign of UN SDGs 2030 [23])
By minimizing the levels of hazardous pharmaceuticals in effluent wastewater and consequently in the aquatic environment, Biotic Blue increases safe re-use of wastewater and reduces pharmaceutical pollution. It also protects and restores water-related ecosystems including rivers and lakes.
Helps human settlements, adopting and implementing integrated policies towards inclusion. In addition, Biotic Blue enhances the capacity for more sustainable urbanization.
Helps the development of advanced regional infrastructure to support sustainable economic growth by upgrading the technological capabilities of WWTPs to treat wastewater.
Helps the achievement of sustainable management of consumed pharmaceuticals. Biotic Blue minimizes the adverse impacts on human health and the environment derived by the presence of pharmaceuticals in the wastewater.
Biotic blue helps in preventing and reducing marine pharmaceutical pollution protecting sensitive coastal and marine ecosystems. It stops the exposure of marine organisms to chemical entities not occurring naturally in the aquatic environment.
Helps to slow down the development of antibiotic resistance, which comprises a major and imminent threat to human health, by minimizing uncontrolled exposure of environmental bacteria to antibiotics.
Helps to preserve marine ecosystems that play a significant role in our effort to restore our planet's climate and mitigate the environmental impact of"

Introduction
Although the science is an integral part of our project, we put some emphasis on human practices as well. Every team member contributed so that we could have a diverse and engaging set of human practices. We reached out to many individuals, including one of our MLAs, the Minister of Environment, to get her support for our project. We talked to rural beekeepers in Southern Alberta to ask about the viability of our project, and to our city council. We also spoke with an urban planner to see how we could make our city more “bee-friendly”. We interacted with the public by handing out seed packets in parks, and informing them about the decline of bees and the city by-law that makes urban bee-keeping illegal. Many people signed a petition  we created to remove this by-law. To promote iGEM, we went to two middle schools to tell the students a little bit about our project and what iGEM is.
Government
Our project focuses on combatting Colony Collapse Disorder, a phenomonon in which the majority of the worker bees die or leave the queen behind, in a variety of ways, including genetic engineering and community outreach.  One method of supporting the bee population, and thus tackling Colony Collapse Disorder, is through urban beekeeping. Urban beekeeping has proven successful in many regions of Canada, but it is illegal within Lethbridge city limits. In order to understand the implications of this bylaw, and potentially amend it, we decided to reach out to local policymakers and urban beekeepers.
City Council By-Law
Dinula and Ronja presenting at City Council
Prior to 1983, residents of the City of Lethbridge were able to beekeep within city limits. However, an amendment to Bylaw 3383 now prevents residents from being able to do so. In Southern Alberta, bee populations are currently decreasing dramatically, with reports saying that North American beekeepers are losing approximately one third of their bees each year. As a way to help the bee population, our team made it a goal to try and have this bylaw amended"

The Team
The team came together during the course 'Mammalian Cell Cultivations for Production of Heterologous Proteins' in the month of June. Due to our late team registration we have been working hard all summer to catch up with the other teams. Luckily Mathilde was able to work full time on the project from August and we recruited a fifth team member Maja who joined us in the middle of August. We are five students from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) all studying biotechnology at graduate level. The project is conducted at the Center for Microbial Biotechnology, where associate professor Mikael Rørdam Andersen is our supervisor together with Post Doc. Helene Faustrup Kildegaard and Ph.D. Dorte Koefoed Holm.
