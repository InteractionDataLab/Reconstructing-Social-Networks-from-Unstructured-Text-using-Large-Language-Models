Two β-hairpin forming sequences were removed from the Ag43 coding sequence, maintaining ORF. Expression of Ag43 is under the control of the pBAD promoter; it includes a ribosome binding site as well as two transcriptional terminators.
Structure of the BioBrick was designed to allow easy insertion of foreign protein sequences of choice at codon 148 with a simple restriction digest with BglII and HindIII followed by ligation in cases where aggregation is undesirable.
Potential uses of  this BioBrick include surface display of foreign peptide sequences and synthetic vaccines production.
4.       Template for foreign peptide insertion
Depending on the length, desired foreign peptide sequence can be purchased as oligos or a synthetic piece of DNA. In order to keep the foreign protein sequence in-frame, a following template should be used:
5' gct gtg AGA TCT (your sequence) AAG CTT aac acc 3' [mote reading frame of Ag43 is indicated by nucleotide triplets]
BglII recognition site; HindIII recognition site; sequence adjacent to foreign peptide insertion site
5.       Making of the Biobrick and plasmid modularization
Bba_K1352001 BioBrick (Ag43+FLAG+MCS) was a starting material for this construct. Two β-hairpins were removed via In-Fusion reaction (Clonetech). For more information regarding the construction of this BioBrick please see: https://2014.igem.org/Team:Aberdeen_Scotland/Parts

EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," nucleic acid sequences originate from a healthy genome. We succeeded in differentiating them after amplification                       in plasma.
Ideally we would have wanted to see how sensitive our system was by lowering the concentration of template DNA added in the plasma. Our plan was to make a multiplex device allowing to test relapse emergence using many different chromosomal                       rearrangements, point mutation and miRNA that could easily be used in smaller clinics and hospitals. The idea is to do a one-pot reaction, i.e. isothermal amplification coupled with the Cas12a detection, with an easy readout, for                       example USB fluorescence microscope.
We believe that easy and thus frequent relapse detection tests could truly help save lives.

As we sat down to lunch with Barrett we learned of what our part of the collaboration would be. He told us that we could help them out by contributing to the past project data base they are putting together. Once we said we would be glad to help we were able to get even more ideas on how to improve our project for this year and improve future years as well. The first of these ideas was the founding of the RHIT iGEM twitter. After finishing lunch we said our goodbyes to Barrett and headed back to Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology with our pictures and ideas flowing through our head of how to finish off the 2016 year right."

Software
Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#testing#Circularization_-_-_TEXT.html," the construction of randomized promoter libraries. We modified Assembly PCR [12] to create promoters with randomized spacing and frequency of Transcription Factor Binding Sites. It relies on using different oligos containing a transcription factor binding site (or random DNA) plus two annealing sequences (see Fig. 1 for a comprehensive explanation of the method).  We use two sets of oligos, one for the top strand, one for the bottom strand. The oligos for each strand have the same annealing sequences (which are complementary to the annealing sequences of the other strand). If these oligos are pooled, they will randomly anneal to each other, thus generating randomized repeats of the transcription factor binding sites of interest at varying spacing. In order to be able to clone the construct, we also add two stop oligos (termed stop 5' and top 3') which contain only one annealing sequence, plus a cutsite (SpeI 5', HindIII 3'). Double-stranded DNA is created by running a seven-cycle PCR, and amplified by a  25-cycle PCR. Then, the resulting (proximal) promoter is cloned 5' of a core promoter (we used the core promoter of JeT [10] ) by inserting it into pSMB_MEASURE ( Part:BBa_K203100 ), the promoter measurement plasmid we developed (from there, it can be excised like any standard biological part in a submission plasmid). Thus, a mixture of different promoters in the same plasmid backbone is generated. These can then be transformed into bacteria. Each colony represents a single putative promoter, which can be transfected into mammalian cell. 24 hours after transfection cells are exposed to the conditions of interest and control conditions, serving as a reference. Promoters active under the desired conditions, but not under control conditions, are selected for further characterization.
Please see a detailed protocol for RA-PCR below .
[TOP]
Generation of a library of constitutive promoters
Most efforts of obtaining such promoters focus on cloning them from nature. This approach is, in eukaryotes, flawed for three reasons: First, promoters in eukaryotic cells are very complexly regulated by a wide variety of transcription factors, and thus, pathways [1] . One is the concept of ""genetic switches"" (see [2] for a recent review)

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#Brainstorm ideasecondweek_-_-_TEXT.html," that principle is defended by the team? What are the embodiment of that position? In which theoretical and practical examples?
Informatics.
What about taking in other “knowledge production sphere” their methods of creativity and innovation? For the team, what happened in informatics can't be traced in life science. The idealization of the geek mythical character (young, learning on his own in his room, quite critical and/or asocial) is quite operative here. That kind of character, making that things possible in informatics, can be find in informatics, not in biology.
IGEM : a certain DIY way to learn?
Christophe, who is from an traditional engineer school, admits that the way he “reach” biology through iGEM was quite DIY and on his own. He has to learn it by himself and, above all, for his own interest and needs : nobody asked him to do that. The idea of build your project, build your knowledge seems quite operating in iGEM competition. That idea leaded him to think that amateurs in science could be a good way to make people wonder about new stuff, and hope, in this direction, that “something happens”.
The idea of material constraint : what the lab permit to scientist, what the garage forbid?
The question of the cost of the failure is one of the main point expressed here : coding is free, of course it takes time but it is not like wet materials. Failure has not the same cost in both disciplines, so you don't take the same risk by doing it with amateurs and/or in a garage. Guillaume expressed the fact that a lot of what make synthetic biology interesting is in the lab. That thing can't be bring at home, for both cost of the outfit and the danger of handling.
“I don't laugh by doing a PCR”
Among that talk, the most representative sentence I've heard was something close to “I don't laugh by doing a PCR”. Is Molecular biology not fun because of the scale? Because of the special practices implied by that scale? The idea that “molecular biology is not fun” reconfigures the question : if you are not looking for fun or cooperation, you are looking for efficiency, results. That way, the failure finds other signification, the way to get that knowledge and results is not self-sufficient, results and knowledge are wanted. That idea was also symbolized in the critics against the MIT 2006 iGEM's project (which was about making bacterias smell banana or wintergreen), saying that the general process was impressive, but the “have fun"

Repressive protein LuxR in the lux cassette of V. Fischeri is controlled by the left promoter pluxL in the lux cassette of V. Fischeri.
BBa_K1421005:  pRPAI
In the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris, there is a quorum-sensing system RPAI/RPAR, which is similar to the LUXI/LUXR system in V. Fischeri. RpaI is the acyl-HSL synthase to produce p-coumaroyl-HSL by using environmental p-coumaric acid. RPAR is a signal receptor with homology to fatty acyl-HSL receptors (such as LuxR) that responds to p-coumaroyl-HSL to regulate global gene expression including the promoter of RPAI, pRPAI.[1] In deed, there have already been numbers of quorum-sensing systems; usually, the signals of these systems are not unique and inter-influence the other. While, p-coumaroyl-HSL (pc-HSL), the signal of RPAI/RPAR system is unique to AHL. So, RPA system is independent on LUX system and a part of its homologies. This part, pRpaI, is the promoter of RPAI. It opens the expression of the gene behind and meanwhile, can be regulated by the complex RPAR/pc-HSL.

Valencia,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Molecular_-_-_TEXT.html," also called RpoN or sigma N, was originally identified as the sigma factor for nitrogen-controlled genes. sigma54 works in conjunction with members of the NtrC (Nitrogenregulatoryprotein C) superfamily of transcriptional activators. In our case, when ammonia levels are low the bacterium undergoes some metabolic changes. Within these changes, there are some related to nitrogen assimilation and processing, so our construction, which responds to low ammonia levels, increases its transcription.
How did we deal with this construction?We developed a nitrogen-gradation tube experiment, which means that we added different (NH4)2SO4 concentrations to each tube, so we can measure a gradation of the protein fluorescence. We used a synthetic medium for this.

OXYGEN-REGULATED PROMOTER
This construction has two parts:
The transcription factor-binding site inside the promoter and
the coding sequence, which contains a synthetic fluorescent (green) protein. We chose as the promoter sequence the one of the nirB gene, because it is 100% dependent      on FNR [1,2], which is the transcription factor activated when there is no oxygen in the environment. It is involved mainly in cellular respiration and carbon metabolism      during anaerobic cell growth.
When is the protein synthesized? In order to obtain this green fluorescent protein one condition is required: anaerobic conditions should be met. We grew the bacteria in a oxygen-controlled environment [3].
The molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is as follows: the promoter is activated when there is a lack of O2 in the environment thanks to a family"

Yuze is majoring in material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
He learns a lot in the project and is always inspired by his teammates. “I did many things I’ve never tried before. And when my teammates are taking pains, I do feel encouraged and believe that I have to work harder”, he says.
Yuze first worked in the lab, while later he focused on designing and making the hardware. He also took part in some HP activities. Attracted by biology science as a participants in iGEM, Yuze plans to minor in biology.
Besides, he keeps doing sport and sometimes play music for relax. He is interested in numerous things and enjoys a fulfilling college life.
Yunfan LI
Riding the subway with my MP3 is the most enjoyable thing I can imagine.
Yunfan is a sophomore majoring in biology in UCAS.
He gets a pretty memorable experience with his fantastic teammates and sapiential tutors and learns a lot in the lab. That really promotes his gcolumnth in both knowledge level and spiritual level. He also recognizes what he is truly interested in and figures out his future researching plan in cell oxidation and reduction.
He spends most of his time on fighting with the experiment in lab and draws the vestigial energy out for the hardware designing and circuit welding. The interlab work is also finished by him.
Like most schoolboys in campus, he loves computer games and sports and can play badminton quite well. Taking the public transport for aimless roaming is also his favor. However, no one can strip the comic out of his life. Remember! No one!!!
Shubo YUAN
If I rest, I rust.
Shubo is a junior majoring in biological science at UCAS.
He learns some experimental operation of molecular biology, some methods to organize material and data, and many routes from the lab to the school. He wants to make biological experiments more automated to liberate biotech hands.
He undertook most of the experimental tasks in the group of ammonia degradation. He spent most of his time adding samples. He also did some work of human practice, but mostly ended in failure.
Outside the lab he has little hobby in addition to watching anime. Learning and experimenting make him happy.

""There are 10 kinds of persons, one knows binary and the other does not know.""
Overview
Our software consists of several parts.
For the model, we developed a website Graphical User Interface named VisualSTEP that allows the user to adjust the parameters autonomously and it can display the simulation results of the model in real time. This can help others understand our model in depth and freely explore how our STEP system works.
For general biological experiments, we developed a user-friendly biological parameter calculator, which can be applied in several kinds of biology reactions, to minimize the burden of life science researchers calculating parameters before carrying out experiments. These calculators have been used in our wet lab and some experiments done by some third-party users for a while, and have gained a good reputation.
VisualSTEP
We obtained several conclusions which are closely related to the results of wet lab and can provide guidance for future experiments from our model, in which the effect of protease cleavage ability on dynamic range may be the most difficult part to understand. Hence, we develop the software VisualSTEP, now begin your own exploration!   You can adjust the parameters p1, p2 ,d1, d2 in our birth-death process model to find the effect of them on dynamic range. In general, p1>p2>0, d1>d2>0. Hence, the dynamic range is negatively correlated with protease cleavage ability.

Paris_Saclay,2013,Team:Paris Saclay#ellen interview_-_-_TEXT.html," to be just a PhD scientist in a lab working on series of projects, I wanted to make a more global impact.
Team Paris Saclay : When we talk about the Open Source, people think about computer science, free software, but not about biology, so for you, what is the bio-open source ?
Ellen : Well, I think biology by its nature is open source, DNA is everywhere, and the only thing that really hasn’t been readily available is facilities and training. And I would also like to see certainly a lot less patenting of genetic engineering products…. The whole biobrick foundation is a very necessary and interesting legal mechanism for making things open source.
Team Paris Saclay : Do you think that people without a scientific education can make and understand biology and synthetic biology ?
Ellen : It happens every day at genspace!
Team Paris Saclay : What are their motivations ?
Ellen :I think that people are curious, curious about the world, they have heard some stuff about this kind of technology and they are interested in it. What surprises me is that a lot of them say it’s good for their career or it has impacted their career to know a little more about this stuff. Now not everyone who takes my classes is going to go on actually do a project in the lab, but a good number of them do. Our work takes a commitment of time. It’s not so much the ability to understand, it’s the time commitment that holds people back. You know we had people without formal training at all, doing genetic engineering, PCR and making constructs. And then we have the general public coming and doing things like DNA bar coding. And that’s people just off the street. We explain what we are doing and walk them through it and they do it
Team Paris Saclay : What do you say to people who are afraid by GMO and think it’s too dangerous ?
Ellen : This technology is very powerful ! Of course there is a dangerous side to it, but then there is side that  promises unbelievable benefits. Like any technology, like electricity or nuclear power, you have to handle it properly…You have to steer the exploration in the right direction but to shut it down is not the answer.  And in particular with this technology, as I said DNA is already open source, if someone wants to do something related to DNA, he can just extract it from anything around him. So yes, there shouldn’t be completely unbridled experimentation without any oversight at all, but it shouldn’t be completely opposite where you say"
Cornell,2013,Team:Cornell#team#bios_-_-_TEXT.html," Ithaca’s own superhero. When not saving freshman from ill-advised gorge jumping and the bipolar weather, Mac can be seen answering the prayers of his fellow iGEM members, once appearing out of nowhere to give his stranded members a ride, delivering his catch phrase, “come to daddy.” For the moment, Mac has decided to settle down in Ithaca to pursue his interests in neurobiology and biochemistry. For the sake of mankind, let’s hope he decides to stay here forever.
Prashant Sharma
Here we have spotted the rare Prashant Sharma in his natural habitat. Known as Shawn by the natives of these bleached-white halls, this elusive species is most easily sighted when mingling with others of its kind. Unlike previously examined organisms, those of the Prashant genus are capable of an untroubled manner granting them a unique niche in this high-stress ecosystem. However, also characteristic of the Shawn is an innate sense of humor that both its prospective predators and prey find startling. While researchers continue to study this enigmatic creature, there is much debate over the ethics and legality of their use as laboratory assistants, despite their seeming acuity at it.
Mark Simpson
Knighted as “the God of Electrocompetent  Stocks,” Mark has aroused a growing religion among iGEMers worshipping his ability to create infinite stocks with the bat of an eye. He has astounded his followers with his ability to eat red bell peppers raw and his Pillsbury doughboy impression will leave you giggling on the outside, but crying on the inside…out of happiness of course. After winging…I mean, graduating in 3 years, Mark acquired the nickname “Turbo!”, also reflecting his godliness in the lab. Mark is a valuable asset to our team, having trademarked several widely employed lab techniques such as hand centrifugation and mouth pressurized column chromatography. His sense of humor brightens the room, providing zesty comedic relief to our meetings.  ""Meeting adjourned!""
Christine Soong
Christine is from Ohio. Enough said. But wait, there’s more… In the U.S. government’s time of need, they turned to Christine.  She did not let them down.  Reluctant to leave the iGEM team, but knowing that country comes first, Christine heroically chose to spend her summer at a top-secret military intelligence base.  She masquerades as a summer intern at NASA, but in actuality she is a member of the CIA.  Of course if you ask her she would deny it; that"

Possible Future Applications
1. Probiotics - A Platform For Drug Delivery
Nowadays, drug are not necessarily produced by chemical combination purified from plants or other substances.                 One example is the probiotics that treat Clostridium Difficiles, replacing traditional antibiotics or fecal                 transplantation which may cause negative effects.
There is an increasing support on the effect of microbiomes on human health. Microbiome species present inside                 human body can tell whether a person gets sick and what kinds of illness that could be. Thus, microbiome                 therapeutics is a new hope and breakthrough technology.
The genetically modified bacteria used in the therapeutics can be programmed to detect signals when some dangerous                 or pathogenic bacteria invade the environment. This signal transduction allows bacteria to produce desired                 proteins that help combat with the disease bacteria. Nevertheless, while engineered probiotics offer several                 advantages to human health, it is still deemed as GMOs. Thus, safe implementation is necessary to remove                 engineered gene in this application.
In the light of growing microbiome therapeutics market size, we proposed that microbes can be functioned to deliver                 suitable amount of drugs under a concentration which can optimally cure human diseases. The engineered bacteria                 can be delivered simply in a form of pills like bacterial spore inside an oral capsule. Our construct simulating                 sensing, time delay and knockout condition will be suitable for tourists or soldiers who need to take these                 pills before traveling to a place with high risk of transmissible disease, but this drug will not need to                 express immediately unless diseases are detected. This would be cost saving and safer than taking drugs frequently                 especially when it involves antibiotics.
In addition, the environment will be kept safe by reverting microbes to their original state that can balance                 human flora and continue to serve beneficial purpose to human bodies.

1.Detecting Ruler
A series of ABS values and fluorescence values were obtained when we incubated the constructed bacteria with tetracycline containing                           concentration gradient for a certain period of time, so we can get the following relation:
Note:
Tc represents the concentration of tetracycline in the medium; ABS and FL represents the ABS value and fluorescence intensity in the bacterial fluid after 24 hours of culturing.
Those variable constitute the mapping relationship shown in the above formula.
We hope that we can get a ""ruler"" through the experiment, so that we can measure the ABS value and fluorescence intensity in the verification experiments,             and then reversing the concentration of tetracycline in the culture medium and even in the natural environment. That is:
Taking the E.coli strain( DH5α ) that converted into the plasmid pSB1C3 as an example: Draw our experimental data (a total of 400) into a diagram as follows, as circled in the red box, and you can see that there are some very ""strange"" data here, which may be the result of misoperation in some of our experiments. We call these outliers and it represents the data is needed to be cleaned.Taking the E.coli strain( DH5α ) that cnverted into the plasmid pSB1C3 as an example: Draw our experimental data (a total of 400) into a diagram as follows, as circled in the red box, and you can see that there are some very ""strange"" data here, which may be the result of misoperation in some of our experiments.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," we came up with the idea to synthesize our own new amino acid, combining organic chemistry, computational modeling, and molecular biology. We designed the novel synthetic amino acid Nγ cyanobenzothiazolyl L asparagine (CBT-asparagine), its cyano group undergoes a condensation reaction with the 1,2-aminothiol group of Nε L cysteinyl L lysine (CL).
Best Basic Part
For our project, we characterized the structure, kinetics, dynamics and subcellular localization of the nucleotide transportter PtNTT2 and different PtNTT2 variants. Therefore, we applied bioinformatic prediction tools, confocal laser scanning microscopy, SDS-PAGE, Western Blot, MALDI-TOF as well as HPLC-MS. In the future, advanced endosymbiotic systems or novel biosafety mechanisms can be developed based on this part.
Best Composite Part
This part ( BBa_K2201373 ) contains a T3 RNA Polymerase with an inverted mRFP under T3 RNA polymerase control for the enhancing of reporter signals. It is an improved reporter and a genetic circuit that could report even weak expression levels. It was designed based on the model of an amplifier in electrical engineering to intensify an existing input signal and could be used in a broad range of synthetic biology applications.
Best Part Collection
Our part collection expands the possibilities for advanced protein design, utilizing novel amino acids with diverse chemical abilities. We provide six different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for the translational incorporation of non-canonical amino acids to the iGEM community.
Best Software Tool
Our comprehensive software suite is composed of two connected modules for the analysis of unnatural base pairs in a specified target sequence: M.A.X and iCG. We postulate that our suite is also applicable to the study of DNA modifications and epigenetics.
Best Hardware
We designed and constructed a multifunctional LED panel in a 96-well microtiter plate format through multiple rounds of optimization. This device enables the extensive irradiation of samples with a high resolution of light of different wavelengths and intensities. Using our self-written Android application, complex illumination protocols can be programmed and send to the device via Bluetooth.
Integrated Human Practices
Throughout our project we got advice and support by over thirty experts that influenced our work profoundly. We organized a conference about the expansion of the genetic code and wrote a report about the chances and implications of an expanded genetic code. Find all human practices we integrated into our project here .

K are the affinity constants of the different compounds.
Parameters
Some parameters were found in the literature. Others were derived from other known constants as explained below.
Transcription rate
The transcription rate was calculated using the known rate of 2kb per minute6 which translates to 33.3 nucleotides per second. This rate was then divided by the amount of nucleotides in one mRNA strand. The values are in the parameter table.
Translation rate
The translation rate was calculated using the known rate of 9.5 amino acid per second12. This rate was then divided by the amount of amino acids per protein. The values are in the parameter table.
Transfer rate of protein from the cytosol to the nucleus
The rate of transfer from the cytosol to the nucleus was extrapolated from the formula rate = 0.01*(5000-size of protein in Dalton)-50. This is the multiplied by 119 or the average number of nuclear pores in yeast7. The first equation was determined by assuming that transfer rate of protein 5000 Da takes 0 seconds (its size being insignificant ) and a 17000 Da protein takes 120 seconds 11 .

Oxford,2018,Team:Oxford#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html,". While these ideas are very different, they all agree with the use of our technology as a moral act.
Consequentialism
Consequentialism can be summarised as the consequences of an act being the most important feature to consider. When we make a decision, we must weigh up the good and bad consequences of an action. The action is morally right if the positive consequences outweigh the negatives.
Our project has the potential to improve the lives of thousands of people and alleviate a great deal of suffering. While there is a potential risk of something going wrong, we have also designed safety precautions to minimise the risks. Overall, we would argue that our project brings a net positive benefit to the world and hence it abides by the principles of consequentialism.
Deontology
Deontology is seen as the opposing theory to utilitarianism. Deontologists believe that it is the acts themselves that dictate the morality of an action, not the consequences. Deontology is the belief that there are specific rules we have a duty to abide by, no matter the consequences.
There are many duties that we should abide by, according to deontological ethics, for example, beneficence and nonmaleficence (principles that we have already seen in medical ethics). Giving our treatment to patients is a moral act according to deontology as we are alleviating suffering and adhering to moral rules of helping others.
Virtue ethics
Virtue ethics is a relatively old philosophical tradition. Instead of following rules or considering consequences, we must instead develop good characteristics or virtues. We must act courageously, compassionately or honestly.
The use of our technology demonstrates the virtues of compassion and justice among others. It is therefore moral to use our genetically modified probiotics.
Appeal to nature
When discussing genetic engineering, there is a tendency for people to engage in a fallacy called the appeal to nature. The appeal to nature is when people state that something is inherently good because it is natural, or inherently bad because it is unnatural.
It is a viewpoint that many of us are taught to believe, companies will often parade a product as natural to make it more desirable to customers.
There are many examples that can be used to counter this logical fallacy. Diseases, natural disasters and poisonous plants are all natural, yet very few people would view them as good. Conversely, there are a lot of things in our world which are unnatural but give great benefit to humans such as medicine, electricity and artificial fertiliser.
People often equate genetic engineering with unnatural tampering of organisms. However, humans have actually been modifying organisms for thousands of years through selective breeding."

These agents may include nutrients, methanol, or other chemicals for pH adjustment (e.g. acids and bases). Workers may be exposed to these chemicals during their application either as a powder or in a liquid state.
Bioreactors may expose workers to pathogenic microbes during operation and maintenance. However, exposure to these pathogens is usually not a significant concern unless the wastes being fed into the reactors contain pathogenic agents. If the bioreactors are equipped with open aerators, microbe-entrained mists may become airborne. Inhalation of pathogenic microbes may cause allergic reactions or illness. During sludge handling activities, workers' hands may be exposed to microbes and result in accidental ingestion of pathogenic material (1).
In conclusion our team has taken many different safety aspects into consideration when working on our project. The safety precautions are critical to our next steps when moving forward in the future with our project plan.

These two parts                   are registered as BBa_K1330000 and BBa_K1330001 and they are listed at our parts wiki page.
Furthermore we intended to streamline the Anderson promoter library by                       transforming promoters formerly present in plasmid J61002 into the iGEM standard                  backbone pSB1C3.

This will be a great advantage for future iGEM teams working with the Anderson promoter Library.
Silver Medal Requirements
In addition to the bronze medal requirements the requirements for silver medal have been achieved as stated below.
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part works as expected:
The Spinach2 fragments has been transformed into E. coli. Original Spinach2 and Spinach2.1 containing two point mutations to remove an internal SpeI                   restriction site, have been demonstrated to fluoresce at equal levels. Spinach2.1 can be applied in our developed method for measuring promoter activity. The parts                 have been demonstrated to fluoresce only after addition of the fluorophore DFHBI-1T. Furthermore the fluorophore was proved not to cause significant fluorescence signal without the spinach. See our experimental results for more information. This validates that the novel BioBrick works as we expected, and thereby we have opened up for our new new method for measurement of absolute promoter activities                     with the Spinach technology.
Document the characterization of this part in the Registry.
The two Spinach2.1 BioBricks and the corresponding documentation can be found in the Registry with the entries BBa_K1330000 and BBa_K1330001 .

Oxford,2017,Team:Oxford#DNA Based Model_-_-_TEXT.html," it was still able to accelerate the release of hirudin.
As 11 minutes is very close to the common blood coagulation initiation time of 5-10 minutes, it is hard to tell if the blood will clot or not. Hence, we ran the blood coagulation model with this model’s output.
[Fig 8]
The lack of a distinct peak here indicates no initiation of blood coagulation, showing that an amplification step is effective.
Changing the Ribosome Biding Site Strength
To further increase the rate of production, we wanted to see what does changing the ribosome binding site will do to the production of Hirudin. We simulated the model with a Ribosome to RBS dissociation constant 2 orders of magnitude higher and lower than the current.
[Fig 9]
Lowering the Kd of the RBS increases its strength and increasing it decreases the strength of the RBS. However, we see that a weaker RBS has a larger effect on the production rate than a stronger RBS. Hence, our RBS seems to give very close to the maximum rate of hirudin production.
Stochastic Model – Extrinsic Noise
Most biochemical processes are stochastic in nature due to the uncertainty in the model’s parameters and the inherent unpredictability in the processes. Noise in biological systems can be classified into two groups – intrinsic noise and extrinsic noise. Intrinsic noise is the random fluctuations in reaction rates caused by the inherent stochasticity of biochemical reactions. It is more apparent in systems with a low concentration, where the low probability of collision creates large deviations in the rate of collisions. Due to our large reaction volumes of 30 μL, we have chosen to ignore the effects of intrinsic noise.
Extrinsic noise is different in that it is caused by the uncertainty or the variability in the model parameters. We modelled this by varying the parameters according to their measurement errors and running the deterministic model and plotting a histogram of the data.
[Fig 10]
[Fig 11]
[Fig 12]
These simulations aims to show the variability of positive test and negative test results. As seen in the graphs, we see some overlap between the positive tests and negative tests. These overlap areas creates false positive or false negatives as the result of one test can be interpreted as the other. Figure 11 shows the distribution of the time to thresholds of positive and negative tests. Using this graph, we can see that the best time to “click” the two parts of the kit is between 10 to 15. Anytime before that, and the positive tests will not have had enough"

The positive colonies were inoculated and PCR was done on miniprep plasmid to verify the presence of PHaA-CFP. A clear band at 19 kb was detected corresponding to PHaA-CFP. Similar steps were carried out with the linearized plasmid which also gave colonies, but no band for PHaA-CFP at 1,9 kb was detected before and after the miniprep step. This concludes that our PHaA-CFP was successfully cloned into pHT254 vector using conventional cloning.

In case the distance between the ribosomes and the membrane wall was too small for our system to be efficient, we also designed alternative variants the would feature the his-tags connected via a highly flexible two-glycine-four-serine linker (GGSSSS), which is a highly popular linker for artificial fusion proteins.
When the homology arm and marker gene pcr products are restricted and ligated, the end result is a single sequence with an antibiotic resistance gene flanked on either side by ~300 bp homology arms, in addition to the according tag fused to the selected subunit’s gene. The entire linear DNA product was amplified via PCR using primers that annealed to the ends of the strand. Large amounts of nonspecific product was present even after performing PCR of the whole ligated sequence, therefore gel purification was necessary after each amplification (Fig. 5).
Fig.3 Example of a constructed donor sequence. The sequence of the selected tag is present in primer used for the PCR of the homology arm that encompasses the target subunit. As a result, the tag sequence is fused to the ribosomal subunit gene.
Fig. 4 PCR of homology arms, and antibiotic resistance genes
Fig. 5 Constructed donor DNA sequences. The L29 donor DNA was not further revisited due to time constraints
The genome modifications were then carried according to our protocol . Although cPCR gave us mixed results, we could not verify any colonies that afterwards grew on our selected marker antibiotics, and thus could not continue our experiments with them. It appears most likely that the genome modifications were not entirely successful, due to the somewhat unstable nature of the ligated linear DNA used for the donor sequence.
Conclusion and Discussion
Although well described and planned in theory, our ribosome attachment system did not yield desired results. We hypothesize, that the underlying cause may include a flawed implementation of the CRISPR-Cas9 system: in our case we were forced to incorporate selection markers due to the functionality of the specific expression plasmids we used, which lead to the construction of unstable donor sequences. While this is unfortunate, we are still confident that our idea is worth further investigation: as we could not reproduce genome modifications on the subunit that has already been reportedly modified in a similar manner, it does not suggest that our primary concept is unworkable. Moving forward, we will most likely move to an alternative CRISPR-Cas9 expression system that would allow for optimized"

Thus, it is likely that our  vastly simplified promoter, while designed and refined by us to respond to TNT, would actually have a more ubiquitous role in responding to a range of important electrophiles and thus is ripe for characterisation not only by us but also for future iGEM teams.
The NemR promoter construct ( BBa_K1398007 )
The development of the NemR promoter was originally as part of the design of a kill switch we intended to implement. However, it was clear that impressive kill switches have already been widely developed and used. We decided instead to focus on a NemR switch that could be used to regulate them such that the bacterium would die in the absence of TNT. When we designed the NemR promoter, we debated where the ‘NemR box’ would be inserted into the construct sequence to enable successful gene repression and expression. We eventually opted for the NemR box to be placed in-between the -12 and -33 region of the promoter as this region appeared reasonably conserved across the Anderson promoter group available to us on the registry: http://parts.igem.org/Promoters/Catalog/Anderson . Thus we designed the NemR construct, BBa_K1398007 as follows:
Figure 10: The BBa NemR construct we designed
The construct begins with the synthetic promoter NemR, which combines a high-expression promoter with the NemR recognition box ( BBa_K1398008 ). It is followed by a strong RBS ( BBa_B0034 ), the fluorescent reporter iLOV ( BBa_K660004 ), a double STOP codon and a double terminator made up of BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012 .
The addition of the iLOV reporter gene was also to help further characterise part BBa_K660004 submitted into the iGEM database in 2011 by the team from Glasgow: https://2011.igem.org/Team:Glasgow/LOV2 . Given that this promoter would respond to TNT, this means we are also generating a biosensor for TNT.
While hybrid promoters have been designed before upon similar ideas, this is usually done to develop a switch with additional functionality to respond to the insertion of an additional engineered system (eg. For example, it is common that we utilise dual Lac and IPTG inducible promoters in the design of gene circuits). "

Phosphate Assay
We used the Abcam Phosphate Assay Kit (Colorimetric) to perform the phosphate assay.
Procedure
Sonication
Take culture that has been grown up to 0.75 OD and centrifuge in the large centrifuge machine for 10 min at 4000rpm and 4*C.
Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 4ml of DI water.
Take the tube to the sonicator and sonicate for 30sec, then put on ice for 1 min and repeat. (make sure to sonicate with ethanol before each sample to avoid contamination!)
Centrifuge for an additional 10min at 4000rpm and 4*C.
Transfer the supernatant to a clean ON tube and discard the pellet
Assay
Add phytase (the supernatant) and 3mM of phytate in a 96 well plate in serial dilutions.
Use phytate only as a control.
Wait 20-30 minutes to allow the phytase to work on the phytate.
Add the reagent from the phosphate kit.
Wait 30 minutes to allow the reagent to work on the free phosphate.
Place the well plate into the plate reader and read at 650nm.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Plant_-_-_TEXT.html,"M CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

Other controls in the experiment included Valinomycin, an ionophore that balances K+ ions down electrochemical gradient; Ferricyanide (FeCY), an electron acceptor impermeable to plasma membranes are in the assay outside the liposome; p-xylene-bis-pyridinium bromide (DPX) quenches the non-permeant pyranine pH indicator dye in the assay. 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone (DCBQ) and decylubiquinone (DQ) were the different electron acceptors tested in the assays; DCBQ degrades after long exposure to light, whereas DQ is stable for much longer period of time. Changing substrate DCBQ and DQ, the expected result is to show pH value decreasing as proton gradient acidifies the internal compartment of proteoliposomes upon exposure to light.
Adding Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) in the assay mixture causes break down of electrochemical gradient, and balance pH between assay and liposome. As a result, the pH of the sample increases. In this experiment, upon addition of CCCP after the 1020 seconds mark, the expected result is to see the pH going from an acidic state back to a state of equilibrium.

Attachment to Nanowire:
Our inspiration to attach the Photosystem II to the Gold Nano-wire is inspired from the work of the team of Dr. Yehezkeli. They developed a gold plate with immobilized Photosystem II protein via the Quinone Channel. In cyanobacteria, the Quinine channel is used to transport the electron from the Photosystem II to electron transport chain. We designed our assembling of the Protein with the nanowire using the same channel but with modified molecules. In order to find the best molecule that can harvest electron with highest efficiency, we tested Oxygen Evolution of the protein using multiple of Plastiquinone derivative molecules. A stack of this molecules would attach to our protein."

3. rRNA Depletion
The ribosomal RNA - rRNA, does not hold any relevant genetic information for us and makes up about 90% of the total RNA content of the cell. Using Thermo Fishers MICROBExpress Kit, the rRNA is removed to get rid of genetic static and to make future steps easier in terms of total material that needs to be processed.

4. Poly(A)-Tailing
Poly(A)-tails consists of adenosine nucleotides that are added onto the 3’ end of the nucleotide strand in mostly eukaryotes for translation purposes. Since these polyA tails are not present in bacteria, they need to be added onto the ends of our RNA to work as a primer target in the next step of the process.
Find Out More!
5. cDNA Conversion
Using our newly added Poly(A)-tails as a primer target, we subject our RNA to reverse transcription to create complementary DNA copies - or cDNA. The RNA needs to be converted into DNA to be sequenced with the MinION device. The original RNA template is then degraded and a second strand is synthesized onto the cDNA.
Find Out More!
6. Barcoding + Library Preparation
A necessary step to be able to make sense of the sequenced data is to attach so-called barcodes to the end of each cDNA strand. Barcodes are small sequences which are known beforehand and allows us to differentiate between different samples. Because two transcriptome samples will be sequenced at the same time, this will let us know which sequence came from which sample.
One final step before sequencing can begin is to attach the adaptor sequences onto the ends of the barcodes. These specialized adaptors allows the pores of the sequencing device to recognize the cDNA-strand and move it into the sequencing machinery.
Find Out More!
7. Sequencing
The MinION device, produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, works by applying an electrical current and pulling the DNA strand through small biological pores. This movement causes changes in the electrical current also passing through the pore - and the charge of the current varies depending on which nucleotide of the DNA strand is passing through at the moment. This is what enables the sequencing - the current changes are translated into the nucleotide order of the DNA strand.

 Overview
In our project we worked with multiple plasmids. We tried different reporter plasmids: RFP and GFP in high and low copy plasmids with different antibiotics resistance genes. We worked also with two different conjugative plasmids: pSW23T           ans pK18mob.
The plasmids used as reporter :
We worked with an Red Fluorescent Protein constitutive generator in the form of the biobrick Bba_J04450 and with the Green Fluorescent Protein generator in the form of a construction of two biobricks R0010, a LacI dependent promoter,               and E0840, a weak RBS promoterless GFP generator.
Both of those construction have been placed in high replicative plasmids backbones: pSB1R3 (with the specific resistance of the backbone R=C, chloramphenicol; A, Ampicillin; K, Kanamycin).
They have also been placed in low replicative plasmids backbones: pSB4R5 (with the specific resistance of the backbone R = C, chloramphenicol; A, Ampicillin; K, Kanamycin).
The submitted parts:
We sent two different biobricks.
The first one, K2654001, is our GFP generator with a weak RBS and a LacI dependent promoter. We used this part to discern our donor with the green color. We wanted a weak RBS to avoid a deflection of the ribosomes from the                   vital translations.
The second one is , K2654002, is a customable sgRNA with a switchable crRNA sequence. This biobrick was used to create two sgRNA’s for txo differnts targets: The RFP Bba_E1010 and the Ampicillin Resistance gene."

Human practice
The human practice of our team has been of ultimate success for the better part of last three months as we have excelled in as well as dedicated to the non-stop collecting of public opinion on our project, the education of Synthetic Biology to the general public, the endeavour of invoking interests in Synthetic among high school students, the collaboration with other teams and the forging of a meaningful relationship with the Fab Lab Shenzhen. Our ongoing human practice endeavour had started in early June and is still proceeding even as you read this line. The following events are some of the best out of the many.
The LIYSF 2016
The LIYSF, full name London International Youth Science Fair was held in London during the Summer holiday during which students from Britain and all over the world participated to present their advanced science project of immense diversity. Among them, our delegate, Danny, who presented the team’s project in the science fair before distributing questionnaires on the public’s opinion. Wearing our team’s T-shirt, Danny presented our well-written well-composed posters to the other intelligent young men and women in the fair. This event raised the scale of our project from within China to, boldly speaking, the world.
The London International Youth Science Forum Science Bazaar gives participants the opportunity to to share their research with students from all over the world, and to talk to experts about the projects they have completed prior to attending LIYSF. This year, over 140 of the 500 participants in the forum presented their research covering a wide range of topics. These topics ranged from hologram development, sodium chloride solution to absorb indoor formaldehyde, vaccinating teenage boys with the HPV vaccine, and using sniffer dogs to detect the presence of red palm weevil, just to name a few.
As one of the representatives from China, I present my topic on ‘ Paper-based Cell-free system For Comprehensive Testing’. This is our iGEM group project and we have work on this for a few month. The idea is to produce a test paper system that can be used to detect and measure the concentration of small biological molecules i.e glucose, that can be then used in further analysis. Where the innovation is we are trying to build a re-programmable and open-sourcing systems, that simply every biologist can get use to it quickly.
I am so glad"

Project Description
WHY
As fossil fuels continue to run out across the globe, many people are looking towards alternative sources of energy that are renewable and sustainable. One of these options is biofuel, fuel made from organic matter. Biofuel is most commonly made from ethanol, or bioethanol, which can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form. In the field of biofuel production, bioethanol made from cellulose continues to be the dominant form; however, harsh methods are required to be able to extract the sugars from cellulose and convert it to ethanol. In Atlantic Canada, the main export is wood, pulp, and paper. The processes of these mills have been shown to be environmentally unsound with large quantities of hazardous waste being expelled. As many of our members have seen first-hand, growing up near these pulp and paper mills. Along with hazardous waste practices, the extraction of usable materials from wood is fairly inefficient. These mills leave behind a great deal of wood waste that could be used for biofuel production if broken down and converted to ethanol. The only question is: how?
WHAT
The Dalhousie iGEM team this year is focused on using the microbiome of the porcupine to solve this conversion of wood waste to ethanol. A large part of the porcupine’s diet is made up of bark. Unable to digest the cellulose, hemi-cellulose, and lignin in the bark, the gut bacteria of the porcupine do the work instead. We hypothesized that the microbiome of the porcupine would contain enzymes that convert cellulose, hemi-cellulose, and lignin to glucose; a usable sugar. If true, we would be able to mine metagenomic sequencing for these enzymes, clone them into E.coli, creating a system that could convert cellulose to glucose. Finally, we would use this expression system in a bioreactor containing both E. coli and yeast to create ethanol from wood waste. The yeast being an integral part of the system to ferment the glucose created by the E. coli to ethanol, our biofuel.

We thought to share and spread our experience through our University. We organized a seminar for the students from the faculties of Biological Sciences, Biotechnologies and Environmental Sciences, where we talked about iGEM, Synthetic biology and Our project.
We also found interesting to interview some students from previous years' edition, and to broadcast the interviews during the seminar.

Synthetic Biology: a survey
To analyze how much synthetic biology, its applications and its ethical implications are known in our academic world, we decided to submit a short survey. We submitted it to professors, researchers, doctoral students and non graduate students. Here the survey and the results.
""Let me now comment on the question ""what next"". Up to now we are working on the descriptive phase of molecular biology.[...] But the real challenge will start when we enter the synthetic biology phase of research in our field. We will then devise new control elements and add these new modules to the existing genomes or build up wholly new genomes. This would be a field with the unlimited expansion potential and hardly any limitations to building ""new better control circuits"" and [...] finally other ""synthetic"" organisms, like a ""new better mouse"".[...] I am not concerned that we will run out of exciting and novel ideas"
Hong_Kong_HKU,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#hp#article#hk_-_-_TEXT.html,", the fund ceased making new investments in the end of March in 2005. In total, HK$ 28.27 million (around US$ 3.6 million) were invested to the field of biotechnology (""Innovation and technology,"" 2013).
Regulations for Synthetic Biology
Since synthetic biology is not prominent in Hong Kong, there is no law specifically related to it. Also, the Hong Kong government gives less attention to scientific research itself. In fact, there are laws that only govern the derivative products developed from research. If this legislative trend continues, it is foreseeable that the Hong Kong legislation will consider synthetic biology in more detail when there are more commercialized products that are manufactured from the research of synthetic biology.
Currently, there are only laws related to the genetically modified organisms and guidelines for medical products. In order to monitor genetically modified organisms, Hong Kong implemented the Genetically Modified Organisms (Control of Release) Ordinance and the Genetically Modified Organisms (Documentation for Import and Export) Regulation based on the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, which is an international agreement aims at ensuring the safe handling, transport and use of living modified organisms (LMO). Under the ordinance, the importation of LMO to Hong Kong (except for exemptions provided by the exemption notice) with the intention to be released into the environment requires prior approval from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.
In terms of bio-safety of cloned animals, according to the Hong Kong Agricultural Biotechnology Annual written by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Foreign Agricultural Service, Hong Kong government’s awareness towards risk assessment of cloned animals was not sufficient.   Moreover, it is not compulsory to label biotech foods or feeds in Hong Kong. The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) in Hong Kong released guidelines for voluntary labeling of biotech foods in 2006 because of the citizens’ urge of informed choices. The guidelines that apply to prepackaged food were constructed by a working groups comprised of members from various sectors including manufacturing, wholesale, retail, consumer groups and government departments. The guidelines mention that it is recommended to include information such as the intended use and presence of animal genes inside a product (Yuen, 2013).
Regulation for medical product is more stringent. If scientists want to apply synthetic biology to develop medical products that have clinical application, they will need to pass all the phases of clinical research. Starting from typical lab test, model organisms test, and finally to human test. Products that pass all these tests are finally allowed to be commercialized.

The bands at the bottom of the gel reflects the lengths of the biobricks truly. However, in some wells there are three bands although we used two restriction enzymes and there should have been two bands for each. This might due to using the fast digest enzymes and not waiting long enough before running the gel.  We had run the gel for LasI using normal enzymes and had seen only two bands before.
Today we also prepared some overnight cultures of DH5alpha cells (2X 3ml plain LB) for the Genomic DNA prep which will be carried out tomorrow.

Introduction
Mathew pipetting digested pSB1A2 plasmid containing the BioBrick BBa_J33206 into gel
Yesterday's lab session saw a few things happen: 1)We prepared the 'products' of a PCR reaction on the genome of Bacillus subtilis transformed with pGFP-rrnB and put it through gel electrophoresis, 2)The midi-prep samples stored in the freezer underwent ethanol precipitation and DNA concentration and 3) Agarose gel was made up for restriction enzyme digests (to be done today). Time ran out quickly and this prevented the team from performing the other tasks. We hope to complete the tasks in today's lab session.
Today, the Metal Sensing team intend to digest some samples of BBa_J33206 in pSB1A2 with enzymes EcoRI and PstI and run both them and an undigested sample on gel. The results of this experiment will determine our next moves.
Practical Outline
Jane helping the Metal Sensing Team with lab housekeeping during waiting times
The following list consists of the tasks the Metal Sensing team hope to achieve by the end of the day:
Carry out the restiction enzyme digests of the midi-prep plasmid DNA (pSB1A2 containing BioBrick BBa_J33206) and run them on the gel.
Carry out the genomic DNA preparations.
Procedure
Restriction enzyme digests of the midi-prep DNA
It was decided that four samples would be prepared"

June 25 - July 1
Monday: first day of pseudo-vacations! Classes are over and just the exams are remaining. Simon and Carla believe they don't have any left (the grades of the last test are not published yet), but they are confident. They are full time iGEM now.
Tuesday: Tried Gibson with new enzymes (again). KanR was amplified by PCR (finally after four failed attempts!!).  Also, we invited Dr. Endy to our Synbio Workshop in December and he kindly said he'd come (yeah!).
Wednesday: Gibson did not work this time so now we believe the temperature is the cause (we keep the DNA in ice throughout the whole procedure until the heat shock). This reaction worked in summer. Winter has come and we are waaaaaaay beyond the wall.  Tried Gibson at different room temperature exposure times before heat shock: no exposure time, 5 seconds, 15 seconds and room temperature.
Also, Simon and Carla found out they didn't skip the exams they thought they have so the mood is kind of low. And after the failed Gibson they decided to go drinking after the lab work is done.
Thursday:
Results of previous experiment:
- no exposure = +
- room temperature = +
- 5 sec = -
- 15 sec = -
Conclusion: We have extremists bacteria!!!

With help from other iGEM teams in China who volunteered to validate our circuit in their own lab, we obtained a large amount of data for modelling and modifying our system (see collaboration).

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds.

WPI-Worcester,2014,Team:WPI-Worcester#ATF1_-_-_TEXT.html," spectroscopy of this sample, whose results verified that these compounds were correct, as their molecular makeups were analogous to isoamyl alcohol and isoamyl acetate.
LB solution injected with 5mM isoamyl alcohol and 5mM isoamyl acetate.
In order to efficiently quantify the performance of these two constructs, we designed and performed a number of experiments based around E.Coli with the constitutive promoter plasmid, and E.Coli with the arsenic inducible promoter. The full protocol is located in our protocol section, and can be located through this link. Some findings through these experiments revealed that:
The arsenic based repressor may be affected by cadmium, leading us to believe that the construct can be affected by other heavy metals.
We based our concentrations off of MIT experience results on their BBa_J45200 experience page. But in our findings, the amount of isoamyl acetate is dwarfed by the 5mM concentration of isoamyl alcohol. The cell’s acetate output is very small compared to the initial alcohol injection. This leads us to believe that the production of isoamyl acetate can be misinterpreted based on odor tests alone due to its potency.
Although inducible by arsenic, cells appear to die off after the concentration of arsenite exceeds 5uM
Yields of isoamyl acetate were improved slightly when there was less open air within the incubation tubes
Our final Experimental procedure combined our best practices across our previous experiments. In the last procedure, we performed 10 different trials 3 times each. The constitutive promoter was used as a theoretical maximum possible yield. from the isoamyl acetate output observed, we used it as the base standard that the other results were based upon. The yields were based upon the Corrected abundance are of the peaks identified through mass spectroscopy as isoamyl acetate.  The results of the other trials and their errors were normalized to the value of the constitutive promoter.
Normalized results of the readings of isoamyl acetate presence.
From these graphed results (not including all of our negative controls, see protocol) we have obtained a variety of different results, despite the large variances from the standard error readings.
As expected, the constitutive promoter without isoamyl alcohol did not produce isoamyl acetate.
Conversely, when provided isoamyl alcohol, the acetate is produced, which is used for our expected maximum output that all other results have been normalized to.
Unexpectedly, when provided isoamyl alcohol but no arsenite,"

Packaging: The lab members attended a review meeting for the Materials Lab. This is where people gave mini presentations on how their projects were going and what problems they have run into. The Packaging members and Chia considered the advantages of using different surface proteins in order to package E. coli and decided on curli. The four Packaging students searched the iGEM site for parts (cellulose binding domains, CsgA, etc) was discussed.
Thursday (06/08/17)
The team attended a seminar given by a professor from Northwestern.
Sense/Respond: When they entered the lab on the second day the plates showed growth with distinctions of individual colonies. Mentor Mike Goodson ecstatically let the students know about the significance of the growth and students were relieved that their plates had grown! These colonies were used to complete the PCR protocol. The master mixture, (protocol tab) and LB broth in round bottom falcon tubes were left in the incubator (37°C), overnight. The plates were put in the refrigerator (4°C) to preserve the bacteria for future use. This protocol was used to confirm that E.coli JM109 had absorbed the plasmid PRhl_GFPa1
Packaging: The Packaging team clarified the goals of their project by deciding to attach a cellulose binding domain to the CsgA portion of a curli protein on E. coli bacteria. In the lab, the team worked with producing agarose gel, diluting a buffer, and using these components to run gel electrophoresis on DNA samples. Additionally, the team poured LB agar plates.
Friday (06/09/17)
Sense/Respond: For the last day of the week, the students’ goal was to confirm the E. Coli had absorbed the plasmid and then perform a MiniPrep Kit to take the plasmid out of the bacteria. To accomplish this, they first learned how to create a gel and how to use the electrophoresis. The electrophoresis sends the DNA down the gel using a positive and negative charge. Under a blacklight you can see if the DNA is present. Next, the students use a QIA prep spin Miniprep Kit to take plasmid out of bacteria. The students placed one nanodrop onto spectrophotometer to measure how pure the DNA extracted is. For future experiments, the plasmid DNA would then be sent to an offsite lab to be sequenced.

Aída: I tried to explain Jose how all the genetic algorithms should work in order to meet the BioBricks standards. I also downloaded from the NCBI the genetic code table and the codon frequencies tables for the main model organisms in synthetic biology.
Week 5
Testing and debugging genetic algorithms
Jose: I continued working on the writing process of all the module 1 genetic algorithms. The codon optimisation algorithm was pretty challenging but finally, it worked.
Aída: I tried to assist Jose with the biological part of the algorithms and I also tested the designed algorithms.
Week 6
Group meeting
We met up with the team to show them the BioBrick Creator first draft and also, how the genetic algorithms worked. From this meeting we got interesting advices and conclusions, in which we worked on the rest of the week.
Week 7
Module 1 finished
Jose: I finished the module 1 and I started to work on module 2. I wrote the composite parts algorithm. In addition, during this week I worked in managing output files and the formatting process. At the beginning I was sure to use only text files for output format files, but the FASTA format files were more easy to work with. Moreover, I decided what program features couldn’t be done due to time restrictions (future versions of the BioBrick Creator will implement them!).
Aída: I explained Jose how the output files should look like and what information should they contain. I also finished designing the Module 2 and I started working on the design of the Module 3. I looked in iGEM parts registry for the most interesting and well characterised plasmid backbones and I downloaded their sequences and main information.
Week 8
Jose: Hard work week. I implemented all plasmids information into the program. I finished the design of the module 3. I worked in the interface design and to complete the user experience I added helping buttons to guide during the execution, this would help confused users to navigate through the application.
Aída: I wrote help pop-ups and I tested each independent module. After the testing process I suggest Jose some minor changes.
Week 9
Last week!!
Jose: Almost done with it but still a lot of work to be done! I spent most of time testing, listening to other’s people opinions and finishing the program in order to upload it in time. I also designed and wrote with Aida the BioBrick Creator wiki page. Furthermore I made a video tour showing the"

Made 500 mL LB liquid media as well as 1 L LB + agar for plates.  Put approximately 20g each of LB Broth and Bacto Agar into the agar mixture, but it came out cloudy so we had to get rid of it.  For the autoclave we use, seeing as it is so old, we should now heat the agar mixture briefly to a boil on a hotplate first and then leave it in the autoclave for 25 mins.  The LB media came out just fine.
6/10/08
Re-made LB-agar plates according to method described above.  They came out rather successfully.  Good consistency.
With these plates, we then streaked out glycerol stocks of J63001 (EYFP) and J63002 (terminator) onto plates for growth overnight.
However, after realizing that J63006 had never been made into a glycerol stock, we attempted to transform cells with J63006 from the 2007 parts kit.  We decided against using the same part from the new 2008 kit because we would have then had to purchase Tris-HCl and make TE, which would have meant more money and more time.  Positive control for the transformation was a 3x flag provided by Diana.
We plated this transformation as well and put all of the plates into the incubator at around 11:30 pm.  Since we were unsure about how successful we would be, we made duplicate plates for each part. Our streaking technique was a little unique, but I had found it to work in the past.  You take out a dab of glycerol and add it to 1 mL of LB in a microentrifuge tube.  After mixing it uniformly, you then take a loop and sterilize it by getting it red hot.  After first cooling the loop in the agar of the plate, you then dip the loop into the liquid and get just a drop.  You apply this drop to the surface of the agar and streak as if you would streak a"

Congratulations! You've found our secret garden! Follow the instructions below and win a great prize at the World jamboree!
A video shows that two of our team members are having great fun at our favourite company. Do you know the name of the second member that appears in the video?
For one of our models we had to do very extensive computations. To prevent our own computers from overheating and to keep the temperature in our iGEM room at a normal level, we used a supercomputer. Which centre maintains this supercomputer? (Dutch abbreviation)
We organised a symposium with a debate, some seminars and 2 iGEM project presentations. An iGEM team came all the way from the Netherlands to present their project. What is the name of their city?
Now put all of these in this URL:https://2013.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/(firstname)(abbreviation)(city), (loose the brackets and put everything in lowercase) and follow the very last instruction to get your special jamboree prize!

INSA Toulouse
Already in mid-June INSA Toulouse asked us to send a brick. From our own experience, we knew that ordering bricks from the registry could take some time. Therefore we helped out the team of INSA Toulouse by sending them the brick BBa_K145150 from the KU Leuven team of 2008.
Purdue
The 2013 Purdue iGEM team started a project to bring a new standard to the datasheets. We gladly participated as we also consider this a serious problem."

Glasgow,2016,Team:Glasgow#WeeklyJournal_-_-_TEXT.html," of our laptops, apart from our computer scientist, Oliver. Pinja graced us with homemade chocolate-banana bread, although it was sadly slightly undercooked.
Week 3
Oliver worked on wiki designs and started assembling it. A logo and possible merchandise was discussed. S. thermophilus was the chosen winning yogurt bacteria, and ways of making it a chassis were debated. A beta-carotene biosynthesis plan for our yogurt bacteria was created. Our engineers changed the idea of a solar kettle into an incubator as a part of a solar oven and thought about using an Arduino in the yogurt maker. James gave us lovely demonstrations on all the lab techniques we needed to know for this summer. Catriona made the most amazing, mouth-watering brownies known to mankind (thanks Catriona).
Week 4
We finally started our wet lab work! It took a wee while to get used to all the different lab instruments, but we did get the hang of it eventually. We made our first batch of plates and made minipreps from some of the BioBricks provided on the distribution kits. More research was done of course. Liam, who claims he has never baked before, made a fantastic Victoria sponge.
Week 5
More and more minipreps were done. We attempted to ligate crtB and crtI together. We failed. The engineers continued constructing their solar oven. Oliver’s lemon drizzle was heavenly, fo shizzle.
Week 6
The engineers were having success with their solar oven building and incorporated a 3D printed valve into it. The wet lab team, however, was having minimal success with the ligations. We were all a bit down, but Dee’s nutella cake was a chocolatey dream come true.
Week 7
We finally managed to ligate our first two crt genes together! Everyone was happy. The engineers were tweaking their design with a valve 2.0. Lindsey made delicious chocolate chip cookies big enough to completely satisfy everyone’s sweet tooth.
Week 8
We made lycopene! On the other hand, we had yet to transform S. thermophilus, which made everyone, especially Katy, sad. Dee also seemed to be sad, as “everything is broken”. Poor Dee. Our engineers attempted to make yogurt with their newly 3D printed valve, but unfortunately it turned out rather gloopy. There seemed to be some debate about the success of this valve between Fergus and Simone, with “it works, yeah” as the only positive thing said about it. In the end, they decided to 3"

They have created 95% biodegradable biodiesel, that produces no greenhouse gas emission. Since 2010, the use of the recycled materials for biofuel in Montreal, from Evoleum, showed a decrease of 4.8 cents a liter on biodiesel. In Nova Scotia, the CelluFuel Company uses low-value wood fiber to convert into renewable diesel. They receive their wood fiber from Freeman’s Lumber in Greenfield, Nova Scotia. The wood fiber undergoes a series of catalytic induced depolymerisation’s to produce the renewable diesel. Today, CelluFuel is currently in its demonstration phase, and once they have successfully completed this project they will begin producing commercial-grade fuel.   Another upcoming company for biofuel production in Canada, is Woodland Biofuel, Incorporation. They are currently in their demonstrative phase with their start up plant located in Sarnia, Ontario. Woodland is interested in cellulosic ethanol production, using agriculture and forestry waste. The President, Greg Nuttal, states that it will be one of the lowest fuel productive costs, not just for ethanol but other fuel industries, including gasoline. He suggests the company will produce 200 million gallons per year. As of now, this company is looking into another plant location in Merritt, British Columbia. Clearly biofuel production is a popular industry sector with each of the aforementioned companies carving out a particular niche for themselves. We believe that in this competitive field, our project could have potential to hold its own. Firstly, our project would utilize cellulose-containing waste from various industries and therefore our feedstock substrate would not be limited to one particular area. This could be important in the future when certain resources become scarce. As long as our substrate contained cellulose we could convert it! Secondly, these companies still seem dependent on chemicals, water, or heat to aid in the production process. Our project would utilize the enzymatic capabilities of microorganisms to convert cellulose into glucose. Furthermore, we could modify this process to enhance for production, for example, by modifying our organism. While we are a while away from making a name for ourselves in the Canadian biofuel game, we have found our own niche within the market.

The work was carried out in the Microbiology laboratory at the department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Southern Denmark in the city of Odense. Odense University was established in 1966. In 1998, it merged with two other institutes of Southern Denmark and became SDU. It has locations in multiple cities all over Denmark including Odense, Kolding, Esbjerg, Sønderborg, Slagelse, and Copenhagen with a shared focus on education and research. There are approximately 3.200 employees and more than 20.000 students enrolled; about half live and study in the city of Odense. Source Homepage of University of Southern Denmark. (Link)
Odense
Odense is quite an extraordinary city. Even though it’s the 3rd largest city of Denmark, Odense only has 2 buildings taller than the 4th floor. The city name originates from “Odins Vi”, meaning a shrine for the worshiping of Odin, the allfather of all gods from the Nordic mythology.
Located on the isle of Funen, placed almost perfectly in the middle of Denmark and with it’s direct connection to the ocean through a cove, Odense was a rich city of trade. A number of Danish kings lived in the city, Knud the Holy was even killed on the altar of the Albani cathedral during a tax-induced revolt. However, any historical figure pales in comparison to the famous"

PetBD worked really well at several temps but 63.5 Celsius appears to be the best temp, strong band that was very clean. This worked out so well I might try just running a 50 ul solution at this temp and saving it as backup stock. Confirm the same clean band with a 5 ul run of solution through gel.
CmR did not work at all  I was told K56 was the integration vector sent from Utah State but was unable to confirm that in any of my team’s notebooks. Will double check with David today and see if he has that same number in his note book. If it is correct, maybe need to play with DNA concentration and temps again.
*E. coli group has extra CmR, will ask Megan to bring over some of this stock (pSB1C3 – iGEM vector) for next PCR. Shintani thinks that maybe vials were switched in the beginning (KmR PCR also not working) or something went wrong during purification.
With better stock will run temp gradient PCR on CmR again.
7/22/11:  Gel for GLF at 65.5C yielded no bands.  Ran PCR of GLF at 63.5C.  Faint bands, attempted gel purification, will run confirmation gel on Monday.  Ran PCR for PETBD (50ul), which also yielded no bands.  Will run another gel for a shorter time period on Monday.  Will discuss options/next steps on Monday with the group.

Procedure: PCR was reperformed on KnR, petBD, INV, and agp with a temperature gradient in order to determine the optimum initial annealing temperature for the different parts of the agp knockout-invertase operon. PCR reactions contained phusion DNA polymerase and DNA concentrations of 1 ng/ul reaction. The initial primer annealing temperatures used were 72.0, 70.3, 67.6, 63.5, 58.2, 54.3, 51.6, and 50.0 degrees Celsius.

BNU-China,2014,Team:BNU-China#chinese-biopolicy.html_-_-_TEXT.html," the Prevention and Treatment of Infections Diseases” was thus born in 2004 as a response.  We currently have “General Rules for Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories” enacted in 2002, and “Standards for Biosafety in Veterinary Laboratories” enacted in 2003, to regulate related studies in synthetic biology on potentially pathogenic microbes.
I also suggest to establish a national committee to administrate products from synthetic biology. The committee should encompass experts from various field (including public health, environmental science, food hygiene, and food industry, etc), and would ensure the biosafety in research, mass-production, and marketing.
Besides, it’s also necessary to establish standards in safety assessment and risk evaluation. Concerning our experience in legislating and regulating GMO safety, the basis to enact risk evaluation for products form synthetic biology is the categorization with regard to the underlying principles.
BNU-China:
Thank you very much for this interview.
3. Advice on policy making
To improve biosafety, there are many different ideas. Some people, such as Kelle (2009), called for self-regulation and they think that subjective motivation is more important than regulation. However, in the view of economics, rational person are driven by profits, tragedy of the commons occasionally happens. Government regulation plays an important way in control it. Hence, clear and reasonable regulations are the most powerful weapon to gain biosafety.
The following aspects in China can be improved to make a better environment for the development of biology, especially synthetic biology.
First, we should make comprehensive regulation collections of biosafety. Regulations are the most powerful tools to lead scientific researches. If the regulations are too strict, they may inhibit the development of science. If they are too loose, biosafety will become a big problem. Good regulations are clear, comprehensive, easy to access for researchers.
Second, it would be much better if the Congress or State Council makes regulations for biosafety supervisory institutions. Besides Ministry of Science and Technology, Department of Agriculture and State Environmental Protection Administration, some other industry associations are also the supervisory institutions. Sometimes, it is hard to tell who should in charge of a certain case. No one to administrate or all to administrate makes it obscure and even finally cause corruptions or selective law enforcements.
Third, clear accountability is an essential issue. The 32 article of Regulation on the Bio-safety Management of Pathogenic Microbe Labs points out that Lab manager is the first person liable. However, it does not point out who is the second. As some labs are too big for the Lab manager to manage, the"
UCLA,2013,Team:UCLA#Project#ProjectDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," the normal DGR system. An enormous library of unique variants can increase the chances of identifying a protein-binding species in a screen. Having a large copy number of each variant is also important, as this number invariably decreases during purification steps – too few, and an actual protein-binding variant might be lost even before the final screening step!
There are few cost-efficient methods of calculating the number of copies per mtd variant within a given sample. However, the maximum average copy number per variant within a given sample can be calculated assuming that every possible variant is present at least once before copies of the variants are formed. This maximum is only useful as a loose reference since it is unrealistic to assume that the obtained sample contains at least one of every possible variant. Our protocol involves two separate PCR setups, the second of which uses only a subset of the variants generated from the first. This step limits the sequence variation at the first mutagenic island in the variants present in the final assembled library.
Displaying Diversity
At this time of writing, we have been unable to complete mRNA display and screening of the Mtd library. However, we will discuss the steps we have taken and are still optimizing, as well as future directions. We encourage you to stay tuned for the final results which will be posted here!
mRNA display links each protein variant within our library to its corresponding coding sequence. This allows for identification of successful protein-binding variants following screening. The technique has been widely used throughout the literature for similar screening and protein selection applications. Our mRNA display protocol can be completed in two days once optimized, and like other published protocols, is done entirely in vitro.
As previously mentioned, it is important to monitor and take steps to reduce the loss of sample diversity through the purification steps. A measure of the sample’s OD can be taken after purification steps to track any losses. Following purification of the in vitro transcription products, the sample should be ligated to the puromycin-linker. Maintaining near-equimolar amounts of RNA, splint (the oligonucleotide which connects the RNA to the puromycin-linker), and puromycin-linker has given us optimal results. RNA tertiary structures can reduce efficiency in these processes and should be avoided. Heating samples at 65 degrees Celsius for a few minutes can help prevent this from occurring. Prior to ligation, it is important to heat the RNA sample in the absence of DNA ligation buffer or ligase since these reagents often include magnesium ions, which may facilitate formation of tertiary structures. Following ligation, RNA samples should be run on a gel by electrophoresis to separate the fully"

The product “Chloramine 60 Tablets from SANOFI AVENTIS BELGIUM”6 contains 60 tablets of chloramine and costs 3.69€. According to the instructions, 1 to 4 tablets must be dissolved in 25L of water, depending on the water pollution degree. One tablet costs 3.69/60=0.0615€. Thus, treating 25 L of water costs up to 246cts (4 tablets) and up to 9.84cts for 1L.
To conclude, treating water with our system should not cost more than 10cts per L.
Conclusion about the scope statement
To conclude, the system must be able to detect V. cholerae and release AMPs from a threshold concentration of pathogenic bacterium in water. The water treatment aspect thanks to AMPs is essential.
The device that we have to create must gather technical criteria from an environmental, safety, material and economic point of view that we have listed in the scope statement. These specifications were defined taking into account the advice we received from the people we met throughout our project.
The design of the device will have to best fit these constraints to be accepted by our potential future customers.

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Pur"

- Absorbance :Photometric 595nm,
- Excitation :485nm FITC,
- Emission :535nm FITC,
- Mirror module : FITC (403) at bottom.

Data Processing for data from Envision Multilabel Reader
1. After E. coli carrying the right construct was grown to mid-log phase, GFP intensity and OD595 were measured every 30 minutes (up to 120min);
2. GFP intensity are subtracted with the background fluorescence which is the fluorescence of pSB3K3- BBa_E0240 . Curve reflecting  GFP expression change was plotted (from 4 measurements from time=0 to time=120); OD595 was converted to OD600, and average values were taken;
3. GFP synthesis rate was then obtained by calculating the slope of the above mentioned curve;
4. Absolute promoter activity of PBAD and BBa_I20260 were calculated by dividing the GFP synthesis rate with the  average OD600 value;
5. Averaged absolute promoter activity was then obtained by averaging the respective 3 sets of absolute promoter activity values;
6. Finally, R.P.U was calculated by dividing the averaged PBAD and absolute promoter activity over the averaged BBa_J23101 absolute promoter activity. R.P.U value of PBAD in different concentration of"
SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," composed of three genes named ho1, pcyA, and cph8, all of which are essential to ensure the cells ability to respond to red light. When the photocontrol device is exposed to light, a phosphorylation cascade activates the transcription factor OmpR, which in turn induces transcription through the OmpR-regulated promoter, BBa_R0082 . This system is combined with the RelE-RelB toxin-antitoxin system in the endeavour to mediate light-dependent dormancy in bacteria. In the first considered design of the light-dependent dormancy system, the aim was to clone the photocontrol device, BBa_K519030 , under control of a constitutive promoter, RelE under control of the OmpR-regulated promoter, BBa_R0082 , and RelB under control of a constitutive promoter, all into one high copy BioBrick assembly plasmid pSB1C3, as seen on Figure 1.
Figure 1. All three components of the light-dependent dormancy system cloned into one high copy plasmid.
The Photocontrol Device was Placed under Control of a Constitutive Promoter
From the constitutive promoter family the weak promoter, BBa_J23114 , the two medium promoters, BBa_J23106 , and BBa_J23110 , and the strong promoter, BBa_J23102 , were tested by fluorescence microscopy to determine which one to use for expression of the photocontrol device and RelB. Overnight cultures of the submitted parts expressed in E. coli TOP10 illustrated a clear gradient of increasing red fluorescent protein (RFP) expression correlated with the strength of the promoter, as seen on Figure 2.
Figure 2. Cultures of E. coli TOP10. From left to right: WT, the weak promoter, BBa_J23114 , the two medium promoters, BBa_J23110 , and BBa_J23106 , and the strong promoter, BBa_J23102 .
On the basis of the data obtained by fluorescence microscopy, the strong constitutive promoter, BBa_J23102 , was chosen to control the photocontrol device. For still inexplicable reasons the photocontrol device emerged difficult to clone with the strong constitutive promoter. Although the molecular cloning of these parts was optimised several times very few successful clonings were accomplished, and the few times correct assembly was obtained, the BioBrick was not reproducibly purifiable. By sequencing, it was deduced that a region of the plasmid containing both the promoter and the BioBrick prefix had vanished. To circumvent"
Lethbridge,2010,Team:Lethbridge#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," 3-Antibiotic assembly method to add a tetracycline repressible promoter ( BBa_R0040 ) for constitutive expression of the fusion protein. This addition generated BioBricks BBa_K331031 and BBa_K331030 for the C-terminal tagged and N-terminal tagged YFP respectively.
The BioBrick containing plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α cells. These cells were grown to an OD600 of approximately 0.7, and diluted 1:10 with MilliQ H2O immediately prior to analysis by fluorescent spectroscopy.
This dilution of cells was excited at 517 nm, and the emission spectra was read from 522 nm to 650 nm. Fluorescence at 524 nm (emission maxima of YFP) of control cells (Escherichia coli DH5α), N-terminal tagged, and C-terminal tagged YFP were compared.
Results
N-terminal tagged YFP did not have substantially more fluorescence than control cells. Cells expressing C-terminal tagged YFP had ten times more fluorescence than control cells and cells expressing N-terminal tagged YFP.
Conclusion
Our results showing that the placement of arginine residues at the N-terminus of our YFP results in no observable fluorescence over control cells are consistent with the general N-terminal rule reported by Bachmair et al. Assuming that transcription of this K331030 and K331031 are equivalent, these data suggest that the N-terminal oligoarginine is reducing the half-life of the protein to which it is fused, ie YFP.

Light will be observed at 476 nm when cells containing BBa_K331033 are illuminated with light at 439 nm as a result of the excitation and subsequent fluorescence of Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP).
Introduction
Prior to introducing a oligoarginine tail onto the catechol-2,3-dioxygenase protein with the intention of directing the fusion protein into a lumazine synthase microcompartment, there must be some confirmation that oligoarginine tail is indeed causing the protein to which it is attached to localize within the microcompartment.

Minnesota,2014,Team:Minnesota#Templates_-_-_TEXT.html," can best design our technology to meet the needs and concerns of the people whose waters we hope to bioremediate. We delivered a short synopsis of our device, the synthetic biology involved, and safety precautions we have outlined for our project. We then presented visitors with a five question survey using a Likert Scale to gauge public perception of both our device, and the synthetic biology methods used. The survey was a huge success with over 320 participants. With such a diverse attendance, our survey captured a great cross-section of the Minnesota community that would be impacted by the implementation of our device. The results of our survey, illustrated below, informed how and where the public would be most comfortable with implementing our device, and illustrated the need for catered education addressing the public’s major concerns prior to applying our device in the environment. Our model for gauging public perception allowed for a wide, diverse crowd to be accessed. This model can be used upon request.
Intellectual Property
Members of our team attended three Intellectual Property Protection and patenting workshops that educated them on the process of commercialization of our invention. This allowed us to develop a comprehensive business plan and perform an economic analysis of the mining, fisheries, and governmental markets that could potentially benefit from the use of our invention. We also worked in conjunction with the Office of Technology Commercialization to explore the patentability of our project, the novelty, the non obviousness, and utility of our product and how to make the best claims to patent our device or license it to Minnepura Technologies, Inc.

Documentary
In order for our project to reach commercialization and success with the public, we needed to inform ourselves as well as others of the ethics of the use of our invention. We compiled this documentary in order to inform those unfamiliar with the problem of global mercury contamination and to discuss the bioethical questions of synthetic biology as they related to our device implementation. We conducted interviews with specialists from environmental toxicology, biotechnology, and philosophy. Through our collaboration with the 2014 Colombia iGEM Team, we further examined the current mercury contamination in Colombia and around the globe.

Cloning of gRNA plasmids using annealed oligos
Cloning was performed in the same way as normal digestion - ligation cloning, but annealed oligonucleotides were used as insert.
Oligos were annealed as in Jao et al 8 , but using 1x ligase buffer instead of NEBuffer 3.
Two complementary oligos corresponding to the target sequence were diluted to 10 µM each in T4 ligase buffer (NEB) to a final volume of 20 µL. To anneal them, the following protocol was used:
5 min denaturation at 95ºC, cooling to 50ºC at -0.1ºC per second, remaining at 50ºC for 10 minutes, followed by cooling to 4ºC at -1ºC per second.
The annealed oligos were cloned into pT7-gRNA (Addgene plasmid # 46759). pT7-gRNA was digested with BsmBI and BglII for 1 hour. Cut plasmids were checked by gel electrophoresis, and digested bands were purified from the gel (hyperlink).
Next, we proceeded with ligation as usual, diluting the annealed oligos 16x to add 1 µL to 25 ng digested pT7-gRNA. Ligation mixtures were diluted 2x, and 1 µL was used for electroporation .
