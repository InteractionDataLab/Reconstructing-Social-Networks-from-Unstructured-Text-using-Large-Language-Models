The Gel of pSB1C3 with appended lox sites showed bands close to the expected length, so assembly of pC13BN can continue. We also did a ligation to create pC13BD and a digestion of pC13I.

Today, parts for pC13BN were DpnI digested, purified and Gibson assembled. We also performed a PCR of pC13F to append BamHI and KpnI restriction sites to the pSB1C3 backbone. The goal was to digest pC13F with BamHI and KpnI and ligate PpelA in place of ‘’mRFP’’ using BamHI/KpnI digested pA13BE (part pHNU3pelA). pA13BE is a plasmid generously given to us by the Turgeon lab at Cornell and contains the ‘’PpelA’’ flanked by BamHI and KpnI restriction sites. Thus, transferring ‘’PpelA’’ to the pSB1C3 backbone (creating the part pC13BF) would allow constructs made with ‘’PpelA’’ to be BioBrick submissible. All 4 of the PCRs (in addition to the BamHI/KpnI digestion of pA13BE) seemed successful upon gel electrophoresis. We also received the A. nigers pkiA promoter (‘’PpkiA’’) and xlnD terminator (‘’TxlnD’’) from the Wageningen team, which we plan on characterizing by cloning ‘’GFP’’ and ‘’mRFP’’ (in separate constructs) between the two.
pC13BN was Gibson assembled.

For the dead cell population, at higher temperatures, we see less dead cells. This is because killing starts early, and there will be less cells produced, and thus, less cells to kill.
We also note that when all E. coli have been killed, dead cell population seem to saturate.
N.B. Note that the values we have used for temperature are arbitrary, and they are for the purpose of illustrating the behaviour of the system. In reality, this will be linked to our data, and the parameters will change.

An Overview
Background
The Human Practice section of Tianjin iGEM 2012, considering the knowledge and demand of Chinese public, aims at popularizing the Chinese citizens' interest to Synthetic Biology and iGEM by building a series of network platforms to publicize interesting and abundant education material. Meanwhile, we hold a variety of activities labeled 'daily joy' along with academic information, to evoke the interest in the specific field for students from middle schools and universities. Seek for a Safer Future, trying to make public have a further sense of the development of transgenic technology and the hazard of gene contamination, enjoys a positive response among virtual and realistic society. Our idea extends to more scientists and teams with the help of the handbooks and summary from academic part of our activity.

After all, more attention is desired to prove that we are plotting a bright future belonged to Synthetic Biology in a positive way.
SynBio Museum of China
SynBio Museum
Our Science Expo Network, considered to be a great attempt in synthetic biology, aims to introduce the knowledge and the future development of the synthetic biology to China, a potential country in the field of scientific research and economic cooperation. We make full advantages of Chinese four mainstream SNS (weibo.com; douban.com; blog.sina.com.cn; renren.com;) to enlarge the popularity of synthetic among different ages, occupations and educational backgrounds, mainly Chinese new generation of intellectuals. We regularly publish science articles and conduct public activities, to enforce Chinese citizens understand more about synthetic biology and iGEM by text, images games, and competition. The establishment of the network platform ensures a rapid dissemination of information and a tremendous amount of reading materials. We earned a lot consensus and a widespread attention just in one month. Addition to the great charm and potential of synthetic biology, our innovation to spread the knowledge is a significant factor.

On the other hand, Prof Giamarellou expressed particular interest in the application of this diagnostic method in influenza, a virus that shows high mutation rates and frequent genetic reassortment. This would facilitate the identification of new strains, yet high mutation rates imply low percentage of conserved regions, on which toehold switches are based, rendering the determination of suitable switches challenging.

Final meeting with Dr. Chong before he leaves for two weeks. Catch up with supervisors on how lab work is going.
Rapid Assembly of Biobricks (RAB)
We found this easy way of joining two or more biobricks together:
1. Amplify the parts using VF2&VR primers (although specific primers make it easier).
2. Digest one product with SpeI and the other one with XbaI.
3. We would usually gel extract the fragments we need, which makes the next step easier.
4. Ligate the two fragments together.
5. Now amplify with PCR again the whole fragment that should have formed.
6. You can continue joining more parts together by repeating the above steps.
7. Finally, insert your new part into the iGEM plasmid using the standard procedure.
8. Transform.
Now many would argue that this continuous PCR would result in lots of mutations. However, polymerases with already high fidelity are being continuously improved to the point where their mutation rate is hard to detect statistically. Also, we sequence the parts anyway, so there is high potential in this assembly. We successfully joined our gold sensing device using this protocol. If you feel confused about the procedure, perhaps this picture will help to clarify the mechanism:
Beta galactosidase assay for gold induction
Growth:
1. Transfer one colony to LB with antibiotics and grow overnight at +37 °C with shaking.
2. Next morning transfer bacteria to fresh LB with antibiotics up to OD600=0.1 and continue growing until exponential stage (OD600=0.6-0.8).
3. Induce with required concentration of AuCl4 and continue growing at 30 °C or 37 °C depending on the experiment.
4. Samples for measurements can be taken at time points or after overnight growth.
Measurements:
1. Take 200 µl of cell suspension and measure OD630 (due to machine that we used instead of OD600) in a 96 well plate.
2. Take 100 µl of cell suspension for beta gal assay and mix with 100ul Z-buffer.
3. Add 10 µl 0.1% SDS and 20 µl chloroform and incubate at 30 °C for 5 min to disrupt the cells.
4. Add 50 µl 5mM PNPG and incubate at 30 °C for 30 min (incubation times can be extended up to 1h if the colour is not appearing, however the same incubation time should be"

In April 1941, I entered the seventh grade at Sasebo middle school. Japanese militarism was maximal at the time. We had to perform military exercises once or twice a week under the direction of the officers attached to the school. Later that year, my father was transferred to Osaka, and after the Pacific War began on December 8, we joined my father there. At school in Osaka, my teacher happened to be Shizuo Ito, a well-known poet from Isahaya. I contracted tuberculosis and was often tired; though I studied hard, my class rank was poor. I was interested in making model airplanes at the time. Once I built a plane based on an article in a scientific magazine, and I exhibited it at a large department store. My sister, Setsuko, was born, and I had to babysit occasionally.
When I was in the ninth grade, the war became clearly unfavorable to Japan, and my father was sent to Thailand. At school, missing lectures became common and military exercises increased. Once, on an overnight march to Mt. Ikoma, I saw many tiny irregular spots of light on the road. Now I think they were probably luminous earthworms crushed by shoes. In the summer of 1944, my father wrote us to move to the countryside to avoid American bombings. My mother chose to move us to her parents Fujiyama's house in Isayaha near Nagasaki. That September, on my first day of school (tenth grade), the teacher told us, ""This class is mobilized to the Omura Naval Aircraft Arsenal immediately. Other classes are mobilized to Mitsubishi shipyard and arms factory in Nagasaki."" Because the National General Mobilization Law had been activated earlier, I expected to be mobilized sooner or later, but I didn't think it would be on the first day of school.

In order to improve our productivity model, we designed a new method to detect curcumin concentration quickly and consistently. Our BioBrick and device allow for calibration of our productivity model to better demonstrate the efficacy of our soil regulation system.

Jilin_China,2016,Team:Jilin China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," tumor cells is more likely to be a parasitic relation. Based on the Holling Ⅱ Type Functional Reacting Model, we establish a differential equations as follows.
x_1: the population of tumor cellsx_2: the population of bifidobacteria The definitions of the parameters can be found in the link: (Get more information about our ecological models…)
Model
In this model, with the appropriate parameter, bifidobacteria can reduce the amount of tumor cells at the beginning. However, the population of bifidobacteria gradually drop as population of tumor cells decreases at the late phase, which indicates that bifidobacteria will not stay in the body ecosystem very long after tumor cells are eliminated.
Figure7: The population curve of bifidobacteria and tumor cells. the tumor cells slowly increase at early time. As the population of bifidobacteria rising, the population of tumor cells declined sharply, then the population of bifidobacteria goes down after it get to the maximum value. Finally, the population of bifidobacteria and tumor cells tend to zero.
The image of the differential equations above:
Model
2.3 Tumor cell - bifidobacterium-somatic cell model
This model estimates the population curve of tumor cells and somatic cells after bifidobacteria are introduced into the tissue. We consider the tumor tissue as a homogeneous environment, which contains a great number of tumor cells and a small number of somatic cells. When a small amount of genetically engineered bifidobacteria parasitize in such tumor tissue, the relations among these three kinds of cells can be summarized as follows
(1) Tumor cells compete with somatic cells, and bifidobacteria prey on tumor cells.
(2) Bifidobacteria compete with somatic cells, restricted by oxygen.
(3) Somatic cells compete with tumor cells and bifidobacteria.
We establish differential equations as follows.
The definitions of the parameters can be found in the link: (Get more …)
Model
From this model, tumor cells are killed by bifidobacteria and the population of tumor cells decreases. Then the growth of bifidobacteria will be restrained by the rising of oxygen concentration. When the population of competitors declines and the improvement of the environment, the population of somatic cells will constantly increase and reach to normal level finally. In this model, bifidobacteria can be used to kill the tumor cells and they will not stay for a long time in the tissue after tumor cells are eliminated.

Choosing Target Substrates and PCR Primers
Possible target substrate:
Single Colonies
Bacteria Solution
Plasmid
DNA Fragments
Design PCR Primers according to the purpose of the experiment
The choice of the reaction system is dictated by the specific experiment
Taq System: to primarily validate the DNA sequence.
KOD System: to amplificate long DNA fragments in high fidelity.
Golden Mix System: for rapid amplification of DNA fragments in high fidelity.
Set up the reaction system according to the protocol of the product you use
If the target substrate is single colony, use pipette to pick up a minute quantity of bacteria. Inoculate the bacteria onto a plate for further use. Then pipet up and down for several times in the solution.
If the target substrate is liquid, add proper quantity of substrate according to the protocol of specific reaction system.
Choosing the Reaction Conditions

We needed a proton-selective membrane to separate the anode and cathode compartments so that the circuit may be completed by the transfer of H+ ions from the anode to the cathode without allowing for the direct reduction of the terminal electron acceptor. For this, we chose to use a Nafion membrane due to its highly selective nature and efficiency in proton exchange.

Week 25 (Oct 23 - Oct 29)
Our SDS-PAGE results from last week showed that the cells were still not completely lysed following the original protocol due to the stringy state of the protein samples during loading. The protein PhaJ was also being expressed in the insoluble proteins, likely due to the inclusion bodies from culturing at high temperatures. Therefore, this week we decided to lower the temperature that the subculture grows in 28°C instead of 37°C after IPTG induction. However, our shaker temperature remained at room temperature when we checked on the cultures. Therefore, we still stored these cells after centrifuging and removal of the liquid in the -20°C freezer. We decided to make overnight cultures again and ensured that the temperature was maintained at 28°C. We then prepared the proteins from both of the samples from this week (subcultures incubated at room temperature 28°C). We made changes to the original protocol for SDS-PAGE by resuspending the frozen cell pellets in 500μL of STET buffer to reduce bubbles when sonicating and adding a sonication step. In addition, we resuspended the insoluble proteins in a higher volume of Tris-glycine running buffer; 100μL and 200μL for room temperature and 28°C samples, respectively. The gels were run for 50 minutes at 30mA.

Lan Le
Research Ethics & Compliance Support - University of New South Wales
Lan Le is a member of the Genetic Technology Research Committee at the University of New South Wales, the regulatory body within the university responsible for evaluating and giving approval to its labs. We spoke with Lan about the regulatory framework within which she operates, and any potential issues the current framework may have. Lan outlined the success of the current system based on the relatively high success rate of applications. She also noted that most of the declined applications were based on high-risk activities, where the university lacked suitable facilities, or where the intended activity broke university conduct. Lan also noted that the current framework, the Genetic Technology Scheme, was under review, inciting the interest of medical and plant-based biologists.
Our conversation with Lan turned to the recent decision in the EU to restrict CRISPR-Cas9 use in the genetic modification of food, and issues with governing bodies only being present for genetic modification as a whole, rather than being split into plant and medical focused bodies. Lan informed us that the genetic technology component of our project would be considered the use of Escherichia coli, but that approval wasn't required because none of the genes with which we are modifying our organism are considered pathogenic. Our conversation with Lan gave us insight into the ethical considerations to be made in our project, informing many of the decisions we made throughout.

Lawrence gave us opportunities to present to his lab group, allowing us to receive feedback from research fellows and students from diverse backgrounds. Lawrence also met with Alex, one of our team members, who created the mathematical model of our system, providing him with invaluable feedback, advice and direction on how to approach the task of modelling our system.
We presented the science behind our project, our integrated human practises, and some potential approaches to mathematical modelling to Lawrence's lab group. The lab group were enthusiastic about our project and stressed the importance of explaining the modular nature of our prefoldin scaffold, as they felt this was one of the key advantages over other scaffolding systems. Confusion from the lab group about the exact size and arrangment of our scaffold led us to the goal of conducting"

11. What is the side effects of anesthesia?
①Respiratory depression;
②Blood oxygen reduction;
③Heart rate reduction;
④Major side effects: cough, heart rate disorders, etc.
12. What is the side effect after the colonoscopy?
①General: abdominal distension (aerate the patient's intestines when inspect);
②Serious: collapse (a, stimulating vagal reflexes, nausea; b, colonoscopy 3d control diet; hypoglycemia; c, pain).
13. What are the requirements for the patient's diet before the colonoscopy?
①Slag and semi-flow diet two days before check and treat, do not drink milk and soy milk;
②Liquid diet the day before check;
③Fasting in the check day morning ;
14. What are the key people who doctor want them take a colonoscopy?
①People over 40 years old;
②Tool contains blood;
③Family history of tumors (all tumor types, causes: lung cancer, stomach cancer, intestinal cancer are three high-grade tumors);
④Had intestinal polyps before;
⑤Appendectomy patients (appendectomy is easy to cause intestinal flora disorder, increase the risk of intestinal cancer).
15. As a clinician, are there any hopes and suggestions for improving the inspection method?
①In the colonoscopy, the operation of the rectal intestine requires the operator to learn for a long time to master, which is difficult;
②Colonoscopy operation requires operator to stand for a long time, thus the physical requirements for the doctor is higher. In addition, due to the long-term holding of the colonoscopy, the colonoscopy doctor has occupational diseases in joint and finger injuries. I hope there can be some methods can reduce the physical burden of the doctor.
③Doctors need to be highly concentrated when do colonoscopy, and can not miss the diseased tissue. I hope that the instrument can be used to help doctors find out the lesions to reduce the burden on doctors.
16. From the doctor's point of view, what kind of examination the patient is more willing to accept, not too excluded?
Safe and painless.

From 2010.igem.org
Untitled Document
     Engaging communities is an  important part of the IGEM experience, and The Citadel team actively pursued  connections with both local neighbors and our fellow teams over the course of  the summer.
 
Downtown DNA Event
     Early on the morning of June 6,  2010 the three members of The Citadel team set up a stall at the farmers’ market in downtown Charleston, SC. We  had no produce to sell. Instead, we came with a demonstration of everyday  science and a determination to inspire our friends and neighbors.  Our marketing division devised two clever  strategies for gaining people's attention:
1.         give away cookies and ""petri dish Jell-O""
2.         post an enormous sign offering everyone “Free DNA!”.
     Inspired by projects from the  DIYbio community, our team offered a basic biology experiment to patrons of the Farmer's Market. Visitors  to our table were invited to extract DNA from strawberries using store bought products available in every  household. Young children, in particular, enjoyed the cookies, while parents, grandparents  and others enjoyed the opportunity to ask us questions about iGEM, the chemical  reactions of our experiment, GMOs, science, education, and more. A highly diverse group of  people visited our stall, including middle school teachers, postgraduate  researchers, kindergarteners, market vendors, and at least one very curious  homeless person. The questions they asked often surprised us; we had   not  expected to field questions ranging from the most basic to highly specialized  all within the same day. The messages we conveyed to our visitors were simple:
1.         Science and engineering are not solely the domain of professionals, but              can be pursued in everyday life.
2.         Synthetic biology, an emerging discipline that integrates many fields of              science, engineering, and information technology, asks important              questions and  offers unique, exciting opportunities for invention and              creativity.
3.         iGEM is an example of young people who are inspired and driven to              innovate.
     The Downtown DNA Event was a  great success. We made contact with hundreds of many interesting people and  were able to share our interest in synthetic biology with them.  We hope to do this again and  encourage other teams to find a means for interacting with their"

Collaboration
iGEM teams are a big family. All teams register the competition are encouraged to help each other to make the projects better! Collaboration is really an important part in the process of competition.
This year, we built close cooperative relation to HUST-China , WHU-China and ZJU-China and helped each other to make our project better.
1、we offered help to HUST-China team in their genetic circuit construction. They failed when they used a reporter in their test experiment. We provided them with an essential reporter part we constructed (B0034+E0040+B0015)  and succeeded inserting the reporter part respectively to the downstream of the three ptrp mutants.
2、when dealing with the Interface Device, we met some trouble about the usage of SCM (Single Chip Micyoco) as we were not familiar with it. Thus, we turned to ZJU-China for help and they soon provide us a basic program which can change the brightness of LED through controlling PWM as a reference and later other suggestions online.
3、WHU-China team communicated with us frequently. Due to the lack of team member working on modeling, they turned to our team for help. After learning about their project, we analyzed the design of their genetic circuit carefully and built mathematical model for it.
In addition we also received assistance from WHU-China team when we decided to adopt a light control system in our project. They helped us to construct a section of light control system, saving our precious time.

Lethbridge,2016,Team:Lethbridge HS#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," little of the blood clotted when 24 hours had passed. Because of these results we can infer that our viper construct cells do have a positive effect on the clotting process by forming a clot.
Second Blood Experiment
We did a second experiment that included the pig’s blood. The point of this experiment was to see the effect that our viper construct cells had on the blood as compared to our control cells (which contained PRNA cells) and also compared to just the blood that had the heparin mixed into it previously (filtered and nonfiltered).  For this experiment, we used another container of blood that had 70 mg of heparin already mixed into it. We added 10 mL of blood into 9 standard petri dishes. For one of our  petri dishes we just had the blood inside the dish as unfiltered, meaning that we just pipetted the blood with a volumetric pipette from the blood container into the petri dish.For the second dish we filtered the blood with kimwipes to see if there was any small clots that were in the blood still. For these two dishes we did not add anything else to them--these were strictly to see how the blood clotted by itself. For our control protein we used PRNA to determine if it would have any effect on clotting the blood or not. The PRNA was chosen for our control because it was just cells that did not have our construct in them. We added this PRNA to 3 of our dishes for our negative control dishes. Again we expected to see that the addition of the PRNA cells would have no effect on the blood in terms of clotting.For the first control dish, 1.0 mL of the PRNA cells to the blood. For the second dish, 2.0 mL of the cells was added and for the third control dish 2.0 mL of the cells was added along with 1.0 mg of heparin. We added 1.0 mL of our viper construct to another petri dish with just the 10 mL of blood mixed in. The second dish contained 1.0 mL of our construct, the blood and an additional 1 mg of heparin.  We also had another dish that had 2.0 mL of our construct in it as well. All of these dishes were timed over the span of 80 minutes to see at what point in time when half of the blood that was inside of the petri dish had coagulated.

The volume of the mutagen should correspond to the label on the test tube. Because 5-bromodeoxyuridine stock is a 10mg/mL aqueous solution, the final mutagen concentration in the five test tubes will be 0, 10, 50, 100, and 200 ug/mL.
- Let the bacterial suspension incubate with mutagen for approximately 15min.
- 6uL of 5.3 phage stock was added to each centrifuge tube. From 5.15 Titer Test on 5.3 T7 new Phage Stock, we know that 5.3 phage stock has 7E8 particle/20uL. Thus, to each of the test tubes, we are adding approximately 2.1E8 particle. This gives us a multiplicity of infection lower than 0.5 particles per cell.
- Incubate phage on shaker at 37C for approximately 30min.
- Liquid culture from the five test tubes is then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes to pellet cell debris. Supernatant containing phage particles is removed and 1mL of chloroform is added destroy any remaining E coli cells.
- The stock solutions are now stored in 4C
2) Spot test (5.22)
- Spot test was performed following procedures similar to those in 5.3 T7 Phage Amplification/Purification
3) Preliminary selection test (5.24)
- Preliminary selection test was performed using x8 agar; -6, -7, and -8 dilutions; and procedure similar to those in 5.3 T7 Phage Selection Method Test
4) Preliminary selection test - second round (5.29)
Preliminary selection test from 5.24 only yielded approximately one plaque per plate for -6 dilutions when they were plated at x8 top agar. This is not enough for us to start selection. As a result, we decided to either increase phage concentration to -4 or plate at x6.
For all mutagen concentrations, -4 and -6 dilutions were plated with x6 top agar. Specific procedures used were similar to that in 5.3 T7 Phage Selection Method Test
5) Preliminary selection test - third round (6.3)
We plated -4 dilution titers with x6 and x8 top agar using similar procedure to the previous"

1. Scaffold effect
 
Fig.15 Different RNA scaffold’s effect on split GFP showing by fluorescence microscopy. The BL21*DE3 of the E. coli were transformed with pCJDFA+pCJDFB, pCJDFA+pCJDFB + pCJDD0, and pCJDFA+pCJDFB + pZCCOV 2 (0.5 mM theophylline adding). As expected, strains without RNA scaffold did not fluoresce. Upon the existence of RNA scaffold, many of the cells emitted fluorescence indicating a substantial amount of split GFP combination is permitted because of the function of RNA scaffold. The brightfield images in the right column depict all bacterial cells. The GFP images in the left column depict bacterial cells which emitted fluorescence.
 
Fig.16 Biotek Synergy H1 Hybrid Reader controlled experiments. The BL21*DE3 of the E. coli were transformed with figure showing plasmids. (0.5 mM theophylline was adding in strains containing clover 2).
`luminescence \quad efficiency \quad of \quad clover 2=\frac{\frac{FI}{OD(FA+FB+clover 2)}-\frac{FI}{OD(FA+FB)}}{\frac{FI}{OD(FA+FB)}}=\frac{53425-23779}{23779}=125\%`
 
`luminescence \quad efficiency \quad of \quad D0=\frac{\frac{FI}{OD(FA+FB+clover 2)}-\frac{FI}{OD(FA+FB)}}{\frac{FI}{OD(FA+FB)}}=\frac{38288-23779}{23779}=61\%`
 
The original intention of our designing RNA scaffold clover 2 is to create a regulatory scaffold which can tune its conformation thus have various functions. To our surprise, clover version 2, when adding optimal Theophylline concentration 0.5mM, happens to be a more powerful scaffold which helps two halves of GFP’s combination and give out light strongly.
One possible reason is in clover version 2, distance between MS2 aptamer and PP7 aptamer is closer than in D0 (showing in 04 S1 Rboscaffold Fig.4 and Fig.6), so that when binding"

Further to this, we carried out a joint survey with them. Participants from both of our respective countries filled this out, allowing us to find the public's preferred method of therapeutic delivery and opinion on probiotic use. This cross-cultural survey gave us an idea of how the attitudes to probiotics can vary, and the issues we might face if we were to further develop our project and create a treatment that would be used worldwide.
Cardiff
We wanted to analyse our sfGFP-tagged chelators using Fluorescence Lifetime IMaging (FLIM).
Lacking access to a fluorescence lifetime microscope ourselves we contacted Cardiff iGEM who had access to a FLIM machine in Cardiff's bioimaging unit . They very kindly agreed to run a few samples for us taking up over five hours of microscope time.
We sent Cardiff iGEM our parts Csp1-sfGFP, MymT-sfGFP (both in pBAD) and pCopA CueR sfGFP (as a control) in live MG1655 E. coli in agar tubes. Cardiff grew them overnight in 5ml of LB with 5uM copper with and without 2mM arabinose.
The imaging unit spread each strain on slides and measured the fluorescence lifetime of three areas on each slide. For full analysis of the results see our results page .
From this preliminary data we believe that measuring fluorescence lifetime of a His tagged GFP can be used as a reliable method for measuring copper concentration in vivo and that MymT displays copper chelation activity in E. coli. If we could perform additional experiment we would measure the fluorescence lifetime with different overnight copper concentrations to try to generate a standard curve for quantitative analysis.
Our most sincere gratitude to all those at Cardiff iGEM in particular Rob Newman for setting up the collaboration, Dr. Geraint Parry for setting up the experiment and Dr. Anthony Hayes at the bioimaging unit measuring the our parts using the FLIM microscope.
UNBC
We discovered that UMBC were investigating a similar project idea towards the end of our project and decided to Skype them to share our experiences of performing copper assays in particular the difficulties we had in optimising our BCS absorbance assay and the choice of reducing agent.

NTNU_Trondheim,2011,Team:NTNU Trondheim#rrnB_-_-_TEXT.html," the rrnB P1 promoter, as there is no difference between the induced and the uninduced cultures. This might be due to problems during the genetic construction, as enzyme test cutting of the construct didn't give the expected fragments. The construct will be sequenced to figure out what went wrong.
UPDATE: It was clear from the sequencig results that the construct had errors. It consisted only of half the RelA gene and no pBad promoter.
Another problem was that it seemed like the lacZ construct had constitutive expression without a promoter. The transformants containing only the lacZ BioBrick gave blue colonies on X-gal, and analysis of the BioBricks sequence showed promoter-like features ahead of the actual lacZ gene in some web-tools for promoter analysis. As the rrnB P1 promoter is quite weak in our constructs (see stress-sensor ), it could be that the difference in rrnB P1 expression is over-shadowed by the constitutive expression of the lacZ BioBrick.
ONPG assay
β-galactosidase hydrolyzes ortho-Nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (ONPG) to ONP + galactoside. ONP gives a yellow color, and absorbs at 420 nm. LacZ assays are widely used to test promoter activity. Here, the assay was performed as follows;
Cells were grown over night in pre-culture, inoculated 1% in appropriate media in 3 parallells and grown for 18 hours. 5µL culture was transferred to a 96 well plate and 100 μl of Z-buffer with chloroform (Z-buffer: 0,06 M Na2HPO4 x 7H20, 0,04 M NaH2PO4 x H20, 0,1M KCl, 0,001 M MgSO4x7H2O, pH 7; Z-buffer with chloroform: Z-buffer, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% chloroform)was added. 50 µL Z-buffer with SDS 1,6% was added to lyse the cells, and the plate was incubated for 10 minutes in room temperature. 50 µL 0,4 % ONPG solution in Z-buffer was added, and OD405 was measured with 1 minute intervals for 20 cycles, in 4 parallells.
Miller units were calculated as shown in Openwetware's A better Miller , to compensate for OD and reaction time."

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#Appendix_-_-_TEXT.html,"antwoord omgaan met Synthetische Biologie: Wat is het en wat zijn de kansen en mogelijkheden (Dealing responsibly with synthetic biology: what is it, and what are the chances and possibilities). The attendants of the meeting were mostly policymakers from various departments of the RIVM, involved in synbio legislation and related subjects such as biobased economy. The goal of the meeting was to inform the attendants about synbio and to start the discussion on if and how the current policy concerning synbio needs to be changed.
All four Dutch iGEM teams were invited to present their project and host a discussion about the policy&practice-aspects of their project. We were asked to use our project as a specific case study. This provided the attendants with an opportunity to discuss the specific problems concerning a real-life project, instead of the more common general, very non-specific discussion which is usually conducted. For us, this provided the opportunity to discuss real-life implementation of our ELECTRACE project with a large amount of specialists at once.  In this report, a summary of the discussion we hosted will be given.
At the start of the meeting, Tomek and Duco gave a presentation in which they explained what iGEM was and explained what our ELECTRACE project entails. The main focus of the presentation was to show that currently, lots of different synbio applications are developed, but that there are still no (consumer) products. They explained how, by enabling biosensor applications outside the lab, our ELECTRACE system is able to change this.  We described our end product, a cheap, generic biosensor on a chip, designed for use outside the lab, and asked the question “how do we get from a working prototype to a commercial end product?”
The ensuing discussion started off, as expected, with safety issues concerning the use of GMOs outside a safe lab environment. The question was raised how to prevent a release of GMOs in the environment and to what degree this would be harmful. After explaining the possible implementation of kill switches and the fact that our (and most other) GMOs are crippled versions of lab strains which will not be able to survive in nature and have an evolutionary disadvantage, a certain degree of consensus was reached: the possible release of GMOs in the environment is not as big a safety issue as it seems and should not stop the development of outside-the-lab-applications when the pros outweigh the cons. This viewpoint strongly contrasted with the current Dutch legislature, which forbids the (possible) release of GMOs in the environment, and would"

Introduction
Encapsulins are versatile proteins found in a variety of different bacteria ( Giessen and Silver, 2017 ). In the case of this specific part derived from Thermotoga maritima, it can be used among other things to deliver cargo, both on the outer surface of the cage by fusing a peptide in between the 139/140 Amino Acids or the protein's C terminus. A cargo protein can also be loaded by fusing it with a tag binding to Encapsulin's interior surface ( Cassidy-Amstutz et al., 2016 ).
BBa_K2696005
BBa_K192000 is a part that was brought to the registry by iGEM Toronto 2009.
We designed an upgraded composite part, BBa_K2686005 using a modified version of David Savage's encapsulin (Addgene #86405) where we introduced a HexaHistidine loop on the protein subunit's inner surface which increases the heat resistance and stability of the part. To facilitate the introduction of antigen encoding sequences into the HexaHistidine Encapsulin, BsaI cut sites are present"

Place: Chennai
Study: InterLab
Teams: REC-Chennai and IIT-Madras
During the InterLab study, our team faced a few issues in transformation. Considering that we operated under both time and resource constraints, we looked for collaborations with other teams that could help us with a successful completion and compilation of the InterLab results. We collaborated with another team from the city – IIT Madras as per the facilitations provided on the page 9 of InterLab Study Protocol. We requested to share transformed devices with IIT Madras and further used them to carry out the cell measurement. We performed the calibration experiments followed by CFU measurements.
We are thankful for the collaborative gesture of IIT-Madras in helping us carry out our InterLab study successfully.
NYU Abu Dhabi
Science Sketch
We took cognizance of the fact that a technical project on mutagenesis and the underlying principles of synthetic biology may not be unambiguous to the general public. Hence, when IGEM NYU Abu Dhabi forwarded emails looking for science sketches that could simplify the presentation of the underlying principle of the project, we were more than happy to collaborate with them.
The science sketch is a diagrammatic representation of the project over a series of frames. Our science sketch started by addressing the most basic question of what mutagenesis is. Furthermore, we explained what mutants are with relatable examples and explained the ideas of restriction digestion and ligation using depictions of scissors and glue respectively in an attempt to illustrate their synonymous functions. The sketch also explained the conventional mutagenesis system of Palter and the drawbacks associated with it before introducing our system. It involved an illustration of our screening procedure and a relevant conclusion.
Through the sketching and filming processes, we realised what an important tool visualisation can be and the importance of public understanding of even complex scientific discoveries. We used the simplified explanation of our project for explaining it to many others. It also served as an inspiration for the Spot the mutations game we conducted as a part of our human practices campaign in an attempt to explain the concept of mutations and mutagenesis to tiny tots. We’re grateful to have been a part of the initiative.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#FRED#Prototype_-_-_TEXT.html," LEDs.  All of this was possible through our simple, yet sophisticated software package.  Within this package the user can toggle a wide range of voltage sweeps they would like to test in, as well as the rate of each sweep.  This package also outputs a holding voltage, so when the program is finished executing, the electrodes don’t get damaged by swinging between voltages randomly.
Along with the outputs there were two input channels.  One input channel measured the voltage applied to the solution, while the other one measured the current produced by the solution.  Although this was the easiest part of the software to write, the more challenging issue was the interpolation of this acquired data.  With our software, it is possible to produce a standard curve as well as determine the concentration of whatever chemical agent we are testing for with the user having to only click a button.
All of this software is completely stand-alone, built with MATLABs own compiler, allowing others to make use of this technology for other applications.

Speak UP Speak OUT
Speak UP Speak OUT is a series of events hosted by Leadership and Cultural Programs at Missouri S&T. These moderated discussions are held periodically throughout the year on a variety of controversial topics. In spring 2011, our team suggested synthetic biology as a topic for discussion. Although our team was not directly involved in the planning of this event, the discussion was successful in engaging students from a variety of backgrounds in many topics associated with synthetic biology. The event received a lot of positive feedback from participants and organizers alike. This fall, our team will be working more closely with Leadership and Cultural Programs to plan another Speak UP Speak OUT about synthetic biology. Previous successful programs involved students who did not know anything about synthetic biology upon arrival, which may or may not be the case in the future. It would be ideal to assess the audience’s perceptions of the field during the event in order to address possible misconceptions held by students who are unfamiliar with both the risks and benefits of genetically engineering living organisms. Information such as this collected at the event can be used in future human practices projects for our team. This event will function as both an educational opportunity for attendees and as a way to spread awareness of our iGEM team on campus and the organization as a whole.
St. Louis Engineers Week
Every spring the St. Louis Science Center in accordance with the National Engineers Week Foundation has student design teams from multiple universities come and present their work, machines, and/or research to the general public. The Missouri Miners iGEM team was the only non-core engineering design team asked to attend Engineers Week. At the event two team members presented our 2011 iGEM project, The Microbial Glucose Sensor , along with general information about iGEM and synthetic biology. To demonstrate the concept of synthetic biology and how awesome the living world is, the team brought along four shadow boxes, each with a single plate with bioluminescent bacteria. Each plate was inoculated with a colony in the shape of the iGEM logo, Missouri S&T logo, St. Louis Rams logo, and Cardinals logo.
Other Educational Events
In April 2011, our iGEM team went to the local high school and presented to their Science Olympiad team about synthetic biology and iGEM. The synthetic biology activity that we led explained how different systems could be put together using different parts, and how using different parts yields systems with different functions.

Thursday, May 31, 2012
Fragments for the Multidirectional Promoter Project were digested and run through PCR by Hannah and Kevin. Kait and Victoria re-transformed the remaining 10 plasmids and 1 from yesterday that did not yield colonies. Kait and Victoria ran a gel to confirm a plasmid they could use in the Codon Optimization Project .
The originally transformed promoters were disposed of. Some of the cultures became a purple color. After centrifuging it was shown that the bacteria themselves were purple. This may be from contamination, so to be on the safe side, these plasmids were re-transformed. This may be an artifact from the plasmids themselves, but there is no consistent pattern. Very strange indeed! Always remember to use good sterile techniques when working with media and cultures!
Friday, June 1, 2012
Today Hannah digested components for the Multiple Start Codon Project . Later she ran a gel and extracted the components for later use. Kait and Victoria prepared a plasmid for the Codon Optimization Project . Kevin and Chris began work on a plasmid backbone and fluorescent component of the Multidirectional Promoters Project .
The team also received a new gel illuminator to see their bands without the use of UV light. They were very excited.

Monday, June 4, 2012
Hannah hydrated BBa_I13521 and used it to gauge the competency of the chemically competent cells we prepared earlier. Victoria and Kait ran a gel to confirm some of the components they need for the Codon Optimization Project . Kevin and Chris worked on some cleaning and housekeeping.
Tuesday, June 5, 2012
Victoria and Kait completed a transformation for the Codon Optimization Project . Kevin mini-prepped two plasmids for the Multidirectional Promoters Project . Chris and Kevin then froze some cultures containing these plasmids for later use. Hannah completed a CBAR and transformation for the Multiple Start Codon Project . She also tested the competency rate of the chemically competent cells the team prepared earlier.

The figures below show the changing tendency of lethal time with respect to each parameter and the sensitivity coefficient in ten percent up.
Figure 4: Change of the lethal time when transmission rate (β) ranging from 0 to 1. Blake dot represent our parameter used in Table 1.
Figure 5: Change of the lethal time when mortality (γ) ranging from 0 to 1. Upper x-axis is 1/γ, indicating the average mortality day. Blake dot represent our parameter used in Table 1, and dash line showing when lager than 0.8 because ODE system can not find solution in our interval.
We can conclude the intuitive results after scanning either parameter from 0 to 1. For transmission rate (Figure 4), as beta increasing, both LTD50 and LT80 going down. However, the change of lethal time become more smoothly when beta closer to one. The black dot in curves indicates our simulating parameter value 0.775 in epidemic model, which can consider as a good approximation and high efficiency that we do not need to increase so much.
As for mortality (Figure 5), lethal time will increase dramatically when gamma gets closer to zero or          one (when gamma closer to one, the ODE system can not find real solution in our interval), but change          smoothly in a low region in the middle. That’s sound great for as since the black dot, indicating our          simulating parameter value 1/7 in epidemic model, lines near the middle. So, if we can control to          increase mortality a little bite, it can make a difference. This is just what we do in our project.           The functional genes we used may decrease lethal time into nearly stationary state.
Figure 6: Sensitivity coefficient of transmission rate (β) and mortality (γ) to LT50 and LT80.
Moreover, the sensitivity coefficient in Figure 6 shows the coefficient is less than -0.8, which indicate a low sensitivity of beta and gamma, while gamma has higher sensitivity compared with beta. In conclusion, the parameters we estimated previously did not greatly affect the lethal time of our model, we can say our parameters are well approximate.
Discussion
By our improved epidemic model, we successfully predict the population dynamics of cockroaches infected by         our Metarhizium anisopliae indoors. Estimate the key parameters beta to be 0.775, gamma to be 1/7,         can"

Negative Control
To ensure that the fluorescence signal resulted from the sensor construct and not from the medium or E. coli cells themselves, B0015 in NEB10β cells was used as negative control during sensor chip induction with IPTG, HSL and P. aeruginosa.
B0015 in NEB10β was used as a negativ control

Achievements
We developed and optimized a 2D biosensor, which is able to detect IPTG, 3-oxo-C12-HSL and living Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells.

Testing K1319042 in our sensor chips
Sensor chips based on K1319042 were investigated for fluorescence using a plate reader. Blue color indicates the absence of fluorescence, while red color indicates fluorescence. The upper chip was not induced, while the lower chip was induced with IPTG (2.0 µL, 100mM).
Testing our Sensor Chips in a Plate Reader
To establish a prove-of-principle for our sensor chip design, we used our construct K1319042 , an IPTG inducible iLOV. E. coli cells carrying the this construct were introduced into sensor chips and fluorescence was measured every 15 minutes after induction with 2 µL of 100 mM IPTG. The results are displayed on the left. We observed a distinct difference in fluorescence between the non-induced chip (top) and the induced chip (bottom). The middle of the bottom chip started to exhibit a clear and visible fluorescence that increased over time and spread outwards. The top chip, however, also showed an increase in the measured fluorescence over time which was primarily due to the leaky promoter and background fluorescence.

February: We got to know iGEM and synthetic biology. Associate professor Hu Qiwen organized a lecture on iGEM and synthetic biology, and began to recruit team members to establish the first team in our school and in Chongqing.
March: After a month of learning and training, 21 team members were gathered to establish the TMMU-China team. Team registration was completed.
April: Team members consulted literature and brainstormed to discuss problems in the project and team constrcution, and set the project as ""promote Lactococcus lactis to be a better chassis in synthetic biology"".
May: Instructed by our mentors, we designed the markerless integration visual selection system for Lactococcus Lactis, Then we ordered primers, and started experiments.
June: The NZ-blue strain was constructed and the utility of it was tested.
July: We completed the optimizations of the system, and constructed the plasmid containing the promoter PnisZ and nisin resistance gene nsr. Some of the members set out to design and finish the mathematic modeling.
August: We completed construction of the protein surface display system, by displaying LacZ via connecting Usp45-cA on the surface of L. lactis
September: We completed the construction of all the 6 Parts.
October: We at last perfected our preparation for presentation, poster and wiki.
Collaboration
After building up our own team and during the process of completing our project, we found our weaknesses in many aspects. Therefore, we sought advice from other teams and meanwhile helped them in some ways.
February 22nd UESTC-China: They introduced iGEM to us and invited us to participate in it.
March 12th  NUDT-China: They guided us in terms of team construction, and introduced the rules of the iGEM, which inspired us.
June 11th Nanjing-China: While designing the project, we encountered some problems. After communication with Nanjing-China, they gave us useful advice and helped us to re-group our thoughts in our project design.
August 5th SCU-China: In the Southwest Union, we knew that the team of Sichuan University had difficulties in verifying the efficiency of an antibacterial peptide."

The consequences which utilitarianism focuses on are utility and it’s often the most positive arguments in bioethics. The arguments are simple in outline: if the action that is discussed produces, or results in, more utility then one is morally obliged to apply or accept that action HOLTUG, N. 2014. Konsekventialisme. In: CHRISTENSEN, A.-M. S. (ed.) Filosofisk Etik. Århus: Århus Universitetsforlag. .
Sometimes the arguments are based on virtue ethics. Where deontology and utilitarianism are based on rules independent of individuals, meaning that the rules apply no matter what, virtue ethics are based on the individuals. The perfect virtuous person is what determines the morally just action. In natural science virtues like integrity, curiosity and intelligence are often highly praised and the idea behind virtue ethics are that the virtuous person’s actions are the morally praiseworthy actions CHRISTENSEN, A.-M. S. 2014. Dydsetik. In: CHRISTENSEN, A.-M. S. (ed.) Filosofisk Etik. Århus: Århus Universitetsforlag. . In relation to bioethics most arguments focus on; that for an action or technology to be morally acceptable it should be so that a virtuous person would accept it. Problems arise when it comes to determine the perfect virtuous person.
Precautionary vs. proactionary
In the discussions of different emerging technologies or therapeutics one can either assume a precautionary or a proactionary stand. The precautionary point of view tends to be a more sceptical view, where one takes a stand against just accepting and embracing new technologies or therapeutics: their motto is better safe than sorry, based on the fear of unknown consequences or that the technology in question has the possibility of changing our life as we know it.
As a proactionist the fear is not unforeseen consequences, but that the public skepticism will hold evolution and progress back. There is a tendency to see an emerging technology or therapeutics as safe, unless there is evidence that suggests otherwise KAPPEL, K. 2011. Bioetik. In: CHRISTENSEN, A.-M. S. (ed.) Filosofisk Etik.

What we were able to take away from this outreach was the relevance of our first MARS branch, Microfluidics 101. Providing this easy to access information for anyone interested in microfluidics would be positively impacting the synthetic biology community but also the scientific community at large. Especially when we have coupled it to our rapid prototyping and manufacturing methods.
Black Hole Lab
Over the summer we were also in contact with Black Hole Lab who manufacture plug and play microfluidics for researchers. As we were in the beginning stages of fabrication, our questions for them were mainly in regards to manufacturing chips and what standards they recommended in order to ensure quality control. What we were able to learn is that at the moment there are no specific “industry standard” when working in microfluidics. Quality control guidelines can be built around manufacturing methods and depend on quantifiable parameters. Through building an evaluation system for our workflow, we would be able to introduce a microfluidics “standard” for research purposes. This impacts the existing field through allowing researchers to better document, evaluate and standardize their devices.

Whats going on in the lab (12/08/10) (Annemi, Patrick)
So if you have done your homework and read yesterdays log ;), you would have a better understanding and update of whats going on with the project. Heres whats actually going on in the lab right now:
From the power-point presentation ""Bistable switch design - Biobrick approach"" , if you have a look at slides 6 and 9 this will illustrate what we are trying to put together.
We are digesting and ligating by the method of biobrick assembly standard as was mentioned yesterday.
We are digesting and ligating by the method of biobrick assembly standard as was mentioned yesterday.
Initially we ran into problems with the restriction enzymes (FastDigest enzymes from Fermentas), after a third attempt and playing around with the digestion mix, we got them to work.
We are hoping to be successful in our ligations, which we will be transforming today (fingers crossed for tomorrows outcome ;)), the plasmid backbone used for the ligation is pSB1T3, a high-copy number plasmid that has the Tetracycline antibiotic resistance.
Plates containing tetracycline need to be used within 2 weeks after being made as the tetracycline antibiotic is unstable. If you have to make some of these plates as we have to, ask Lisa for the protocol for making plates. You can also ask Bjarne, the lab technician in our lab for assistance. After you have gone through the laborious procedure of making your LB solution, you need to add the antibiotic (the solution can be max 60C otherwise the antibiotic will die).
Today the tetracycline plates made will have a concentration of 10 gamma.

Experiments & Results
Introduction & Background
To investigate whether our antisense RNAs can reduce basal level expression, we ligated GFP (BBa_E0240) in each               construct, and measured the fluorescence/OD600 unit produced: pSB1C3-BBa_T9002 (Annotated as w/o PFB): Plasmid               without positive feedback loop
Diagram 4. pSB1C3-BBa_T9002
pSB1C3-BBa_F2620-C0261-E0240 (Annotated as w/ PFB): Plasmid with positive feedback loop due to insertion of LuxI               gene (BBa_C0261)
Diagram 5. pSB1C3-BBa_F2620-C0261-E0240
pSB1C3-BBa_K2240000 (Annotated as as PFB + asRNA1): Plasmid resulted from insertion of antisense type I and antisense               binding region complementary to antisense RNA type I into the positive feedback loop system (pSB1C3-BBa_F2620-ABR1-C0261-ABR1-E0240-R0063-Anti1).               This part has GFP expresses in the construct.
pSB1C3-BBa_K2240003 (Annotated as as PFB + asRNA2): Construct with Anti II; Plasmid resulted from insertion of               antisense type II and antisense binding region complementary to antisense RNA type II into the positive feedback               loop system (pSB1C3-BBa_F2620-ABR2-C0261-ABR2-E0240-R0063-Anti2). This part has GFP expresses in the construct.

Antisense RNA reduces basal expression level
We first characterized the pSB1C3-BBa_T9002 (w/ PFB) to find suitable time for induction, which we found that fluorescence/OD600 can reach over than 600,000 GFP/OD600 after more than 3 hours. Thus, we used control variables               of 3 hours and [AHL] = 1.00E-05 M as an optimum level of induction.

3. Use a 2L flask.
4. Add the following
- 10 g Tryptone
- 5 g Yeast Extract
- 5 g NaCl
- 1.5 g Agar (NOT agarose!)
4. Then add 1 L of MilliQ water.
5. Autoclave by total volume.
6. Pour 25 mL on each plate (just enough to cover the bottom).
Making Liquid Media
1. Always use a 5-2.5-2.5 ratio of Tryptone to Yeast Extract to NaCl
2. Add dry ingredients first, then add MilliQ water
3. No Agar!
4. Autoclave by total volume
Making Glycerol Stock
To make 400 mL of 10% glycerol you will need:

Tsz Man CHEUNG, David
The Main Contact person for the human practice in our team.
David puts a lot of                             effort in the human practices group by organizing various events and activities for the public.                             He is a very sociable person who is not shy to contact people from other teams or the professionals.                             It is really a good thing to have him in the human practices group!
Our Advisors
Luna Eresta JAYA, Luna
The Good Teacher.
Luna taught us a lot of useful wet lab skills on our lab training                             tutorial. She often makes sure our team know where we are focusing and will guide us to the right                             direction. Especially for human practices, she always gives amazing advice to modify our plans.
Ka Man TAM, Sabrina
One of our best advisors that we are pleased to have.
She has taught us so many things in the lab and also in theory. She gives us advice from the very beginning of the project                             throughout the whole journey. Her advice on the project design and troubleshooting helps us to                             make our project better.
Tze Wing MAK, Tiffany
Our IT backup.
Tiffany knows well the importance of the wiki page. She gave us                             a lot of useful tips and helped us tackling technical problems. She appears to be very serious,                             but once she warms up, she has a pretty silly side too. She likes to call the iGEM girls ""Dua                             eng"" (which means ""sweetheart"" in Thai)
Mike DOROTHEA, Mike
The past secretary from last year's team.
Mike keeps us on a good manner for recording                             meeting minutes as well as all the public documents. She is a perfectionist who will make sure                             we follow the right nomenclature in all publications and annotate gel photo correctly.
Kar On CHENG, Karen
Our Lab Guider.
Karen ensures we do our lab work properly. She is very patient                             to our questions, always raises and gives useful suggestions to all the module groups and the                             auxiliary group. We are very pleased to have her!
Shek Chun LOI, Danson
The Elder Brother.
From what Katie have said, Danson ""looks so old that was thought as a postgraduate"".                             However, he is actually a nice advisor that he answer our questions and gave suggestions. He                             often gave advices that guide us into the right track.

Doesn't rubber come from trees?
Let your eyes (and mouse) wander to these trees to discover our ideas on how to help the environment and change the future of rubber production. Take a look at our short project description below.
The growing demand for natural rubber causes deforestation of the rainforest and occupation of arable lands, due to the establishment of new plantations. If producing rubber by bacteria succeeds, production of natural rubber will not be limited to the regions where the rubber tree can grow. Rather, rubber can be produced even in barren lands.
Our project aims to enable a common bacteria to produce natural rubber while grown under controlled conditions.  Natural rubber is composed of molecules consisting of the substance IPP linked together like a chain. The common bacteria that we use (E. coli) already possesses the ability to produce the IPP, but it lacks the enzyme to connect the IPP links together into a chain.  We introduced the enzyme that the rubber tree has for connecting the links into the bacteria. Furthermore, we introduced genes that allow the bacteria further production of the IPP links.
No, rubber is made in the lab.

I'm Zhang Jun, an optimistic and enthusiastic girl.  It is my honor to take part in this synthetic biology competition. I like swimming and I'm good at singing. I like the mystique of science, in which the challenge and the sense of achievement during the experiment make me crazy. Despite setbacks, I'll never give up! I gave presentation for my team at the China meeting up in USTC, I am also responsible for many sections of the experiments, such as those about the deficient bacteria, and part of notebook making.
Xiaoxi Zhang  Grade 2009
 Hello, everyone! I'm Zhang Xiaoxi, a Chinese girl. I'm from OUC university. My major is  ecology. It's an honor to join part in this game, and I really have learned a lot. In my life, I am curious and optimistic. I want to try many unknown things to get excited, including this experience. But sometimes I will be very lazy, sitting on my bed for a whole day. I love smile, my signboard is my smiling face. Look at my! Do you want to be my friend? I am mainly responsible for searching the previous biobrick parts, drawing gene maps and doing experiments.
Qian Zhang  Grade 2009
I'm Zhang Qian. I'm very straightforward. I don't like hiding my true thoughts. I'll say and do what I think. Music and art are always a part of my life. Although I don't think I’m good at singing and drawing. I like challenging myself. It's my great honor to take part in this synthetic biology competition. Before the competition, I know little about synthetic biology. Maybe it's the first time for me to learn knowledge not in class. It’s my biggest rewarding. However it's difficult, now that I have decided to do it, I’ll never give up. I enjoy the process very much. We are fighting ~O (∩_∩) O~. I am mainly responsible for searching the previous biobrick parts, drawing gene maps and doing experiments.

In order to find the best way to implement the toxin-antitoxin system, we resort to modelling. We use the gillespie algorithm to model the interactions of the toxin antitoxin system.

We find that when we implement enhanced relE production as a tool to make the bacteria dormant, an additional implementation of relB to ensure don’t stay dormant when in light again.
The model found that the system is sensitive to the relE:relB ratio as well as the total production, and that an implementation with production rates in the vicinity of 50 and 35  molecules pr. min for relB and relE respectively yields close to the wished for effect: THe bacteria goes dormant in an hour and wakes up quickly.

Modified from Gibson et al. (2009)
This assembly method is an isothermal, single-reaction method for assembling multiple overlapping DNA molecules. By coordinating the activity of a 5‘ exonuclease, a DNA polymerase and a DNA ligase two adjacent DNA fragments with complementary terminal sequence overlaps can be joined into a covalently sealed molecule, without the use of any restriction endonuclease.

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Diary#W1_-_-_TEXT.html,". Condering that UCL iGEM 2014 is the empirical subject of my dissertation, I started reading more on the various ways in which a social scientist conducts a case study. In addition, I am looking into ethnography as a method especially considering that I am embedding myself as a researcher among a team of students and scientists-in-the-making. Considering that a lot of what they do happens online, I am also consulting some of the literature on ethnography that apply to social media. Kevkey 09:09, 26 July 2014 (CDT)

Still reading further on the ethnographic method and case studies. However, today I found a book that deals with both methods but from the perspective of sustainability research. It even contains an elaborate example of a case study on biosecurity. In the afternoon I went to the Human Practice meeting with the team. We discussed our social media presence on Twitter and just started sending out some tweets with the idea that this tool can also be used to blog - microblog - our thoughts on the subject of synbio. I also asked Lewis about how I could edit my own space of the wiki. Subsequently, I went back to the Science Library to write some of my methodological ideas down and write a bit of the introduction for my methodology chapter. Kevkey 09:"
ITU_MOBGAM_Turkey,2013,Team:ITU MOBGAM Turkey#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," courses and we have to improve it. This train of thought lead me to our university’s first iGEM Team. In future, i’m thinking of neurobiology as my primary tendency. You may think that synthetic biology has no resemblance with neurobiology but i love how synthetic biology works. I was amazed when i hear some projects from previous years like Stanford’s “Hell Cell” or Kyoto’s “Emerging The Titanic”. Thinking outside the box and applying these thoughts on real life world is amazing. As i said, synthetic biology is fun. Maybe one day, we can make synthetic neurological pathways, neuron cell networks or an entire brain. On that day, the resemblance will be unraveled.
Sibel Karaman: Hi, I’m Sibel, my third year in department of Molecular Biology and Genetics in ITU and as my team mates, my first year in iGEM team. In our team, I take part in wet lab. In my opinion, it is important to learn the experimental fields in molecular biology. iGEM provides the opportunity to get experience in molecular biology. It is a good feeling that being part of a team and studying together, so, I learn as well as have fun in the laboratory. And finally, I think iGEM provides me a big opportunity to have sufficient experience on synthetic biology.

When viewed under the GFP filter, the pellet fluoresced green when compared to its corresponding controls (cells not expressing a fluorescent protein, and cells expressing RFP)
Flow cytometry
The results for flow cytometry are shown in Figure 6. GFP expression from both cultures (Figure 6b. and 6c.) result in a shift in fluorescent populations when compared to control cells expressing no fluorescent protein (Figure 6a.). These results confirm the proper functioning of our modified GFP gene and furthermore, demonstrate the functionality of the promoter switches in their PB state.

MODELLING
Modelling the Dynamics of Bxb1-style and PhiC31-style Invertible Promoter Switch Systems
Invertible Promoter Switch “Styles”
We made invertible promoter switches based on the Bxb1 and PhiC31 integrase systems.  In both of these systems Int dimerizes before attaching to att sites, and RDF modifies Int by binding it stoichiometrically (ie two RDF molecules bind each Int dimer). However, the details of the interaction between Int and RDF in these two systems is thought to differ. Notably, the Bxb1 RDF is thought to interact with Bxb1 Int only when Int is bound to DNA at the Bxb1 att sites [1] while PhiC31 RDF is also able to complex with Int in the cytosol independently of DNA binding [2] (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Bxb1 RDF can only complex with Int dimers that are bound to att sites, while PhiC31 RDF can complex with cytosolic Int dimers as well.
We refer to a switch system where RDF binds Int only when Int is already complexed with an att site as a “Bxb1-style” system, and we refer to a switch system where RDF can complex with Int independently of DNA as a “PhiC31-style” system. We sought to investigate the differences in the dynamics of these systems.

For any new scientific creation, it is important to imagine how the project will impact existing political, economic, and societal frameworks. This is particularly important for projects that can have far-reaching consequences, such as ones involving cells in a therapeutic product, or products with novel applications such as space travel.
When designing our product, we had many questions of how we can optimize the design to best address the numerous political, manufacturing, economic, as well as end user experience aspects of our product throughout its lifecycle. In order to get answers to these questions, our human practices team did extensive research, as well as conducted numerous interviews with professionals working in related fields. See all the professionals that we have spoken to in order to improve our project design on our Human Practices Silver Medal page.
We've incorporated all of the comments we've obtained from professionals into the design of our product. See how all the feedback has informed our project design on our Human Practices Gold Medal page.
See our human practices highlights on our Integrated Human Practices page.
As part of integration of human practices into our project, we've also considered the process it would take for our drug to go from the lab bench to the market. To such ends, we decided to reach out to Dr. Agnes Klein, who is currently the Director of the Centre for Evaluation of Radiopharmaceuticals and Biotherapeutics at Health Canada.
During our conversation, Dr. Klein made aware to us that there are currently no specific regulations in Canada pertaining to the development and marketization of synbio products. Having specific regulations would be beneficial for both prevention of adverse events as well as streamline the process of synbio drug approval.
We decided to address this gap in current Canadian regulations by writing a policy brief.
