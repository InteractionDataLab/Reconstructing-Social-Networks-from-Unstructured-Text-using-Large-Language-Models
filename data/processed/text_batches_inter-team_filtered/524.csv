Chalmers_Gothenburg,2016,Team:Chalmers Gothenburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," DNA-synthesizer on her desk had completed another cycle, she sighed in relief, her dream had been so unpleasant. The machine humming on her desk she had bought for her high school biology project. It was old and loud, almost as big as the vintage toaster her mother kept in the kitchen. Moving over to the desk, she sat down and read the display on the device. It still had 3 more cycles to complete before the genetic constructs she had chosen the night before were complete. The constructs were going to change the “photoplastic” growing in small tubes on the roof of all the buildings in her neighborhood. They would shine in different colors depending on the season. She thought of the small life forms growing on the roof and how they provided the material for the 3D-printers everyone had in their homes.
She wondered how people had made things without them.
The idea she had suggested to her mother, not two weeks ago, played in her mind; if the small lifeforms make everything we need, then they might as well look pretty doing so! She had learned the basics of manipulating DNA in primary school and bought everything she needed online, from the DNA-synthesizer to an old TIRC machine (Transformation Integration Replication and Cultivation). That night, her mother had talked about how genetic modification of the tiny life forms had once been difficult and even forbidden.
Eve could not see how anything could be produced without them. In her world they produced everything from food to energy, even the material of the sheets she had been curling into a moment ago was produced from these tiny things. She remembered how they used the energy of sunlight and the gases in the air, freely available everywhere and to everyone, to replicate themselves. Of course, they need the small bag of minerals every few weeks or so but other than that they were completely self-sustaining.
Her teacher had once talked about how people used to pull ancient black and toxic goo from deep pockets in the ground to make things and burn for fuel. She had described how it had almost made the planet uninhabitable, how the oceans had threatened to swallow the lands and the air becoming toxic. Eve wondered how people could allow such wasteful and destructive use of the scarce resources available on the little world they all shared.
Eve thought about the dream she had, was it real? Was it a memory, no she had never seen the dead landscape before, her world was green and full of life. She returned to her bed and looked up at the early morning sky through the transparent domed ceiling of her bedroom. Some of the stars had"

DXP is reductively isomerized to MEP MEP2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate by Dxr Dxr1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase in a reversible NADPH-dependent reaction
This is subsequently converted to CDP-ME CDP-ME4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol in a CTP substrate inhibited reaction catalysed by IspD. IspD4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol synthase DXP is not only a substrate in the isoprenoids biosynthesis, but also for the reversible synthesis of B1-vitamin and further synthesis of B6-vitamin in the thiamine biosynthesis pathway.
The next step in the MEP pathway is an ATP-dependent phosphorylation of the C2 hydroxyl group of CDP-ME, giving CDP-MEP CDP-MEP4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-2-phosphate catalysed by IspE. IspE4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase
CDP-MEP is cyclized to MEcPP MEcPP2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphat by IspF IspF2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase and in the next reaction IspG IspG1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate synthase catalyzes the ring opening of the cyclic pyrophosphate and subsequent C3-reductive dehydration of MEcPP to HMBPP. HMBPP1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate
The MEP pathway’s final step, the conversion of HMBPP to IPP IPPisopentenyl diphosphate and DMAPP DMAPPdimethylallyl diphosphate, is catalysed by IspH. IspH4-hydroxyl-3-methyl-butenyl-1-disphosphate reductase

De secole alchimiștii credeau în existența unei pietre a filosofilor, a unei substanțe misterioase, care nu numai că transformă metalele obișnuite în aur și argint prețios, dar și care îndeplinește cele mai mari nostalgii ale omenirii: întinerirea și nemurirea.
Deși piatra filosofilor nu a fost descoperită niciodată, alchimiștii au testat această substanță nenumărată și a interacțiunilor acesteia în laboratoarele lor și au contribuit în așa mod la formarea cunoștințelor fundamentale, care pot fi găsite și în prezent în științele de chimie, metalurgie și farmocologie. În lumea plină de științe a secolului 21 credința în piatra filosofiei a disparut. Cu toate acestea noi tindem mereu spre remedii, nu numai pentru a trăi mai mult și mai sănătos, dar și spre soluționarea problemelor ecologice create de noi în urma modernizării. Comparativ cu trecutul, astăzi nu mai suntem în căutarea substanțelor magice ale naturii. Ba din contra, ne lăsăm inspirați de ea și creăm unelte noi, pentru a escalada activ provocările societății noastre.

Our first day in the laboratory!
Goal: Incubate the Escherichia coli (E. coli) samples which carry pgRNA and pdCas9 on agar plates separately with antibiotics.
1. LA- medium (1.5%) was made.
2. Two different agar plates were made – one containing ampicillin (AMP) and one containing chloramphenicol (CM).
Incubation of bacteria
Two Escherichia coli (E. coli) samples which carry pgRNA and pdCas9 plasmids respectively, were ordered from Addgene. E.coli carrying the pgRNA plasmid were plated on agar plates with AMP, while E.coli carrying the pdCas9 plasmid were plated on agar plates with CM. Incubation for 24 h at 37℃.
Results:
There was growth and single colonies on all the plates.

September
Week 1
The working method for doing these lab experiments were discussed by the modeller responsible for the Metabolic Model and the experimentalists. Experiment 1 from the E. coli survival protocol was done, but failed due to the 96 wells plate having been on a shaker in between steps, causing contamination of wells from other rows. The shaker setup can be seen in figure 1 and the result in figure 2.
Figure 1. Photo of plate 2 of the first experiment on the shaker. We believe this is the reason the contamination of Figure 2 occurred.
Figure 2. Photo of plate 2 of the first experiment on a lightsource. As all rows are dark, including the ones that were supposed to be kept sterile, we can clearly see the experiment has failed.
Week 2
Experiment 1 was repeated, this time plate 2 was kept stationary in between inoculation steps"

Overview
There are three ways we can degrade azodyes: using Azoreductase (AzoR), Laccase (Lac) or BsDyp. Azoreductase breaks down AzoDye (AzoD) into two products Laccase breaks down AzoDye  as well as the products of the reaction of Azoreductase with AzoDye. BsDyP acts on sulfonated AzoDyes (sAzoD):
 
 
In order to model this system we used COPASI. We included equations for gene expression and degradation for each gene in our pathway, as well as the intake and excretion of AzoDyes and sulfonated AzoDyes. The equations we included as well as the parameter assigned to each one are shown below:
Equations for pathway model
Using reasonable parameter values, the simulation showed that the AzoDye is degraded within two days (48 hours). This timeframe agrees with the experimental results!
Simulated timecourse data of Acid Orange AzoDye degradation by Azoreductase, Laccase and BsDyP
Parameter Inference
We wanted to see which part of the pathway is the bottleneck in degrading the AzoDyes and sulfonated AzoDyes. So we analysed the parameters of our model to see which one is the most constrained, which could give us an insight on which one to tweak experimentally in the future in order to speed up the degradation. To do that we used ABC-SysBio (Liepe, 2014) .
Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a method that utilises Bayesian statistics for parameter inference in synthetic biology. Given a model and data form that model, it computes the most likely parameters that could give rise to that data. We used the model and simulated data we had in order to find out which parameters are restricted in the values they can have in order to achieve that behaviour.
To use ABC-SysBio we had to make an SBML file describing our model and write"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," spestres is interesting but a bit time consuming if many aaRS should be testes for their quality. The results this far imply that a comparison of different aaRS is possible, just by comparison of the relative emission at 475 nm, representing the CFP amount, and at 525 nm, representing the fusion protein amount of the cotransformants when cultivated with and without the specific ncAA.
Negative and Positive Selectivity and Ranking System for Synthetases
Similar to Texas 2014, we defined values that rank the synthetases among each other.
The negative score is the quotient of the CFP-signal to the YFP-signal when the aaRS is cultivated without the specific ncAA. Negative score = (emission at 475 m)/(emission at 525 nm). When there is no supplemented ncAA, a very specific synthetase will not or seldom couple native amino acids to the amber tRNA. This would lead to a very high amount of CFP-units compared to the whole CFP-YFP fusion protein, resulting in a strong CFP-signal and a weak YFP-signal. The higher the negative score, the higher is the specificity of the aaRS. The maximal negative score should be around 2.0, which would correspond to solely CFP expression.
The positive score is the quotient of the YFP-signal to the CFP-signal when the aaRS is cultivated with the specific ncAA. Positive score = (emission at 525)/(emission at 475). When there is the specific ncAA is supplemented to the media, an efficient synthetase should couple the ncAA to the amber tRNA. This would lead to a very high amount of whole fusion protein compared to the solely CFP-units, resulting in a strong YFP signal including a strong contribution by the FRET-signal. The higher the positive score, the higher is the efficiency of the aaRS. The maximal positive score cannot be estimated yet, but based on our tests values between four and five seem to be plausible.
An advantage of our ranking system is, that the mean of the positive and the negative score can be used to merge the two values. This enables us to assign one specific mean score to one specific synthetase and thus to arrange tested synthetases after their quality.
The resulting scores of the tested Prk-RS and 2-NPA-RS are shown in Figure 11.

Wendy, XU KAICHUN
Wendy is now a year 2 biochemistry student in HKUST. She loves doing different experiments and like using different approaches to solve problems and enjoy the lab work. She plans to continue doing research after graduation.
Funny random things:
Having been participated in iGEM for almost 3 years, I am happy to see the diversity of iGEM projects in HKUST and also each year different lab techniques are involved. I hope in the future HKUST iGEM team can keep better and better.

Conclusion:
Glasgow iGEM did fantastic work for us, providing us with detailed analysis of the T7 promoter and suggestions for improving the efficiency of our project. Whilst their data on the DH5alpha Z1 strain is accurate and in accordance with subsequent research and advice, we have since noted there is expression of KillerRed and KillerOrange in DH5alpha in lab tests.

Lethbridge,2010,Team:Lethbridge#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"2,3-dioxygenase will result in the production of 2-HMS.
Method
BBa_K118021 was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α (E. coli) cells using our transformation protocol. We confirmed that the cells hosted the plasmid containing the BBa_118021 part and we begun experiments to characterize catechol degredation.
In our first experiment we grew a 5 mL culture of our engineered E. coli cells in M9 minimal media overnight. The cells were spun down at 14000 rfc for 2 minutes. We raised the catechol concentration of this solution to 100 mM, the solution immediately turned bright yellow.
Figure 1. Left: M9 media containing 100 mM catechol. The solution contains E. coli cells hosting the pUC19 plasmid.  Right: M9 media containing 100 mM catechol. The solution contains E. coli cells hosting part BBa_118021. The yellow colour suggests the production of 2-HMS.
In our second experiment we wanted to measure the absorbance of 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde over time. We grew a 5 mL culture of our engineered E. coli cells in M9 media overnight.  1 mL of the cell solution was removed for analysis.  Catechol was added to a final concentration of 100mM in the cell suspension. Immediately the formation of 2-HMS was tracked. The formation of 2-HMS can easily be tracked, as it absorbs light at 375 nm.
Figure 2.  Production of 2-HMS over time.
Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase contains an iron molecule in its active site. Our hypothesis was that the iron molecule is oxidized after converting a single catechol molecule to 2-HMS; rendering the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase inactive. We also want to test how catechol 2,3-dioxygenase would behave in vitro compared to in vivo.
To test this hypothesis we grew E. coli containing BBa_K118021 in 500 mL of LB media with ampicillin. E.coli containing the pUC19 plasmid were also grown in 500 mL of LB media with ampicillin to act as a negative control throughout the course of the experiment. The cells were grown to a final optical density of 4.55 AU (measured at 600 nm). The cells were first spun down at 3800 rcf for "

During the process, we have gained many precious suggestions, which can help us make our game better one step at a time.
We’d like to continue to popularize the game in the future, and get more feedback to make improvement.
Continual communication and application
We applied Bio2048 to education. After working hard, we successfully contacted local schools and remedial classes to help teachers arouse the learning interest of their students. Absolutely, it is an original way to obtain knowledge. Making our game as a real educational tool in class needs more communication with teachers and practice at schools. We are sure that it is useful for students’ learning by visiting more schools.
Inspired by the thoughts of applying game to education, we got more ideas about EDUTAINMENT, we will go further and do better.
During the summer, we tried these approaches to practice our thoughts and received a good response. We hope our work can really affect the people around to pay attention to the biology. We believe our work can contribute to the learning of students through communication, test and improvement.

By discussing with the principals, we were able to know the public mind toward synthetic biology. We feel this image is due to the ignorance of this field. If we can get more people informed of the reality of synthetic biology, maybe we can change the general opinion. We will continue interacting with a variety of people so that more and more people can learn about synthetic biology.

6-2 Discussion of iGEM JAPAN
 
We discussed about iGEM JAPAN’s future initiative at this meeting. Setting up iGEM JAPAN was committed to making it easier for iGEM teams to communicate with each other. However, the interactions between the iGEM teams have been decreasing recently, and the only event that iGEM teams gather together this year is the meetup held at Tokyo Metropolitan University in August.
We had to seek a solution for this problem. At this meeting in Nagahama, iGEM JAPAN created a Facebook page. Our future plan is to make a website directed toward the outside.

Promotion of public concern
In addition to fundamental research, we also made progress in improving the public awareness about hearing loss.
We designed our human practice step by step. Firstly, to know hearing-impaired people better, we learned a lot from different aspects. Then, we designed a questionnaire to investigate the attitudes of normal people towards people with hearing loss. Because we found most people lacked the knowledge about hearing loss, we designed a handout contains science popularization information about hearing and treatment. To further develop our ideas, we made outreach cooperation with commonweal organizations and companies.
1. Consultation
To obtain more information about the life of hearing-impaired people, we consulted specialists work in various areas, as well as managers of local charities or official associations. At the same time, we introduced our project and their suggestions helped us a lot to promote our project.
Law
We wanted to learn policies about the rights of people with hearing loss and the investigation process in case of surdomute criminal suspects. We consulted Justice Liu and a legal practitioner, Miss Zhao.
It is said that in China, the Criminal Law and the Law of Criminal Procedure Law aim to embody the humanitarian. Deaf and mute are given appropriate preferential treatment and Summary Proceeding cannot be applied in these cases.
Details
Advanced research
We consulted Prof. Chen Fei who studies hearing aids and speech recognition technology for cochlear implants. He stressed the importance of attention to hearing-impaired people, because this big problem has not been concerned enough as it deserved. At the same time, he believes that, as direct and efficient currently, hearing aids and CIs cannot solve the problem of hearing loss thoroughly. Protect our ears to prevent more hearing impairment cases, together with elaborate studies on hearing, tend to a more profound and lasting resolution.

Based on this risk-assessment it is possible to rank the project according to the risk, ranking from level 1 to 4, in accordance with the procedure giving by the UN. See appendix I for the risk-assessment we made for our project.
Personal Safety
To be allowed to work in a level 1 laboratory, it is required that there at all times is a suitable instructed person present. At level 2, all personnel in the laboratory are required to have been suitable instructed in lab safety and procedure. All access to the lab by non-members of this group or the lab-staff is to be restricted. All members of our team have in the time prior to the work in the laboratory undertaken a lab-safety-course, thus fulfilling the requirements to work in a level 1 lab.
Substitution
Furthermore, it is not legal to work with any host, donor or vector-system, should another, safer, system, containing the same basic features, be available. If it is possible to find a suitable system, compatible with the intended work, that is safer for humans, animals and plants, or the environment at large, it must always substitute the other, more dangerous system. It is in other words prohibited to take unnecessary risks, or use unnecessarily risky setups. Should a possible substitute system be unreasonably difficult or expensive to acquire, then the risks and benefits must be considered, favoring safety above economical issues. As we're working with relatively harmless strains of E. coli (MG1655 and TOP10 strains), it has not been necessary to locate a safer, compatible host, donor or system, but we have nonetheless attempted to locate such systems for wholesomeness, although without luck.

SYNBIO MAP
The increase of researches related to synthetic biology has increased, SynBio Map’s idea is to enable the identification of companies, universities, research institutes, laboratories and other centers around the globe that have activities in this emerging field. It can be a tool to compare the growth of synthetic biology around the world. The Synthetic Biology project began in 2009, and received an update in 2013 and has been updated based on available publications in official sites, in scientific, articles literatures. However, this field is very dynamic and the map is a continuous work. A new update, in the website will be launched soon, opening the possibility to evaluate the advance of synthetic biology during those years. The map shows that in the area where Uruguay is located, no activity was found.

BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY AND FUNDS
In the report of Human Development in Uruguay prepared by the United Nations Development Program (UNPD) in 2005, 32 biotechnology industries were identified, from which 11 suppliers of specialized products and services, which has a total of 43 listed companies were identified. In addition, 71 entities were identified technology and innovation (Uruguaio, 2012).
As part of the industrial strategy, the Bio and Nanotechnology Border was launched in order to prioritize and implement measures to improve the sector identified by the border in 2009. After the border’s production in 2009, where measures were identified to terminate the restrictions related to the growth of the nano and biotechnonology sectors in Uruguay, in June 22th of 2010, the Sectoral Border on Nano and Biotechnology was launched. The Border is made up of employers, employees and technicians from the public sector, it is a tool of articulation inputs e policies making in the sector. The first product of the Border in 2011 was the development of a sector plan that defines the main strategic  industry guidance and"

Safety
Proper Risk Management
Biosafety and proper risk assessment are important aspects to consider before any handling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). There are several concerns that must be addressed properly. The safety of the public as well as of the environment is of the utmost importance, but the safety of the person in direct contact with the GMOs should not be compromised either. The risk associated with laboratorial work can be evaluated using the statement “Risk = Hazard ✕ Probability”. To responsibly address this inquiry, the entire team was given a mandatory lab safety course held by Lab Technician Simon Rose. In addition, we received a detailed handbook regarding lab safety. This ensured that all our team members were well equipped to work safely in the lab. Throughout the project we have continuously been evaluating the safety of our work. These assessments can be found in the safety form . Furthermore, our team participated in the 5th annual BioBrick workshop hosted by DTU BioBuilders. Here we participated in"

Chloromycetin (C+) was used for positive control (PC). The ultrasonic lysate of wild BL21(pLysS) was used for negative control (NC). Each tube was cultured at 37℃ with rotation in a speed of 300rpm. The measuring error is within ±0.02.
For the inhibition zone assay, we used the filter paper method. The filter paper was soaked in the raw ultrasonic lysate for 10min and put on the medium after plate coating of Staphylococcus aureus. The antibacterial efficacy and inhibition zone was shown in Fig.8.
Fig.8. Antimicrobial activity of recombinant CecropinXJ using inhibition zone assays. Staphylococcus aureus were plated on LB medium. (A)①25μg/ml chloromycetin was used as positive control. ②250μg/ml chloromycetin was used as positive control. ③10μg/ml kanamycin was used as positive control. ④Ultrasonic lysate of wild BL21(pLyss) was used as negative control. ⑤,⑥Ultrasonic lysates from two repeated independent induced experiments.

Compared with the high bacterial inhibition effects of prokaryotic expressed CecropinXJ, shown in previous researches, [8] our results show that the recombinant CecropinXJ has limited antimicrobial activity. Even we used three specialized E.coli BL21 strain (RIPL, Rosetta and pGr07) provided by SCUT-China_A, the results are still not ideal. We hypothesized that the induction condition used in our experiments were slightly different with the original research, which lead to serious consequence. However, due to time limits, our experiments on the prokaryotic expression of CecropinXJ had to be paused here. Further experiments using different induction condition are required. Earlier studies had indicated that CecropinXJ shares a similar structure with ABP-CM"

Yunfan LI
Riding the subway with my MP3 is the most enjoyable thing I can imagine.
Yunfan is a sophomore majoring in biology in UCAS.
He gets a pretty memorable experience with his fantastic teammates and sapiential tutors and learns a lot in the lab. That really promotes his gcolumnth in both knowledge level and spiritual level. He also recognizes what he is truly interested in and figures out his future researching plan in cell oxidation and reduction.
He spends most of his time on fighting with the experiment in lab and draws the vestigial energy out for the hardware designing and circuit welding. The interlab work is also finished by him.
Like most schoolboys in campus, he loves computer games and sports and can play badminton quite well. Taking the public transport for aimless roaming is also his favor. However, no one can strip the comic out of his life. Remember! No one!!!

Another significant factor regarding biotechnology clusters and industry support is the variable knowledge exchange with a high significance of p = 0.00 and a positive coefficient of .653, all variables being held constant. This significant and positive relationship implies interaction with biotech clusters and/or industry members is highly influential for biotech business creation, as it likely provides 1) expert insight into problems that need solving, 2) knowledge in scientific processes, 3) knowledge in business processes and/or 4) market information important for successful business creation. From the qualitative data it is clear that most of the founding teams consulted industry experts regarding their projects and business consideration. The non-Founding teams had noticeably less interaction with industry representatives. Although founding has a clear relationship with knowledge exchange, it is clear from the survey respondents that only a few iGEM teams actually collaborated with other entities and exchanged knowledge. Therefore, it appears extremely important for iGEM teams considering founding (or for iGEM success) to have knowledge exchange.

In regards to building the business model of an iGEM project, having a business plan is extremely significant with p = 0.00 and a positive coefficient of 3.07, all variables held constant. Clearly, having a business plan greatly improves the chances of an iGEM team founding. However, as seen in the graph, very few teams in iGEM actually make a business plan. The qualitative data also suggests that founding teams created a business plan during iGEM. Therefore, it can be concluded that a business plan enables iGEM teams in business founding.

This algorithm is adopted by CRISPR-P, the inadequacies of this algorithm are: (a) Despite the presence of off-target sites, but sometimes it's subtracted score will still be 0 (which seems unreasonable under certain circumstances, and it will confuse the scoring of those sgRNA that don’t exist off-target sites). (b) Using W function, which cannot be expressed by elementary functions, it will take some additional time in calculation.
However, our algorithm can avoid these two shortcomings. Our algorithm is:
First, we use the summation of exponential replaced W function; Secondly, when there exist off-target sites, our running results will be with the subtracted score, and we use the rounding to further ensure this situation. The following table can show the score contrast.

While in acoustic stimulation, the pressure generated by our designed sound wave oscillation is bigger than 100kPa, which is conflict with the result of microfluidics. After consultation with Prof. Bin Tang, who is an expert in biomechanics field. He referred that high frequency oscillation leads visco-elastic transition, in other words, makes cytoskeleton becomes harder, and stiffer cytoskeleton needs lager vibrating force to deform the cytoskeleton.
3. Future Plan
The feedback regulatory motif is most common in the gene regulatory network of cells, including the hair cells. They can change mechanical thresholds by increase or decrease the expression of a mechanosensitive channel (MS) channel. Also, we have proof that downstream GFP of the NFAT (Nuclear factor of activated T-cells) promoter can be successfully induced by long term calcium signal. Thus, NFAT promotor can be used for auto-regulating the mechanical thresholds by adjusting the MS channel expression. Besides, although the identity of MET channel in hair cells is still unclear, but the method we developed to quantitatively examine the sensibility of Piezo1 channel (Fig. X) is well adapt to all MS channel, such as the Transmembrane channel-like (TMC) channel, which has been thought as a prime contender for the MET channel in hair cells. Even if the nature exists MS channels may not be suitable for repair of hearing disease, the directed evolution platform we developed can be used to extend the audible frequency and intensity of sound that the cells can sense.

Count the number of colonies on each plate.
Ministat Protocol
Prepare the desired number of media containers and culture chambers ready to be autoclaved.
Add media to the containers. Add 100 µl of inoculum to the sterile culture chamber. Connect the    media container to the culture chamber.
Arrange the ministat array in the heat block and set the effluent volume to around 35 ml by moving    the effluent needle up to the desired height in the chamber.
Set the peristaltic pump to 90 rpm and allow the chambers to fill. Once at 35 ml turn off the    peristaltic pump. Turn on the air pump to start aeration and agitation. Let the culture grow for 24 hrs
Turn on the peristaltic pump to 7.5 rpm this will give a flow rate of approx 4 ml/hr. Ensure    that the effluent tubes are uncovered and inside a collecting vessel.
Each day take a sample in a sterile container for testing. Glycerol stocks should be taken.    These can then be tested later.
HGT Protocol
Prepare a 5 ml overnight of pSB1C3 RFP transformed into E. coli DH5α in a 10 ml falcon tube.
Prepare working solution of lysozyme in reaction buffer from a molecular probes EnzCheck lysozyme     assay kit by diluting 1000 U/ml lysozyme C (Galus Galus) two fold in reaction buffer. 50 µl of working     solution is needed per reaction.
Add 50 µl of working solution to 50 µl of overnight culture in a PCR tube incubate at room temp     for 30 mins
Incubate overnight at 55 °C (this step is critical to ensure all lysozyme is inactivated)
Perform full transformation protocol using 3 µl of the lysate with BL21 (DE3) competent cells.
Plate the remaining lysate onto a chloramphenicol plate as a negative control.
Count colonies, overnight these and measure fluorescence.
Preparation of Competent Cells protocol
Scrape a few cells from an E. coli strain, straight form the -80°C freezer onto a marked space on an L-agar plate. (N.B. no ampicillin!) Streak out three times with a wire and grow overnight at 37ºC
Remove one colony from the plate and re-streak onto a second plate with a wire and again grow overnight at 37ºC.

To test the feasibility of chosen droplet coalescence volume ratios simple MDA reaction were tested. First of all, single circular DNA templates were encapsulated into 10 pL droplets and the emulsion was collected in a 1 mL syringe. Then, these small droplets were reinjected into the microfluidic droplet merging device. At the same moment 40 pL droplets, containing the MDA reaction components without a DNA template were generated at a constant rate (~ 100 000 000 droplets per hour). The droplet electrocoalescence was initiated by applying 10 kHz 300 mV square electrical wave. Fused 50 pL droplets were collected and incubated off chip at 30oC for 6 hours. The analysis of reaction prove (16 Fig. 1), that the content of two compartments fused and single DNA templates were amplified as the product looks exactly the same as simple droplet MDA reaction.
Next, a control experiment, mimicking the full microfluidic workflow of CAT-seq was performed. First, 10 pL droplets, housing in vitro transcription and translation reaction reagents, pUC19 DNA, substrate nucleotides and purified esterase were generated and incubated in 37oC for 3 hours. After the incubation, the droplets were reinfused into the microfluidics merging device and fused with 40 pL droplets, containing MDA reaction reagents without DNA template and dCTP molecules. The merged emulsion was collected and incubated at 30oC for 6 hours. The DNA agarose gel analysis show that ONLY if extracted CAT-Seq esterase enzyme is added the DNA is amplified (16 fig., well +Est). These results conclude that substrate nucleotides, catalytically converted by the added enzyme in 10 pL droplets, are incorporated into the DNA strand by phi29 polymerase which was successfully added to the reaction by employing droplet electrocoalescence. It also proves, that any of the reagents, present in the reaction do not affect the stability of substrate nucleotides, as no product is seen when the esterase is not added.       Proof of droplet merging.

What’s interesting is that most people we talked to in the street wanted to hear more about GMO and iGEM once we were done with the questions and many were positive about the new information. If they’d been positive about GMO before they naturally still seemed positive but those who were more negative seemed to open up a bit and many said they’d look up more information about GMO and synthetic biology.
To try and summarize: the public were a bit more positive about GMO than we’d have thought. Those who were against it had often heard bad things about GMO in media, from friends or just hadn’t received enough information at all. Some of those seemed to sway towards a more positive side after our conversation. This may simply be because of politeness or disinterest but we’d like to think that most people would be more positive about GMO and synthetic biology if we spread more knowledge about it and highlighted everything that’s beneficial with it while acknowledging all the research and controls that have to be made and precautions that have to be taken.
To see a spreadsheet of all the results and all statistical values click here .
This is just a beginning. It would be great if upcoming teams could expand the survey to include more participants. This would increase the statistical certainty of the survey. For instance is the difference between males and females in Sweden only significant at a 95% level but not at 99% (tobs=1.901, tstat(0.05,34)=1.696 and tstat(0.01,34)=2.453). It would also make it possible to compare results over the years and to be able to categorize the results more, even further looking at differences between ages for instance. More participants is also great for including more people from different areas with different backgrounds, making the survey even more extensive and complete. We will advise the next team Chalmers Gothenburg to continue with the survey. We want to thank team Czech Republic for participating and hopefully more teams may participate in upcoming years.
Media as a tool to reach society
We have been in contact with media for the purpose of spreading information about iGEM, Synthetic Biology and our project and team. We have reached out through the radio, Journals and the university press.  We got an interview at our local radio station (P4) at their morning program in the beginning of August. We spoke about the competition and our project idea and the program can be found by this link (the program is in Swedish): http://t.sr.se/1Pa2"

Friday created Plugin help file in Clotho. Created plugin xml file generator, which will automatically create a xml file to connect the Plug-in once the information is filled in. Also displays the xml file in the window.
Creates XML file for plugins
Still need to work on the five interfaces and their structure.
Week of June 15, 2009
Monday had the presentation on Plug-Ins. Got feedback from group and Professor Anderson on the Plug-In xml file generator:
Have mouse overs on each field that needs to be filled
Make option to save the xml file under user specified name
Make restrictions on choice for the interface and package name, since they have to correspond to each other
Started familiarizing myself with ANTLR , a tool for constructing compilers and interpreters from grammar rules. Each grammar rule checks the syntax of the program. One can specify actions for each rule which will be responsible for the semantic context of the program. The program consists of parser rules and lexer rules, where ANTLR constructs the Parser and Lexer files, the Test file and a Test input file after debugging.  So far ANTLR seems more user friendly than GNU Bison, but this can be due to the fact that there are more tutorials available.
Tuesday had a meeting with Doug and Adam on the language development:
Need to specify probabilities with each rule somehow, maybe each rule can have a probability property and when enforcing rules this can be taken into consideration
Need to provide functions, for example could have:
isDownstream()
isUpstream()
Translate()
ReverseComplement()
Need to include input/output capabilities
Control and iteration statements
Scope of the variables for right now will be global
Started writing the Context Free Grammar and thinking about the structure of the intermediate language, that is how are we going to implement the semantics. Right now have two classes (they are more like structs):
Property which has type, variable name and the different fields that will store the values of the property. Type just means if the value of the property that we are going to store is text, integer or list. Variable name refers to what property we are talking about, eg Sequence, ID, etc; it should help later accessing each property.
Part stores an ArrayList of properties, the part type, eg Promoter, RBS, etc and a HashMap of objects that each Part will have. For example:

The gel showed nothing, so there was nothing in the sample.  It is something that we have to be aware of when the concentration is so low, that there may actually not be any viable DNA in the sample.
7/13: The transformations using the concentrated cells (our own competent cells) did not work.  Likewise, only one plasmid prep from 7/12, YFPc+R200, grew.  The DNA quantification for this was very low as well.  It is looking increasingly obvious that we will need to buy competent cells.  We ordered Bioline Gold Efficiency Alpha-Select cells ( http://www.bioline.com/h_prod_detail.asp?itemid=234 ). Just to see if we were on the cusp of concentrating our cells, I did another transformation using 4000ul of our cells re-suspended in 200 ul of LB.  For these, I did YFPc+ pCat, YFPc+pBad, YFPc+pTet, and a positive control of J23101.
7/14: Transformations of the 4000ul concentrated cells did not work, with the exception on one plate that used the 3000ul concentrated cells, GFPc+R2000, grew a few colonies.  As we are waiting for the commercial competent cells to come in, I prepared a new ligation of RFP+term and GFP+term, using our standard ligation protocol (30 mins benchtop, no heat inactivation).  I also made some plasmid preps of the BFP+term and YFPc+R2000 that had grown using the MIT cells.  There are a lot of false positives on the plate and thus I am trying to be more selective with the colonies.
7/15: This morning I did minipreps of the plasmid preps that grew overnight of BFP+term and YFPc+Term.  One of the BFP+term liquid cultures grew well while the others were less cloudy than usual for a liquid culture.

When the OD600 of engineered E. coli reached 1.3, we added an appropriate concentration of mercury ions (0, 6.5, 12.5, 25 mg/L) to LB medium. In order to measure the metal ion adsorption ability of GFP-MC displayed on E. coli, we harvested cells from LB medium by centrifugation (5000 rpm, 3 min) and then washed them twice with saline. Then we analyzed total mercury by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.

We processed the sequence data using QIIME Pipeline–Version 1.7.0.In order to measure the selectivity of the E. coli to adsorb mercury ions, we added 6.5 mg/l Hg2+ and Cd2+, and 12.5 mg/l Cu2+ and Zn2+ in place of the mercury and measured the metal ion content in the samples by atomic absorption spectrophotometr(AAS).

I. physiological characteristics of the human nervous system[1]
The nervous system is divided into two different parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). We will focus on the peripheral nervous system as it transports the information between the rest of the body and the central nervous system. Moreover, it includes the somatic nervous system which consists of afferent nerves, also called sensory nerves, and efferent nerves also called motor nerves. Afferent nerves are responsible for relaying sensation from the body to the central nervous system; efferent nerves are responsible for sending out commands from the CNS to the body, stimulating muscle contraction; they include all the non-sensory neurons connected with skeletal muscles and skin. Generally, the fibers of the somatic nervous system have an insulating sheath called a myelin sheath.
Figure 1: Structure of nerves, based on[2]
Nerve fibers, consisting of axons and associated Schwann cells are grouped together in fascicles, sheathed by the perineurium (Cf. Figure 1). It is composed of layers of perineural cells. About half of the fascicular surface is occupied by the fibers, the rest is composed of the endoneurium which segments the inside of the fascicle into several groups of nerve fibers which will then form new fascicles.
The fascicles are contained in an isolated connective tissue called the epineurium that contains fibroblasts, collagen, and fat in different proportions. This envelope allows the fixation of the nerve on the surrounding structures. It contains the lymphatic and vascular network which crosses the perineurium to communicate with the network of arterioles and venula of the endoneurium. The epineurium constitutes 30 to 70% of the total area of a nerve.
The fascicular architecture is ordered only distally, close to the emergence of a nerve trunk. Going up to the proximal part, fascicles divide and some fibers change their fascicles, the size of the fascicles decreases and their number increases. An orderly organization relative to the target organ is found only in the final branches that innervate a muscle, a group of muscles or sensory receptors.
II. Propagation of nerve impulses:
The nerve impulse is initiated by action potentials that are created by successive openings and closings of the ion channels. The membrane current due to ionic flux creates an electric field in the nerve that produces a potential difference outside the nerve called extracellular voltage. It is this"

Time Complexity Analysis
The algorithms used in  Biodesigner could be grouped into two categories: preprocessing part and executing  part.
Preprocessing Part
The preprocessing part includes three algorithms. Here we assume there are n devices and each device  contains at most m biobrickes.
The first one is to count  the probabilities of two successive biobrickes, three successive biobrickes,  four successive biobrickes and five successive biobrickes. Here successive  biobrickes means the biobrickes are neighbors. Thus the number of two successive  biobrickes, three successive biobrickes, four successive biobrickes and five successive  biobrickes are n(m-1),  n(m-2), n(m-3),  n(m-4), respectively. Hash tables are used to store these successive  biobrickes. Therefore, the probabilities could be obtained by scanning the  device chains four times. Thus, the time complexity of this algorithm is O(2n(m-1)+3n(m-2)+4n(m-3)+5n(m-3))=O(nm).   
The second one is to count  the probabilities of the first biobrick of each device chain. This work could  be done by scanning the first biobrick of each chain. Thus, the complexity of  this algorithm is O(n).
The third one is to  calculate the hamming distances of each paired biobrickes.  Since there are n device chains and each  device contains at most m biobrickes. Therefore, there are at most nm  biobrickes, which means there are at most nm*nm paired biobrickes. The  calculation of hamming distances between two sequences with length l could be  done in O(l) time. Thus, the complexity of this algorithm is O(l*nm*nm).
Hence, the time complexity  of preprocessing part is O(nm)+O(n)+O(l*nm*nm) =O(l*nm*nm).
Executing Part
The executing part contains  two algorithms. Here we"

Overview
Bacteriocins are antimicrobial peptide compounds that are ribosomally produced by Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria as inactive or active pre-peptides ZENDO, T. (2013). Screening and Characterization of Novel Bacteriocins from Lactic Acid Bacteria. Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry, 77(5), 893–899. . Bacteriocins were first described in 1925 by Gratia, and were reported as highly specific antibiotics produced by E. coli Balciunas, E. M., Castillo Martinez, F. A., Todorov, S. D., Gombossy De Melo Franco, B. D., Converti, A., & Pinheiro De Souza Oliveira, R. (2013). Novel biotechnological applications of bacteriocins: A review. Food Control, 32, 134–142. . The bacteriocins show bacteriostatic and/or bactericidal activity against other related bacteria,  and can be broad- or narrow-spectrum Balciunas, E. M., Castillo Martinez, F. A., Todorov, S. D., Gombossy De Melo Franco, B. D., Converti, A., & Pinheiro De Souza Oliveira, R. (2013). Novel biotechnological applications of bacteriocins: A review. Food Control, 32, 134–142. . The bacteriocins effect is through adhesion to specific receptors present on the external surface of the target bacteria, or by other unknown mechanism Zendo, T., Yoneyama, F., & Sonomoto, K. (2010). Lactococcal membrane-permeabilizing antimicrobial peptides. . Hereby the bacteriocins induce metabolic changes by forming an open pore where nutrients diffuse out of the cell and therefore also induces morphological changes, which might result in the death of the bacteria or inhibition of its virulence factors. The bacteriocins are found to play a fundamental role in controlling pathogenic and non-wanted flora, as well as establish beneficial bacterial populations and thus serve as an alternative and/or supplement to traditional antibiotics used today. Thereby facing the problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
Gene localization and regulation
The bacteriocins are located in operon clusters. These clusters contain genes encoding the bacteriocin, corresponding immunity and also genes that encodes peptides responsible for post translational modification"

Old Yellow Enzymes
Several microbial enzymes have the ability to catalyse the breakdown of nitro- and nitroaromatic compounds such as TNT and NG. These enzymes fall into two main families:
Oxygen-Insensitive Nitroreductases: These enzymes sequentially perform two-electron reductions of nitro groups. They typically contain Flavin mononucleotides FMN which they use, along with NADPH as a cofactor and electron donor. Examples include the nitroreductases NfsA and NfsB from Escherichia coli,1 PnrA and PnrB from Pseudomonas putida,2 and NitA and NitB from Clostridium acetobutylicum.3
Old Yellow Enzymes (OYE): The physiological function of this family of NADPH dehydrogenases is not yet well established; however, they are often associated with nitroaromatic compound reduction. Within the OYE family, two types of enzymes have been described:
Type I hydride transferases, which, like the oxygen-insensitive nitroreductases above, reduce the nitroaromatic compounds to hydroxylamine derivatives.
Type II hydride transferases, which catalyse a nucleophilic attack on the aromatic ring of TNT.4,5
Of bacterial OYE family members, those"

Time: 2015.07.11 and 2015.08
Location: 712 Meeting Room, 5th Teaching Building, Beijing Institute of Technology and BNU
Since it has been the third time for us to join in the iGEM competition, we deeply appreciate the significance of communication and discussion. We had several exchange meetings with BNU-China. In the first communication, the two teams respectively introduced their project and the recent progress. Then we exchanged some ideas on how to guide new team members and discussed some problems in experiments. We found our own advantages and shortcomings in the exchange. At the end of this meeting, the two teams decided to establish a cooperation relationship and helped with each other.
The next two exchanges were mainly focused on cooperation. Discussions were processing both online and offline. We helped BNU-China to construct a part of the gene circuit, and meanwhile, BNU-China tried their best to help us with the characterization of our parts and also contributed a lot to our project’s modelling.

In August, 2015, BIT-CHINA participated in Conference of China iGEM Committee (CCiC) in Peking University. We had a good harvest during this conference. After a long time of experiments, this time we showed more results of our experiments. For this time, much more attention was received in virtue of our project, and many different kinds of questions about pH Controller were asked. Meanwhile, we had received some valuable suggestions. Surprisingly, staffs from some fermentation industry companies expressed great interests in our project, at the same time, they put forward a number of targeted issues, which made us think more deeply about our project.

Dundee,2013,Team:Dundee#Project#MopTesting_-_-_TEXT.html,". The following day the cells were harvested and washed, and the cell pellets weighed and re-suspended in TBS buffer to a concentration of 1 g cells/ml. The optical density at 600nm of these cell suspensions was also measured, allowing us to enumerate the number of cells, and therefore mops, present in our experiment.
The Mop Experiment
0.5 ml of the re-suspended E. coli cells was incubated with TBS buffer containing microcystin-LR (Enzo Life Sciences), at a final concentration of 5nM, for 1 h at room temperature. The final volume of the reaction was 1ml. After incubation the bacterial cells were removed by pelleting and supernatant was withdrawn, snap frozen, and stored at -80oC.
In order to measure the microcystin concentration of the samples the microcystin (ADDA specific) ELISA kit from Enzo was used, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
TorASP-PP1 cells ""Mop"" up Microcystin
The ELISA that we used is an indirect competitive ELISA. The sample is placed in a well of a 96 well plate and so is the microcystin (ADDA specific) primary antibody. Microcystin present in the sample competes with microcystin bound at the bottom of the wells for binding of the primary antibody. The secondary antibody is HRP-conjugated and if it binds to primary antibody:microcystin complexes at the bottom of the well this will result in a colour change. The intensity of the colour is inversely proportional to the concentration of microcystin present in the sample. The absorbance was read at 450 nm and by measuring standards of known microcystin concentration, a standard curve was constructed to allow us to calculate microcystin concentration in the samples. As shown in Fig 1, the microcystin concentration in the no cells control sample measured 4.3 nM, whereas, by treating the microcystin contaminated buffer with our TorASP-PP1 ‘Mop’ cells the concentration was reduced to 0.26 nM. Cells expressing an ‘empty’ vector or cytoplasmic NarG-PP1 did not mop up microcystin. Therefore we can conclude that it only PP1 in the periplasm can mop up the microcystin.

They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.

Estimating the number of targets and off-targets, we                         can obtain a distribution of the cleavage probability                         in function of energy needed to cleave each DNA                         location. Thus, M different energetic states are                         considered as places where the R-loop could take place,                         being our Testing System one of that states. This                         scenario can fit to a Boltzmann distribution (2,5),                         being the binding probability of the Cas9:gRNA complex                         with the m-DNA region:
This expression has information about the thermodynamic                         balance after the R-loop formation. In order to obtain                         it, we had to obtain previously the free energy                         increment for each DNA candidate (-ΔGcomplex,target), and the expected number                         of those regions (Ntarget).
Off-target regions were estimated using the off-target                         search algorithm, getting 1 off-target for Ga20Ox and 5                         for TFL. The next section has the explanation of the                         free energy increment, which ensures the thermodynamic                         stability of the R-loop.
Off-target search algorithm.
Off-targets are DNA regions where the R-loop could                         take place because of the high similarity between that                         region and the target. This means that off targets                         steal Cas9 and gRNA supposed to knock out on-targets.                         Most reliable off-target predictions are obtained by                         experimental results, but in our model we must be able                         to find off-targets quickly for all possible targets                         (1,2) so we could not wait for experimental                         results.
Alternatively, we have developed an off-target search based in transcriptional activities and local                         alignments between target and off-target candidates.                         Our proposed strategy was the following one:
The first step was to create a gene library with                         sequences of the most transcribed genes in Nicotiana                         benthamiana. There is a clear relation between                         transcriptional activity and relaxed state of chromatin                         (13), letting us assume that those genes highly                         transcribed will be more accessible to the gRNA.
This algorithm is implemented in the Matlab function                         Nboffsearch.m. The search of potential off-targets for                         each of our two targets, gave a result of 1 off-target                         for Ga20Ox and 5 off-targets for the TFL.

As there is no energy supply catalyzing the R-loop (2), the process described above is a sequence of                         reactions which in global, must accomplish the                         thermodynamic law for this kind of processes:

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Results-nuc_-_-_TEXT.html," pSB1K3-T7-Esp as backbone source, due to depletion of pure pSB1K3. The pSB1K3-T7-Esp plasmid was digested with the same restriction enzymes as the linear pSB1K3 backbone from iGEM HQ. The backbone fragment from this was then obtained through gel purification for the use in subsequent ligation. This gel purification may have been imprecise and the cause of the Esp contamination. Therefore, ligation was re-done with another backbone source from iGEM HQ containing only backbone, pSB1A3.
The subsequent attempt was unsuccessful and for the 7th attempt, no analysis on the ligation product was made. The transformation of the ligation product was unsuccessful since there were no colonies on the plate. Since the transformation protocol were thought to be reliable, the conclusion was drawn that the ligation had failed. The backbone used was again changed to pSB1C3 instead, due to depletion of the pSB1A3 sample from iGEM HQ. Also, the ligation conditions were changed - instead of 10 minutes at room temperature, the samples were incubated at 16 °C overnight, a common protocol for ligations which we hoped would be more successful.
Digestion an Ligation, Eight to Tenth Attempt [✔️]
Successful digestion of Nuc in both the 8th and the 9th attempt (see Figure 2, 9th attempt). There results from the analysis of the ligation product indicated a successful ligation and after transformations, colonies were formed. However for both attempts, the subsequent plasmid analysis of the transformed cells showed negative results.
The vector:insert ratio of 1:3 was suspected to be insufficient and a 1:10 ratio was set for the subsequent ligations. A mistake of using the wrong restriction enzymes for the digestion of the backbone resulted in an obvious unsuccessful ligation. The following, 10th, attempt where the same samples were used (except for the backbone, which was now correctly digested), was successful. But the results were not confirmed until a single digestion analysis had been performed (successfully, see Figure 3) since the analysis of the ligation product were inconclusive. The sample in well 5 (see Figure 3) had the expected size and was further used. Presence of the correct construct was further proved after overhang PCR amplification with the Nuc_R reverse primer, designed with a BamHI restriction site overhang (see Figure 4).

Further downstream of this affinity tag we fused the BioBrick for the EspP autotransporter from E. coli [27] [28] which is then followed by a bacterial terminator. For the termination we again chose a well working terminator from the distribution plate (""double terminator""; BBa_B0010 - BBa_B0012 ).
But this was just the DNA-part. What is expected to happens on a protein level? The construct constantly produces Tet-repressor that binds to thet Tet-Operator and repressed the promoter activity of the autotransporter gene. As soon as the inducer anhydrotetracycline (aTc) is added to the culture, it binds to the Tet-repressor that can't bind any more to the Tet-operator and thus the expression of the autotransporter can be regulated. Although the TetR-system is known to be a tight promoter system there is always a certain background expression with most promoters. If the protein expression of the autotransporter is induced using aTc the autotransporter is transcribed and translated. Due to the bacterial signal peptide the protein is secreted into the bacterial periplasm (the space between the two bacterial membranes of gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli). When present in the bacteria periplasm the autotransporter diffused to the outer membrane and inserts into the membrane. After the integration into the outer membrane the protein cargo is transportet through the beta-barrel of the autotransporter and is pre sented on the bacterial surface. We are sure that this BioBrick will be a valuable contribution to the Parts Registry as it allows future teams to display small protein domains on the surface of gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli.
Results: Testing the bacterial autotransporter system
For the testing of our autotransporter constructs we transformed all three autotransporter constructs together with a secreted NanoLuc luciferase, which served as a control, into E. coli JK321 [29] . Transformed cells were grown in LB-medium supplemented with chloramphenicol (pSB1C3-vector) at 30°C and 180 RPM. In the morning a stationary over night culture was used to inoculate 50 mL fresh medium with 1 mL of culture. The cultures were grown to OD550 = 0.5 and then the induction of the protein production was started using aTc: ""non"" = non-induced; ""low"" = 25 ng/mL aTc;"

Currently, cyanobacteria is used to produce biofuel, however the process is too costly and inefficient to use on a large-scale production to replace fossil fuels. Many researchers have been successful increasing the amount of free fatty acids produced within the cells, which serve as the precursors to biofuel. However, scientists constantly run into a problem: high amounts of free fatty acids are toxic to the cell and kill it. Our aim is to reengineer cyanobacteria to increase the efficiency of biofuel production by improving the yield of fatty acids produced within each cell while solving the toxicity problem. To aid the cells in surviving these high amounts of toxicity we plan to upregulate the cells' carotenoids, which will stabilize their membranes and get rid of reactive oxygen species. With a stronger, more stable cell membrane, the cyanobacteria should be able to produce more free fatty acids, thus producing more biofuel, bringing humanity a step closer to acquiring a source of renewable energy.
Carotenoid pigments are naturally occurring within photosynthetic organisms, and protect the cell against high amounts of light exposure. Specifically, Zeaxanthin is one of the carotenoids that can be synthesized within cells. Some bacteria, such as Staphlycoccus aureus, are able to live in the fatty acids located on our skin (citation). The mechanism in which these bacteria are able to thrive is by upregulating genes related to cell wall thickness and membrane bound carotenoid concentrations. By using this same mechanism, we hope to help the cyanobacteria cope with the fatty acids that they themselves have been genetically modified to make.
Tocopherols are photosynthesis-increasing metabolites that have similar properties to zeaxanthin in cyanobacteria and act as an antioxidant, protecting the cell from lipid peroxidation, a chain reaction affecting unsaturated hydrophobic compounds, including fatty acids, that degrades the cell membrane (Sattler, S. E., Cahoon, E. B., Coughlan, S. J., & DellaPenna, D., 2003). They protect the cell membrane by donating an electron to create resonance-stabilized tocopheroxyl radicals. This stops the lipid peroxidation reaction right in its tracks. Thus, the tocopherols are able to protect polyunsaturated fatty acids"

Figure 4: Skype call with Benjamin Lehner, PhD Exchange Candidate at the NASA Ames Research Center in California, Silicon Valley.
We talked with Benjamin about our project idea, possible bottlenecks and how NASA and iGEM work together. Thanks to his great insights we learned that the uptake of iron ions in high amounts by bacteria is possible and that printing with iron in space is currently a field NASA is working on. He explained to us, that iron can be used in the construction of conducting structures when used in an air free atmosphere for example on the moon. This changed our assumptions on which metals can be used for printing conducting structures and we decided to add iron to the list of metal ions we could use for our printing applications. His encouraging remarks about the possibility to import very high amounts of iron ions into cells gave us the confidence to further pursue our work in the direction of iron uptake with the help of modified ferritin. By also focusing on iron uptake we add another important metal to the list of materials which can be found in elevated levels in pit water all over Germany. Mr. Lehner also encouraged us to continue our work on copper uptake because to his knowledge 20% of the global copper mined and recycling is already done with the help of bacteria and it’s an essential metal required in many industrial applications. He also recommended us to get in contact with Jon Marles-Wright which is an expert in the field of ferritin and its possible applications.
Physics Department and Nanoparticle Experts
To gain valuable insight about physical characteristics of our nanoparticles we stood in close contact with the physics department here at our university. By granting us access to measurement equipment like an electron microscope and through a constant dialog with the department we were able to attain a new level of understanding about our nanoparticles.
Beside the expertise and advice on how to deal with nanoparticles we made extensive use of multiple TEM microscopes which require an experienced operator who spends long hours helping us to load the probes inside the vacuum chamber and set up the TEM correctly.

There are two known transcriptional activators of the vps operons, VpsR and VpsT.
vpsR mutants are completely defective in biofilm formation
Expression of vpsR and vpsT is regulated by the expression of hapR.
At high cell density, hapR is expressed, and vpsR and vpsT are repressed.
Stringent response induces biofilm formation, particularly when V. cholerae is forming biofilms in aquatic environments, where there may be low nutrient availability. Stringent response is induced when there is an increased concentration of the second messengers pppGpp (guanosine 3=-diphosphate 5=triphosphate) and ppGpp [guanosine 3=5=-bis(diphosphate)], together termed (p)ppGpp. An increased concentration of (p)ppGpp causes significant changes in gene expression that result in cessation of growth and induction of specific stress responses.
Deletion of (p)ppGpp synthases led to loss of the ability to form biofilm and a decrease in expression of vpsR and vpsT.
In stringent response-induced cultures, vpsR expression increased 2.5-fold and vpsT expression increased 4-fold.

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Test#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," who wouldn't take the advice of their doctor, our treatment was favourite with just under half saying they would prefer the designed bacteria (48%), compared to 40% who would prefer antibiotics.
We also asked, “If your doctor recommended a treatment for an infection, which involved the use of bacteria that had been engineered to treat the infection, would you use it?”
Our survey showed that if a doctor recommended our treatment, only 6% would not consider it. This is very encouraging data for our project, but again highlights the importance of gaining support from doctors, because without their backing, the use of engineered bacteria as therapeutic agents will not progress from primary research.
We had very similar feedback when we spoke to patients. During a visit to the Bedford Ward at the John Radcliffe Hospital, we spoke with one of the catheterised patients there called Mavis. She admitted to having had UTIs in the past, but said she had not contracted a UTI since having a catheter fitted. We found that patients like Mavis could end up using the same catheter for up to 10 weeks. This enforced the importance of being able to keep our bacteria alive for a sustained period of time. When we asked her about treating infection with bacteria, she said she would be happy to, if it had been recommended to her by a doctor. She said, in her view, it is not dissimilar to using antibiotics.
Return to nurses
During this visit we were able to talk to Laura Evans again, this time to ask questions specifically about our project.
Our project involves designing a catheter that prevents the formation of a biofilm on its surface. What do you think of this idea?
A catheter like that would be useful, but it depends on how long your catheter would work for. Patients can have a single catheter fitted for 3 months or longer. Catheters are also removed for other reasons, for example if they become blocked. Catheter blockage is a common issue for patients suffering from UTIs.
Both Laura’s and Mavis’ response regarding how long a catheter remains in place inspired us to research how we could keep our Solution bacteria alive, the results of which can be found in design.

Techfest
• Achievement: a public education involving 5 igem teams and more than 1000 participants!
“Be a world shaper!” Stimulating interests of the youth to be future world shaper is a core purpose of our education part in Human Practice. Every year ZJU-iGEM holds Techfest in Zhejiang Technology and Science museum since 2015. Particularly in this year, we invited ZJUT-China, JNU-China, ASTWS-China, HFLS_ZhejiangUnited and Worldshaper-XSHS to co-organize the Techfest.
We always believe education should be directly applied to students in every age, from kids in primary school to youth in collage, even to the adults. Such a popular scientific activity was a fantastic opportunity. We delivered speeches about synthetic biology and introduction of our project. We designed several minigames such as Candy DNA Model Splicing, Ecological Bottle Designing and Card Game on How to Splice Genetic Circuit Correctly. In order to make the activity more impressive and more in-depth, we also designed 100 simple questions related to synthetic biology.
Every one present showed great interests in our Biology and we took this advantage to advertise what is modern biology. We were delighted that the public showed great enthusiasm on biology! Considered as the bridge to link the profound science and the public together, popularization of science activity is really meaningful.

The cell vectors number does not increase such as the tissue vectors . Indeed, it decreases with time, because of the phage vector stability and of its cell penetration (to release the therapeutic plasmide ).
Its stability in the blood is equal to the phage vector deterioration constant (kdeg) according to time. If we add this constant to the cell vectors number equation according to time (Np(t)) we obtain the following formula :

So, we determined:
The size of the tumor versus time (initial volume + growth)
The amount of tissue vector versus time
The amount of released cell vectors for a tissue vector
Now, we're going to determine the efficiency of our vectors for penetring cancer cells.
For that we are studying:
The area of dispersal cell vector
The importance of the cellular internalization of the vector in cancer cells.

Fourth step : The cell vector dispersion
Here, we are looking for determine the maximum area that a phage can cover. This requires knowing:
The spread of phages in the bloodstream
Their diffusion through the walls of blood vessels
The surface of a cancer cell
For our modeling, we consider the blood as a Newtonian fluid with a constant velocity Vmax. Here, We neglect the heart-related jolts and turbulent flows caused by the cavities of the blood epithelium.
The cell vector moves along two axes. An X axis in the direction of blood flow and a Y axis orthogonal to the axis X.
The phage propagation in the bloodstream
The movement in X depends solely on the propagation of phages the vessel due to blood flow. Indeed, we neglect the diffusion which takes place also along the X axis because it is 1000 times less than the propagation of particles in the blood (due to the importance of blood flow). The cellular carriers are moving at speeds spread on a dish from, Vmax in the center of the vessel at V0 against the vessel wall.
The speed of phages decrease in approaching the vessel walls due to the friction forces which are opposing to the movement.
We can determine how long the particle (with a Vmax velocity), ie the particles in the center of the ship, reached the end. This gives the time necessary to internalize all the phages of the bacteria.

Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Stockholm,2010,Team:Stockholm#Project Idea#Introduction_-_-_TEXT.html," affected by Vitiligo, with varying levels of severity. The disorder is characterized by patches occurring on the skin in various parts of the body, hair growing on the patches may also turn white [1].
Population surveys have shown that Vitiligo patients first outbreak is seen before the age of 20 in 50 % of the cases, and 70-80 before the age of 30. So it is relatively uncommon with Vitiligo outbreaks in mid-age. Both sexes in adults and children are affected in equal weights; however studies have showed that females contact doctors in a larger number due to greater psychological and social impact [2].
At first, vitiligo can be thought of as a minor disorder, however the effect on patient’s self-esteem and social interactions can be devastating, especially in patients with darker pigmented skin where the white patches can be more visible. There are two distinguished large sub-sets of vitiligo, called focal/segmental vitiligo and non-segmental vitiligo. The former is characterized by few numbers of small lesions while the second form by an asymmetric distribution of the skin surface. Non-segmental vitiligo is correlated to all generalized, symmetrical forms. The course of the outbreak of the disease is unpredictable with phases of stabilized depigmentation. White vitiligo patches that are in an enlarging manner or the development of new lesions are classified as in an active form of disease [3].
Currently three major hypotheses of vitiligo have been proposed. The neural hypothesis implicates an accumulation of a neurochemical substance in the form of a toxin from nerve endings. This damages melanocytes and thus decreases melanin production. The biochemical hypothesis suggests an accumulation of toxic molecules from the synthesis of melanin in melanocytes, the breakdown of antioxidant molecules, and the build-up of large amounts of reactive molecules in pigment cells. Additionally, an autoimmune response in vitiligo patients has been proposed. Studies have demonstrated that vitiligo patients have developed antibodies and an activated immune system destructive against the body’s own pigment cells. Other possible causes of vitiligo have been suggested, including impaired melanocyte migration and/or development [3].
It might be that the mentioned factors act independently or together to result in the same effect, which is the disappearance of melanocytes from the skin [3].
Our research is divided up into two areas, which are long and short time effect on the skin. The long term research is focusing on both the biochemical and autoimmune hypothesis, which is to result in a repigmentation of white skin patches after a longer time period of treatment. The complementary short term research"
