iGEM - INTERNATIONAL GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MACHINES
iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machines) is a competition  organized by MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) in Boston, USA,  since 2004 and has become one of the largest international competitions in the  field of science. This year 128 teams of undergraduate students compete against  each other, and for the second time ESBS-Strasbourg team is joining this  competition.
Synthetic biology is a new area of biological research that combines science and engineering. Synthetic biology encompasses a variety of  different approaches, methodologies and disciplines. We can define the synthetic  biology as the design and (re)construction of new biological  functions and systems not found in nature.
Similar to the construction of a car,  Synthetic Biology uses simple gene building blocks for the construction of new complex systems with distinct functions.  These gene building blocks are collected in a database by iGEM and can  be used by all participants of the competition. So far, the collection contains  more than 13,000 gene building blocks , due to the continuous development of  new parts over the last years. This summer all teams work on self-developed  projects which will then be presented in the beginning of November at the  “Jamboree” in Boston. Several prizes in different categories will be awarded.
ESBS-Strasbourg Team
We are a student-run team from the trinational graduate school ""École supérieur de Biotechnologie Strasbourg"" (ESBS) located in the capital of Europe - Strasbourg, France. The ESBS is a joint-venture of the Universities of Freiburg and Karlsruhe in  Germany, the University of Bale in Switzerland and the University of"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of g"

UNIPV-Pavia,2009,Team:UNIPV-Pavia#Project#Motivation_-_-_TEXT.html," fuels (biofuels). The possibility of obtaining a renewable source of energy is one of the challenges. Bioethanol as the other biofuels is an environmentally clean source of energy. In the last year, due to the rising environmental concerns and to the petroleum  crisis, bioethanol has become a viable and realistic alternative in the energy market.
The development of cost-effective technologies for fuel ethanol production is a priority that implies the selection of the most appropriate feedstock and the selection and definition of a suitable process configuration.
Bioethanol can be produced from several raw materials containing fermentable sugars as sugar cane (the most important feedstock utilized in tropical and sub-tropical countries) and beet, from starchy materials (most utilized in North America and Europe), from some polysaccharides and from lignocellulosic biomass (for countries where the cultivation of energy crops is difficult). However, production costs of fuel ethanol are higher than production costs of gasoline; diverse process improvements could succeed in lowering ethanol cost. An important part of the research on fuel ethanol production is oriented to the reduction of feedstock costs: the technology of recombinant DNA will provide important advances for the development of fuel ethanol industry.
A viable alternative to obtaining fuel ethanol is whey, that it is considered a feedstock for fermentation; in fact, fuel ethanol production from whey seems to be technically and economically feasible. The whey-to-ethanol plant commissioned in 1978 by Carbery Milk Products Ltd., Ireland, is believed to be the first modern commercial operation to produce alcohol. There are two industrial-scale whey-ethanol plants in the United States, at Corona, California, and Melrose, Minnesota, that together produce 8 million gallons of fuel ethanol a year. New Zealand started using fuel ethanol produced from whey in August 2007.
All ethanol production processes share some basic principles and steps:
- whey permeate from protein ultrafiltration is concentrated by reverse osmosis to attain high lactose content;
- lactose is fermented with some yeast strains;
- once the fermentation is completed, the liquid is separated and moved to the distillation process to extract ethanol;
- ethanol is then sent through the rectifier for dehydration and then denatured.
- the effluent may be discharged to a treatment system, digested for methane gas, sold as feed, or further processed into food, feed or other products.
Whey permeate used in ethanol fermentation is a free feedstock (no cost) and the capital can be completely invested in the plant construction project.
Naturally occurring biological systems cannot efficiently metabolize lactose"

*A+K stands for ampicillin + kanamycin, C stands for chloramphenicol.
2. Test of the equality of killing: the killing effect of warrior II is far stronger than warrior I
    We calculate the ratio of Warrior I/Warrior II in group 3 and group 6. If the ratios are alike, then the killing effect of the warriors are similar.
    The figure shows the result. We can see that in the medium containing A+K, the amount of the warriors from two sides are roughly equal. At the same time, in the medium containing C, the amount of Warrior II is much larger. This is easy to explain as not only does Warrior II kills warrior I, but Warrior I kills itself as well.
*A+K stands for ampicillin + kanamycin, C stands for chloramphenicol.
B. Killing effect test
1. Test of killing effect
    We calculate the ratio of Beggar/Warrior in each group and the results can be seen from the figures.
    We can see that when we mix Warrior I with Beggar II, the amount of Beggar II after 15h is much more than the amount of Warrior I. This may partly because Warrior I kills itself and partly because its killing effect towards Beggar II is weak.
    In contrast with the result above, we find that when we mix Beggar I and Warrior II together, the amount of Warrior II surely surpasses that of Beggar I. This means that the killing effect of Warrior I is very obvious.
2. Killing significance of warriors
    Furthermore, we compared the amount of beggars when they are cultured alone with the amount of beggars when they are cultured with warriors. We calculated the amount of beggars in group 7/group 8 to see the change in beggar I and in group11 /group 12 to see the change in Beggar II. From this figure, we can see that the amount of beggar I drops drastically when it is cultured with Warrior II, which means that Warrior II really work. As the amount of Beggar II does not have an apparent change, we may say that warrior I’s killing effect is surely too weak.
V Analysis
    Firstly, we ensure that our warriors can really kill. The amount of beggars do decrease when the warriors from the other side is added and the more warriors, the less beggars. (tset of killing effect)

Who we are
Our iGEM team is a group of seven students and three mentors.
As we are a team of only ten people, and the iGEM competition is a new experience for many of us, we work closely together on all aspects of our work. There is no graph, no abstract, not even a single presentation slide that isn't enthusiastically discussed by the whole team. We divide our lab work as well, so that each of us has spent some time working on the other modules.
All of us are working closely together with our two instructors Prof. Thorsten Mascher and Dr. Tina Wecke and our advisor Dr. Georg Fritz. Prof. Thorsten Mascher is not only offering us a place in his lab, but also a lot of support and input on all parts of the project. Tina is the one to go to for trouble shooting and strategy planning, and Georg is advising us how to best evaluate parts and how to model.
We have a lot of fun working together on Beadzillus!
Where we are from
München mag dich!
This is the slogan of Munich, the city where our team is from. It stands for the cosmopolitan character of Munich. But it is also a declaration of love to its citizens. All of us enjoy the variety of activities that Munich has to offer. The inner city shows traces of Munich|s history, the English Garden provides the space for sunny or snowy days, quarters are complete with diverse museums, galleries, cafes and bars... In many of these quarters you will meet many students, on the run or relaxing between classes, as two universities are located"

The second phase: T.atroviride homologous recombination kit
A DNA assembly and chromosomal integration method was established by homologous recombination (HR) in T.atroviride.
When using our kit, we transform the plasmids embedded gene of interests together with the plasmids embedded left and right homologous arms into the T.atroviride. In this way, we can finish the homologous recombination process in vivo.
As listed in table, we have constructed a series of promoter vectors and terminator vectors.

There must be a contamination or mix-up of AP_light and AP_dark.   The purified plasmid AP_dark_Ppsp-EL222-BR was transformed in S1030 by electroporation and plated on Amp/Tet plates. Tet is necessary to make sure that the E. coli still carry the F-plasmid for phage infection.
On the next day, colonies were picked an grown in 4 ml 2xYT overnight. A glycerol stock of the overnight culture was prepared, and the remaining culture was used for plasmid purification. Plasmid purifications of AP_light, AP_dark and AP_dark_Ppsp_EL222-BR out of S1030 were send to GATC for sequencing. The sequence of AP_dark_Ppsp_EL222-BR was correct, but AP_dark as well as AP_light exhibited the sequence of AP_dark.
Protein_Interaction
Week 39: GoldenGate cloning for all T7 RNAP constructs were performed and transformed into S1030 cells via electroporation. Transformation for phages worked properly, but AP transformation first did not show any cultures on plate to pick for glycerol stocks (plasmid IDs 305 + 306). Therefore, AP-transformation was repeated with 2060 cells, which worked.
Software
Embedding
Embedding on Uniprot is calculated over 15 epochs, vectors that are close to each other in the high dimensional space seem to be similar on sequence level on first sight.
Genetic artificial intelligent algorithm is implemented. Features are mutation of a given maximum of residues, mutation of specific residues. Those are inserted in the model in small letters while the rest of the sequence is written in capital letters. Furthermore weighting arbitrary numbers of goal- and avoid- GO-terms are possible. The variance of the given classes, a measure for the authenticity of a protein, is substracted from the overall score. Recombination of sequences was not implemented as it corrupts maintaining less then the maximum allowed mutations in a sequence.

Abstract
When we talk about internal clock, we actually refer to the circadian rhythm of higher animals and plants. Sensing the cycling environmental factors (light and temperature, etc.), circadian clock allows organism to behave accordingly and reguarly. This year, we develop a plug-in for microbes, a system that can build up an internal clock for microbes and guide them to live regularly as well as to work efficiently. Also, we could insert this system into dangerous strains and endue life span, they are doomed to die before causing any biohazard. Flip units based on recombinase system are introduced in our system. One flip unit is able to calculate a specific period of time, while several flip units form one time cycle. So, when we combine several time cycles together, a timer is constructed. Different flip unit assemblies creat distinctive time cycles, forms different kinds of timers. We believe this system will be of great significance to biological devices with time-related concepts.
Background
It is well known that the internal clock is of great significance to human life. The time rhythm let people work and rest regularly, which keeps us healthy and energetic. However, in microbes, especially prokaryotic organism, we could hardly find a strain with rhythm.
Actually, adding rhythm into microbes is a meaningful thing, by which would provide us a brand new technology platform or control system. This year, we hope to construct a rhythm device with time limit. As follows, we will use 3 simple hypothetical cases to illustrate its future application potentials.

Figure 6. The fluorescence intensity of two coloration systems (the concentration of formaldehyde is 0.1mM）
As Figure 6 shows, our improved coloration system has a stronger fluorescence intensity, about 1.4 times stronger than the coloration system designed by WHU-China 2014.
----* Improvement of XMU-China 2016 *----
In the project of XMU-China 2016, they designed a circuit to detect and kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and the most attracting part of their project is their toggle switch, which can bring a delayed effect with a 3 hours delay.
Figure 7. The designed circuit of XMU-China 2016
But in their project, they only finished the experiment part of their project without modeling. After learning about their project, improved their project by modeling their circuit.
Because XMU-China 2016 did not get enough data to complete their modeling, we have to look for more data from their references[1] and repeat their work to complete and test the model.
I. The relationship between the concentration of AHL and the fluorescence intensity of GFP
To get a formula which can show the relationship between the concentration of AHL and the fluorescence intensity of GFP, we fitted their curve using GraphPad PRISM software.
FI: fluorescence intensity
AHL: concentration of AHL
II. The function of the circuit
The models were based on ordinary differential equations that captured the activation and repression of protein synthesis. The intracellular species included GFP (G), LacI (L), cI (C), LuxR/AHL complex (R), AHL (A) and a fixed concentration of LuxR. The following equations were used:

While he has to be a bit cautious about revealing details because of the patent process – an expected six to eight-month timeline -- Ward said their idea will significantly improve the way in which hormones are detected.
""Hormones – and hormone imbalances – play very important roles in understanding behaviour and mental health, pregnancy as well as development and aging of all populations,"" says Ward. ""We are pursuing new technology for the detection of hormones that provides rapid results that are 93 per cent more cost effective than traditional antibody technology.""
The team's market analysis showed diverse applications and projections for growth, with a two to three-year timeline to produce a marketable device. The first test runs of this device will occur this summer at the Canadian Centre for Behavioural Neuroscience (CCBN) in collaboration with CCBN neuroscience researcher Dr. Gerlinde Metz.
Ward said the team came up with the idea to develop the company and the new biomedical device by using the skills they learned through the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) program.
""The internationally competitive program allows undergraduate students to gain hands-on experience in science,"" Ward said. U of L teams have claimed several top international honours at past competitions, and three of the Synbiologica entrepreneurs are off to Boston Massachusetts, toward the end of June as advisors to the U of L's high school iGEM team. The university-level competition takes place in October, 2013 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, MA.
""iGEM is run out of a student-operated lab provided by the department of Chemistry and Biochemistry here at the University of Lethbridge and coordinated by Dr. HJ Wieden. We have been encouraged at every turn by our professors and others to move this idea forward, especially by the people at Alberta Innovates – Technology Futures (AITF) who promote entrepreneurial engagement from scientific innovation.""
Ward cited advisors Dr. Gerlinde Metz (Department of Neuroscience), Dr. HJ Wieden (Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry), Dr. Roy Golsteyn (Department of Biological Sciences) and Michael Kelly (Erin Kelly's father and Manager of Real Estate and Land Development, City of Lethbridge) as being particularly helpful as they refined their idea.

Lux pR Mutation Analysis
>>>>Design
With the hope to find an optimal promotor for our NEON system, we designed 9 mutations on sites -35, -36, -37 near the luxR binding site and tested another on -10 site that TUST 2017 reported to show decreased leakage. We conducted experiments to evaluate these lux pR mutants’ reaction to AHL stimulation and their leakage level. The test devices we designed include a constantly expressed luxR and a lux pR (or mutant) driven sfGFP (like BBa_K2558211 with original lux pR promotor, and BBa_K2558212 with lux pR-HS promotor).

The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace the detecting cell more conveniently. We drilled two holes on the lid of the cell, to insert the pump pipe.
A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in"

When intracellular pH goes up, the alkali-resisting genes NhaA and NhaB can generate Na+/H+ pump which transfers Na+ to the outside in exchange for H+ from the outside. Thus, H+ is able to neutralize OH- inside the cell leading to pH drop. Next, we will demonstrate our construction via taking the pH regulation module as an example.
Figure 6. The gene circuit about glsA acid regulation gene
We establish the following equations based on the gene circle above:
As a step forward, we established the following ordinary differential equations on the basis of Law of Conservation of Mass and Michaelis-Menten equation:
Supposing that the original pH in the external environment is 4, we can get the picture of intracellular H+ concentration change (as shown in picture 1).
Figure 7. The environmental H+ concentration variation tendency.
the figure indicates that the intracellular acid concentration tends to be stable, which clarifies that the acid controller can make microorganism more tolerant in the low pH conditions. Besides, the principles and equations used in alkali controller modeling is similar to those used in acid controller.

THE WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT
Your browser does not support the video tag.
Our team had the opportunity of receiving a tour of the Wastewater Treatment Plant in Lethbridge. This plant was built in the early 1900s and it is a biological nutrient facility, which makes it belong to the top five percent of all the treatment plants in the world. The plant removes phosphorus, nitrogen, ammonia, total suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand (pollution), as well as works to reduces fecal and total coliform. The wastewater treatment plant is licensed under the Alberta Government which ensures that certain rules and obligations must be met. Our team had a tour of the plant led by Duane Guzzi, the Process Coordinator of the wastewater treatment plant. During the tour we learned valuable information that would help us for the success of our project. As our project deals with the extraction of metals from tailings ponds, going to a wastewater treatment plant was beneficial as we learned the procedures and methods they take to remove chemicals from water and make it safe for rivers.
The Wastewater Treatment Plant is licensed under the Alberta Government, which ensures that certain rules and obligations must be met.  During the tour, we learned about the procedures and methods that are taken to remove chemicals from water and make it safe for release. Surprisingly, we discovered a few similarities between our system and the plant’s operations. The plant processes bacteria in order for it to form into flocks and create a netting; then, it sinks to the bottom of the tank and is subsequently able to be removed easily.
Our project is very similar to this process, as we use phages that have inducible precipitation, to allow for easy removal after metal ion capture. This tour also provided us with valuable knowledge on how we can integrate our system into the plant. Mr. Guzzi told us that our project could be integrated into the secondary clarifiers, to remove the metals that are contained within the wastewater. If our project was integrated into the secondary clarifiers, the metals that are contained in the wastewater could be removed before moving on to ultraviolet disinfection, where the microorganisms that are left in the water are disrupted and unable to reproduce and cause harm."

We observed these plants each week for 1-5 weeks post inoculation, and took micrographs using confocal microscopy.
Goal 7: Engineer a circuit to regulate expression as a response to abscisic acid
Plants produce abscisic acid in response to drought conditions, and this molecule leads to a dimerization of two proteins. We aimed to use this interaction to regulate expression of ACC deaminase in bacteria. We did not get to developing this circuit due to time constraints. We hypothesize that this regulation can reduce impacts on normal plant physiology in the absence of drought conditions.
Goal 8: Demonstrate plant growth promotion in a model grass
This was our ultimate project goal, which we may have achieved if plants germinated in the early trials and our transformation techniques were developed earlier. Our plan was to use the inoculation technique in Goal 6, apply stresses to the plants, and measure characters of the plants after a growth period of 8 weeks. This would allow us to measure yield, biomass, and ethylene pathway genes and metabolites. Evidence for plant growth promotion will increment from sterile environment in growth chamber, to non-sterile in growth chamber, to field trials."

Franconia,2017,Team:Franconia#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," the visitors of the school’s Project Day “TraumVision 2017”. Our     team members and students of MTG worked together as a “teaching team” to carry out     the DNA extraction with parents, teachers of other subjects, siblings and other interested     individuals. Not only small inquiries but also bigger problems could be solved by the     teaching teams. Everybody was concentrated and the biological work flow could not be     stopped, whether it would have been due to the heat (it was a very hot summer day) or     due to loud music being played by the school’s marching band in the adjacent     schoolyard. In the end everybody helped to clean up the classroom – all in all: another     very successful Human Practice project and we also got featured on the school’s website
Card Game
Pathologia
As more and more multi-resistant bacteria emerge and the amount of therapeutics rises,                 it is crucial for everyone to better understand human health and how diseases are caused.                 This especially includes knowledge about human pathogens, their effect and how they can be treated.                 To improve education in this field we decided to develop a card game,                 that teaches about the complex system of the human organism and its interaction with pathogens in an entertaining and direct way.                 In the first stages of the development process, we agreed that the game should meet certain demands.
The rules of the game should be easily understandable while still enabling an interesting play process.
The cards should contain an overview of information about the represented pathogen or cure, but no long texts.                         This is because during a game, reading longer texts disrupts the flow of the play.
The information should be easy to grasp and not take long to read.
The rules and concept should provide a basic understanding of the interactions of pathogens and treatments against it.
Keeping these demands in mind, we created the concept and basic card layout. The former is based on the idea that each card should represent something that effects human health.                     Thus, we designed three different types of cards: red cards, that show pathogens, blue cards, that represent a cure or preventative, as well as yellow cards that include special preconditions or events.                     We chose this partitioning, because we think that it best represents the different influences on human health.                     To model the overall health of each human, we decided to base the game on a common “health-currency”, that we called health points.                     To each card we assigned a certain amount of health points, negative or positive, depending on the effect and its power.With this, we designed three different layouts that include all important information on the card,"

Additional Chaperone help to visit Cayetano
Because we traveled at least 1 hour each way (sometimes, depending on traffic, it could be 2 hours) to Cayetano, we needed additional chaperones to go with us when Dr. Markham couldn't make it. Mrs. Diane Holloway and Mrs. Wendy Dierkes graciously assisted.
Transportation
Mr. Chris Mott, our athletics director, and his assistant, Rosana Coronal, arranged for transportation for us to and from Cayetano as well as our travel and accomodations in Boston. This is actually very involved, given the conditions in Lima, Peru.

Nanjing-China,2016,Team:Nanjing-China#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," July 6th, we collected very precious suggestions from the conference in Huazhong University of Science and Technology. First, team Shanghai Tech A is also doing experiments about constructing a photosynthetic system with CdS, but they are using a special species called Moorella Thermoacetica. There are current seven kinds of bacteria that can transmit electrons. Secondly, a team from Taiwan last year has focused on the protein OmpA, but with low efficiency. We don’t meet this difficulty this year fortunately. Third, a teacher from Taiwan was curious about how to transform such a long gene HyaABCDEF into E.coli. Last, A teacher from Taiwan suggested that the experiments should be done under well-controlled conditions. There are possibilities of false positive and false negative results because of the low concentration of hydrogen. The teacher also suggested that we can either change the contents of the media to reduce loss of hydrogen or add a negative pressure to suck out all the hydrogen.
 
 
3. Conferences with five iGEM teams in Zhejiang University
 
In summer, we got the chance to communicate our projects with other five iGEM teams from Zhejiang University, Tsinghua University, Sun Yet-Sen University and Fudan University. Students from other universities are very interested about our project and come up with many doubts and suggestions. One student from ZJU is interested about the formation of CdS precipitation. He also had his explanations about why red fluorescence intensity becomes darker upon silicon encapsulation. Another student from ZJU suggested that if electrons can’t be conducted across the cell membrane of E.coli, we can try to culture shewanella spp. with E.coli to increase electron transduction efficiency because the flagella of shewanella spp. can help to aggregate E.coli.
 
This conference indeed helped us familiarize with our project as well as deepen the friendship between different teams in China.
Brochures
To propagate iGEM and make our human practice easier, we also made a beautiful brochure which contains detailed explanations of the iGEM competition. ( Click here to get the PDF file. )
Collaborations
Apart from collecting information of our own project during the process this year, we also helped many iGEM teams this year. The iGEMers are a group of young people who have passion about synthetic biology and are representatives of the synthetic biology community. Our close collaborations with each other not only helps us know many friends, but assists in propagating our ideas and projects to the science community all over China.

Marvel Megaly
My name is Marvel Megaly. I am a third-year Biomedical Sciences student at Brock University.    I have always been interested in biology during high school but being at Brock has allowed me to narrow down my interests. I am most interested in molecular biology, cell biology, and human physiology.
I got involved in iGEM because I wanted to get more experience in the research field. Because of getting the chance to be on the Brock iGEM team I am now considering pursuing a Masters degree in Molecular Biology or Genetics after next year.
During my free time, I like to volunteer, bike and sketch. I volunteer on campus, helping youth with autism and people with spinal cord injuries improve their motor skills by creating effective exercise plans. I also volunteer with Big Brothers Big Sisters ""Go Girls!"" program as a mentor for young girls.

Overview
    In our system, we have three characters. Warriors attack the enemies, farmers provide nutrients for everybody, while beggars sit there doing nothing.
    To contruct our farmers, we contructed a new part invertase(BBa_K2250000/BBa_K2250001/BBa_K2250003). Our E.coli MG1655  can not utilize sucrose as its nutrients. Invertase catalyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose, thus providing nutrients for all bacteria. See the intervase test for more details.
    To realize the role of the warrior, we utilized a kind of molecule called AHL([N-]acyl-homoserine lactones). There are several kinds of AHLs, which bind to different receptors with different affinity. AHL together with the receptor can bind to specific promoters and activate the corresponding gene. We want to design a gene circuit with orthogonality.In other words, we want the warrior to kill bacteria from the other group but not from its own group. To accomplish this, we did the orthogonality test to select the comparatively best pairs.
    After the construction of our warriors, we tested how the warriors really work. We have two standards to see if the warriors are fitted or not. First, the warrior must have good orthogonality. That is to say, the warrior must kill its enemies but not itself. Second, the killing ability must be neither too strong nor too weak. We carried out the killing test to test our warriors.
    From the killing test, we find that although"

As we can see the phages-bacteria interaction has a cyclic behavior: once the phage reduced the number of bacteria there is an equilibrium phase, but the phages population start to decline due to the phage degradation factor, allowing the bacteria population to rise again.
The rise of the bacteria is not quickly controlled by the phage due to the long latent time. But after a while, the number of phages reaches again the inundation threshold VI and the bacteria population starts to decline again.
10) C. jejuni
Figure 16: Growths in case of strongly phage-resistant bacteria over 24h
Finally we also kept the implementation of the resistant bacteria in our model based on this article[1]. We can see here a case with a strong resistance factor. The number of susceptible bacteria (the one that can be infected by phages) quickly decrease as we have seen before. This allow the phages-resistant bacteria to grow.
However the decrease of the susceptible bacteria population could be enough for a phages therapy: once the total number of bacteria is low enough the immune system of our patient will take over from here and kill the remaining bacteria.
Phages needed for a therapy:
Finally Ruth gave us the idea of computing this 3D figure:
Figure17: 3D phage/bacteria/time link graph
The idea behind this figure is that the doctor wants to know how much phages he has to administer in order to obtain a certain amount of bacteria after a giving time.
From this graph we can actually see pretty easily than the most important factor is the time and not the targeted bacteria population that has to be reached at the targeted time.

With BactWars, we build a biological tool that can target specific genes in multiresistant or pathogenic bacteria, and would kill or deactivate them.
To target specific genes we worked with the CRISPR-Cas9 system. By designing the sgRNA, we can target different genes. At first, we targeted the RFP with Cas9 by electroporating our plasmid.
Figure 1: [left] control producing RFP, [right] Transformed strain
After this experiment we knew our CRISPR-Cas9 system was operational.
For the transfer of genes, we worked with conjugative plasmids (pSW23T and pK18mob).
We tried at first, a conjugation without killing. We transferred our conjugative plasmid pK18mob containing the LacZ gene coding for the beta-galactosidase. So The receiver strain, that produces RFP, will then acquire this gene and will           appear           purple on Xgal media from producing RFP (red) and metabolizing Xgal (blue).
Figure 2: [Red] Receiver strain, [Blue] Donor strain, [purple] Conjugated Receiver strain
We know from now on that our conjugation is working. We can now combine the two tools.
Thus, our next step is to target the RFP gene with our conjugative plasmid containing Cas9.
Cross test 1: [left] overview, [center] close up conjugative donor strain with sgRNA targetting RFP (+), [left] close up conjugative donor strain without sgRNA targetting RFP(-).
We can see that the conjugation line is visible under the microscope and an effective difference between the control, without sgRNA, and the conjugative strain with the sgRNA.
The last step aim at targetting a resistance gene in the receiver strain.

GENE LOSS IN PLASMIDS: CHALLENGING SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
Synthetic biology allows for the manipulation of living organisms in order to generate novel functions. This new field has the potential to revolutionise medical treatments, industrial protocols and potentially how we interact with the planet. Key to synthetic biology is the ability to manipulate the genetic information of the target. In most instances, this involves the addition of genes not normally present, hence producing a novel function. To do this, scientists use a vector (which simply means a method of transferring genetic information from one organism to another), the most common of which is the plasmid.
While the use of plasmids is the standard method of transformation, use of plasmids presents some unique challenges, most important of which is the loss of plasmids over successive generations. This so called gene loss effectively removes the inserted genes removing the synthetic organism's novel function. As we shall discuss, understanding of gene loss presents both challenges and opportunities.
One of the core elements of synthetic biology is applying biological molecules from one environment to another in order to solve a problem. To do this, genetic information must be transferred. Fortunately, bacteria already possess several methods of transferring genetic information from one to aother. By far the most common is the use of plasmids. Plasmids are circular loops of DNA that exist separately from the main bacterial genome; they can replicate independently and be transferred between members of the same and different species. Plasmids commonly contain genes for antibiotic resistance and are the method by which species acquire resistance to multiple antibiotics.
While plasmids provide a mechanism of insertion of specific genes into a given bacteria, they do not represent a single permanent change. Over time, transformed bacteria may lose their plasmid and so their novel function. The result is that over time, the bacteria become less effective. It can be observed that over successive generations of cell division the likihood that both daughter cells receive a plasmid decreases, hence the frequency of the desired genes in the population decreases.
This is the so called gene loss, the inserted genes are effectively lost from the population. The reasons behind this are complex and not completely understood, and while the probability of a single transformed cell division producing plasmid-free daughter cells is very low, the likelihood of such an event is believed to be disproportionately increased by the reduced growth rate of transformed cells. One possible explanation for this is due to the additional genes transformed bacteria are able to carry out more processes. This in turn increases the metabolic burden on the bacteria and so the overall"

- Gel purified both bands which seemed to appear better than previous attempts. Concentrations after purification were still fairly low so chances of successful ligation might be compromised.
- Redid PCR of WT PUF with a temp gradient of 59-63-67-71. Used the supermix.
- Redid colony PCR with a temp gradient of 59-63-67-71 and the colony PCR supermix.
- Inoculated BBa_157005.
- Ran a gel of the WT PUF for pBAD. Only the 2 lanes showed any bands at all - the ladder and the 59 degree lane (had the right band!)
- Redid another gel with more dye, but still saw nothing else.
- Ran a gel of the colony PCR and got all primer dimers.
- PCR cleanup on the successful 59 degree lane for WT PUF, yielded a nanodrop of 63.7 ng/uL.
- Digested the pBAD miniprep and the WT PUF from the PCR.
- Ran a gel of the digestion with high melt gel. Got bands of the right length, but WT PUF was very faint.
- Used procedure for gel extraction, yielded very low nanodrop! Did ligation anyways
- PCR'ed four samples of WT PUF for subcloning into pBAD.
- Ran a gel of the PCR products. Only the 59 and 71 degrees samples worked (63 and 67 didn't).

Background
CRISPR/Cas systems generate site-specific double strand breaks and have recently been used for genome editing.
Aims
Building a genotype sensor based on CRISPR/Cas that reports existance of an antibiotic resistance gene.
Results
Successfully cloned gRNA anti-KAN, crRNA anti-KAN, tracrRNA-Cas9 and pRecA-LacZ into Biobrick backbones and therefore generated four new BioBricks.
Confirmation of site-specific binding and DNA double-strand breaks generated by the gRNA-Cas9 complex in the kanamycin resistance casette.
Testing the new assembly standard for our cloning.
CRISPR anti-Kan plasmids target specifically kanamycin resistant E. coli. We introduced our CRISPR-based DNA cleavage system to two strains of E. coli : one WT (blue bars) and one carrying a genomically integrated kanamycin resistance casette (KanR, blue bars). The strains were co-transformed with two plasmids. One with the Cas9 construct, the other with the anti-Kanamycin gRNA. WT E. coli could be efficiently transformed with one or both plasmids, as determined by selective plating. However, KanR E. coli could not be efficiently transformed with both. We attribute this to Cas9-induced cleavage of the chromosome specifically at the KanR casette, with about 99% efficiency.

Tsinghua-A,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#solid model_-_-_TEXT.html," is created (advancing t by 1), according to some fixed rule (generally, a mathematical function) that determines the new state of each cell in terms of the current state of the cell and the states of the cells in its neighborhood. Typically, the rule for updating the state of cells is the same for each cell and does not change over time, and is applied to the whole grid simultaneously.
    Using the idea of CA, first, we discretize whole space in a medium and total time we take to cultivate cells; second, we set placement rules, i.e. events that will happen after a cell is put onto medium; third, we set iteration rules, i.e. events that will trigger during each iteration in simulation.
III Basic assumptions
    Our solid model has several basic assumptions that are indispensable.
(1) A colony-to-grid representation in a 200×200 mesh grid (one grid represents a cell colony) is good enough to simulate bacterial growth in a real medium. (See Overall Discretization )
(2) The time it takes for AHLs and nutrition to diffuse into surrounding grids and reach concentration balance is very short compared to the time for cells to grow into colonies. (See Placement Rules )
(3) We suppose decomposing rate of AHLs and utilization rate nutrition are constants, and decomposing rate is relatively high compared to growth rate of cells.
IV. Overall discretization
    In the first place we do spatial and time discretization. The whole medium is discretized into a 200×200 mesh grid, and valid space for living is a disk inscribed on it with a radius of 100. Using assumption I, we set each cell colony (abbreviated as ‘cell’ in following sections) into a corresponding grid to represent its presence. In software simulation, we keep three matrices of 200×200 size to record the amount of cells, nutrition and AHLs in each grid, respectively.
    Meanwhile, the whole time we take to cultivate cells is discretized into 1,200 iterations. After each iteration, the number of substances in each grid changes according to certain rules (will be discussed in following sections).
V Placement rules
    When we place a cell onto a corresponding grid, concentrations of substances in adjacent grids also change as a result. We apply assumption II to develop a set of synchronous placement rules:
(1)The event of placing a cell triggers concentration incline in surrounding grids synchronously
(2)Cell’s influence keeps unchanged in subsequent iterations as long as the cell exists.
(3)Removal of a cell has"
Hong_Kong_HKU,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#hp#article#jp_-_-_TEXT.html," ). It is notable that in comparison with China and South Korea, Japan has more private companies participating in synthetic biology research. In fact, one third of the entries for Japan in the SynBio map are private companies. Japan has the largest bio-technology industry and therefore large capability for private companies to be involved in synthetic biology.
Although Japan is a leading Asian nation in synthetic biology, its footprint is relatively small compared to synthetic biology in western countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, with 360 and 50 entries on the SynBio map respectively.
However the SynBio Map may not provide an accurate picture of synthetic biology in Japan since, as mentioned previously, relevant work there is classified under more traditional fields. In the SynBio map webpage, it states that the entries listed are strictly those indicated as synthetic biology work. Many researchers in Japan who do studies that could be seen as synthetic biology have not felt a need to classify their work as such, particularly when it is already classified under another category (Mori & Yoshizawa, 2011).
Participation in the iGEM Competition
Japan is one of the Asian countries that send relatively many universities to participate in the iGEM competition.  12 teams from 11 different Japanese universities participated in the competition (in 2012, Tokyo University had two different teams).  In 2012, out of 51 Asian teams, 11 of them were from Japan.  Also, Japanese universities have shown great achievements in the competition. It can be perceived by the fact that all Japanese universities that participated in 2009 and 2010, managed to get medals (""Synthetic biology based,"" ).
In 2006, Chiba University and Tokyo Institute of Technology are the first two Japanese universities that joined the competition. Tokyo Institute of Technology participated all the subsequent iGEM competitions. They received Gold medals in every year from 2007 until 2012. Chiba University only participated from 2006 to 2010 (""Synthetic biology based,"" ).
The following table summarizes the achievements of the Japanese universities from 2006 to 2012 iGEM competition.

We have sent emails to other teams for further communications and asked for their opions on how we can improve iGame. What is more, all our codes are shared on github [1] (in the right picture). With fixes and new features putting forward every day,any one in any corner of the world can learn and keep update of our work, not just from the surface, but from codes and essense of our work. This is really a great way of communication, for we do not have to say too much to put our achieves across to those who really want to know our work, which really works. Great contributions have been given through github and we get a lot of advices and opinions as well.
Community
To better promote synthesis and the spirit of IGEM, we decided to establish a community together with IGEM USTC team. For the community, we have set regular classes and lectures for both synthesis biology and IGEM. We also open our laboratory to our community members and teach them basic skills of biology experiment(as in the right picture), like PCR. Of course, this is the main field we will update our progress on in the future.

The 434 cI inactivates the λ cI directly, or prevents the translation of the λ cI protein. 434 cI has a higher turnover rate than λ cI. This subpopulation system is based on a natural system for persister cell formation 6 .
Figure 6: Schematic of the subpopulation system. In this system,  AraC inhibits the promoter activity of the subpopulation part. AraC is inhibited by  Arabinose, and when glucose is added to the system Arabinose is inhibited by glucose.  AraC inhibits the constitutive promoter of 434 cI and λ cI, where 434 cI   inhibits the promotion of λ cI. The production of λ cI leads to production of Red   Fluorescence Protein(RFP) as the reporter protein.
As you can see in Figure 6; glucose has a suppressing function on the system, arabinose has an activating function on the system. We used the model to predict what will happen when we add glucose in different amounts. The assumptions we made for the subpopulation system are the following: 434 cI degrades faster than λ cI, cell division happens when the cell size has doubled, and two cell populations exist with one growing differently than another. We tested a number of parameter sets and picked the parameter set that gave the biggest RFP response based on the strength of glucose. To see how the model behaved when we changed the ratios of the initial amounts of λ cI and 434 cI, we investigated the effect of starting conditions on the outcome of the system. The initial conditions were varied between 1 and 10. Within the heatmap you can see in which ratios the initial amounts of λ cI and 434 cI in the system are needed to get high RFP production (here glucose and arabinose have a fixed concentration).
Figure 7. Heatmap of λ cI and 434 cI against RFP production. The right side bar indicates the amount of RFP, where red indicate a high amount and black a low amount.  This heatmap shows you the amount of RFP produced given the balance between the two genes initial conditions.
As seen in Figure 7, when λ cI and 434 cI are present in similar amounts we have a subpopulation system. But if they are present in different amounts there will be no subpopulations. This can be expected when you look at the subpopulation system. The system is inhibited"

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"I to transcription units. 6 transcription units can be assembled using BpiI into level 2 multigene constructs containing a kanamycin resistance and a Cred-dropout. Alternatively Esp3I can be use to transfer the constructs to intermediary levels to reach higher levels for assembly of bigger constructs.
This toolbox is best for constructs up to level 2 plasmids. Higher levels can be reached through intermediary levels but need two restriction enzymes for the assembly. Furthermore it is important to know in which level the current constructs stand to avoid messing up the acceptor plasmids for subsequent levels.
Golden Braid ( Sarrion-Perdigones et al., 2011 )
The Golden Braid system was mainly developed with focus on plants. It picks up the idea of the MoClo system and improves it offering a looping system for reaching higher levels of assembly. Level 0 modules are stored in entry plasmids surrounded by BsaI restriction sites containing an ampicillin resistance and a LacZα dropout. This modules are assembled to transcription units in one of two level α entry plasmids with kanamycin resistance and a LacZα dropout. Here the transcription units are surrounded by BsmBI restriction sites. The transcription units can subsequently be transferred into level Ω entry plasmids with spectinomycin resistance and BsaI restriction sites surrounding the multigene constructs. Every level α plasmid is a precursor of a level Ω plasmid and vise versa. This way the system allows to loop over the plasmids building in theory infinite bigger constructs doubling their size on every round.
This system makes the assembly of higher levels much simpler using only 1 restriction enzyme. Nevertheless the plasmids’ size is just doubled from level to level.
Golden Braid 2.0 ( Sarrion-Perdigones et al., 2013 )
The Golden Braid 2.0 system is an improvement of its prior system. Some minor changes were introduced to make the system simpler and more versatile. The basic modules were defined and classified in 11 classes building optional subclasses e.g. protein tags. The level 0 modules are stored in a universal vector (pUPD) surrounding the sequences with BsaI and BtgZI recognition sites cutting on the same position. The current acceptor plasmids α and Ω have been supplemented by reverse plasmids allowing the inversion of single transcription units.  The fusion sites were simplified by merging unnecessary ones. ‘Superparts’ were introduced consisting of pre-assembled modules to reduce the number of fragments needed for the assembly"

Kenneth: Made the line chart for TRE:eBFP experiment, looks good. Processed data from TRE:mKate experiment. No increase in red, but increase in blue, almost like TRE:eBFP2. Not quite sure what went wrong here. Maybe I aliquoted the wrong DNA, maybe there's some mixup? Either way, has to be redone. Future directions: continue working on the matlab code, process FACS data for co-cultures and AVPR2 testing as well as free Delta (all done Sunday). Experiments planned:  1) Elowitz CHO cells [Initial CHO images - No Fluorescence] (so the cells don't express Delta-mCHerry without dox.) will FACS all of this Wednesday with proper scatter gating for CHO's
a. Dox induction of Delta (get a good curve showing conc of dox to amt of delta on surface
b. Addition of Free Delta to Notch-Gal4 cells and Notch+Delta cells
c. Co-culture with varying dox levels
d. If we see successful dox induction of Delta-mCherry and delta induction of Notch-Gal4/UAS, we can do the 2D ladder experiment where we vary both dox and delta levels for the Notch+Delta CHOs and see how much citrine, thus giving us a ""surface""
2)redo TRE:Delta-mCherry dox ladder
3)TRE:eYFP and TRE:mKate need to be redone, I don't know if Charles wants to do this or not...
4)Immunostaining using no-coverslip technique for pdisplay-vasopressin as well as AVPR2 for troubleshooting

Tsinghua,2011,Team:Tsinghua-A#Modeling#P2A_-_-_TEXT.html," that protein PtetR is controlled by LA2 through Hill Function, we assume that concentration of mRNA is directly related to LA2:
Parameter KM4 is relevant to both KM1 and KM3, however accurate function depicting the relationship is unknown. We estimate the quantity of KM4 by multiplying KM1 and KM3. Noting LA1 and LA2 have already been expressed, we have:
Then we have trouble in expressing protein PluxI and PlasI. Since concentration of protein is the integrals of its mRNA, we assume that it is proportional to concentration of mRNA in a previous time. Thus we have a DDE function:
Equations concerning environmental AHLs remain unchanged.
The original ODEs can be transformed to a much simple DDEs by above deductions.
Parameters
Some of the parameters are derived from original ones, some of them are created to describe the new equations, and others are set for further testing.

General results
We coded the system in MATLAB. The result shows that every signal AHL is oscillating.

Stability analysis
In a nonlinear system, proper value ranges of the parameters are vital for producing a periodic oscillating solution. It’s not difficult to find the nonlinear part in our model, thus, we sought to analyze the sensitivity of Hill parameters and thoroughly reveal the internal relationship between Hill parameters and the system’s robustness. For simplicity, here we denoteKM1/ρ1 , KM4/ρ2 and kTL2,kTL4 by km1,km2and β1, β2 respectively. Without loss of generality, we determined to search the affection to the system’s robustness caused by the fluctuation of binary parameter (km2,β2). After observing distinct oscillation mode (we choose two types of concentration of AHLs in environment as our observed object) and its phase trajectory, we depicted the bifurcation of our system.
Set basic parameters as follows:
ka=0,kb=0,μ=10min-1,γ=2.3min-1,β1=30nm/min,km1=1,n1=n2=2,p=0.2,arab=20,t1=t2=0,τ1=6,τ2=10.
We changed the binary parameter (β2，km2) and got the result below.

Lax-Milgram theorem $\star\star$
We will try to apply the Lax-Milgram theorem in the following paragraph. Readers which are not familiar with the theory of distribution and how to use it in order to solve partial derivative equation (PDE) could consult the notes of N.Burq and P.Gerard Contrôle optimal des équations aux dérivees partielles [Bur ].
As from now, we work in the space of distributions, $\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R^2})$. Morever, we assume that the reader knows that $\mathbb{R}^+*\times\mathbb{R}^+*~\approx~\mathbb{R}^2$ -$\exp$ defines a bijection between $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^+*$- and we will juste write $\mathbb{R}^2$ instead of $(\mathbb{R}^+*)^2)$. To all agree with the notation, we remind (or not) the definition of a Sobolev space. First we define \[ \mathcal{H}^1(\mathbb{R^2})"

Collaborations
Uppsala-Sweden
They sent us a copy of their cph8 part. It served us as negative control in the assays for our red light sensor.  In return, we sent them a paper about the EnvZ/OmpR pathway involved in our redlight sensor.
Freiburg-Germany
We had a very encouraging Skype conference with the Freiburg team. We talked about our lab progress and experience with bacterial light sensors. The main topic were the problems regarding ligation of Biobricks.
Wagening UR
We tested their cloning software. Unfortunatly it didn't work for us :(

When a value is inserted into the DOM from a template, via property, attribute, style, class binding, or interpolation, Angular sanitizes and escapes untrusted values.
About UI
​ In order to match our frontend framework perfectly, we choose Ng-zorro, which is written in TypeScript with complete defined types as our UI framework. The high-quality components and style of Ng-zorro help us complete our design quickly and provides a better experience.                         ​ As a design system for enterprise-class products, Ng-zorro reduces the cost of redundant production through modular solutions based on deterministic and natural design values. With its simple and efficient design concept, NG-zorro allows designers to focus on better User experience.                         ​ Unlike Bootstrap’s 12 grid system, Ng-zorro use 24 grids system, so our web page has more detailed detail processing. Referring to Bootstrap responsive design, Ng-zorro has richer responsive choices to adapt to screens of different sizes.
About Editor
​ Drag and drop function Plugin Sortable is applied to Editor. Sortable is a minimalistic instrument for sorting elements within a list or between lists. Its library doesn’t depend on jQuery or other libraries; it uses native HTML5 Drag and Drop API, and works on both desktop and touch devices. It works on both desktop and touch devices well.

In the last, we will extend our products to the whole China country.
Users in the province of the east of China in our first phase
Further more, in our first phase, we regard the students in the province of the east of China where are in the economic prosperity, as our first target users, Especially the students in Guangzhou, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Anhui , Jiangsu, Hubei, Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Beijing and Tianjin. In these provinces, the amount of high school students are 13,722,000, and nearly half of them are in the city.
Estimation shows that 35.64% of high school students are interested in biology, which means 24,470,000 students would be our target users. And 1% of these them, which means 24,500 students would develop a keen interest in participating the iGEM competition if we do some training promotion.
There are 569,220,000 primary school students and 238,460,000 junior high school students in these provinces. Another rough estimation finds that at least 30% of them, which means 170,770,000 and 71,540,000 primary school and junior high school students would take an interest in life science.

The Cambridge 2009 iGEM team has created two kits of parts that will facilitate the design and construction of biosensors in the the future.
Previous iGEM teams have focused on genetically engineering bacterial biosensors by enabling bacteria to respond to novel inputs, especially biologically significant compounds. There is an unmistakable need to also develop devices that can 1) manipulate input by changing the behaviour of the response of the input-sensitive promoter, and that can 2) report a response using clear, user-friendly outputs. The most popular output is the expression of a fluorescent protein, detectable using fluorescence microscopy. But, what if we could simply see the output with our own eyes?
We successfully characterised a set of transcriptional systems for calibrated output - Sensitivity Tuners .  We also successfully expressed a spectrum of pigments in E. coli, designing a set of Colour Generators .

Short Summary
For the application of our best composite part, we decided to nominate our reporter signal enhancing system BBa_K2201373 .      This part contains a T3 RNA Polymerase with an inverted mRFP under T3 RNA polymerase control for the enhancing of reporter signals. It is an improved reporter and a genetic circuit that could report even weak expression levels. This part was designed based on the model of an amplifier in electrical engineering to intensify an existing input signal and could be used in a broad range of synthetic biology applications. We used this part for our selection system for the incorporation of non-canonical amino acids and demonstrate the advantages of our system in comparison with standard reporter in an integrated modelling and wet lab characterizations.
Usage and Biology
The T3 RNA polymerase is highly specific to T3 promoters and orthogonal to the T7 RNA polymerase. Therefore, it can be widely utilized in synthetic biology, even in expression strains which encode for a T7 RNA polymerase like E. coli BL21. This orthogonality is due to the promoter specifity of the different polymerases (Davis et al., 1971"

This final product that is produced would then be able to be discharged into the environment.
Lastly, the plant focuses on the environment in the procedures they carry out, as wastes such as methane that is produced from the plant will be transported to co-generation motors where it will then provide heat and electricity for the plant. This ensures that the Wastewater Treatment Plant’s energy costs are low.  This inspired us to turn our attention to the potential impacts our project could have on the environment -- how our project could be used to improve the efficiency of metal removal from wastewater, and how this could impact the dependent ecosystem as a result.
INTERVIEWS
Dorothy Lok
We interviewed Dorothy Lok, who is a Municipal Approvals Engineer at Alberta Environment and Parks to explore the possibility of implementing our system into the Lethbridge Wastewater Treatment plant. Upon interviewing her, we learned that though our system is innovative, it would be unnecessary to implement it into the Lethbridge Wastewater Treatment plant as there is not a high concentration of metal ions in the wastewater. She also mentioned that the wastewater treatment plant already uses the metal-laden sludge produced as fertilizers for various crops. However, Dorothy Lok did propose that we should look into applying our system in other wastewater treatment plants of specific cities such as Flint, Michigan or industrial wastewater treatments plants, as these facilities contain a higher concentration of metal ions. In addition, she also suggested that the issue of mining and oil tailings ponds is a problem we could potentially tackle as tailings ponds contain a high concentration of metal ions that are detrimental to the environment. This would be more efficient for our system as the concentration of metal ions would be higher and therefore there would be more metal ions to remove. In terms of our system, Ms Lok told us, “You would really have to have a purpose for doing it [implementing our system in the wastewater treatment process]… whereas with tailings ponds, they need to be dealt with.” As a result of her advice, we pivoted our project goal to focus on the removal of metal ions from mining and oil tailings ponds rather than wastewater treatments plants. The successful implementation of our project could benefit communities locally and globally!
Senior Tailings Engineer for Alberta Energy Regulator
As mentioned, the environmental concern that tailings ponds cause is a crucial issue that many places around the world face, specifically Alberta. While our provincial economy relies heavily on the oil and gas industry, and we are very fortunate"

MEDAL FULFILLMENT
METHODOLOGY
 Our team applied a user-centered design process (UCD) when developing BacPack for New Frontiers.  This procedure focuses on the user's’ needs and ultimately creating the most intuitive and user-friendly product.  After researching users’ pre-existing knowledge and intuitive behaviors, we edit product designs accordingly to make our software more intuitive and accessible, rather than requiring users to conform to an unfamiliar format.  At the end of each new iteration, our team conducts user studies to ensure we are building the most effective and user-friendly product.  Following, we describe prior research we conducted on designing museum exhibits, four major prototypes, the user feedback we received on their design, and the changes we made to better fit users’ goals.
 Following, we describe prior research we conducted on designing museum exhibits, four major prototypes, the user feedback we received on its design, and the changes we made to better fit users’ goals.
 To ensure that our museum exhibit could be user-friendly and educational, we consulted other researchers exploring the design and use of interactive technology to create innovative learning experiences, such as Mike Horn, director of Northwestern’s TIDAL Lab, and Stephanie Houde, principal designer of Houde Interaction Design.  We drew design concepts from TIDAL’s DeepTree exhibit, a multi-touch tabletop interface that allows users to explore an interactive visualization of the Tree of Life, as well as their multiplayer exhibit Fishing with Friends, where visitors play in a simulated fishing environment to learn about overfishing. We were also inspired by the focus of creature creation from The Boston Museum of Science’s Virtual Fishtank exhibit, which allows visitors to create and deploy personally engineered creations into a communal environment to see how different combinations of traits in fish interacted with one another.
 In addition to visiting current museum exhibits, We also studied literature including Humphrey’s Fostering Active Prolonged Engagement, papers by Alissa N. Antle, and research paper “Designing Visible Engineering: Supporting Tinkering Performances in Museums”.  We received additional advice from our instructors Romie Littrell and Anja Scholze, both museum curators and exhibit developers. Our team also consulted synthetic biologists such as Natalie Kuldell, founder of BioBuilder,"

Laurens ter Haar and Marjolein Crooijmans
Laurens and Marjolein were concerned with enhancing our system so we could obtain a clear read-out. To this end they used T7.
Furthermore, we want to thank exchange student Paula Regal Alonso for creating our constitutively expressed chromoprotein strains.
In addition we would like thank Julia Mullink, Nienke van Noort, Mike Johnson en Jo-Anne Verschoor for their contribution in the demonstration of our system.
Fundraising and Finances
Tim de Jong and Jazzy de Waard functioned as our Fundraising team and were mainly responsible for approaching sponsors and managing our crowdfunding campaign. Our treasurer Maaike de Jong safeguarded our finances and managed our budget with         occasional help from Charlotte de Ceuninck van Capelle.
Design
Our secretary and design manager Daphne van den Homberg designed all of our promotion materials, including flyers, banners, postcards et cetera with help from Laurens ter Haar and Chiel van Amstel.
Collaborations
Carli Koster was responsible for the countless collaborations that we did with teams from all around the world, such as the postcards from team Düsseldorf, the Instagram Challenge for July and Moves Like iGEM amongst others. Charlotte de         Ceuninck van Capelle managed the collaboration between Leiden and Rotterdam HR as well as the Dutch Meet-Up and BBQ.
Programming and Statistics
All of our wiki programming and statistics were performed by Chiel van Amstel. Mathematical modelling was done by Jazzy de Waard, with help from Chiel van Amstel who visualised the results for the wiki.
Outreach and Social Media
Our PR team, Carli Koster and Marijke Grundeken, managed all of our social media accounts and our monthly newsletter, while Mees Fox arranged for us to be present at local events to give workshops and talks about our project.
InterLab
Charlotte de Ceuninck van Capelle arranged for iGEM Leiden to be able to use the transformed InterLab strains from team Delft. All InterLab experiments were performed by Chiel van Amstel and Jazzy de Waard.
Lab Safety
Naturally, all of our team members took lab safety extremely seriously. However, Germaine Aalderink was responsible for arranging the GMO course everyone needed to complete in order to work in the ML-1"

3-2-3 The DNS assay of medium.
We checked the influence of each medium to the DNS assay. Figure 4 shows the background absorbance of each medium. The absorbance of M9 was 1.7±0.1, SOC was1.227±0.007, and Plusgrow Ⅱ was 0.17±0.02.
The data of Plusgrow Ⅱ supports the fact that little reducing sugar is contained in this medium.
Fig.4: The influence of each medium to the DNS assay. Each medium was diluted 25 fold with water. Data points and error bars correspond to the mean and the standard deviation of three time experiments.
4. Discussion
Plusgrow Ⅱ should be suit for the DNS assay in the first three hours.
From three experiments: 3-2-1, 2, and 3, Plusgrow Ⅱ is good for characterizing the chitinase activity using the DNS assay in the first three hours. Firstly, cell number didn't increase so much in the first three hours. So, we can perform the chitinase assay that based on the premise that the enzyme concentration is nearly constant. Secondly, since E.coli can grow in the supernatant without having the influence to the result of DNS assay, the residual E.coli doesn't consume reducing sugar, and N-acetylglucosamine will be assayed quantitatively by DNS.
5.Achievment
We aimed at creating prefect chitinase constraction. However, We don't get this because of time shortage.
Finally, we could creat following constraction.
Moreover, We succesed modeling of chitinase activity. Modeling

Characterization of Switch Brick Results
Aim and Methods:
Please refer to August 21st .
Results:
The samples that had been growing for 12 hours were put under the microscope.
No xylose: All L-forms
0.2 xylose: Most L-forms but a few rod cells
0.4 xylose: Few L-forms more rod cells
0.8 xylose: All rod cells
From this result, we can tell that our switch brick works as expected. When xylose is not present, almost all cells are L-forms. When more xylose is present, more rod cells survive.

Cornell,2013,Team:Cornell#project#safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"  These are all Biosafety Level 1 organisms and are therefore safe to work with within our existing lab space; however, these all require special precautions. Fungi, for instance, can release spores that can be irritating to eyes, skin and lungs, and damaging if inhaled or ingested in significant quantities.
Novel Coding Regions
None of our novel coding regions pose a threat to researcher safety; however, genes such as those for chitinase and antifungal selection markers could be harmful if released into the environment. We must therefore use care to ensure that our engineered organisms do not escape the confines of our lab space.
Safety Protocol
Wet Lab
In the lab all members wear nitrile gloves, closed-toed shoes, and use eye protection when working with volatile chemicals or using UV light. Members typically work in groups of 2-3 so as to be aware of each other’s safety and the work at hand. If using a new piece of equipment, a team member must be supervised by either the faculty lab manager or, in her absence, an experienced team member.
There are taped-off areas for work with carcinogenic substances (particularly ethidium bromide) as well as fungal specimens. When working with fungi that could potentially release harmful spores, team members must work in a designated area and wear masks and eye protection. The delineated and surrounding areas are cleaned with ethanol and/or bleach prior to and immediately following each use, and if these substances must come into contact with a non-designated area, it is cleaned thoroughly to ensure that no residue remains.
All disposables that come into contact with biological materials, including but not limited to: pipet tips, syringes, filters, membranes, Petri dishes, microcentrifuge tubes, culture tubes, and gloves, are disposed of in the biohazard waste. There are also specialized waste containers for glass and sharps accessible in the lab space. Though we are not working with any highly toxic substances this year, we have protocols in place for using and collecting waste from hazardous chemical and/or biological substances in a manner approved by Cornell EHS.
We maintain two copies of MSDS for every chemical stock that we maintain in our lab: one for our own reference and the other for the lab manager and users of the lab space who are not team members. There is a chemicals hood available for use with any chemicals that may produce harmful fumes, i.e. acids and organics. The lab is also equipped with flame-retardant benches, spill kits, safety showers, eyewashes, fire extinguishers, and clearly marked"

Discussion
The expression of mRFP in Scheme B suggest that the OmpC in BBa_K081024 was somehow activated. Further work was conducted to figure out why the OmpC seemed to present a function of a continuous promoter. After blasting the sequence of Cph1 at NIBC ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ), we discovered that the BL21(DE3) strain has endogenous EnvZ, which is the key part of Cph1that can phosphorylate the OmpR and cause the activation of OmpC followed by the expression of downstream genes, BBa_I13507. Hence, once the strain has endogenous EnvZ, BBa_K081024 & BBa_I13507, also known as BBa_S05054 expresses mRFP without Cph8 not to mention the regulation of red light.
Now it is confirmed that as long as equipped with a promoter,RBS and BBa_I15008, the OmpC promoter in BBa_S05054 can work normally in a endogenous-EnvZ-free system. Besides, BBa_S05054 can also be utilized to test the exisitence of endogenous EnvZ.
BLUE LIGHT
Blue light system is much simple compared with red light system, since it involves just one kit, BBa_K238013. It eventually failed in the procedures of combination with other part of our project.
Toggle switch
The toggle switch part of experiment is not very successful.
We have constructed the lac-cI part of the toggle switch, but the pcI-lacI part is failed. The most problem happened around the cI promoter, R0051, which is only 49bp in length. After the failure of several transformation and depletion of the distributed kit, we try to PCR this part out from K091230, a cI promoted mRFP reporter.
Though the PCR works well and we actually get the target fragment, we failed to perform follow experiment because we cannot extract DNA from the enzyme digestion product since the 49bp size is beyond the ability of our Gel Extraction Kit.
After that, we tried to add some nonsense sequence before K091230, and PCR the sequence and R0051 out, but finally did not make it before the deadline.
