ICA for 9-mer Again
We decided to try ICA for 9-mer again, with modification of using more terminator.
Use 1 ul of 5 uM terminator, rather than 1 uL of 50 nM terminator (100-fold increase)
Also increased volume of washes from 50 uL to 100 uL.
Incubation times for ligation steps were reduced to 5 minutes.
Performed ICA using 50 ng of each DNA species, and 1 uL of 5 uM of the relevant cap.
Eluted in 15 uL of 0.01% Tween-20.

Gifu,2017,Team:Gifu#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,". Yeast is fundamentally able to utilize a variety of carbon source such as glycerol. However, under the condition of presence of glucose, yeast only uses glucose as its energy. This phenomenon is coordinated by several signaling and metabolic interactions that is controlled by glucose.
GAR stands for glucose associated repression. GAR prion regulates usage of glucose in yeast. Basically the conformation of the prion is [gar-]. Adding the certain amount of lactic acid to media of yeast, the conformation is changed into [GAR+]. GAR+ prion effects on signal transmission in yeast and expression of enzymes or protein related to glucose utilization is repressed strongly. This mechanism was confirmed by the growth test of GLY+GluN media in this research . As the cause of controlling catabolite repression is one kind of prions, this state is heritable to next generation. Technically, one of the common metabolite, lactic acid, plays a role of signal and may make it possible to conduct cross-kingdom communication.
Gap-repair cloning for biobricks users
What is GRC?
GRC or gap-repair cloning was invented by this research.
Utilizing homologous recombination, the process of transformation of yeast can be simplified and easy to conduct. The picture below shows a brief explanation of how to perform GRC. One of the reasons why not so many teams choose yeast in their projects is that it takes much longer time to conduct transformation of yeast. In this competition, all teams must construct plasmids which include pSB1C3 backbone. However since this backbone does not contain replication origin and selectable marker gene, users who would like to utilize yeast must make at least two plasmids, one of pSB1C3 and one of a shuttle vector. In addition, all teams use the same method of transformation. We thought prefix and suffix can be homologous  recombination regions. GRC may overcome this big problem and be a revolutionary solution for all iGEM teams. To develop this technology and adjust to biobricks, we decided to conduct the research of this technique.

What is “Terminatome”?
Terminatome is a new concept suggested by A Genome-Wide Activity Assessment of Terminator Regions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Provides a “Terminatome” This breakthrough system will clearly develop synthetic biology. According to the article, terminators of yeast change the amount of expressed protein. It is mentioned that Terminator region activities relative to that of the PGK1 standard terminator ranged from 0.036"

The extraction of rubber from Hevea brasiliensis
The primary source of natural rubber is the tree Hevea brasiliensis with approximately 11.3 million tons of natural rubber produced worldwide in 2012 - and the amount is increasing. Though increasing ease of modern world gene technology has given rise to high-yielding Nigerian clones, the production still requires vast amounts of plantations. Source: K.O. Omokhafe & J.E. Alika: Clonal stability of latex yield in eleven clones of Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg. Gen Mol Biol 2003, 26:313-317. (Link) and the International Rubber Study Group IRSG (Link)
These plantations need areas of distinct climate conditions. Furthermore, the tree is slow-growing and incapable of producing rubber in its first 7 years, making it difficult to establish new plantations. Source: Tanaka, Y., & J. T. Sakdapipanich. 2001.

Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," where both questions have the same answer
The line y=x corresponds to people who provided the same answer to both questions. People who understand more about synthetic biology than GMOs lie above the line; people who understand more about GMOs than synthetic biology lie below the line. Most people appeared to have an equal understanding of synthetic biology and GMOs. However, there are more people clustered under the line rather than over the line, indicating that people tend to have a better grasp of GMO than synthetic biology. While a few people answered that they had never heard of synthetic biology, no one answered that they had never heard of GMOs. This is likely due to the media attention placed on GMOs. When we tested for regression, we found that the difference in response was statistically significant (p = 3E-53), indicating that people had different understandings of the terms synthetic biology and GMO.
With all the adverse attention focused on GMOs, we also wanted to know if that affected people’s perceptions. We asked people about their thoughts on the impact of synthetic biology and the impact of GMOs.
Figure 5: Comparison of people’s answers to the questions “how do you feel about the impact of synthetic biology?”versus “how do you feel about the impact of GMOs?” on a scale from -2 to 3. -2 is highly negative, 0 is neutral, 2 is highly positive and 3 is unsure. Sizes of the points correspond to the number of people and the line y=x shows where both questions have the same answer
Points on the line y=x show indicate people who felt similarly about synthetic biology and GMOs. Above the line is people who felt that GMOs have a more positive impact. Below the line is people who felt that GMOs have a more negative impact compared to synthetic biology. There are a significant number of people who feel the same way about both, but we can see that there are far more people below the line than above the line. This demonstrates to us that people feel more negatively about the GMOs compared to synthetic biology (p = 2E-17). This confirmed our hypothesis, that society has twisted our views of GMOs as unacceptable, but hasn’t said anything about synthetic biology.
External Factors On Survey Responses
We analyzed whether external factors impacted a person’s answer. We considered many variables, but here we highlight the results for education level and political affiliations.

USTC-China,2014,Team:USTC-China#modeling#modeling#cellular_-_-_TEXT.html," describes a novel regulatory mechanism by which the C.c. bacterium integrates cell cycle and nutritional signals to control development of an adhesive envelop structure known as holdfast.
They discovered a novel inhibitor of holdfast development. HfiA, that is regulated downstream of lovK-lovR. They also discovered a bio-synthesis related gene named HfsJ. And the suppressing mutations in HfsJ attenuate the HfsJ-HfiA interaction.
These results support a model in which HfiA inhibits holdfast development via direct interaction with an enzyme required for holdfast biosynthesis
In conclusion, author says: We demonstrate that the predicted glycosyltransferase, HfsJ, is a required component of the holdfast development machinery and that residues at the C-terminus of HsfJ mediate a direct interaction with HfiA, leading to a post-translational inhibition of HfsJ.
The binding affinity and cellular concentrations of HfiA and HfsJ are tuned such that this regulatory system is responsive to small changes rather than robust to large changes. This prediction is consistent with a highly responsive and sensitive regulatory system.
So the block is clear. Upstream promoter Expression Rate $\rightarrow$ HfiA $\rightarrow$ HfsJ $\rightarrow$ Catalyzing Rate

REC – CHENNAI
Team REC_CHENNAI is a debut team in iGEM and it is for this reason that we decided to mentor them. From helping them design their gBlocks to troubleshooting experimental problems, we guided them in all possible ways by informing them about the intricacies of iGEM.In addition, we also collaborated with them and conducted the Biofair as part of our Human Practices. We also built a quorum sensing coupled temperature sensitive system for the contolled release of their anti-microbial peptide. We also provided them BL-21 and DHP-alpha strain.
UCL
Since neither of the teams had any prior experience in mathematical modelling, Team UCL and Team SVCE_CHENNAI regularly collaborated and sent each other useful resources on how to model biological pathways and reactions.
Once we started forming the reaction pathway, we exchanged our differential equations and parameter values. Then each team provided valuable feedback to the other as to how we could better our respective models while at the same time making the information that we provide easy for anyone to understand.
LUND
LUND played a key role in forming the reactions and differential equations for our mathematical model, as we were new to modeling and hence required help. They also made sure to guide us every step of the way during our whole modeling process and to check for any corrections while helping us to formulate our final model.
Nawi_GRAZ
Both the teams, NAWI_GRAZ and SVCE_CHENNAI  were working on pH as well as temperature regulatory systems, which provided an  avenue for collaboration. Since we had some issues with changing pH in our medium, NAWI_GRAZ team helped us out by giving us some useful suggestions. In-turn, they seeked our help in solving the precipitation issues that they had faced while preparing the M9 media. In addition to this, we also decided to test each others pH parts and compare the results obtained.

On another hand, he mentioned how there are no young people able to continue with the job of the current farmers, and this is an alarming situation that requires a prompt resolution.
Mr. Ramírez gave us a lot of priceless information that was essential for the development of our whole project. He was the first to comment us about the beekeeping congress that would take place in the city of Delicias in the coming months, and which we would have the great  privilege to attend, he told us that by means of the different sites where he frequently researches information he had noticed another iGEM team that was working with bees, for the month of September we could establish a collaboration with this team ( consult collaborations for more information ) and on this same point of the media, Mr. Ramírez explained to us how he always tried to receive literature to focus and inform himself, he mentioned the magazine “Bee Culture”, where we successfully managed to make a publication about our project and synthetic biology regarding beekeeping ( consult public engagement for more information ).
He also shared with us the contacts of highly recommended specialists with whom we could consult about our product and with which we would have contact later: Juan Diego Pérez de la Rosa, Efraín Rocha, Felipe Esquivel Díaz.
We were able to share a new perspective on beekeeping in relation to synthetic biology with Mr. Ramírez by explaining him our project, the beekeeper mentioned how he was more than willing to help us, and he even shared some honey and bee bread with us! This meeting was an invaluable experience for us!

Meeting with Engineer Alejandro Bianchi
Engineer Alejandro Bianchi studied Agronomy at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education and has been dedicated to beekeeping since 30 years ago. Currently, he has a company called Kolmena Yothë that offers bee products for health and beauty purposes, his company also provides apitherapy treatments, complementing them with Bach flowers, Schuessler salts and homeopathy.

Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.
Run the electrophoresis under 120V.
fter 15-20 min, put the gel in an UV detector and record the picture.
The 50% glycerin should be autoclaved before use.
Mix 600µl bacteria solution with 600µl 50% glycerin separately in two 1.5mL tubes.
Seal the tubes with parafilm.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Merging Model_-_-_TEXT.html," metal electrodes (Fig.1 A). One of the droplet population is being produced on a chip (Fig.1 B) and at the same time, the other is being reinjected in a form of emulsion (Fig.1 C). The droplets in emulsion are being “ spaced ” by using additional oil flow. Tuning the flow rates of the two droplet populations allow us to have the produced-reinjected droplet ratio 1:1. When the two droplets reach the electrodes in a chip (Fig.1 D), an electric field forces them to coalesce into a single one. The droplet coalescence is a result of the drain of spacing oil between them. This comes from the combined effects of viscous forces and the oil draining created by an electric field.
Our model presented here relies on a balance of energy. The energy terms are those for the kinetic energy and the energy dissipated as a result of viscous forces . In the next sections we explicitly present each of the terms, which are making an impact to the energy balance.
1. Determining the drainage rate
In this section we derive the approximate relation for drainage of oil separating two droplets before their coalescence. We use the relation for pressure difference \(\varDelta p\) the one as used by Barman et al.
(1)
Here \(\gamma_{WO}\) is the interfacial tension of oil-water interface. As we will find later, it is changed by adsorption of surfactant molecules. Notice that all voltages applied for the energy terms rely on voltage created at the electrode tip \(U_{tip}\)  and not purely on applied voltage \(U_{app}\).
The action of electric field also changes the interfacial tension through a change in contact angle . Authors postulate the differential equation for oil-film drainage rate \(dT/dt\):
(2)
Integrating the differential equation (2)
We integrate this differential equation by using the mathematical methods of partial integration and guessing of coefficients.
The equation (2) is rewritten in the following form:
(A)
We mark the multiplicative factors of \(T\) as \(a, b\). Then split the right side into “possible” terms with unknown multiplicative factors:
(B)
We solve the system pf algebraic equations to find the coefficients A, B, C. These are found to be \(A=1/ab\), \(B=-1/b\), \(C=-1/a\). The explicit solution for the integral is the following:

Is it possible to program a gene in a computer?
What computers are best at is making calculations in a speed that a human isn’t able to reach. We cannot program the gene directly, but we can find an equation (or a set of them) that describes its behaviour accurately depending on the environmental conditions. No matter how complex these equations are, the computer is capable of solving them, giving as a result the reaction of the gene to different variables.
Can we reproduce the intelligence of an animal in a computer?
For us, this is a question that leads to the field of philosophy. Then, it’s almost impossible to give a definite answer to this question. We’d rather provide with some webs where we can find out about this topic, leading to the formation of our own opinion:
Artificial intelligence
Turing test
Chinese room
Is there a limit in the amount of genes you can introduce into an organism?
Theoretically, there isn’t any limit to this procedure. However, there are technical limitations to the amount of DNA we can use to have a successful transformation. Depending on the method we use, we can insert a certain size of DNA in the host genome.
Has every gene a different effect when inserted in the bacterial genome?
All genes inserted in a foreign genome have effects on the physiology of the host, but these changes may not be always noticeable. To mark mutants we use genes with effects that are easily measured and with well-known effects in the host life-cycle.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Modeling#Population_-_-_TEXT.html," visualise the output of our simulation in a three dimensional environment.
Below is a basic visualisation of one of the early versions of our simulation, where the different states of the bacterial cells are represented by differing colours. This early graphic was produced by feeding the output of our population simulations into another program which we have developed in Java, using the Java3D technology.
In this animation, a population of cells is seen to proliferate in three dimensions from a single cell. Vegetative cells are represented by white spheres. There is cadmium in the environment (not shown), and also sufficient food to allow proliferation. Cells can make choices either to grow and proliferate, or to sporulate due to the cadmium. If cells choose to sporulate, they make a further choice whether or not to sequester cadmium. Since there is sufficient food in the environment, ordinary spores (represented in black) germinate immediately after sporulation. Spores that cannot germinate because they have sequestered cadmium are shown as red spheres. Germinating spores (that have previously been non-sequestering spores) are shown in green.
Also below is an image of the more sophisticated graphical output which we have been producing. The Graphics package Autodesk 3ds Max has been used in the production of these graphics.
Further work
The current version of the model provides the basis of a bacterial population simulator, which can be improved and adapted for use by other people and projects in the future. Currently parts of the model are highly focused on our project, but it can easily be generalised. We have developed a framework for integrating agent based and biochemical models on a distributed grid system. The way in which the bacterial threads run in the program makes it very easy to customise and improve the behaviour of the bacteria throughout their simulated life cycles.

I think this paper is hilarious. ""...microprocessors and other electronic systems are not built directly from chunks of metal and silicon lying about the countryside.""  He alludes to the standardization of a cellular ""chassis"" when he talks about the different groups using different strains of ecoli to develop different devices (p450, right column).  Do you think it makes more sense to use a standard strain or to more clearly define the differences between strains or even different organisms.  For example, wouldn't it be nice if work on e. coli could be reliably translated for use in T. fusca? - chris 02:17, 4 June 2009 (UTC)
The promise and perils of synthetic biology by J. Tucker and R. Zilinskas
What are some of the major risks associated with synthetic biology research projects? - GMcArthurIV 00:08, 4 June 2009 (UTC)
The risks range from accidental to deliberate and include accidental release, testing in an open environment, and the deliberate misuse of the technology.  Self-regulation seems to be the best avenue to address these risks early before any unforeseen mishaps. - Albergca 15:04, 5 June 2009 (UTC)
Anyone with a decent knowledge of genomic engineering and access to University equipment and literature could easily turn into a crazed bio-terrorist. It's not too difficult to isolate something like MRSA and just grow massive vats of it, putting it into spray bottles and hosing down public transport and other high-volume/distance transmission venues. Not that I've ever thought of that. - Jalvin 16:45, 5 June 2009 (UTC)
Refinement and standardization of synthetic biological parts and devices
What does it mean to refine a biological part? - GMcArthurIV 11:28, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
In the context of this article, refinement of a biological part refers to establishing a widely accessible, standardized library of data regarding a biological part or device.  This data informs engineers how the device will interact with the cell once it is transformed.  The device must consistently perform as expected in the standard conditions and cannot be majorly effected by differing variables from situation to situation.  A refined device is analogous to the engine in a car.  If we take that engine out of one car and move it to another than the power output and fuel consumption of the engine will be about the same.  Also, if we change another part of the car, such as the steering wheel"

This technology, similar to Microtox®, encounters the same reliability concerns.
Currently, the Microtox® technology is available in continuous monitoring, portable, and laboratory based systems. IP for all 3 systems is centralized in a UK based company, Modern Water. The other major biosensor technology, ToxTrak, is owned by Hach. This company is in turn owned by Danaher.
Figure 8: Modern Water corporate structure.  The company has acquired several companies which have produced general toxin sensing and water analysis technologies which are competitors in our market space.
Modern Water acquiring these companies has suggested that the ability to detect general toxins in this and other markets is of high value and profit, particularly due to the amount that these companies were acquired for.  Danaher acquired Hach for $355 million which had produced $137 million in revenue in 2012.  Importantly, this suggests there is a global market for our technology.
Conclusions
From our market analysis we have identified an opportunity for our technology to be developed within the context of the oil and gas environmental monitoring program. With significant increases in mandated monitoring by 2015, there is a distinct need for more rapid and portable toxin sensing technology, which will fit into the suite of existing monitoring methods. Our technology can be applied to over 50% of the regulatory sites of which the government has determined to be key regulatory areas. This market has shown to be very profitable, and is expected to rapidly grow and expand in the next five years. Other competitors exist in this market, primarily under the technology MicroTox® which has been largely acquired by Modern Water, however we provide distinct advantages over these current systems.
Marketing Plan
Customers - How Do We Sell To Them?
An important identification in our marketing plan is who the key individuals would be that would buy our product. As we are addressing a clear need in the monitoring market, our customers are those who would most value and profit from new monitoring methods to detect toxins. This will be within the complex relationship between oil sands companies and their contracted service companies. Large oil sands companies must assess a need for this type of toxin monitoring to encourage service companies to adopt this type of technology. Because of the prevalence of competitive products that already exist in the market, there is a clear push for systems which report the overall toxicity of a sample. Service companies must see clear advantages in using our product over presently utilized competing technology, both financially and analytically."

It is my first time to participate in iGEM as a practitioner. My duty is working on Human Practices by communicating with cooperators and other iGEM teams, conducting investigations online, and organizing regular community-based scientific activities with my teammates. Social work may spend much time for graduated students, but it gives more opportunities to get out of laboratory to contact different people, listening to their needs. This will help us to design better productions to improve their life. I believe iGEM will be a fantastic experience for me to receive precious friendship and social responsibility.

Measurement of Gene Expression：
We used RT-PCR to see whether expression of the PDE5A gene was suppressed by our shRNA devices.
Fig.11 PED5a transcription level after transfection with three different shRNA
The results showed that the expression of PDE5A was silenced by all three shRNA devices.
Measurment of cGMP level:
Fig.12 cGMP concentration after treated with three different shRNA
When we measured cellular cGMP levels, shRNA3 showed better potential. Therefore, we chose shRNA3 as our best PDE5A silencing device for further study (part number: BBa_K1720005 ).
4.sGC and shRNA cotransfection
Measurment of cGMP level:
In the next step, sGC Overexpressing and PDE5A Silencing Devices were co-transfected into HEK293 cells. Again, we used Elisa kits to detect the sGC activity and cellular cGMP levels. Whereas either device functioned well by themselves, a synergetic effect between the sGC overexpressing device and the PDE5A silencing device was also observed!

Or another example, representatives from agrochemical companies, who travel all year visiting farms, can also carry the disease. So people, tools, machinery…can all transport the disease, and delaying the arrival depends on preventive measures.""
How do you think the public and farmers would react to the use of genetically modified bacteria in the soil? Would they prefer it to a GM banana?
""Especially in European countries it could cause some unrest. With regards to using a GM banana, I understand that the risk of contamination is lower than with other plants, but you would end up with one or two cultivars and you would have the same situation again. You develop a new cultivar that is resistant to TR4, and then in 20 years TR5 appears and attacks the new cultivar. I have my doubts in such a path of research, and you can’t bet here on just one horse: we are talking here about the livelihoods of millions of people. We should think instead of, for example, bringing more biodiversity to plantations.""
Do you see any problems our synthetic bacteria could bring?
""Well, you should be aware that perhaps this research does not lead to anything. I know of some research carried out in Latin America. It took them years to isolate combinations of microorganisms that could control Race 1, and when they inoculated them in the soil the results were not really conclusive. Some plants got sick and recovered, others didn’t… This is a very complex matter.""
How do you see our project with respect to other approaches?
""I think it could be promising. Anything should be tried out. The approach to fight the disease with microorganisms is not new and has failed before, but in this specific case it might work. I also think it is very encouraging to have a multidisciplinary approach, we need the knowledge of several disciplines, and that a group of young people are interested in the topic.""

What's more, she studies the epidemiology and agro-ecology of Fusarium oxysporum With her background and expertise, knowing her opinion was a must.
The Philippines is one of the hardest hit countries by Panama disease. How would you describe the situation? What kind of losses does it cause?

We designed a framework which can be easily expanded to a lot of different inputs/ouputs. We hope this standardized approach will increase our capacity to manipulate information and/or exchange it between bacteria. This can be used in any engineered biological process requiring transformation or a system of information transfer, including medical applications and bio-remediation.
We did our best to standardize:
the increase of vesicle production;
the system to address proteins to these vesicles;
their fusion with target bacteria.
You can find detailed information in our OMV Project  description or in our different parts.
By analogy to the Internet Protocol, we called our process a Bacterial Protocol. We found that the title Message in a bubble described it quite nicely. In a simple way, the comprehension of vesicles process sounds like a build of a bacteria language.
For more information on how we came up with this idea, please have a look at our brainstorming area .

Chloramphenicol resistance marker excision
The marker excision was performed on two of the previously validated integrant strains: MC-RFP-A and MG-RFP-A (even if they were multiple tandem integrants).
The marker excision protocol was performed as described in the Materials and Methods section for both strains, here named:
Original name
Name after marker excision
MC-RFP
MC-RFPflip
MG-RFP
MG-RFPflip
Three colonies grown after the overnight incubation at 43°C (step 4 of marker excision protocol) were analyzed for each plate. These 6 clones were called MC-RFPflip-A,B,C and MG-FRPflip-A,B,C.
Validation of the loss of pCP20 and the resistance marker: all the 6 picked colonies failed to grow on both Amp (100 ug/ml) media and Cm (12.5 ug/ml) media. They could only grow in LB without antibiotics, thus validating that the pCP20 helper had been actually cured and the R6K-CmR DNA containing the Chloramphenicol selection marker had been actually eliminated.
Validation of the length of the integrated part: colony PCR was performed for all the 6 clones, using MC1061 and MG1655 without integrants as negative controls. Primer pairs VF2/VR and P1/P4 were used to validate if the passenger of interest was still present in the genome and the length of the entire Phi80 locus respectively after the marker excision.
Figure 6: colony PCR with VF2/VR on all the 6 flipped clones. The blank is the reaction mix without bacteria. Expected amplicon for correct insert: 1.2 Kb.
Figure 7: colony PCR with P1/P4 on all the 6 flipped clones. The blank is the reaction mix without bacteria. Expected amplicon for correct construct in the correct position: 2.3 Kb. Expected amplicon for the non-integrant strain MG1655: 546 bp.
PCR results with primers VF2/VR showed that all the 6 clones still contain the passenger of interest, i.e. PconRFP, in the genome after the marker excision. The reaction blank, the MG1655 strain (neg control) and also the other samples showed some extra bands, but the ~1.2Kb amplicons of MC-RFP-A,B,C and MG-RFP-A,B,C had the correct length and was much brighter than"

${K_d}$ is the value which corresponds with the amount of repressor or activator necessary to repress or activate half of the promoters. Since our copynumber is 200, we multiply the Hill constant with 200 because this higher value seems more logical to us.
Leakiness
A last important value in transcription is the leakiness of the promoter. A shutdown promoter still has a very small transcription which is called the leakiness of the promoter. This value should be as low as possible, because there should be a big difference between ON and OFF promoters. The effect of leakiness of promoters is something that should be checked.
iGEM 2012 Upssala measured the leakiness of the pLuxPR promoter. Without AHL and LuxR, the pLuxPR was active and had a RPU of 10. This means that the leaking promoter has a PoPS of $\frac{10}{390} {\cdot} 0.040 {\cdot} 0.03 = 3.077 {\cdot} 10^{-5} PoPS$. We can use this value to estimate the leakiness of the other promoters.
3.2 Translation
The next step in gene expression is the translation of the synthesized mRNA to a protein. This involves the binding of a ribosome complex to the RBS site of the mRNA, elongation and termination. The initiation step is the rate-limiting step of the three. The translation rate is thus tied to the thermodynamics of RBS-ribosome interaction but other sequences (5’-UTR, Shine-Delgarno,repeats, internal startcodons) and possible secondary structures (hairpins) also play a role (Chiam Yu Ng, Salis). (Fong) Salis et al have developed an algorithm to predict the translation initiation rate based upon thermodynamic calculations. This algorithm is used in the Ribosome Binding Site Calculator (https://salislab.net/software/ , Borujeni & Salis). We used this Calculator to predict the translation rates of our mRNAs.
The results are in table 1. The program gives us results in au (arbitrary units). Since we know the translation rate of LuxI and LuxR, we can use these as a base to calculate the other translation rates since the used scale is proportional. (table 1, column 2) LuxI and LuxR have almost the same output from the calculator which corresponds with the paper where they also have the same translation rate. (Ag43 has a very"

About the University of Exeter
The University of Exeter is situated in Devon, England, in the beautiful city of Exeter. We are regarded as being in the top one percent of Universities in the world, with over 18,000 students from 130 different countries across the world studying on one of three campuses across the South West. We were recently named “Sunday Times University of the Year 2013”, and joined the Russell Group in 2012 to join such Universities as the University of Cambridge, University of Edinburgh and the University of Oxford. Our team is made up of students from the College of Life and Environmental Sciences and the College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences , both based on the picturesque Streatham Campus.  The University undertakes a variety of world-class research in an array of different subjects, ranging from extrasolar planets to international relations. The University has announced its plans to build a £50 million multi-disciplinary research centre at the heart of the Streatham Campus to look at 'Living Systems"
DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Regulatory sytems_-_-_TEXT.html," type of promoter arrangement is common in prokaryotes and is also found in humans and other higher species. The pR promoter is very strong and has greater similarity to the promoter consensus sequence than the very weak pRM promoter [Strainic et al.,1999].
The cI gene encodes cI, the lambda repressor protein. The presence of this protein stabilizes the lysogenic state and causes immunity to superinfections by other lambda phages. cI has a dual function by acting as repressor and activator. It represses transcription from the pR promoter while up-regulating its own expression from the pRM promoter.
A dimer is formed by the cI repressor and binds to DNA in the helix-turn-helix binding motif. The cI repressor binds to all three operator sites in the order OR1 = OR2 > OR3, because of its different intrinsic affinities for the operator sites.
The repressor binds with highest affinity to OR1 and that stimulates binding of more cI to OR2 by a mechanism called positive cooperative binding. Binding to OR1 and OR2 blocks binding of RNA polymerase to the pR promoter, so switching to the lytic cycle is prevented. At high repressor concentrations cI down-regulates its own expression by binding to OR3, so all three operator sites are occupied and expression from the pRM promoter is limited i.e cI, while the expression from cro genes still is inhibited. It is important to understand, that regulation of the switch is solely dependent on repressor concentrations and not by other regulatory proteins e.g. anti-repressors. The Cro protein does not bind with positive cooperation to the three operator sites whilst cI does. The result is that cI and the lysogenic state is more stable, because it can outcompete the cro protein.
The Lytic Pathway
The lytic pathway of lambda is induced by the SOS response after DNA damage in E. coli by e.g. UV light. This is achieved when the repressor protein cI is cleaved by a protein expressed during SOS response, RecA [Lemire et al.,2008]. After induction of the lytic cycle, transcription through the pL and pR promoters is instigated. This results in the expression of the N protein from the pL promoter. The N protein participates in anti-termination, a process that prevents termination of transcription by termination signal. This allows transcription through termination signals located downstream of the early genes.
The nut-site plays an important role in anti-termination as it promotes the formation of an anti"

We collaborated with iGEM Bilkent-UNAMBG and let them distribute the survey in their country to see if the results would differ between countries. The participation was good, with 605 and 268 participants in Sweden and Turkey respectively.
When asking the question: “If you would have been called for a free regular medical checkup (screening) for lung cancer every year, would you go?” both countries showed identical results, see Figure 1. The majority of the participants (89 %) in the survey would go to the medical check-up, showing a positive attitude for the screening program.
Figure 1. Results for the question: “If you would have been called for a free regular medical checkup (screening) for lung cancer every year, would you go?”
When asked the following question: “Do you think such a screening program should be totally financed or subsidized by the government?” the result showed that most of the participants think a lung cancer screening program should be either funded or subsidized by the government, seeFigure 2. The large difference between the countries is that most participants for Sweden think a subsidization would be the best while the majority from Turkey believe that the whole screening program should be financed by the government. Overall, there seems to be a positive attitude about setting up a lung screening program in both countries.
Figure 2. Results for the question: “Do you think such a screening program should be totally financed or subsidized by the government?”
Safety
A vital part of working with the project and creating a screening program was to take the safety into consideration. It is important to ensure that neither patients, hospital nor lab workers would be exposed to any risks.
The first step was to make sure that neither patients or physicians would be in contact with the genetically modified yeast created in this project. If the risk of exposure is removed, it will also simplify the regulation issues. The exposure will be reduced using a prototype with a specific filter that will bind the VOCs when breathed on by the patient. This design allows the patient to breath into the prototype several times to increase the amount of VOCs trapped in the filter. The filter can then be sent to laboratory facilities where the VOCs are dissolved and exposed to the yeast to enable detection. See a more detailed description of the method in Integrated human practices, the prototype . With this design, the need to bring genetically modified yeast into a hospital environment is made redundant. In Sweden a specific approval is needed"

Travis, Peter, and Chris performed a digest and ran a gel on the pPTCC1 in order to discover what was cutting the chitinase in half.  The gel revealed there was an extra BamH1 site that was cutting the chitinase.  This is good news since this can be worked with for future experimentation.  They also resuspended the IDT order of Chitinase B4A and assembled it with the ice-nucleation protein.

NUS_Singapore,2016,Team:NUS Singapore#Project#Wet Lab_-_-_TEXT.html," of certain cancer cells due to the Warburg effect. This specificity is conferred by introducing a bifunctional conjugate which consists of an anti-CD44v6 antibody linked to a hemophore, hasA (RIOT Transponder). This hemophore is responsible for triggering the has operon in the RIOTsystem (RIOT Responder) that will allow the engineered E. coli to specifically congregate at the cancer cells and initiate the RIOT Invader, which causes invasion of the cancer cell to deliver a reporter protein or therapeutic drug via expression of Invasin and Listeriolysin.
Part 1:
RIOT Sensor
We synthesized a series of RIOT sensors which is repressed by LldR and activated by L-lactate. Among them, Construct 7 and Construct 8 exhibited an increased sensitivity to lactate compared to the original sensors (namely, Construct 1 and 2).
To further enhance the specificity of our RIOT system, in the future, we may insert Construct 7 in a low-copy plasmid backbone to fine-tune the expression of ALR. This may reduce their growth in the bloodstream and keep them from attacking healthy cells, which do secrete some concentration of lactate.
BACKGROUND:
In order to survive and continually proliferate, cancer cells are found to have the ability to alter glucose metabolism. This is a common phenomenon known as the Warburg effect, where cancer cells have the ability to increase glucose uptake and undergo aerobic glycolysis followed by lactic acid fermentation in the cytosol, resulting in the elevated production and accumulation of lactate (Chen et al., 2007; Vander et al., 2009; Alfarouk et al., 2015). Besides malignancy, high lactate concentration, which is > 4 x 10-3 M (Kruse et al., 2011) in a number of studies, has been associated with increased mortality in sepsis, trauma and cardiac arrest (Andersen et al., 2013). Therefore, elevated lactate can serve as a useful indicator to identify patients and expedite further diagnostic workup. As a proof-of-concept, Escherichia coli was engineered to detect the increased level of lactate, hence, specifically distinguish cancer cells from normal cells.
We designed a collection of RIOT sensors which are responsive to L-lactate. Our RIOT sensors contain a reporter gene, either superfolded green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) or Alanine Racemase (ALR) under the control of a lactate sensitive promoter"

A coding sequence of iRGD peptide and position it outside the membrane.
Usage and Biology
iRGD is a tumor-penetrating peptide that can increase vascular and tissue permeability. Importantly, this effect did not require the drugs to be chemically conjugated to the peptide. To enhance the accuracy of drug delivery system and improve targeting index of drugs, iRGD peptide was displayed on the surface of the exosome containing our previously designed siRNA, allowing us to target recipient cells in vivo efficiently. Lamp-2b is a protein found specifically abundant in exosomal membranes. So we connect iRGD with Lamp2b by a glycine-linker, and promote the expression using cmv promoter. We engineered our chassis, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, to express iRGD-Lamp2b fusion protein. Therefore, the iRGD exosomes (iRGD-Exos) are endowed with site-specific recognition ability and were purified from cell culture supernatants and loaded with Dox by electroporation.
Characterization
The iRGD-Lamp2b expressing vector was thoroughly described in Tian’s article (Yanhua Tian, et al. Biomaterials, 2013). He showed that exosomes, endogenous nano-sized membrane vesicles secreted by most cell types, could deliver chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin (Dox) to tumor tissue in BALB/c nude mice. To reduce immunogenicity and toxicity, mouse immature dendritic cells (imDCs) were used for exosome production. Tumor targeting was facilitated by engineering the imDCs to express a well-characterized exosomal membrane protein (Lamp2b) fused to αν integrin-specific iRGD peptide (CRGDKGPDC). Purified exosomes from imDCs were loaded with Dox via electroporation, with an encapsulation efficiency of up to 20%. iRGD exosomes showed highly efficient targeting and Dox delivery to αν integrin-positive breast cancer cells in"

Abstract
There are several issues in the switch from petroleum to alternative fuels. One problem the world faces is what to do with existing wastes such as leaking coal ash ponds. Another issue is the efficient production of an alcohol that is effective as a fuel, easy and inexpensive to produce, and will function within the current infrastructure. This year, we improved the sensitivity of our cadmium detector using sensitivity tuners. We are developing a strain of E. coli resistant to isobutanol, and we are cloning GlmY, GlmZ, and IlvM which are genes involved in the isobutanol production pathway. Addition of sensitivity tuners has improved the cadmium detector approximately four-fold, from 10mM to 2.5mM, which is still over the federal limit. The isobutanol resistant strain of E. coli can tolerate three times as much isobutanol as the original strain. Finally, we have successfully isolated the GlmZ coding region and have cloned it into the BioBrick vector.
Biofuels
The rising cost of petroleum, coupled with the environmental concerns that go with its use, have led to a recent increase in biofuel research. Developments in using bacteria to produce biofuels such as isobutanol and ethanol have come with this research. These al"

Abstract
     Ionizing radiation and radiation pollution is an important environmental problem that not only affects those working around radiation facilities, but those dealing with the aftermath of widespread nuclear disasters such as those at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor or the Chernobyl reactor. Penn State’s team project will focus on using a genetic circuit introduced into E. coli bacterial cells, in order to rapidly detect and report the presence of harmful ionizing radiation. We are working to develop a robust and reliable biosensor which utilizes the lambda phage lytic-lysogenic switch coupled with a fast-acting reporter capable of producing an easily visible effect. We believe that the final construct may have the potential to rival current radiation detection methods, such as digital dosimeters.
     Our hope is that the basis of our biological dosimeter system will prove to be an effective genetic system capable of detecting harmful levels of radiation and relaying it to those working in the field or affected area. We envision our system not only being useful in such applications, but also being capable of further expansion and evolution through the expanding field of synthetic biology.
Overall project: Bacterial Dosimeter
Radiation of one form or another is a constant presence throughout our every day lives. Radiation, or the transmission and absorption of energy over a given distance, has proven an invaluable technology useful in applications for everything from heating our food to diagnosing and treating diseases. Some forms of radiation, however, can be detrimental to the human body, as they are a common cause of such diseases as radiation poisoning and cancer.
All types of radiation can be divided into two categories: non-ionizing and ionizing. Non-ionizing radiation (consisting of radio, micro, infrared, and visible electromagnetic waves) contains less energy and has a relatively small effect on living organisms that has only recently been studied. Ionizing radiation, however, contains a much greater amount of energy capable of ionizing atoms which can lead to harmful effects on living tissue. This category of radiation encompasses alpha and beta decay as well as neutron, X-ray, and gamma radiation.
Our project focuses on detecting the degradation and damage of DNA associated with ionizing radiation. The initial proposed design is shown below. It consists of two parts: a sensor based on a lambda phage bistable switch, and a fast-acting reporter similar to the reporter designed by the Imperial College of London 2010 iGEM team.

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.      It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",     and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,     and theological speculation throughout history.

Abstract ...
“A BETTER FUTURE WITH SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY”
Study of synthetic biology emerged as a multidisciplinary science that help people in solving various problems. Among the general public, synthetic biology is famous as bioengineering and extreme genetic engineering which have an advantage in redesigning a life through genetical circuit, thus allows people to manipulate a new organism for use in treatment and diagnosis of disease, provision of quality seeds, remediation of environmental pollution caused by industrial and mining as well as the mitigation of global warming.
Indonesia as one of the currently high development countries in science is allowing for synthetic biology to grow rapidly. Prospects for the synthetic biology's development in Indonesia, among others, is the independence of technology in the health sector include the development of a specific diagnosis, the provision of pharmaceutical raw materials, and technology screening for Indonesia natural resources which have potency to treat various types of diseases.
Brawijaya University iGEM team will develop synthetic biology in order to solve health sector problems, focus in Cervical Cancer. We have three sub-projects, they are: plant engineering for cervical cancer prevention, developing Cervical Cancer Care Program application for smartphone as helpdesk, and scanning technology for natural materials treatment (SCT Kit).
Background
“UB_INDONESIA BRINGS C3P (CERVICAL CANCER PROGRAM)”
Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide. Yet, because of poor access to screening and treatment services, the number of deaths occur in women increase highly, especially in our country, Indonesia. Effective methods for early detection of precancerous lesions using cytology (Pap smear) exist, but not effective enough for detection in all age. However, new technological developments, using synthetic biology, offer the potential to tackle cervical cancer in a more comprehensive way and build a healthier future for girls and women. Here we go with our great idea!
UB IGEM TEAM is on progress in developing C3P (Cervical Cancer Care Program) as the theme to give solutions"

Kingsborough_NY,2017,Team:Kingsborough NY#LacZ_-_-_TEXT.html,"3: LacZ expression of K2268003 grown in the Light
(Figure 3)Shows the plating of K2268003 grown in the light where the blue indicator shows the direction of plating. The center had the highest expression of LacZ suggesting that rate of cell growth is the highest at the center and rate of cell growth towards the edge of the plate is lower. The cell was induced with 1mM of IPTG in 20 ɥg/ɥl of X-gal.
Figure 4: Approach for ImageJ Analysis (Light)
(Figure 4)Shows the ImageJ analysis for the average expression level. Each “cell” is a ratio of blue to gray and expression level was found by taking the ratio of the background to the cell.
Figure 5: Quantified Results comparing Light and Dark conditions
(Figure5)Shows that there is a significant difference in expression level between K2268005 grown in light and K2268005 grown in dark with significantly higher expression in K2268005 grown in light, p<.001. Data analysis was done by comparing the mean expression level of figure 2 and figure 4 with GraphPad Software.
Figure 6: Optimizing X-gal concentrations
(Figure 6) shows that increasing x-gal from 20 ɥg/ɥl  to 40 ɥg/ɥl showed a noticeable increase in LacZ expression for K2268004. Increased expression level shows that LacI inhibition is not strong and that LacZ expression is coming from the plasmid backbone (pSB1C3) or the bacteria itself.

Based on the product analyses we have concluded that our microlenses are especially useful for solar panels and we have written an extensive business plan about this. The safety analysis showed us that, because of the antibiotic resistance, our microlenses cannot leave the lab. Therefore, we have analysed methods to sterilize the biolenses and eventually we adopted one of the methods in our project. The stakeholder also suggested to make round lenses, since they have advantages over the rod-shaped microlenses we produced. This motivated us to produce spherical E. coli cells. With the gene BolA we succeeded to make the cells spherical. For more details, please visit our Human Practices Gold medal page .

During our project we needed to express GFP, but the only GFP BioBrick                                      ( BBa_E0840 ) available                                      in the distribution kit does not contain a promoter, thus it can only be used if cloned downstream of one.                                      It is also for this reason that this part did not have any characterization. We have improved BioBrick BBa_E0840 in 2 different ways: on the one hand, we                                      provided 5 ready-to-go expression devices for green fluorescence (with promoters of different strengths),                                      which can be used by future teams; on the other hand, this has allowed us to provide characterization for this uncharacterized GFP part. Also, all the biobricks created based on this part were                                      characterized by measuring their spectrum and growth cycle.

Figure 5: Here, you can see us presenting our poster to the prime minister.
To reach people of all ages, we had a stand at the Hessentag , an annual event in the federal state of Hesse with hundreds of thousands of visitors and differing locations. We isolated DNA out of paprika together with present kids only with items they could find in their own household (e.g. knives, sieves, spiritus etc.). Meanwhile, we talked about synthetic biology with their parents and grandparents, and discussed their concerns about genetic engineering.

By working with every age class of the society, we wanted to positively influence the image of synthetic biology and to achieve a higher public acceptance. If you want to get some more impressions of what we have done in our projects, check out the gallery at the bottom of the page.
iGEM meets Marburg
One of our biggest events was the MeetUp iGEM meets Marburg to which we invited all German iGEM teams to Marburg for a weekend in August. When the representatives of each team had arrived, we walked through the ‘Oberstadt’, Marburg’s city center. There, we had dinner in one of the 126 bars. The next day, every of the 9 participating teams had the opportunity to present their project ideas, exchange their experiences with arisen problems and think about new perspectives. In the afternoon, we organized a boat race at the Lahn followed by a barbecue. Through this event, several collaborations came into being.

Research and Change
Our project goal is to prevent tissue damage from chronic inflammation by inhibiting Granzyme B in the extracellular matrix.  In order to accomplish this task, we needed A LOT of help and advice. Some of our team members learned a little bit about inflammation in AP or IB biology, but if we wanted to create a project dealing with the harmful effects of inflammation, we needed to ask for more help.  We received valuable help from research scientists currently working with Granzyme B, medical doctors who had expertise working with patients with chronic inflammation, and policy analysts who make rules and decisions regarding the safety and viability of synthetic biology projects.  Ultimately the information we gathered helped us shape and guide our project.  By taking into account the advice from these experts, we have created a possibly feasible project and a functional prototype.
In addition to the advice we received on the background and experimental portion of our project, the policy advice we received from The National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine's (Committee on Science, Technology and Law – Forum on Synthetic Biology) helped us create a policy brief that we sent to the US Senate, US House, World Health Organization, Bill and Melinda Gates foundation and Mark Zuckerberg's Silicon Valley Community Foundation.  Our innovative policy informed policy makers about the uneven spending discrepancy between R&D and marketing in pharmaceutical companies.  Based on our policy research, we offered a potential solution to this problem for policy makers to consider.

COLLABORATIONS
  This year the collaboration of our team with SCU_China team and UESTC-software team were very smoothly as expected. We helped each other from the aspects of experimental design, experiment results verification and software to reach the iGEM spirit of resource sharing. The following is a detailed description.
In 2015 iGEM, we CHINA_CD_UESTC team collaborated with SCU_China team and UESTC-software team. We communicated several times, helped each other and shared our resources, which generated a great atmosphere of cooperation and mutual assistance. Indeed, we helped SCU_China team finish the prediction and experiment design about RBS in their project.
In this process, our team had completed two aspects of the collaboration work:
(1) Help SCU_China team to design the experiments and complete the experimental demonstration of RBS forecast outcomes.
(2) Provide the theoretical support of developing SD Finder software aiming to predict the ribosome binding site (RBS) position to UESTC-software team.
Design experiments for SCU_China team
We helped SCU_China team design the experiment. In order to find the unknown RBS position and standard it, we designed the folowing experiments for them:
1. Demonstration of RBS located in upstream of the gene nifD
2. Mutant demonstration of RBS located in upstream of the gene nifD
3. Demonstration of RBS located in upstream of the gene nifK
4. Mutant demonstration of RBS located in upstream of the gene nifK
CHINA_CD_UESTC team finally completed the design of these experiments, which helped SCU_China team accomplish the work of forecast RBS position.
SD Finder Theoretical Support
It was in our theoretical knowledge support that UESTC-software team helped SCU_China team develop a RBS prediction software which named SD Finder. The two teams, CHINA_CD_UESTC team and UESTC-software team, made up deficiencies in theoretical support and software technology to each other and cooperated to complete the SD Finder smoothly. The main function of SD Finder is helping user predict the"

Exeter,2018,Team:Exeter#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," needed to see if E. coli could survive in the presence of perchlorate and chlorite, and at what concentrations. This was important information, as it allowed us to determine a baseline level of robustness of the wild type bacterial strain to the environment they will face in the bioreactor on Mars.  We used the BL21 (DE3) strain for these growth curves. This meant we could tackle the following question:
""Can E. coli survive in perchlorate and chlorite conditions that are likely to be encountered?""
Four perchlorate concentrations were chosen. Baseline growth was determined by adding 0 mM perchlorate. Our modelling informed us that if we could maintain a constant concentration of 1 mM perchlorate in our bioreactor we could produce enough oxygen to sustain one person at rest with a 48 litre bioreactor. However, to mitigate for fluctuations we chose a 2 mM concentration. If 100 g of Martian regolith was added to 100 ml of water (i.e. 100 % w/v) this would give a 100 mM perchlorate concentration. Finally, Urban Tundra 2016 determined that 200 mM was a toxic concentration of perchlorate for E. coli.
Figure 1: 12 hour growth curves for E. coli BL21 (DE3) in 0, 2, 100, 200 mM perchlorate. 0.2ml culture volumes in a 96 well-plate grown at 37°C, 600rpm measuring OD600 every 30 minutes.
Figure 1 shows that E. coli can survive in all tested concentrations of perchlorate. Although reduced E. coli can still grow in 200 mM perchlorate which is contradictory to the results from Urban Tundra.
Assuming that all perchlorate added is converted to chlorite, we had to determine whether E. coli could survive if only our perchlorate reductase was active i.e. the chlorite is not converted to oxygen and chloride. Therefore we repeated the growth curves in the corresponding concentrations off chlorite.
Figure 2: 12 hour growth curves for E. coli BL21 (DE3) in 0, 2, 100, 200 mM chlorite. 0.2ml culture volumes in a 96 well-plate grown at 37°C, 600rpm measuring OD600 every 30 minutes.
Figure 2 shows that E. coli cannot survive in the higher chlorite concentrations and has significant reduced growth at a chlorite concentration of 2 mM. Hence, in our biore"

This is the foundation of our safety consideration - that the products from all parts and genetic circuits must not cause harm by themselves. All our effector proteins (laccase, catechol-2,3-dioxygenase, erythromycin esterase B) are all from S1 organisms and are not toxic. For example, laccases are already used in the food industry [ Osma et al., 2010 ]. For the establishment of a eukaryotic expression system, we are also using parts of mammalian origin and from S2-organisms (see safety forms below). We have made the decisions to use parts from S2 organism carefully and only after consulting our safety officer. He could ensure us that the parts and circuits we are using do not pose any threat. When possible, we have tried to substitute parts from S2 organisms with parts from S1 organisms. All of the parts we are using (such as a polioviral internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and the Ig-Kappa secretion signal from mouse) are widely used in molecular biology laboratories all around the world and are considered safe.

Currently the production density is 15 thousand kilograms per hectare in China; yet according to the research of experts, the theoretical production is 40-80 thousand kilograms per hectare. According to research, potatoes contain the most vitamins among crops. In America and Europe, the average consumption per person is over 80 kilograms per year. The average consumption of potatoes in China is about 32.1 kilograms, with the three major provinces producing potatoes being Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Guiyang.
From data analysis, we know that the ratio of the input to the output is 1:4 for potato,1:2.5 for soya, and 1:2 for barley. One hectare of potato gives us twice the production of crops in equivalent and three times the output value of crops. The water use efficiency of potatoes is eight times that of wheat and corn. 60% of arable land in China is in water shortage, and is only suitable for planting potatoes to obtain high yield. There are ten provinces with planting areas over 20 thousand hectares: Inner Mongolia, Guizhou, Gansu, Heilongjiang, Chongqing, Shan3xi, Sichuan, Shan1xi, Yunnan, Hubei.
Potato
Potatoes grow better under cool conditions. The best temperature for the sprouting of tubers is at 18°C, and the suitable temperature for stems and leaves to grow is 17-21°C. The lowest bearable temperature is 7°C, while the highest bearable temperature is 25-27°C. In germination period supernumerary water supply is not required. However during blossoming period the requirement for water will reach the peak; once the water supply is not enough, the tuber cannot grow big enough. Excessive rain fall in the later stages of growth will make the potatoes more susceptible to infection.
Variety
Imported varieties
Atlantic: late-maturing variety, anti-PVX and PLRV, high starch content, storable. Mainly used for frying potato chips.
Faudio-videoorita (also known as the Dutch potato): precocious high-yielding variety, anti-potato virus Y and leaf virus, potato virus A and tumor disease immunity. Storable, good eating quality.

La unidad básica de la vida es la célula: hay organismos pluricelulares como los humanos y     también hay organismos como las bacterias que están constituidos por una sola célula. Lo     que tenemos todos los organismos vivos en común, es que “las instrucciones” para nuestro     desarrollo y funcionamiento se encuentran codificadas en el ADN.
El genoma de un organismo es el conjunto de material genético (ADN) particular de su especie.     Es en el genoma donde están los genes que dan origen a las proteínas necesarias para el     organismo. Las proteínas son imprescindibles para la vida pues realizan una enorme cantidad     de funciones: diferentes proteínas forman todas las estructuras, las enzimas promueven las     reacciones químicas que se llevan a cabo en el organismo, las hormonas regulan la actividad     de las células en distintas etapas de la vida, etc.
A través del desarrollo de herramientas computacionales, de las matemáticas y de las nuevas     tecnologías en los laboratorios podemos conocer cada vez más aspectos de los genomas de los     organismos e incluso ir un paso más allá.
La biología sintética es una disciplina en desarrollo, un área de la investigación biológica     que combina la ciencia y la ingeniería. Está compuesta de dos premisas principales:
a) El diseño ingenieril de biomoléculas o sistemas biológicos con funciones nuevas, es decir,    que no se encuentran en la naturaleza.
b) El re-diseño de sistemas biológicos u organismos ya existentes en la naturaleza para     darles aplicaciones útiles.
Al aplicar los principios de la ingeniería a la biología, el concepto de “parte” es     importante, pues progresivamente se desarrollan estándares para la construcción de     sistemas biológicos novedosos. Esta construcción se logra a tomando partes de sistemas     biológicos naturales, caracterizándolas, simplificándolas y estandarizándolas para su uso.

Therefore, we investigated if AI-2 Consumers and AI-2 Suppliers could interfere with biofilm formation process from this biofilm producer. Co-incubations of pTrcHisB were re-inoculated with pTrcHisB, AI-2 Suppliers or AI-2 Consumers and cells were grown in a 96-well plate for 24 h.
Biofilm production was normalized to the final cell density and bacteria co-cultured with AI-2 Suppliers pLuxS and pLuxSMtn showed increased biofilm formation by about 15% compared to identical incubations with pTrcHisB. In the meantime, bacteria co-cultured with AI-2 Consumers showed decreased biofilm formation by about 40% compared to identical incubations with pTrcHisB. A two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test was performed between the groups and the result indicates that the biofilm increase and reduction are both significant.

2. Project Conclusion
Coordination between cell populations via prevailing metabolic cues has been noted as a promising approach to connect synthetic devices and drive phenotypic or product outcomes. However, there has been little progress in developing 'controller cells' to modulate metabolic cues and guide these systems. This summer, our team successfully constructed two cell machines to manipulate the molecular connection between cells by modulating the bacteria signal molecule, autoinducer-2, which is secreted as a quorum sensing (QS) signal by many bacterial species: AI-2 Supplier is the cell machine which can directly supply and enrich the AI-2 molecules while AI-2 Consumer is another cell machine which can sense, absorb and degrade the AI-2 in the environment.
We found that the overexpression of luxSand mtn gene (pLuxSMtn) resulted in a most significant increase of environmental AI-2, while the overexpression of lsrACDBFGK genes (pLsrACDBFGK) resulted in an extraordinarily efficient AI-2 uptake that was capable of completely silencing QS-mediated gene expression among wildtype cells. We demonstrated the utility of AI-2 Controllers by modulating naturally occurring process of biofilm formation. We envision that 'controller cells' that modulate bacteria behavior by manipulating molecular communication will find use in a variety of applications, particularly those employing natural or synthetic bacterial consortia.

Logic gates
Logic gates and complex systems are designed from bio-transistor. Therefore, if we are able to model activation, inhibition and activation/inhibition of our transistors we can use them in parallel and chain them together in order to create logic gates.
Results
Basal expression in E. coli
Once the parameters of our system had been either found in the literature or estimated, we performed our first simulation. In this simulation we computed the basal expression of GFP from the activity of our transistor element in E. coli. The results of this simulation are presented below.
Basal GFP expression in E. coli.
Concentration ranges
Since our parameters were estimated or taken from different papers published over many years, the results of our model had to be analyzed with care. The following question needed to be answered : Are predicted GFP concentration in the nM range and do they make sense? The total number of proteins in E. coli cells is 2x106, while in Yeast cells it reaches 50x106 [15]. Using the known volume of E. coli and S. cerevisiae, which is 1µm3 and 60µm3 respectively [1], we can compute the protein concentration in µM: for E. coli we have 3x103 µM, while for S. cere"

Gold
In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, we achieved the following 3 requirements:
We improve the function and characterization of an existing BioBrick Part in the project of Freiburg 2012 and entered this information in the Registry. We provide new ideas and broaden the range of application upon the former BioBrick by modified the basic units of them.
We cooperated with SJTU-software by debugging constructs.
Our iGEM projects involve important questions related to resource and environment problems like petroleum degradation. We achieved protein polymerization with the help of TAL effector and described thoroughly in our wiki about this approach which can address the questions. Our approach is convenient and easy-used to other scientific researches within and beyond iGEM, including industrial royalties. The approach allowed us to answer our question and influenced deeply through the whole scientific project.

USTC-Software,2017,Team:USTC-Software#project_-_-_TEXT.html," We think a user-friendly forum centred on Biobricks is necessary, where users can grade the parts they've used, or share experiences with other scholars. The forum on the one hand complements the data used for more accurate ranking, and on the other hand provides a platform for idea exchanging.
The parts data can be used for various purposes, but apparently we are not able to achieve all of them. In consideration of this, we decide to make our software extensible. Developers with ideas to better make use of the data may develop their own plugins, and embed them into the software. With the help of forum, such plugins will be acquainted quickly, and accelerate the development of synthetic biology.
To Be Improved
As an upgrade version of Biohub 1.0, we've achieved quite a lot, but there's still something imperfect, due to technical or time limitation. One is that users cannot upload their own plugins freely as a consideration of security. We will try to add sand-box mechanism in the future, whilst still providing enough freedom for plugins. Another is that the project lacks a scaffold for plugin developers, which may confuse them while setting up developing environment. Also, the plugin system lacks a detailed documantation for developers. We will keep updating the repository and gradually fill these blanks in the future."

Hold
While the PCR is running, prepare a 0.5mL tube with 2µL loading buffer for each PCR sample and one tube with 4µL of 1Kb DNA ladder (or 8µL if 2 gels are needed). This way you can take these tubes into the EtBr area and don’t worry about how to handle the PCR tubes.
Cast an agarose gel following the DNA electrophoresis protocol.
Prepare an agarose gel simulation with SNAPGENE for comparison with the actual results.
Once the PCR program is finished, transfer 8µL of PCR product into the tubes containing the loading buffer and follow the DNA electrophoresis protocol.
Back to Protocols
DNA electrophoresis
Work clean! Handle with gloves all material labelled as EtBr contaminated, don’t take it outside of the EtBr area and don’t touch with gloves anything that is not labelled as EtBr contaminated.
Prepare TAE buffer: take the 10X concentrated TAE from the chemicals cabinet and dilute it 10 times with demi water. For 500mL, add 50mL to 450mL of dH2O.
Weigh agarose for a 1% gel. For 200mL, 2g of agarose is necessary.
Mix the TAE solution with the agarose and heat the solution until it is completely dissolved.
Add Ethidium bromide to the gel mould. 2.5L for the small gel and 5L for the big one.
Pour the solution into the mould making sure there are no bubbles and that the EtBr is completely mixed. Let it solidify (approx. 20 minutes).
Transfer the gel to the electrophoresis cell minding the arrow that indicates the direction of DNA migration, remove the combs and cover it with TAE.
Prepare tubes with 5/6 of PCR product and 1/6 of loading buffer.
Load the molecular weight marker (ladder) in the first well (check the appropriate volume for each marker, generally 5L works fine) and load the samples in the other wells, according to the order in your lab journal.
NOTE: Do not contaminate the loading buffer and ladder with EtBr! Do not touch it while wearing a glove.
Connect the cables following the colour code and run at 100-130V for 30-60 min.

Materials
You will need:
DH5α competent cells
polypropylene tubes
ice
DNA to be transformed; can consist of ligation product , miniprep sample , or stock parts from the registry
luria broth
nutrient agar plates
Sterilized glass beads
Extra Notes
Do not keep cells out for too long. It is vital that the cells undergo a rapid temperature change (from very cold to very hot suddenly) in order for crack pores in the cell wall.
Procedure
Thaw DH5α cells on ice for 10 minutes.
Transfer 50μL of DH5α cells to chill, sterile polypropylene tubes.
Transfer 1μL of DNA into the tubes with the cells.
Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
Gently transfer tubes to 42°C water bath for 90s (for heat shock)
Transfer tubes back on ice for 2 minutes.
Add 800μL of luria broth into each tube.
Incubate at 37°C for 1 hour in a shaker.
Plate 200μL of each sample on nutrient agar plates. (Be sure to choose the plates with the antibiotic that your E. Coli is resistant to.)
Spread the sample evenly by plating with sterilized glass beads. Empty the plate of glass beads afterwards.
Incubate overnight at 37°C.
Purpose
To insert plasmids into E. Coli.

METU_Turkey_Software,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software_-_-_TEXT.html," based on PartsRegistry Survey Results
First suggesiton is offering fartnership with Google for easy search     and founding a committe to enforce a standardized nomenclature for terminology     and parts registry entries.
We strongly suggest starting a forum on how to quantify the performance     of promoters and genes to bring an easy to measure standard for the     efficiency of the parts. Additionally iGEM should assume the responsibility     and provide the measurements for the each promoter and gene included     in the distributions. The second choice would beeven better in terms     of standardization as all the measurement will be performed by one center     under similar conditions and with experienced researchers, which will     allow user to compare and contrast the efficiencies of the parts more     accurately. We suggest excluding the parts not-working, low rated or     with negative feedbacks from the annual distribution plates but still     archive them and make their data available through the parts registry.     So the while the individuals labs are receiving plates with higher rated,     fully working parts for their projects, anyone who wants to work on     a more exotic part can search through the achieves and re-vitalize the     parts stored there. The challenge of re-vitalization of parts can be     encouraged as an collaborative effort. We are sure, all of us would     like to see gene-protein and pathway information if these information     was integrated into the database and offered automatically for each     entry in the database. We are planning to provide this information about     the parts to all parts registry users as a build-in option in the next     version of BioGuide in iGEM 2011.
Database Standardization
Two main focuses of our project was the organization of the available     information about Biobricks on iGEM’s website and development of a software     application to help synthetic biologists at the experimental set-up     level by providing all available construct combinations for any given     input and output relations ,which they can utilize for their own project.
Normalization and re-organization of the part information at iGEM’s     web site was needed in order to develop our application, which will     automatically search the possible construct combinations. For the organization     and analysis of the Biobricks, we used part info for Spring 2010 distribution.     The information on all three 384 well plates distributed by iGEM scrutinized     and checked individually to specify the standards available and needed.     iGEM is providing so many parts within a hierarchical way, but there     is no order in the information flow and no common standards. Furthermore,     the information bulk is being used in an ineffective manner. Some"

SAFETY
Laboratory Safety
The Ribozyme Project is not expected to raise any research, public or environmental safety concerns other than those normally associated with Biosafety Level 2 organisms, such as Escherichia coli (DH5-alpha), which is classified as very low to moderate. The use of this project is primarily reserved for research and laboratory use, therefore, should not purposefully be exposed to the public or environment except after further testing in its specific applications (such as with particular fusion proteins). Furthermore, the basis of our project is to establish a self-excising sequence (ribozymes), which"

We cooperated with NTU_Taida iGEM team this year and helped them to characterize their parts (C-4 AHL Biosensers ACE: K1157020 & CEA: K1157021 ) and also analyzed the data. We tested the function of Kii57020 by testing its GFP fluorescence expression. We used ELISA plate reader to read the fluorescence of the constructs under different concentrations of C-4 AHLs. The biosensors are transformed into competent cell E. Coli DH5α cultured overnight and then diluted until OD value=0.1. Then we read fluorescence expression from 0 to 4 hours.
BBa_K1157020
BBa_K1157021
The results show that as AHL concentration increase, the expression of the downstream gene increase, which indicate that their parts work as expected.

Bob Mulder gave us some extensive advice on how to approach different scenarios. He advised to focus on and show the modularity of the device and to find a way to describe all three cases (HAT, Zika and Mayaro). The implementation of the device will be different for each case. Moreover, we have to find the weakest link in the diagnosis process. For now, we should fully develop one case first and then compare it to the next case and adapt the application. We did that by making a roll-out plan for African Sleeping Sickness in Congo and then compared it to the case of Zika virus in Brazil. Also, we could try to develop future scenarios: a best case scenario, in which everything works out well, or one in which everything is performed badly.

Start-Up Culture Preparation, continued
The three start-up cultures are removed from the shaking incubator. An Optical Density (OD) check was performed on each one.
Start-Up Culture from G-Block 3: 0.2
Start-Up Culture from G-Block 4, Colony 1: 0.38
Start-Up Culture from G-Block 4, Colony 2: 0.28
Procedure to Measure OD
1 mL of LB broth in cuvette used as blank
100 ul of sample, 900 ul of LB broth in cuvette
AD 600 reading multiplied by 10 to obtain OD measurement (Beer-Lambert's Law)
Next, we autoclaved 1 L LB, added 1 mL of Ampicillin. The OD measurement from start-up culture tube labelled G-Block 4, Colony 1, was 0.38, the highest and most optimal out of the three. The contents of this tube were added to the 1 L of LB and 1 mL of ampicillin. The contents were put in a shaking incubator for 3 hours and 45 minutes. Another OD check was completed, this time reported to be 0.5. Next 5 mL of IPTG was added to further initiate growth and the contents were left to incubate overnight."

Ryan is a senior in the chemical engineering department   at UW-Madison. Originally he was interested in industrial research, but synthetic biology soon stole his heart. When not in the lab, Ryan can be spotted in many places on campus. He spends late nights in the concrete canoe lab, mixing and sanding concrete repeatedly. He also is a tour guide and tutors for organic chemistry. Ryan intends to go to grad school after his last year at Madison, hopefully to pursue his passion for synthetic biology.
Michael is a sophomore in the biochemistry department with both math and physics minors. After working in labs at the Mayo Clinic during high school, and receiving an award at the International Science and Engineering Fair for his immunology research done there, Michael jumped straight into research upon arriving at the UW. Michael has for many years had a passion for synthetic biology and the potential in holds. In his spare time Michael can be found fencing, larping, role-playing, reading, or otherwise being a nerd. Michael plans to go to grad school, pursuing a PhD with every plan of returning to synthetic biology in his future.
Chris is a senior in Microbiology, minoring in Business Entrepreneurship, and is interested in biofuels, biorefining, and the future of the energy economy. He has done research in materials science, pharmaceutical discovery, and unconventional yeast metabolism. When not pondering the fate of humanity, Chris enjoys swimming, water polo, and sailing big boats.
Charles Johnson is a Junior in the department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at UW-Madison. He is interested in studying the many different ways synthetic biology can be used to help the world, from medical applications to biofuels. When Charlie is not in the lab he wants fallow in his family's footsteps by helping those less fortunate than him, his older brother and grandmother dedicated their lives to teaching in the inner city of Chicago, while his parents have been representing people who could not afford lawyers for 30 plus years,"
EPFL,2016,Team:EPFL#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," the academic side. On the other hand, I also see that companies need to have some kind of protection of their research and development, therefore the patents!
There is some fear that those new technologies just make the gap between poor and rich people bigger. Because the rich people are those who get direct access to the new technologies; an example are the plants that don’t produce their own seeds. Farmer have to buy seed from the same company each year. This is an issue.
I like that you mentioned the open source community because one of the questions we had prepared for you was regarding biohacking and kind of where ... And what the first thing that might come into your mind when you think about kind of... Well I am not sure if this is where you were taking this question when you were talking about open source. Maybe you were talking about everybody getting involved. But when you think about small maybe members of the general public running their own small experiments in synthetic biology, do you see that as an issue? Because these people usually aren’t’ regulated to the same level as an institution might be.
Dimitri ;Taking this back to where I am coming from (United States), this was a big issue after 9/11; they shut down a ton of people running their own biohacking experiments.
That’s a good question. In general, I think that it’s great that people not doing this as professionals are interested and can play around with it. It is also a form of public engagement.
But then of course, if they don’t treat the waste and release genetically modified organisms that’s not a good idea. There should be some basic safety level ensured. Basically the same rules should apply independent of where the experiments are performed.
But in this case I guess the limit to which biohacking might be available to the general public is under the umbrella of an open laboratory. We have something similar here in a town nearby called Renens. We went there to present our project. They have a small laboratory called “Hackuarium” which is open to the members of the public who want to run their own biological experiment.
I imagine they must have the possibility for proper waste disposal, for example using an autoclave. And there should be somebody responsible to control this.
Our last question regarding biohacking is whether even if it is open to the pubic if there should be some sort of regulation of who should do it about who can do it. Basically, if whether in your estimation It should be regulated - now we are balancing public safety and community engagement.
Do you mean like bioterrorism, or things like"

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Detectives_-_-_TEXT.html," which is a problem because it must also be complementary to the target DNA sequence - a sequence which we have very little control over. According to the literature, there are multiple parameters in regards to the sequence design which must be considered, including optimization of the dynamic range - tight regulation with a high level of expression. Furthermore, the post-transcriptional nature of this strategy may be more susceptible to leaky expression, which for our purpose, is highly undesirable.
Integration vector plasmids were also prepared, and ready for transformation of B. subtilis.
Week 7: June 23 - 27
We continued our efforts in building the repressor construct, consisting of Pveg + RBS [for E. coli] and one of five coding sequences for a repressor protein. A similar repressor genewill also be made consisting of two variants of an RBS - a RBS consensus sequence for B. subtilis and an RBS that works in both E. coli and B. subtilis.
The two RBS’s that will be used in B. subtilis were synthesized, because they were not immediately available from the iGEM kit plates. This week they were inserted into a plasmid, after several attempts.
We have also been dealing with logistical problems in ordering the synthesis of our reporter construct ‘skeleton’ - that is the Pveg + [operator] + [RBS] - that will be used to make reporter genes with different reporters.
Week 8: June 30 - July 4
Attempted once more to clone the three different synthesized RBSs into a plasmid. Since the parts are so small they are difficult to verify, however, it appears that they were successfully cloned into a plasmid vector and into E. coli. Subsequently the constitutive promoter, Pveg, was inserted in front of the RBS.
Continuing effort in making the repressor/generator gene using a constitutive promoter and one of 3 RBSs - Pveg + RBS (x3) + [repressor or reporter]
Week 9: July 7 - 11
While waiting for synthesis of our reporter genes, we are looking for a similar gene- promoter + operator + RBS - to amplify out to use for testing our system, preferably from B. subtilis. However, since we do not want to have our system overlap with the native regulatory systems in B. subtilis, we will again attempt to assemble the reporter geneusing the parts that we have.

Desalting and low-melting agarose (LMA) 1% electrophoresis purification was done to further remove any possible contaminating enzymes and undesired polynucleotides. Ligation of both vectors and inserts were conducted by adding T4 ligase and its respective buffers to be later incubated 160C overnight
Transformation of resultant recombinant plasmids was done in wild-type E. coli K-12 (for submission purpose) and BL21(DE3) (for characterization and validation purpose) via “transformation protocol” methods in the other page. To enhance selection of recombinant E. coli, the transformed products were spread into selective LB agar containing appropriate antibiotic. Antibiotic formulation was complied to the lab’s proven antibiotics sensitivity test. We solubilized the powdered chloramphenicol in ethanol 95% and ampicillin in distilled water until final concentration of 25 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml, respectively. They were then added into LB media with ratio of 1:1000. After spread into LB agar, the transformed products were then incubated at 370C overnight.
In the case of transformation with pSB1C3, to select the colony with desired inserts, we performed red-white screening. If the grown colonies were red, it indicated that the colonies were transformed by native pSB1C3-mRFP and we excluded the colonies. We only picked white colonies (indicated that mRFP had been successfully removed from pSB1C3 and possibly replaced by insert) to be further confirmed for desired insert presence by colony PCR. We used VF2 and VR primers (i.e. iGEM standard primers) for confirmation of inserts in pSB1C3, while we used our hand-made designed primers for confirmation of inserts in pQE80L.
Finally, we performed mini-prep plasmid isolation for any confirmed colonies with desired inserts in pSB1C3. We grew the colonies in LB liquid medium at 370C shaken overnight. Sequencing was performed to confirm the sequence of inserts before submitted to iGEM Headquarters.
Part II: SDS-PAGE Confirmation of Expressing BioBricks
Confirmation of any expressing DT and HT protein in recombinant E. coli BL21(DE3) was done via SDS-PAGE after isopropyl-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction for 4 hours in 370C in terrific broth (TB) medium with am"
