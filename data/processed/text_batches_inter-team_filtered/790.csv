Safety
    Our team members have organized a laboratory safety test. Everyone have read and learned the safety protocols carefully and apply them in our experiments, and prepared our work surroundings to ensure the biosafety of our experimental environments.
Safe lab work
Which organisms we use?
     Our starting strain is Escherichia coli that is biosafety classification of 1 based on U.S. Public Health Service Guidelines. The odorless host (the tnaA gene deletion strain of Escherichia coli ) is introduced in our experiments. These organisms are commonly used with safety in our lab. And the Staphylococcus epidermidis used in the experiment is also a biosafety level 1 strain which is one of the normal skin microorganisms and not pathogenic. We also sterilized the equipment before and after the experiment , by which we minimize the risk of infection. We process our experimental samples reasonably and our experiments will comply with laboratory safety guidelines.
What we do with our organisms?
    Our bacteria will be engineered to express a series of enzymes. Such as Escherichia coli atoDA and Clostridium acetobutylicum adhE2 were co-expressed in the host strain to transform E-3M2H into alcohols. Additionally, the broad-spectrum antibacterial phenyllactic acid (PLA) and the pleasant rose-like fragrance 2-phenylethanol (2-PE,) biosynthesis pathways were co-constructed in the host with circuit to achieve antibacterial and natural deodorizing effects.
What do we refer to?
    We all complied with the regulations below: 1. The general requirements for Laboratory biosafety, and other regulations about pathogenic micro"

Designing the protein expression vector. The two characteristics that we are looking for are:
Strong promoter
Inducible
In order to achieve these two aims, we will use the biobrick BBa_R0010 which is an (lac) inducible promoter and incorporate a T7 promoter to it. This process involves the removal of the -35 and -10 promoter sites and the incorporation of the T7 promoter sequence.
By mutagenesis we aim to turn the promoter elements into restriction sites (which are not found in the plamsid), thus being able to remove the promoter section and then introducing the T7 promoter sequence by ligation.

Ethics & synthetic biology
Synthetic biology strives towards using engineering principles to the practice of biology and  makes the development of biological systems possible, including development of entire  organisms, which don’t exist in nature and serve solely specified human purposes. Synthetic  biology relies on genetic engineering techniques of recombinant DNA that were first  developed in the 1970s, but synthetic biology hopes to bring these techniques many steps  forward. It aims at the development of genetic sequences that can serve as standardized  modules and be used in standardized platform organisms to cause those organisms to  exhibit predictable behaviours.
This rapidly advancing technology raises ethical questions about benefits and harms that  have not been thoroughly addressed and are subject to a worldwide debate. For example,  many countries of the EU are attempting to completely ban the use of GMOs in agriculture  and food, but on the other hand, many other countries such as the USA are growing more  and more genetically modified crops. Synthetic organisms raise questions about public  health, environmental contamination, and even abuse. This technology could be very  dangerous, if it ever falls into the wrong hands, since it could be used for bioterrorism. Other  concerns that have a more religious nature are about the very idea of creating synthetic  organisms. These tap into our instincts about what is natural and what is our relationship to  the natural world, but also about the intrinsic value of human creativity and industry.
But like most things, not even synthetic biology is purely black and white. It also opens door  to numerous practical applications of living organisms, especially bacteria. It could make our  lives easier, safer and better and could even help us to do more to preserve the  environment. Medicine, agriculture, waste treatment, fuel production and pharmaceutics  are just some of the possible are where synthetic biology could mean an enormous  breakthrough and a solution to many of our problems. One possible invention it could bring  is personalized medicine tailored to each individual. These would be more efficient than  normal medicines and would also cause fewer side effects. Also, in most cases these  applications would require GMOs, safely trapped in bioreactors; therefore the fear of these  organisms being released into naturel is redundant.

At the end, both the risks and benefits have to be taken into consideration when deciding on  ethical questions of this kind and the decision should be made simply by determining which prevail.

As of today, we don’t have HEK+EYFP, but we may not need them Split HEK293 today 1:6 for monday. Seeded 5 plates, so that we have enough for transfections and to create DMSO stocks.  Also added DIH20 to the tray at the bottom of the incubator, to keep humidity and CO2 levels constant.  Also created more FBS stocks. One for Freezing Media, another for making media for normal culture.
Week Two: 6/18/12 - 6/24/12
June 18th, 2012
We split one plate of cells and seeded two dishes 1:6. One is back up, the other to potentially use for transfections on Wednesday. We also seeded a dish 1:3 to use in transfections tomorrow for imaging. We used three plates to make cell stocks of HEK 293T. 3 cryovials contain 1.2x10^6 cells. 3 cryovials contain 1.5x10^6 cells. One plate was then used for transfections for FACs. A static image was also taken.

“BioGUIDE v1.0 software is FOR RESEARCH USE ONLY,     no medical or diagnostic use for applications of the novel Biobrick     constructs generated through our software has been described “
“No military (defense or combat) applications will be allowed in     future”
Methods
Part Extraction Standards
All information about the parts that are essential in experimental     setup of iGEM projects has been utilized. The information for the parts     available provided with all three 384 well plates in Spring 2010 distribution     have been standardized. Our standardization criteria have been discussed     in detail under Database Standardization. ER diagram has been generated     which simply describes the organization of the data. Around 70% of the     parts information has been fetched by the custom parsing code from XML     and Excel files provided by iGEM. Rest of the data had to be collected     and organized manually as the organization of these data cannot be standardized     to generate an algorithm. This step was one of the most time consuming     steps in our project. For each construct and Biobrick the information     collected was; Activity, Inducer, Activator, Repressor and Inhibitor     for promoters and Inducer, Activator, Repressor and Inhibitor information     valid for synthesized molecules (mostly proteins and RNA fragments etc.)
Combination
Rules (Image Combinations) In order to build our input/output relations     graphs first we run our algorithm on the real combination dataset which     contains all few thousand different possible combinations of the biobricks.     But after performing all combinations for the first few hundred biobricks     application’s rate slowed downed tremendously, which also become very     time consuming for displaying biobricks graphs. To overcome this bottleneck     we have developed a new strategy, where we have only used the construct     combinations of the biobricks distributed within the plates. Moreover,     according to information gathered from the subparts of the constructs     distrubuted, we also collected the subpart assembly order, such as 1st:     promoter, 2nd:rbs, 3rd:coding seq, any internal parts and the Last:     terminator. Each specific Biobrick type has been assigned a number as     a unique image ID from 1 to 19. Gathering the information on subparts     was not a direct forward process. ImageID assembly orders for each construct     has been used to extract the type information for each subpart with     that construct. This innovative approach helped us to"

Duesseldorf,2018,Team:Duesseldorf#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," As feedback it was often a relief to know more about the topic and to understand the background better.
Survey
Furthermore, we surveyed the listeners before and after each lecture in order to get a general overview of the opinion on synthetic biology. As can be seen from Fig. 1, 84% of the participants have regularly dealt with synthetic biology previously, 16% have dealt with it only now and then and none of the audience have never dealt with it at all.
It becomes clear that our lecture series initially addressed only people who have dealt with the topic before, so it can be assumed that they are no strangers to the topic.
However, 50% of participants thought that synthetic biology has little or no impact on our daily lives (Figure 2). A balance arises in this question though as the other 50% of respondents disagree and are of the opinion that synthetic biology does have an impact on our everyday lives.
One of the most interesting questions asked how much synthetic biology will change our lives has also been answered very interestingly (Figure 4), and it is particularly noteworthy that 31% have a negative view of establishing newly developed products or processes. For our lecture series this means that we not only had supporters in the audience, but also critics.
In the end it was asked if the participants will now deal more with the topic. More than 67% believe that they will continue to do so on a regular basis and 33% will do so more often (Figure 2).

Giving Everybody a Chance
It is very important for us to give everyone the chance to take a look at the synthetic life sciences and perhaps inspire them to dive deep into the field. We believe that science should be freely accessible to everyone. Everybody should be able to expand their knowledge and expertise and should have the chance to contribute to their favored scientific discipline, regardless of their financial background or country of origin.
Since this vision is not yet reality, we tried to contribute a small part to this enormous challenge. The Heinrich Heine University offers many programs for refugees who are currently not able to access science. We turned to participants of German courses and the so-called ""Sprachbuddy"" program and invited them for a discussion and experiment session.
In a comfortably sized group with people from Syria and Iran, we started out by giving a rough overview of the synthetic life sciences and introducing them to the iGEM competition in German. We were"

A1: Our track is Software, as a result, we would not submit any parts to the iGEM. Hence, we don't have chassis organism.
Q2: How will your project work?
A2: The Synthetic Biologists could use our software to transform truth table into Logic Gates with definitive biological substance, besides, they could use our Simulation feature to verify whether the result is satisfactory. If the result is good, they could use the DNA sequence to wet lab experiments.
Q3: What risks does your project pose at the laboratory stage? What actions are you taking to reduce those risks?
A3: We do not work in any wet lab capacity. We complete our project via computers.
Q4: How would your project be used in the real world?
A4: They could use our software to assist them to design gene circuits and validate them by wet lab experiments.
Q5: What risks might your project pose, if it were fully developed into a real product that real people could use? What future work might you do to reduce those risks?
A5: This project has been constructed exclusively in silico. Therefore, we anticipate no risks or safety issues from any wet lab experiment. Since we focused only on developing software and did not interacting at all with any biological components, we cannot foresee any new safety risks in combining pathogens in any new and novel way. Working and constructing new and novel biological circuits are at the risk of the experimenter. We won't take responsibility for any kind of hazards or risks arising from the results returned from our work. The safety of our fellow scientists is one of our utmost priorities, hence, any lab that wishes to use SBiDer for their own research purposes must, at all times, keep the biosafety regulations of their own institution and country in mind.

Components
RNA Thermometer:
A critical component of our system is a regulatory element that can respond to oscillatory stimuli. Our system relies on an RNA thermometer (RNAT), that is found in the 5’ UTR of the downstream gene transcript. The RNAT is a rudimentary riboswitch that responds to temperature instead of a small molecule, and forms a hairpin than blocks the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, an RBS. At high enough temperatures, the hairpin melts and allows for translation of the mRNA [1,2]. In addition to providing comparably tight control over gene expression, RNA thermometers have relatively fast kinetics since they rely simply on the melting of a few hydrogen bonds to unwind.
We sought an RNA thermometer with near binary-behavior to allow for tighter control in our system. We began with a RNAT designed by Neupert, Karcher, and Bock [3], and mutated it to make it RFC 10 compatible. The RNAT designed by Neupert and colleagues was based on the Listeria monocytogenes RNAT. We performed an analysis of the free energy of the mutated RNAT, and found that it had a similar free energy of ΔG = -9.4 kcal/mol compared to -6.7 kcal/mol to the original structure [4]. The single most effective parameter to predict the behavior of the thermometer is the free energy, and thus we determined the performances of the two RNAT should be similar.

Figure 4. Temperature-dependent functionality of the RNA thermometer and state table.
σF and PF2:
σF is a transcription factor endogenous to Bacillus subtilis and orthogonal to the E. coli transcriptional machinery [5]. While sigma factors tend to be diverse and dissimilar between different species, the bacterial RNA polymerase is highly conserved and the B. subtilis sigma factors can recruit polymerases even in E. Coli. In our system, σF acts as an activator.
PF2 is a promoter that contains the consensus binding sequence from B. subtilis for σF. Bervoets and colleagues created and characterized a library of promoters for use in E. Coli with alternative sigma factor networks. The σF/PF2 system allowed us to have tight transcriptional control of genes in allowing transcription to only occur in the"

May 10 ~ May 16, 2010 read the source code of TinkerCell and place emphasis on the simulation parts. Try to detail how it operate its modeling in sequence and detect that they use ODE and some mathematic API to simulate the biological reactions.
May 17 ~ Jun 6, 2010 specify the simulation means we will apply. I have collected some information about the methods like deterministic simulation and stochastic simulation. Meanwhile, the reaction network will have three layers: molecular reaction layer, topology layer and mathematical equations layer.

Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#S-Layer#SbpA_-_-_TEXT.html,", these proteins form inclusion bodies in E. coli. Inclusion bodies have the advantage that they are relatively easy to clean-up and are resistant to proteases. So the first purification step is to solve and set-free the inclusion bodies. This step is followed by two filtrations (300 kDa UF and 100 kDa DF/UF) to further concentrate and purify the S-layer proteins. After the filtrations, the remaining protein solution is dialyzed against ddH2O for 18 h at 4 °C in the dark. The dialysis leads to a precipitation of the water-insoluble proteins. After centrifugation of the dialysate the water-soluble S-layer monomers remain in the supernatant and can be used for recrystallization experiments.
The fluorescence of some collected, important fractions of this purification strategy is shown in Figure 4.
A lot of protein is lost during the purification especially after centrifugation steps (compared to filtrations). The fluorescence in the urea containing fractions is lowered due to denaturation of the fluorescent protein. This purification strategy is very simple and can be carried out by nearly everyone in any lab being one first step to enable real do it yourself nanobiotechnology.
Final purification strategy
Scheme of purification strategy for SbpA (fusion) proteins:
First, SbpA is expressed in E. coli under the control of a T7 / lac promoter for separation of growth and production phase due to metabolic stress of the S-layer expression. Because the SbpA protein is forming inclusion bodies in E. coli, an inclusion body purification with urea follows the cell lysis. The S-layers are further concentrated and purified by two ultrafiltration / diafiltration steps (300 kDa and 100 kDa) and afterwards dialysed against water leading to the precipitation of water-insoluble proteins. The supernatant contains the monomeric SbpA solution.

Alternative purification strategy
Sometimes the inclusion body purification does not give very clean fractions. That's why we developed another purification strategy for <partinfo>K525405</partinfo> monomers after inclusion body purification. This strategy consists of a capture with an IEX chromatography followed by a purification with HIC chromatography. Because of issues with the PES membranes we used to rebuffer our samples (see below - PES binds most of the S-layers) we lost a lot of our proteins in this step between the two chromatographies. So there was not enough protein left to stain it with Coomassie in a SDS"

TnrA Activation
Purpose
Prior to the successful microarray experiment conducted by the wetwork team, the proposed volatile sensing mechanism     tied reporter activation to the metabolism of ammonium/ammonia (NH4/NH3+). The nitrogen metabolism in B. subtilis is a convoluted mesh of reactions and (in)activation complexes mostly controlled by the TnrA transcription factor.     In order to observe the effect of NH4 uptake on the TnrA, it was necessary to have a concise behavioral diagram.     Unfortunately, no such"

Our list of twenty includes businesses that were formed from teams exclusively from North America and Europe. They also show a remarkable degree of clustering on a sub-national level. London has produced four- two from Imperial College of London (CustoMem, LabGenius) and University College London (Bento Lab, Morph Bioinformatics) each. MIT (Benchling, Ginkgo Bioworks) and the University of Washington (Experiment.com, PVP Biologics) have also produced two each. The University of Alberta (Upcycled Aromatics and Genomikon, which merged with Synbiota) has two as well and the University of Calgary’s (FREDSense) one brings Alberta’s total to three. Lastly, Ontario is home to two startups from Queen’s (Hyasynth Bio) and Waterloo (Acorn Cryotech). This leaves seven startups that are not part of a cluster; their American universities are the University of California Davis (Ambercycle), the University of Pennsylvania, (BioBots) Brown University (SynBioBeta), and the University of Texas Austin (Caribou Biosciences), and their European universities are Erasmus University/the Delft University of Technology/Leiden University/the Royal Tropical Institute (Amplino), the University of Edinburgh (Gene Advisor), and the Technical University of Denmark (Labster).
To understand the qualitative impact of these companies, we undertook two taxonomy methodologies. The first was to sort companies based on whether their product was a good, a service, or a platform, and then based on whether their good was a final good or an input to further production, a service aimed at consumers or industrial partners, and a platform for intended for a general audience or for technical work. Final goods, consumer services, and general platforms are roughly analogous to each other since they are an end product intended for mass consumption, while input goods, industrial services, and input goods, industrial services, and technical platforms are also analogous in that they contribute to further production. The table below was created with these classifications in mind. Some companies provide secondary products that are in a different category from their primary product; these were put in the appropriate box with their name in italics and added to the sum of each row/column in italics. Companies with teams in the entrepreneurship track have asterisks.

Last week, we got nothing, so why?
Where could things go wrong?
They could go wrong at the restriction digestion reaction (less likely as process is fairly robust, and had been tested the day previously.)
Ligation reaction may not have worked.. (again less likely, process is fairly robust). If the buffer isn't mixed well it may separate.
How do we test? we could perform pcr to see if the ligation took place, using primers to amplify the ligated segment checking with gel electrophoreis to identify.
Transformation reaction - (Except we ran positive controls successfully)
Still possible to have mixed up the media, since positive used Amp instead..
Tom checked the media and found that wasn't the case.
Amount of Plasmid may not have been accurate. (The only thing we didn't physically check ahead of time.)

Transformation rxn is 1 x 10 (-8/-9), still fairly efficient.
We did 2 things last night, we did the transformations into the stocks..
By using assembly strategies that don't use the same resistance as the parts, we can more efficiently screen out non-transformed pieces.
Previously in Genetic Engineering all parts and pieces had variorus resistances where as bb tries to create a standard.
Cells can be lost in replication due to metabolic costs, and new generations lacking the Costly programming tend to outgrow the special cells.
When designing the assembly strategy try to use a plasmid backbone with a different resistance to allow the filtration/screening of parts that didn't transform correctly.

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer1_-_-_TEXT.html," engineered systems reported to date have continued their reliance on the loop-mediated RNA interactions from natural systems. Although these loop interactions have been selected by evolution in nature, alternative approaches employing linear-linear RNA interactions are amenable to rational engineering and exhibit more favorable reaction kinetics and thermodynamics, factors that could be exploited to increase riboregulator dynamic range.
A riboregulator that activates gene expression must switch from a secondary structure that prevents translation to a configuration that promotes translation upon binding of a cognate trans-acting RNA. Although the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is an important factor in determining the efficiency of translation from a given mRNA, studies have found that secondary structure in regions near by the start codon also plays a critical role (Kudla et al., 2009).Furthermore, genome-wide analyses have revealed strong biases toward low secondary structures around the start codon of mRNAs from a panel of hundreds of bacterial genomes.
Toehold switch systems are composed of two RNA strands referred to as the switch and trigger (Figure 1B). The switch RNA contains the coding sequence of the gene being regulated. Upstream of this coding sequence is a hairpin-based processing module containing both a strong RBS and a start codon that is followed by a common 21 nt linker sequence coding for low-molecular-weight amino acids added to the N terminus of the gene of interest. A single-stranded toehold sequence at the 50 end of the hairpin module provides the initial binding site for the trigger RNA strand. This trigger molecule contains an extended single stranded region that completes a branch migration process with the hairpin to expose the RBS and start codon, thereby initiating translation of the gene of interest. The hairpin processing unit functions as a repressor of translation in the absence of the trigger strand. Unlike previous riboregulators, the RBS sequence is left completely unpaired within the 11 nt loop of the hairpin. Instead, the bases immediately before and after the start codon are sequestered within RNA duplexes that are 6 bp and 9 bp long, respectively. The start codon itself is left unpaired in the switches we tested, leaving a 3 nt bulge near the midpoint of the 18 nt hairpin stem. Because the repressing domain b (Figure 1B) does not possess complementary bases to the start codon, the cognate trigger strand in turn does not need to contain corresponding start codon bases, thereby increasing the number of potential trigger sequences. The sequence in the hairpin added after the start codon was also screened for the presence of"

For verification a digestion of the purified plasmid was made.   All linkers were single digested first with EcoRI and then with PstI. Uncut plasmid was also run on the gel to see the difference between cut and uncut.
All linkers obtained from the substrate screening has a length of 24 nucleotides. The oligos that we received had a total length of 60 bp because of the desired restriction sites at the ends.  When the linkers are assembled correctly into the plasmid backbone (pSB1C3) and cut with either EcoRI or PstI the length obtained is 2094 bp.
The only linker not obtained by the substrate screening BBa_K2355001 has a length of 72 bp. When assembled correctly into the plasmid backbone (pSB1C3) and cut with either EcoRI or PstI the length obtained is 2142 bp.
The uncut plasmid will run faster in the gel due to the supercoiled structure. The results of the digest is displayed in figure 18, figure 19, figure 20 and figure 21.

Paris_Bettencourt,2016,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Enzyme_-_-_TEXT.html," turn to nature in the search for enzymes with the potential ability to degrade these pigments for expression in E. coli. Three potential wine stain removers, BpuI, CatA and XylE, were successfully expressed in E. coli and are ready to be tested for their ability to degrade Anthocyanins. To take their stain removal capacity to the next level, we discovered peptide binding domains that supported the localization of the enzymes to cotton, wool, linen and silk. Here we also showed that enzymes XylE and CatA maintained their activity when fused to our Fabric Binding Domains. We believe that our fabric-specific enzyme detergents have opened a new door for the development of innovative laundry products.
Motivation and Background
Throughout human history, people have taken inspiration from nature to find solutions for everyday problems. A famous example is velcro. Velcro was inspired by the way the structure of plant burrs allowed them to attach to the furry bodies of animals.
As technology has progressed, we not only take inspiration from nature, but also control and enhance biology for our specific purposes.
We adopted this mindset when we approached this part of our project: the development of anthocyanin degrading enzymes that can be attached to a specific type of fabric.
First, we searched for enzyme candidates that could be suitable within this scope. We selected enzymes from literature based on the following three criteria:
1- the enzyme has the known ability to specifically degrade Anthocyanins, or, more broadly, polyphenols, which are the class of compounds to which red wine pigments (Anthocyanins) belong.
2 - the enzyme has been successfully expressed in E. coli
3 - the enzyme activity can be tested using spectophotography
Polyphenol degrading enzymes
Our literature search resulted in six enzymes that met these criteria.
The first enzyme of interest was the natural anthocyanin degrading Polyphenol Oxidase (PPO) from Camellia sinensis (PPO) (Jaiswal 2009). In order to optimally express this enzyme, we removed the naturally occurring signal peptide region of PPO and annotated the resulting enzyme as PPO2. Wu and coworkers reported that this signal peptide hampered the heterologous expression in E. coli (Wu et al. 2010).
We also selected the Beta-galactosidase from Vitis bellula, BG1. This enzyme was a strong candidate for our assays since it was shows to degrade anthocyanins, but unfortunately we did not manage to express it correctly in E. coli.

Surface display system
Background
The anchoring of proteins to the cell surface of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) using genetic techniques is an exciting and emerging research area that holds great promise for a wide variety of biotechnological applications, including vaccine development, whole cell catalysis, bioremediation and etc. In iGEM, the 2015 Concordia University-Canada team tried but failed to develop a protein scaffold surface display system. Development of a surface display system in L. lactis will make it a better chassis in synthetic biology.
To build a surface display system, the first thing should be considered is the cell wall anchoring motif. The most exploited anchoring regions are those with the LPXTG motifs that bind the proteins in a covalent way to the cell wall. However, to achieve versatile application, it is better to use anchoring domains that interact with the cell wall in a non-covalent way. The major autolysin of L. lactis, the cell wall hydrolase AcmA contains 3 tandem arranged LysM motifs and separated by stretches of 21 to 31 amino acids, this region is collectively termed as the cA anchoring domain. The cA domain can be fused to the N- and C- terminus of functional proteins, and can bind proteins to the cell walls of a broad range of gram-positive bacteria. Interaction of the cA anchoring domain with the cell wall is less strong than that of the LPXTG type cell wall anchoring motif. The interaction between cA and the cell wall is non-covalent. The cA domain could also be used to immobilize soluble enzymes in an active form on the cell surface of L. lactis. Like AcmA, these chimaeric enzymes could bind to L. lactis cells when added from the outside. Thus, cA fusion proteins produced using other expression systems can also be attached to the cell wall of L. lactis.
To get the protein of interest anchored to the surface of L. lactis, it should be secreted out of the cell first. The solution is a signal peptide from the Usp45 protein which is secreted out of L. lactis very efficiently. Fusion of the signal peptide of"

Sheffield,2014,Team:Sheffield#outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," 11 (age 14-16) about synthetic biology, the iGEM competition and pursuing careers in science and engineering post-secondary education. The workshop was divided into 3 sections: an introductory presentation about synthetic biology and the iGEM competition, a brainstorming session in which the students considered which problems they would choose to solve using synthetic biology, and a concluding presentation about our own project.
Our introductory presentation aimed to inform the students about what synthetic biology actually is. We provided a basic overview of how bacteria could be transformed to provide useful products, how the BioBrick registry worked, and how synthetic biology can be used to create novel solutions that could be used by communities all over the world. The students were then given an outline of what the iGEM competition is, why it exists and why they should participate in future.
After our presentation the students divided themselves into small groups of 3 or 4 and were asked to imagine they were part of an iGEM team. We asked them to think the sort of difficulties they would choose to tackle, how they would solve this problem biologically and how they would take into account the ethical or social impact their project may face.
After 10 minutes of discussion one member of the group was asked to report back to the class. A wide variety of responses were received, and the students were particularly enthusiastic about using synthetic biology for medical purposes and to solve their own practical problems.
In the final section of the workshop we presented our project to the students. We explained how fats, oils and greases can lead to blockages in drainage and sewerage systems, and how we intended to solve this using lipase and keratinase. We explained our product to the students and gave an overview of all the different social and ethical ideas we explored during our iGEM project.
At the end of the session students asked many questions and were offered a cake.

In January we went over old iGEM projects to get inspiration for our project. We also divided some roles, such as WIKI Captain, Model Captain, Lab Captain and more.
We brainstormed with the team and came up with some new ideas and did some further in depth research regarding some of these ideas. The sponsoring started by setting up a sponsor proposition.
We decided on a final project idea and made a project proposition for our advisors. We officially registered for the iGEM competition. A planning was made to ensure deadlines would be met and not forgotten.
In April we were planning how we were going to achieve our goals in the lab, we began the search for sponsors, and started the design of both our proteins and our team design.
In May we started working on our PR via social media and contacting other iGEM teams. We have created a solid yet flexible sponsoring and wet lab plan and chose our logo. We started learning HTML and CSS to create this WIKI and made our first design of the site. Also, in May our first modelling results were received and processed.
In June we designed and ordered our DNA sequences in the form of gBlocks. We also started a collaboration with the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, addressing problems of regulation of the current system regarding GMOs. We finished our protein design and incorporated this into our labwork. Halfway June, our semester ended, allowing us to concentrate on our iGEM project full-time.

The algorithms used for the predicting a de-optimzed coding sequence for the four organisms would start with an aminoacid sequence. For this method, the analysis relied on Kazusa’s codon usage datasets, the two approaches were generated. In order to simplify the calculations a script was developed with the assistance and cooperation of another student Diana Gamez, in the programing language PHP (program available in the supplementary data).
First Algorithm: sequence prediction based on similar abundance of codons.
Parting from the first aminoacid, the ideal codon was decided by 1) Obtaining the abundances for the respective coding codons in all four organisms. 2) Calculating the Euclidean distance between those abundances. 3) The codon with the minimum distance between abundance would then be selected as the appropriate triplet. This was done for all aminoacids from the iLOV protein. In an effort to mitigate selecting codons, that not only had the smallest Euclidean distance between abundances, but also a low abundance; values with higher abundance were preferred in the script.
Second Algorithm: sequence prediction is based on most abundant codon for the majority of microorganisms.
Parting from the first aminoacid, the ideal codon was decided by 1) Obtaining the abundances for the respective coding codons in all four organisms. 2) Evaluating all respective codons and select two with the highest abundance. 3) Calculating the Euclidean distance between those abundances. 4) The codon with the minimum distance between abundance would then be selected as the appropriate triplet. This was done for all the aminoacids in the iLOV sequence.
Strains, cell culture medium and growing conditions
E. coli TOP10 competent cells were kindly donated by Dr. Louise Horsfall’s laboratory (School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh, UK) throughout the project. A second E. coli strain was also requested, the LacI deficient strain: lacI785 (del)::kan JW0336-1 was obtained from Yale’s “Coli Genetic Stock Center”. Synechocystis sp. PC 6803 cultures were made available by Dr. Annegret Honsbein from the Rosser Laboratory (School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh, UK).

System #1 In Detail
The first half of our system has Bad Guy #1 as the culprit. Bad Guy #1 is capable of producing large amounts of autoinducer-1, more commonly known as Acyl Homoserine Lactone. This is through constitutive expression of the luxI gene. AHL begins to diffuse into our Champion Cell, which is constitutively expressing LuxR. LuxR protein binds to the pheromone, and the AHL-LuxR complex activates the lux pR promoter, allowing the expression of green fluorescent protein and the colicin E2 activity, immunity and lysis genes (CeaB, CeiB and CelB respectively). The champion cell now fluoresces green, and colicin expression results in the lysis of the cell and the release of CeaB, which would be taken up by Bad Guy #1. Colicin E2 would lead to the eventual destruction of Bad Guy #1, and our Champion Cell will reign supreme (those that haven't burst from the production of the Colicin proteins and are still kicking around, anyway).
This system was assembled in typical iGEM fashion. The part J23039 was transformed into E. coli thus resulting in Bad Guy #1 cells (i.e. capable of AHL production). To construct the signaling and response circuit in the Champion Cell, F2620 , I13500 and the colicin E2 operon were assembled as shown in the picture. Colicin E2 was obtained from UC Berkeley, cloned into a TOPO vector (Invitrogen), amplified using ColicinE2 primers with flanking Biobrick Restriction Sites and cloned into a Biobrick vector.
Tests were also performed, the results of which can be seen in the Results section. These involved verifying that Bad Guy #1 is able to make AHL, verifying that our Champion Cell responds to AHL produced from Bad Guy #1, and that Colicin E2 was actually capable of preventing bacterial growth.
Click on the animation above to watch our system in action.
System #2 In Detail
The other half of our system sees the aptly named Bad Guy #2 as the main adversary to our Champion Cell.
Without any AI-2 in the vicinity, however, there is downstream expression of a repressor protein, clλ, by phosphorylated LuxO, thereby masking the expression of ColicinE3 and RFP. Otherwise, without the presence of this inverter, our Champion cell would start mass production of ColE3 and RFP (indicating the"

Figure 3. the gene expression model of agr system.
As shown in figure 3 above, In the Receiver cell, the agrC and agrA gene is under the control of the P32 promoter together with the reporter module, the P2-GFP composite part. Once AIP enters into the Agr receiver system, the AgrC was phosphorylated and changed its structure at the same time. Immediately, the AgrA was phosphorylated and then promoted the target gene to express, thus resulting in fluorescence. [4]
Modeling:
In our study, we divided the Agr system into Agr sender system and Agr receiver system. In model 1, we quantified the peptide concentration accumulation of Agr sender system. In model 2, we want to quantify the GFP relative concentration expressed by the target gene under different concentration of AIP.
Assumption:
1. phosphorylation and enzyme complex formation rates must be significantly higher than protein expression rates.
2. The concentration of [CP] is in a quasi-steady state.
The equations of this model after simplified read [5]:
Attention:
1. [P] denote the concentration of AIP, [A] denote the concentration of AgrA and similarly for the other proteins, [CP] denote the obvious enzyme complex and [A+] be AgrA phosphorylated.
2. AIP exists (or is only a chemical player) in the extracellular environment whereas cell enzymes (such as AgrA and AgrC) exist only within a cell.
3. The maximum promoter expression rate was 1.
The remaining symbols are defined in Table 2.
Table 2 Definition of symbols used in the recursion equation
Analysis and Results:
The gene expression of different type of Agr systems under different concentration of AIP was shown in figure 2. When the concentration of AIP was small, the extracellular signal molecule concentration was always at a fairly low level, and when the concentration of AIP is achieved at 0.02umol/l, the signal molecules began to increase rapidly, and we found that the signal growth trend was delayed but not stopped, and the growth rate of the curves were different due to different type.
Figure 4. the gene expression of different type of Agr systems under different concentration of AIP
Throughout the plots we observe step-like behavior - this is typical for quorum-sensing systems that react sensitively to local cell densities. The step-like shape of the curve agrees with previously published results [6].

The rest of the week: I don't have much new stuff to say about Spectacles, as I've been working to get Spectacles bulletproofed for demo use. The most annoying part is opening and closing devices; I have to keep track of the visual resources that go with each device, and then open a new tab if that device doesn't already have an open tab.
Week Nine - 7/27
Monday: Devices now have their own placeholder image (just a big black box), instead of the 'No Image' placeholder.
Late update: According to my notes for this week, device tabs can be closed and re-opened, and a few bugs were fixed (like labels properly updating after a name change).
Week Ten - 8/3
Late update: Somehow, I forgot to update for an entire week! My notes say that I added a Save As option to the Notepad editor and Cut/Copy/Paste to the workspace. I also added an image output function that spits out the part images on one line. We also got Spectacles hooked up to Clotho (Spectacles can send sequence data to the Sequence View and part names to the Algorithm manager). The image paths got quite screwy when we converted Spectacles into a Clotho tool, so I spent most of the week fixing that.
Week Eleven - 8/10
Updating this has gotten rather annoying. This week I'm working on rules enforcement and user preferences.
Update - 9/15
Somehow I forgot to update this page. The fall semester has started, and Spectacles still lacks Eugene rules enforcement. User preferences are now available though, along with user-definable part ""palettes"". -- Legor17 08:34, 16 September 2009 (UTC)

Users could understand the underlying reasons why a curve reaches its peak from the network. We also plan to show the topological structure of reactions in network. By connecting species with reactions, users can get a clear picture of the interconnections between species.
User-friendly input with fun
Powered by MoDeL, iGaME has already relieved users from inputting massive amount of data. However, we are still looking forward to make the input process more fun. Besides providing a graphical scene, we are planning to have more elements like story telling and character selecting. Moreover, result grading and multi-user interacting are to be added to make our software a real game.
Database Development Kit
Though we have presented the detail document of RFC 55 for MoDeL, modelers may still found it a tough job to construct a usable database. The Database Development Kit aims at aiding modelers with easy-to-use development tools. To achieve this, graphical tools for creating, removing, modifying data in database are needed. Parameter estimation tools and MoDeL syntax checking tools are also wanted. We are planning to have this kit in our future version, which will greatly reduce the difficulties for users to construct their own databases.
We believe the future of iGaME is bright !

Without AHL, transcriptional level of lux pR is extremal low because of lack of activator, LuxR-AHL dimer. If we add AHL into the system within a very short time, expression of mature GFP is expected to increase significantly. To measure behaviors of the system consisting of BBa_F2620 using our software tool, we construct a system using plasmid pSB3C5 and Part:BBa_F2620 as well as a reporter gene:
where we use two consecutive terminators to indicate a complete termination. Time course simulation was performed to generate transfer function of stable GFP concentrations versus AHL concentration. It is of high consistence with experiment done by Haseloff Lab, MIT :

For the full protocol see the StabyExpressTM T7 Kit Manual, transformation using chemically competent cells .
Ligations
All the ligations were achieved in the Assembly standard 10 . We followed the assembly protocol recommended by New England BioLabs . The first ligation concerns promoter, RBS and RFP. We cut the promoter plasmid with the restriction enzymes EcoR1 and Spe1. We cut the RBS+RFP plasmid with EcoR1 and Xba1. This one was dephosphorylated to prevent it from self-ligating without any inserts. Seeing that both plasmids are ampicillin resistant, we cut the promoter plasmid with AflIII and ScaI. This will prevent any promoter plasmid from being  transformed. At this stage we have promoter, RBS and RFP in the RBS-RFP ampicillin resistant plasmid ( see figure below ).
RBS$-$RFP ampicillin resistant plasmid
We transformed DG1 E.coli competent cells with this construction. The culture was left overnight (37°C) on ampicillin resistant medium. We selected the appropriated colonies and put them back at 37°C in liquid medium.
We proceeded with the extraction of the plasmid using the GenElute Plasmid Miniprep Kit
(Sigma-Aldrich ref (PNL350))
. In order to verify our construction, we cut upstream (EcoR1) and downstream (Pst1) of the Promoter+RBS+RFP. Then we proceeded with the electrophoresis of the digested product. We tested the construction by adding IPTG to a sample and this one was analyzed by fluorescent microscopy.
The second ligation concerns hfsG, hfsH and the terminator. Seeing that both hfsG and hfsH
plasmids were ampicillin resistant and that we did not have appropriate enzymes to cut one of them, we chose to ligate hfsH and the terminator (which have different antibiotic resistances). The terminator plasmid is the destination plasmid and hfsH is the insert. The selection was made with kanamycine (following the above-cited protocol). After that, hfsG was added to this construction. At this stage, we have hfsG, hfsH and terminator in the terminator kanamycin resistant plasm"

After this, the cultures were diluted into a 96-well plate at 8 different concentrations of inducer (arabinose), ranging from 0 to 6.4 uM. The plate was then incubated in a Wallac Victor3 multi-well fluorimeter at 37 degrees Celsius, and repeating measurements of absorbance and fluorescence were taken at 10 minute intervals, with shaking after each measurement. Untransformed BW27783, at each concentration of arabinose, was used to measure background fluorescence, and wells containing only broth were included to measure background absorbance. The machine settings used were identical to those described in the paper referenced above.
With this data, we aimed to calculate the steady-state per-cell GFP concentration during log-phase growth, for both BBa_I0500 and BBa_I20260 (measurement kit for the standard promoter, J23101). The ratio of these values would then characterize the strength of the AraC/pBAD promoter in units of RPU. The justification for this approach can be found in the supplemental material of the paper referenced above.
Results
The results of the experiment were anomalous, and considered too unreliable to be conclusive. There was no clear relationship between cell fluorescence and inducer concentration.
The fluorescence curve did not qualitatively match the predictions of the model; across all concentrations, and for each of the 3 cultures, we observed a high initial fluorescence, with a rapid drop to a lower steady state value. For each culture, this drop in fluorescence aligned well with the growth curve.
In addition, the untransformed BW27783 cells exhibited consistently higher fluorescence than cells containing BBa_I0500, which was highly anomalous. Because of this, we could not reliably use these cells to measure background fluorescence.
Below, a sample graph of Total Fluorescence is shown for each of the 3 cultures. These are curves of the total fluorescence for each culture, averaged over 3 replicates for each culture.
Discussion
It is believed that an error in our strain of BW27783 is most likely responsible for the anomalous qualitative features of our data. This is because for each concentration of inducer, the untransformed BW27783 cells exhibit a fluorescence curve highly similar to that of BW27783 containing BBa_I0500, and yet the untransformed cells should not be expressing GFP.
Prior to the measurement assay, BW27783 cells transformed with BBa_I0500 were plated and examined for fluorescence, both with and without"

InterLab study kit.
Team  Marburg strives to establish Vibrio natriegens as the new chassis organism for synthetic biology. 1 V. natriegens is a gram-negative, non-pathogenic, marine bacteria with a population doubling time of seven minutes. 2 In comparison, the common model organism Escherichia coli has a doubling time between 40 and 64 min. 3 By using V. natriegens culture growing time was reduced significantly so that one day cloning became feasible.                  Team Marburg also built and characterized a flexible golden-gate-based part collection, consisting of more than 100 parts,                  which enables them to create complex pathways in a short period of time.                   The V. natriegens strains VibriClone and VibriExpress were designed for cloning and protein expression applications, respectively.                  Moreover, team Marburg established the first synthetic metabolic pathway in this organism now producing the platform chemical 3-hydroxypropionate.                  In addition, they developed an accelerated workflow for metabolic engineering along the way. 1
As team Marburg works on such an exciting project we were very interested in working with their new model organism.                  Our collaboration started on the 9th September 2018 when team Marburg sent us their kit.                  The kit arrived a few days later and comprises one plate with V. natriegens wild type,                  20 aliquots of recovery media (BHI + v2 + 680 mM sucrose),                  3 falcon tubes with 50 mL 10x v2 Salt (204 mM NaCl,                  4.2 mM KCl, 23.14 mM MgCl2),                  4 falcon tubes with 2.5x electroporation buffer (680 mM sucrose , 7 nM K2HPO4, pH 7),                  a 10 mL-falcon tube with LB + v2 for the overnight culture for the competent cells,                  8 1.5 mL-Eppendorf tubes with the following plasmids from the InterLab study, as well as a protocol (Appendix: Protocol Vibrigens Interlab.pdf) and a team-prospect.

SDSZ-China,2017,Team:SDSZ-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," initial reactant, instead of UDCA, our expected product. This conundrum                         stopped us from reaching any further into the experiment. At this time, Prof. Xu suggested us to                         separate the two enzymes into two steps. (see figure 2) After listening to his suggestion, our                         team worked together and produced our new experiment plan with a two step reaction instead of                         one. In this way, the end product will not be transformed back into CDCA, and the mass                         production of USCA proves to be successful. As well as enhancing the biopharmaceutical effect of                         UDCA, we also aims to reduce the production cost. When we were designing the experiment, we                         included the usage of cofactors: NADH and NADP+. However, the cost of cofactors can be immense                         if they are not regenerated. After hearing about our problem, Prof. Xu suggested us finding                         enzymes to help with the regeneration of cofactors. With his suggestion in mind, we eventually                         employed GDH(Glutamate Dehydrogenase) to regenerate the cofactor NADP+, and LDH(Lactate                         Dehydrogenase) to regenerate the cofactor NADH. Carefully answering our questions and giving us                         other valuable information and cases about our topic, Prof. Xu used his actions to encourage us                         in refining our experiment and to give it a try.
Outreach
Contact with Local Hospital and Patients
In addition, we contact local patients from Xuanwu hospital who suffered from liver cirrhosis to                         discuss the curing effects and prices of various UDCA-contained medicines in the market to                         determine our direction. Through our interviews, we understood that current UDCA medicines in                         the market are unaffordable for patients with average or below average income in long term                         treatment. Also, medicine which price can be accepted by the patients has relatively weak curing                         effect. In order to solve this problem, we consulted experts from doctors from Xuanwu Hospital.                         She reported that UDCA has a large pharmaceutical application. As well as UDCA’s usage in                         dissolving gallstone, its efficacy in primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing                         cholangitis (PSC) as an adjunct to medical therapy has been well established. Newer indications                         include its use in the management of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, post liver transplant                         rejection, graft-versus-host disease and acute viral hepatitis, where it not only relieves                         symptoms of cholestasis but also arrests ongoing hepatocyte necrosis.

Q：Hi, how are"
UCSD_Software,2014,Team:UCSD Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," proposed genetic circuits behave to a more quantitative model.
Web Application
Framework of the SBiDer Interface
Structure Overview
SBiDer was developed off of CyNetShare , a HTML5 application designed to make utilizing and visualizing CytoscapeJS graphs simple and intuitive through use of the javascript library AngularJS . The object of the SBiDer web tool is to visually present genetic circuits and possible interactions between them in addition to providing relative information about each device’s construction and function through reference material. Images of devices and image data, in Systems Biology Markup Language ( SBML ), are provided by a Synthetic Biology Open Language ( SBOL ) visual rendered through use of the popular PigeonCad for intuitive understanding and universal sharing. Users are also provided with the PubMed ID’s of all genetic devices so that they may be able to access and verify entries information in the PubMed journal service . SBiDer utilizes and extends the web-application architecture used by the Owl Datasheet generator project from iGEM 2013.
Visualizing the Network
CytoscapeJS is a widely used visualization library written in Javascript that presents complex relationships in more easily understood figures of nodes connected by edges. The library’s popularity and supportive community make it an ideal framework from which the SBiDer team can reach a large audience of synthetic biologists. Characterizing information about the genetic devices can be easily stored inside CytoscapeJS’s nodes as data . Unfortunately, manipulating, editing, and updating this data autonomously without further means poses a difficult challenge that is resolved with the use of AngularJS and CyNetShare.
Dynamic Interface and Data Handling
The large portion of the SBiDer framework relies on the data manipulation and two-way databinding provided by the AngularJS javascript library which provides the interactivity to the web application. Key to this is the two-way binding that allows information to be changed through the User Interface (UI) and updated between the scripting code and html without need to constantly resync data with the server, allowing for quicker response times for users and cleaner source code for further development. The ability to pass data from the UI to the SBiDer application also simplified the procedure for User-generated entries to the SBiDer database. The major alternative library was JQuery, an older and popular method of achieving a dynamic interface that doesn’t have the crucial feature of two-way databinding. Data is passed from server to client through a JSON string which is parsed by AngularJS for the SBiDer application to visualize the network using CytoscapeJS as well as updating the web page without need to reload the window unlike when employing JQuery."

b. Advantages of adding microbes rhythm in therapy
Frankly speaking, almost everyone has the experience of not taking medicines on time. In fact, patient compliance has always been a significant problem effecting the therapeutic results. It is common that a patient has to take different pills in different time each day, using the engineered E.coli to secrete medicines with rhythm would greatly simplify the medications and improve drug therapy compliance, therefore, ensures the curative effect. What's more, long-termed treatments would become available for any diseases or symptoms associated with time.
c. Meaning of hereditary time limits
By far, many iGEM projects are based on the construction of strains used in  medical treatments, but planting living microorganisms into human body has great potential safety hazards. However, if the microbes have time limit devices triggered by inverted modules which would let microbes commit suicide in calculated time, we might be able to use them to treat human. Such microorganisms would die naturally after function, and since the condition of inverted modules is hereditary, the suicide process of the group would not be disturbed by cell fission, which would avoid most of the potential hazards. Time limits are also capable of more sophisticated applications, for example, timed initiation of gene expression. In the future biological industries and biomedical fields, its prospects are almost limitless.
Recombinase System
The design of our project is mainly based on recombinase system, a complete recombinase system comprises of a kind of recombinase and its corresponding recombination target sites(RTSs). Here are the recombinase system's principle.
a. when two RTSs are in the same direction, the sequences between will be cut out and form a circular DNA under the performances of corresponding recombinase. b. when two RTSs are in reverse direction, the sequences between will be flipped under the performances of corresponding recombinase.
Description
Matching and Testing
The goal of our group is to provide a systematic solution to Micro-timer construction, which includes optimization of synthetic elements and measurement of invertase module timing length. Hence, we developed a real-time invertase dynamics testing system to observe the performance of each combination of different elements. The real-time invertase dynamics testing system consists of two different plasmids in E. coli, namely pInv-gen and pInv-rep. pInv-gen generates invertase-EGFP fusion protein when induced; pInv-rep produces mcherry signal when inverted by invertase-EGFP.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2016,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," the constants regarding our model (see wet lab page). If the expression rate and activity of PAL and phenylalanine diffusion rate is known, the process of phenylalanine hydrolysis inside the cell can be discribed by the following equations:
Simulation of phenylalanine hydrolysis in vivo
We first simulated the break down of phenylalanine by PAL being expressed within the cell. The steady state concentration of PAL inside the cell is assumed to be in the range between 10-4 and 10-7 M. Here the four versions of graphs for each magnitude of PheP steady state concentration, ranging from 10-3 to 10-6 M are shown. The amounts of phenylalanine inside the cell, outside the cell, and the amount of trans-cynnamic acid (in or out?) are presented in the graphs.
Comparison of transport rate of phenylalanine and production rate of TCA under different concentration conditions of PheP and PAL steady state.
Discussion
It is clear that the concentration of PheP has the biggest influence on the efficiency of probiotic. If the cell expressed sufficient amounts of the transporter, it could efficiently reduce the concentration of phenylalanine under laboratory conditions. With this in mind, phep gene under a constitutive promoter was cloned to enhance the uptake of phenylalanine. However, it is not likely that such amounts of PheP will be reached; therefore, alternative measures that could increase the membrane permeability should be applied. As for PAL, it can be seen in graph 2 that the concentration of PAL needs to be in the range between 10-5 and 10-4 M for an observable phenylalanine concentration decrease. As PheP assists the diffusion of phenylalanine into the cell, it then depends on the rate of phenylalanine breakdown.
Readjustment of the model by PAL expression experiment
The model having shown that we will need a certain amount of PAL expression to have a decent conversion of TCA, we proceeded to measuring expression of PAL. The wet lab showed that there is increase in expression of PAL that flattens out after approximately 4 hours; this curvature can be approximated by an exponential function:
which is the solution of:
For OD600 = 1, the corresponding cell DW is ~ 0.39g/L. Therefore, the maximum expression of PAL can be approximated as:
and δ to be approximately:
Now that we know the approximate PAL production over time, we can make the model reflect that in order to make it more accurate."

The second (and last day) had two interesting activities. The first was the meetings with different experts from the university, which privately asked each team about controversial issues. To see if these issues had been taken into account and the possible solutions and consequences were debated.
To close the event, a poster presentation session was held, which was very enriching to know how to present our project in Boston..
One of the things that were achieved in this meet up was the agreement with the UPF-CRG-Barcelona group to organize an activity in their meet up. Activity that is explained in the following session (and that gave rise to a greater collaboration).
Barcelona
Spanish Meet Up (Barcelona)
This meet up took place between Saturday 18 and Monday 20 August in the city of Barcelona and was organized by one of the two teams of this same city, the UPF-CRG-Barcelona. In it, all the teams from Spain were called, which all but the Valencia team attended. To this meet up they were representing the whole team: Laura, Iván and Francisco. The meet up took place in the Biomedical Research Park of Barcelona (PRBB), center where the host team operates and where they started with a welcome activity. This activity consisted of a game where each one of the assistants of each team presented themselves, so that the subsequent environment was much more relaxed.
The next activity was the one organized by our team. In this activity we proposed to carry out a collaborative guide in which each group would give the main ideas on how they have solved the main problems that have arisen in iGEM. The structure we proposed was followed. We collected these ideas and wrote a complete guide. We explain this collaboration in a later section of the collaborations. After this, some playful activities were carried out on the beach, including volleyball games.
During the morning of the second day, a more detailed presentation of each team's project was made. There was 30 minutes to expose each project in detail. This activity was very useful because the rest of the teams, besides getting to know the details of each project well, could intervene to give advice on how to make the presentations. Each team took a series of points in which they could be reinforced in the face of the presentation of the Giant Jamboree.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html," two chains of the template are equivalent: it makes no difference to the tree structure (Huffman code of each node) if they are exchanged. Hence, several equivalent chains should be matched to a certain set of chains in the species only once.
The algorithm of species matching is of the most importance since it provides technical support for structure-based description of species and reactions. It costs most of the running time. We will try to increase the efficiency of the codes of this part.
Generation of products based on reaction templates
Within MoDeL definitions, product templates are composed of both ST parts and NST parts. The ST parts are all transfered from reactants or modifiers. A transfer table is defined in each reaction template to label where does each ST part comes from and goes to. It seems to be very easy to generate Chain-Node structure of products from reactants and mod modifiers based on the transfer table. However, it doesn't.
Consider first a template reaction with one reactant, X-A-B-Y, where A and B are both NST parts and X and Y are both ST parts with type ANY. If it could be digested by a certain enzyme, the products should be X-A and B-Y. In the real biological system, if there is a species with structure C-A-B-C, where the first part C and the last C binds to form a tree node. If we try to digest the A-B bond, the species would not be split into two pieces as expected because the two products are connected by the tree node. To generate the structure of products correctly, we design a three-step mix-trim-split algorithm to solve this problem.
Mixing, trimming and splitting: three-step algorithm to generate products.
The first step is to mix reactants and products. The mixture includes all chains of reactants except for those which are matched to the templates as well as all trees. It also includes all chains and trees of products. And now we have a mixed species with chains and trees from different sources. It is worth noting that chains and trees of modifiers will not be added into the mixture. The next step is to trim the trees. Trees with leaf nodes that are not defined in chains will be removed from the forest. The last step is to split the products out from the mixture. This is because the mixture may not be one standalone complex. For example, it may have two unbound and uncorrelated chains. In other words, some chains that are not connected with others via tree nodes should not be incorporated into other species. The final standalone split species are real products in the system.

Overview
 
 
    We are very concerned about the public engagement in synthetic biology. We have to admit that transgene has been doubted since it came into being, and the idea of synthetic biology is heard much less, which make the public much easier to misunderstand it. Apparently, synthetic biology will not “save the world”, but it has a lot of potential to make it a better one. As iGEMers, we hope to contribute to expand the public understanding of synthetic biology, so that to save the potential from the public’s misunderstanding. From another aspect, burying ourselves in the lab is not a sensible idea, so we need the voices outside lab to help us to know what we have been engaged in better. So we organized some activities concerned public engagement to interact with people. To our satisfactory, we got positive feedbacks and were inspired in a way.

Run these mini-prep samples on the gel to check for DNA
Observations and Hypothesis
When the 12 tubes (each with 5ml LB plus E. coli cells) were taken out of the orbital incubator it was seen that the tubes possessing JM109 cells + BBa_C0076 were clear compared to the other 'cloudy' tubes. This means that the transformant E.coli in the other tubes grew successfully but there was no E. coli growth in the tube where BBa_C0076 transformants should have been.
This means that the so-called colonies found on the LB + amp plate containing the E. coli + BBa_C0076 were not colonies at all! This means that the attempts to transform both BBa_C0077 and BBa_C0076 have failed.
After analysis of the situation, the team studied the plasmid in which the two BioBricks are found. It turns out that both BioBricks are carried by the same plasmid backbone - pSB2K3 - and that this plasmid DOES NOT CONFER AMPICILLIN RESISTANCE! The resistance it bears is kanamycin resistance - this is why the attempted transformations have not grown colonies on the plates. This error has slowed down progress but it has also taught the team some valuable lessons in organisation and lab planning.
Procedure
Mini-Preps for BBa_C0056, BBa_B1002 and BBa_R0077 transformants
The mini-preps carried out on the three sets of transformed JM109 cells was done using Phil's Mini Method protocol . There weren't any particular changes to the protocol but a suggestion was made to use the aspirator/vacuum pump when removing the supernatant in step 2 (where Solution I + RNAse is added) - this method ensures rapid removal of supernatant and also saves on waste flasks.
When using the Speed Vac machine in step 9, the Speed Vac protocol was observed to ensure the machine doesn't get damaged by incorrect handling.
Once the mini-prep procedure was completed the plasmid samples were stored in the -20C freezer for later use.
DNA Gel Electrophoresis
To show that we have DNA in our samples and that the DNA is not anything but our desired BioBricks (within their correct plasmids) we carried out DNA gel electrophoresis on our plasmids. Although we loaded the samples as the electroph"

As a webpage it’s much more accessible - anyone (even on a phone) could use it without having to install any custom programs which would take both time to install and might require a license.
As far as we’re aware, we’re the first iGEM team to ever put up something like this. The closest was Pretoria UP 2016, but our graphs also contained our entire mass action kinetics model, instead of just a visualization.
It was built in JavaScript and therefore not limited by proprietary license agreements, and doesn’t require Java applets to be enabled (which modern browsers no longer support due to stability and security issues). [2]
JavaScript follows ECMA’s open standard so it can run on purely open-source tools. This helps acheive “iGEM’s goal of making everything in the competition open source”. [3] There are also a lot more open source libraries available for JavaScript which means other teams can build upon our work easier. These include Chart.js, the library we are using to draw the graphs.
Finally, our JavaScript code ran faster than our MATLAB code, which we attribute to both our greater experience in JavaScript and the aggressive optimisation that’s been done by vendors trying to compete for the fastest browsers. [4]
Initial mass action kinetics model
We created our first model following a meeting with Thomas Ouldridge at Imperial, who recently coauthored a paper about mathematically modeling toehold-mediated strand displacement. In the meeting we agreed that we’d need to model the different states of the toehold switch. We also discussed modeling the miRNA binding and unbinding to and from the toehold base-by-base. We later decided against this, as whilst it may have been useful for learning about the kinetics of toehold switches it would not have given us useful information to put into our design process and would have overcomplicated our model.
We first modelled a simple system of 4 substances with reversible reactions as follows:
Where CTS, PBTS and OTS represent the toehold switch in closed, partially bound and open states respectively. At this point we didn’t know the value of the rate constants so we used placeholders.
This was useful as it gave us experience programming in MATLAB, which we hadn’t done before, as well as forced us to learn the foundations for the maths we’d need later; mainly ODEs. Khan Academy was very helpful with this.
With all three reactions being reversible, MATLABs dsolve function was not able to"

i) Introduction
In this project the last step is the  death of our bacteria to elute the protein(LUSH) bounded product methanol which is one of the precursors of biofuel. In our modified bacteria, the death of cells occurs by temperature dependent cell lysis device. The expression of this device takes place at 42 C since there is an RNA thermometer part in upstream of this device. At the downstream of this device there is an lysis casette. When transcription initiated at 42C holin and endolysin is expressed from this device and make cell dead.
ii) Background
This composite part consists of promoter, RNA thermometer, GFP and lysis casette. The upstream part of this composite is T7 promoter  (BBa_I712074) which is strong promoter from T7 bacteriophage. For strong transcription T7 promoter expression"

To determine the maximum specific growth rate (µmax), the natural logarithm of the OD600 values was plotted against the cultivation time. The slope of the linear regression through the exponential phase gives µmax. The graphical determination of µmax for the shake flask cultivation is shown in Figure 4
Figure 4: Graphical determination of µmax. The highest specific growth rate was determined for each culture by plotting the natural logarithm of OD600 against the cultivation time. The slope of the linear regression through the exponential phase gives µmax.
The highest specific growth rate can be observed for the negative controls E. coli BL21(DE3) and E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PtNTT2 with values of 1.201 ± 0.070 h-1 and 1.212 ± 0.029 h-1, respectively. The lowest specific growth rate could be observed for E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-TAT-SP-PtNTT2 with a value of 0.946 ± 0.030 h-1. Based on the specific growth rate, the minimal doubling time was calculated using the following equation:

Do you think it is morally acceptable to use superior organism (e.g. fishes, cats, rabbits) for science purpose?
The percentage of affirmative answers in the question of interest ( 13 ) is clearly higher than the media of all values  Furthermore, we were very interested in the discordance of opinions about the use of microorganisms or of complex organisms: such difference becomes more pronounced when the employment of both type of organisms is aimed at scientific art [87.85%], instead of scientific research [79.25%]. Another intriguing data is the percentage of people [4.7%] who agree for using microorganisms for scientific research but not for science art.
We carried out a multivariate analysis on the data collected during our project presentation in secondary and high schools. The first graph is referring to the set of questions we asked the students to answer before the presentation: in this multivariate analysis, we associate to each student a specific set of answers and, using the program PAST, we plotted them to investigate whether there was similarity in their answering schemes. Each point in the graph represents a student with his/her set of answers and the distance between the points is linked to the number of answers that are different. The green lines represent the most discriminating questions: the longer the line, the more different the answers. On the other hand, in red is shown the middle value, or the predominant value in the cluster.
As we can see, the points form some clusters, so the students can be divided in different categories, which are their belonging schools. As the first survey is intended to test the students’ background, or their base knowledge, we can infer that the clustering is the result of being in different schools, or even in different classes, because the teacher can influence somehow a student’s opinion or interests.
The second graph is referring to the survey that we gave to the students after the presentation.
In this case, the points don’t form any cluster, showing that there isn’t an evident link between the differences in the answers given by the students and their belonging schools.
We also correlated the answers of secondary school students to those of high school students, creating a ""clustering"" graph for each part of the survey . Each branch at the bottom of the chart represents a student, represented by the name of the school belonging. The various branches join together at short distances if the answers are very similar or"

both strains show very similar behavior. With Glucose as the solely carbon source, the curve presents a distinct exponential phase corresponding to the consumption of this substrate. After Glucose is consumed, OD seems to drop. Although there is not a decrease in cells, this drop might be due to morphological changes in the cells typical of a shift in the metabolism. As for the curves representing the mixed carbon, there are two exponential phases, the first corresponding to the glucose consumption and the second to the Galactose.
The next two graphs represent the variation of the GFP signal corrected and normalized with OD to subtract any variability that could come from the differences of growth
GFP signal, corrected and normalised for the degradable GFP
GFP signal, corrected and normalised for the non-degradable GFP
As one can see, there is a significant difference between this two constructs in terms of GFP signal. As expected, the signal from the degradable GFP is much lower than the signal showed by the non-degradable GFP, as the GFP that is not being degraded is accumulating and giving a stronger signal.
This results go in line with the results published by Avery and Mateus [3] that state that the degradable GFP has a 14 times shorter half-life than the non-degradable.
Therefore, based on this results we demontrate that the biobrick BBa_K194002 submited, presents a good option as a fast degradable GFP for yeast. We show that both biobricks codes for Green Fluorescent Protein and that the addition of the sequence from Cln2 results in a strain with lower levels of GFP when the genes are expressed from the same promoter in plasmids with same copy number in the same strain

Rephrased in our perspective, it becomes: in order to consummate products, we need to need them. […] This industry, that must match the hunger of the goods to be consummated with our hunger for them, is called “advertisement”.
[…] But the needs that the production of human needs has to satisfy are not only those of the products (needs that we satisfy by buying them), but also those of the production technique, since this technique requires continuously that everything it can do was done.”
Günther Anders, The Outdatedness of Human Beings 2. On the Destruction of Life in the Era of the Third Industrial Revolution, unpublished in English. Originally in German. Translated from French.
Team discussion
I would like to highlight something that for me is a problem. Today, marketing creates needs and technique try, and in general succeed in, producing something to meet them. Personaly, I think that the synthetic biology should meet real needs, and not what I call “false needs”. I mean synthetic biology should find easier, cheaper solutions to create molecules or decontaminate environment. For example, with our project we give an easier solution to the treatment of hemochromatosis.
Günther Anders clearly articulates technique, consumption and advertisement. For him the alienation by technique is not produced by economical structures, on the contrary alienation is originally due to technique, producing only then economical structures that suit its needs for development and consumption. Advertisement is the main strategy to ensure an unrestricted development of techniques regardless of their ends. Thus, advertisement becomes an ethical choice: either we accept to serve technique by advertising even its useless productions, or we choose to regain control on it by stopping excessive advertisement.
Synthetic biology has not reached its production phase yet, so “alienating advertisement” is only a threat in the near future. Today synthetic biology is in its expanding phase, it is thus normal for this discipline to test its possibilities. The danger arises when it absolutely wants to make its investments profitable. Then, a research topic becomes a new product or a new technique. If it is really useful it will find its way into the economy, but we should be afraid that it would be abusively advertised. Some philosophers think with G. Anders that advertisement constitutes a moral fault in itself because it transforms human beings in means to support the production of unnecessary technical and biotechnological objects. The French philosopher Gilbert Simondon (1924-1989) thinks contrary to G. Anders that technique does not necessarily alienate us"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

Analyze composition of fish pond water
In order to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We"

ETH_Zurich,2015,Team:ETH Zurich#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," problem: a component of the medium seemed to react with our kit. After a bibliographic search, we decided that removing FBS from the medium was our best chance to get reliable calibration curves and measurements (researchgate.net) .  We also incorporated a centrifugation step after the collection of the sample to remove any cell that could stay in suspension.
In the case of bacteria, we wanted to take into consideration their fast growth compared to mammalian cells, so we measured the OD600 at each time point to have a correct normalization.
Lactate concentrations were first measured per well, and then normalized by the number of cells present in the well (see protocol about the measurement of Lactate in mammalian cells). The results can be seen in Figure 4.
Figure 16. Total concentration of lactate in a well of a 96-well plate (upper image) and normalized values of lactate per cell(lower image).
As can be seen in Figure 16, in the case of bacteria our results confirm the first hypothesis according to which bacteria do not produce lactate. However, they seem to contradict the presence of Warburg effect, as the concentration of lactate per cell is higher in 3T3 than in Jurkat cells. We came across some possible explanations for this phenomenon:
3T3 is a murine cell line, while Jurkat cells are a human cell line. It could be possible that basal murine lactate levels are higher than in humans. For checking this hypothesis, we wanted to use human fibroblasts. Unfortunately, none of the labs of our department had any adequate cell line for our purposes and due to time constrains we could not ask other departments.
3T3 are adherent cells, while Jurkat cells are non-adherent. Although both cell lines were seeded for not reaching confluency in the next two days it is still possible that the different cell density influenced the metabolism and therefore the lactate production.
In conclusion, we consider that the choice of the 3T3 as a control line was not our best option, but was done due to availability of the cell line and our inexperience using mammalian cells. For future experiments, we want to change our control cell line to produce more conclusive data.
1) During the process of necrosis, parts of the inner cell membrane leaflet are exposed to the environment, including phosphatidylserine. Therefore we also expect some Annexin-positive cells in the absence of apoptosis.
