Responding to IRB Issues.
We received approval on the second application; clearly, we made mistakes on our first attempt.  Keep in mind that all institutions have their own rules, but we would like to provide some advices to future iGEM team seeking IRB approval.
The essential problems with our first application are as follows:
1) We first wanted to pursue a multinational survey by use of our contacts in various countries.
We found it difficult to effectively write a detailed recruitment strategy and receive formal permission from different survey sites for each country.  Furthermore, one institution’s IRB cannot make a judgment about what is ‘ethically sound’ in other countries.  To do a multinational survey, we would have had to collaborate with endemic institutions and have them pass the study through their own IRB reviews.
2) Entered information often must be repeated in the various sections of an IRB application.  Whenever we repeated information, a couple facts would sometimes not match.  Although this mistake seems trivial, it is reportedly one of the most common problems in all the applications our IRB receives.
We eventually solved these issues by aggressively downsizing our application from a multinational study to a study involving two Baltimore markets.  The smaller size of the study allowed us to easily obtain the required permission letters from the appropriate authorities and write a detailed study protocol.  We also took greater care in proofreading our material"

Overview
Our project is about information flowing through gene-regulatory networks and it contains both theory of information and biology. The human practice we did fit our project very well. We show the students who have no idea about what synthetic biology is the fun it have and also make the cross subjects knew by more people. We all think we have did a meaningful practice and help promote development of the cross subjects which is also the aim of iGEM. In a word, human practice gives us a chance to tell more people about our idea and the makes more people realize the charm of synthetic biology.
Eliminate Chinese’s prejudice about biotechnology
After hearing the community's concern about biotechnology, we held two lectures to clear their prejudice. Meanwhile, we printed 200 booklets to expand publicity.
Background
In China, because of the UN human issue that scientists used 60 children to examine their new transgenic product, Golden rice last year, the question about the safety of transgenic technology remains indistinct. The masses even became scared of the transgenic technology as well as the total biotechnology. As a result, transgenic products were resisted all over China.
Lectures
Although many biologists came out to prove their justice, many Chinese still have stereotypes of biotechnology. We hosted two lectures about the correctness of biotechnology for college freshmen and high school students. We introduced the current stereotype phenomenon, then presented the biological applications that have made great contributions, such as bio-fuel, Artemisinin (kind of drug for malaria, first extracted by Chinese pharmacist Youyou Tu) produced by yeast and microorganism which can curb environmental pollution. Because our project involve the knowledge of both biological process and the lecture also involved the development of Synthetic Biology, which is a course of cross-disciplines, requiring us to look at a living organism from the perspective of information system. These contents attracted the attention of students from College of Information.
Brochures
To circulate synthetic biology knowledge and inspiration, we demonstrated key ideas in the discipline"

General Remarks: On September 25th, there is KluyverCentre Programme day in Wageningen. We have a presentation there (what? how? who?). Everybody is expected to attend. Details about car pooling, payment etc will be arranged. Some decisions on the shirts and sweaters to be worn during the jamboree is taken.. Details will follow soon, actions will be taken by Saeed.
Sriram: Started the assembly for the ribo regulator. among 3 steps to be taken, first one worked without any problem. Consecutive steps will follow soon. The university is providing a virtual environment for iGEM, that can be used for either wiki or forum or anything that is suitable. Arrangements should be done and actions will be taken by Sriram and Emrah
Daniel: LacI problem. The problem is described as:
GFP with weak RBS and controlled by PLacI. However, in the experiments i did today PLacI acts as a constitutive promoter and the culture always glow. This makes me think on either I made a mistake and put a constitutive promoter or e coli is not producing LacI. Do you think that the second reason is possible? i'm almost sure is"

Week 3
We found out that MS8-13 are all wrong due to primer dimer.  We redid the PCR of all level 0 primers that failed: L0AB (FJ1), L0EB (FJ2), L0FB (FJ3), L0GB (FJ4), L0DF (FJ5), L0DG (FJ6),L0DH (FJ7), L0DE (FJ8), L0CD (FJ9). Instead of running a gel after the PCR, PCR clean up was performed. The product of the clean up was then nanodropped.
 
Then the PCR clean up samples of FJ1-9 underwent restriction digest. We ran gel of digest, bands came out too weak, but all present.
 
Redid digest with higher amount of DNA. New gel is much more   clear
 
We perfomed gel extraction and nanodropped gel extraction product.
 
Performed PCR clean up on RD of 1A3, 1AT3, 1C3, 1K3 transformed at week1 and nanodropped
 
 
Ligated 1K3 with pSMJSAF from samples of FJ1-9. Transformed the ligations on to plates.  The plates did not yield positives for the transformation.
RD the backbones in two sets, one set with just SpeI other with both SpeI and EcoRI.  Gel of the RD showed that there were unexpected bands when cut with both enzymes, something not shown on the registry experience pages for the backbones.
 
Plated bacteria transformed with the backbones. Picked colonies from the plates. Miniprepped and nanodropped the cultures with the the backbone

  As we go along, we picked several elementary schools randomly and introduce ourselves and what we do to the kids. This is quite an impressive information to those children who have never heard of genetic modification, as a result, they found this attractive and meaningful in improving human’s life.
  Once they were told corn can be retransformed and genetcially modified, they came up with many interesting ideas such as shrinking the watermelon or combining some other fruits. This trip takes people in the countryside to reach the modern thought and technology.
National Chung Hsing University
 
On June 6th, some of our team members visited Chiao Tung University for an iGEM meetup with NCTU-Formosa, while the other members were taking the concept of iGEM and synthetic biology to the public. In order to promote iGEM and synthetic biology to more people, we chose places where Taichung citizens gather for their leisure time such as the plaza in National Chung Hsing University. We talk to people, elder, young and kids we meet in there, from basketball yard to organic farm. We hope that the idea of synthetic biology and iGEM can reach more to the public.
 
 
CMP Block Museum of Arts
 
After stop in Chung Hsing University, our next is to go to the Park Lane by CMP, where is well-known for its shopping malls and green design trail. In order not to disturb people shopping, we promote synthetic biology along the trail. We introduced our project and talked about what we did on fire retardant bio-materials. And we also introduced synthetic biology and iGEM to them.
Techology Month was held annually in Mingdao High School. During Biotech Week, we introduced our project and showed the students from grades 7 to 12 with some experiments we have learned in bio lab such as DNA gel electrophoresis and plasmid DNA extraction. Hoping that more people could understand synthetic biology and our project. Many students came to our lab, and we demonstrated them how to use the pipette and some lab awareness and skills. With excitement, students are enthusiastic to the experiments, and we have a great time together.

2. Model Development —— Test System
2.1 Overview
In the following sections, we will explain how we developed our model of the Test System and present our results. Figure 1 offers an intuitive explanation of the way our Test System works. It can be seen that the system would act differently (perform different functions) under different conditions. Our goal is to specifically describe the system given different conditions, using ODE. The concentrations of the chemical species in the system are regarded as variables, which change over time. Thus, depicting how the concentrations of the molecules of interest change is the primary step.
Figure 1  Illustration of How the System Works
2.2 Notations of Important Variables and Chemical Species
In the model, a set of variables representing the concentrations of various chemical species in the system are used. All these variables are functions of time. The notations and corresponding meanings are listed below.
$H(t)$——concentration of 3OC6HSL in the cell
$I(t)$——concentration of luxI
$H_{ex}(t)$——concentration of 3OC6HSL outside the cell (in the medium)
$C(t)$——concentration of 3OC6HSL-LuxR complex
$R(t)$——concentration of LuxR monomers
$G(t)$——concentration of GFP
$Cas(t)$——concentration of dCas protein in the cell

2.3 Details of Model Development
Next, we will dissect the reactions and events involved in the model. For each reaction involved, we will present the relevant assumptions, molecules involved, and formulae and parameters related to reaction rate or steady state.
1) AHL synthesis inside the cell
- Reaction: Precursors $\to$ AHL (3OC6HSL)
- Reaction rate: $v=k_0 I(t)$
- Relevant parameters: $k_0 \Rightarrow$ rate of synthesis of 3OC6HSL
Explanation/Assumptions: In bacteria, AHL is synthesized from its precursors via several enzymatic reactions. The last step of synthesis is catalyzed by protein luxI. Due to the scarcity of luxI protein in our system, it can be seen as the rate-limiting factor"

These are just a few examples of the possible applications, that our project contains. We have mainly focused on the medical sector, but other applications can be assumed as well. It is just the beginning and as Thomas Edison said: “There’s a way to do it better - find it”. The foundation for our idea has now been made, but we will continue to improve our idea and hopefully one day we will end up with a sustainable product, which we can commercialize.
We look forward to present our project in Boston, and hear about all the other iGEM projects.

Furthermore, we have developed an algorithm and used it to scan through the genome of E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain, and identified five genomic regions that may potentially be a functional target site for Cre recombinase.

Human practice: Interdisciplinarity in Synthetic Biology
Due to the interdisciplinary nature of SMORE, we investigated interdisciplinarity in biology to understand its influence on how successful projects are.
We conducted a skill exchange survey with Team Bulgaria and Technion Israel. The survey identified the use of technical language as pivotal in mutual understanding in interdisciplinary collaboration.
We also measured the diversity in discipline of past iGEM teams and analyzed it with iGEM achievements. We found no significant correlation between diversity and achievements. We proposed hypotheses to explain the result.
See how we analyze the interdisciplinarity in iGEM here.
Human practice: Accessibility Improvement of SMORE
From the aforementioned study, we identified challenges in interdisciplinary work and decided an improvement of accessibility is needed to promote interdisciplinary use of SMORE. We improved accessibility in four aspects:
Readability: we wrote highly readable introductory paragraphs for a wide audience. We also provided highly readable protocols for the software and the cell sorter.
Hardware: we devised a microfluidic device with a 3D syringe pump – an alternative to the expensive cell sorter in the market – to use with SMORE’s randomizer strategy.
Software: we wrote an oligonucleotide designer programme to help the inexperienced to design oligos to use with SMORE.
Data: we compiled and experimentally verified recombinase-related sequence data to establish recombination as a convenient and reliable technology.
See how we integrate our findings on interdisciplinarity into our project here."

Today we have decide to clone our TPH1 biobrick into the expression cassette using three different approaches: 3A assembly, gel extraction, and amplified insert assembly. We were not able to get hold of the kanamycin backbone we needed for subcloning the expression cassette, but we succeeded with two other approaches and managed to get to the stage of PCR/gel extraction clean ups.

Public Engagement
We have contacted many people involved in research, mental health charities and artists who could be interested in our project. Today we got a lot of feedback. We want to use their input to start off our public engagement part of the project. It is starting to take shape...
Interlab Study
The cultures for the interlab study grew (yeah!) and we inoculated them to liquid cultures and let them grow over night.
Mind the Gut: Promoters
We transformed cells with our promoters (Gad-A+RBS, Gad-A and PyeAr) in chloramphenicol resistance.
Mind the Gut: Effectors
We have done ligation and transformation of both gel extracted- and PCR amplified- TPH1 with PSB1C3 carrying expression cassette. In order to maximize the chances of success, we have carried each step according to long protocols, including dephosphorylation of backbone and heat inactivation of both restriction enzymes and T4 ligase. Because of that, we have only managed to finish with the transformation by the end of the day!

Description
From information theory to our project
As we can learn from Wikipedia, information theory studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information which was originally proposed by Claude E. Shannon in 1948. The theory has developed amazingly and has found applications in many areas. It’s not exaggerated to say that we can see the power of information theory all the time.
Based on this, we would like to explore something originally in biological pathway using information theory.
Our project has a close connection with two terms in information theory, mutual Information and channel capacity. And what are they?
In probability theory and information theory, the mutual information (MI) of two random variables is a measure of the mutual dependence between the two variables. More specifically, it quantifies the ""amount of information"" (in units such as bits) obtained about one random variable, through the other random variable. The concept of mutual information is intricately linked to that of entropy of a random variable, a fundamental notion in information theory, that defines the ""amount of information"" held in a random variable. You can understand it trough from the figure below.
Formally, the mutual information of two discrete random variables X and Y can be defined as:\[I\left( {X;Y} \right) = \sum\limits_{y \in Y} {\sum\limits_{x \in X} {p\left( {x,y} \right)\log \left( {\frac{{p\left( {x,y} \right)}}{{p\left( x \right)p\left( y \right)}}} \right)} } \]
And the formula can also be proofed:\[I\left( {X;Y} \right) = H\left( X \right) - H\left( {X\left| Y \right.} \right) = H\left( Y \right) - H\left( {Y\left| X \right.} \right)\]
From the formula you can easily think that mutual information is the reduction of uncertainty in $X$ when you know $Y$.
And when you understand the mutual information, you can easily understand what the channel capacity is.
In electrical engineering, computer science and information theory, channel capacity is the tight upper bound on the rate at which information can be reliably transmitted over a"

BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Collaborations#Blog1_-_-_TEXT.html,", and processing fees.  Right now, you may be wondering “why is the word ‘novel’ bolded?” to which the answer is 1) the writers like bolding words and 2) being novel is arguably the most important part of applying for a patent and is directly responsible for the ambiguity surrounding patents in synthetic biology.  To be “novel,” and invention must be “nonobvious” to other researchers in the same field; however, this definition has only been loosely applied in the fields of biotechnology and synthetic biology.  For example, molecular cloning techniques have been widely used for decades to create plasmids and therefore products of such clonings should not be novel.  Nevertheless, gene products of molecular clonings are still considered novel and therefore patentable by the Federal Circuit courts. Furthermore, new devices and systems in synthetic biology are often created from a wide variety of independently patented genetic parts, causing issue when the inventor of a new device or system using patented parts attempts to patent.
Undoubtedly, there are a lot of issues in patenting/copyrighting synthetic biology products, as almost all parts are based on an expressive DNA code (which indicates the use of copyright) and yet most devices created are functional (which indicates the use of a patent).  This ambiguity in patenting and copyrighting products of synthetic biology is surprisingly similar to the issues faced in past decades by software developers. By looking at how software developers have handled the copyright/patent problem, we will define several more important terms (yay, more definitions!) and will open a dialogue on how to address intellectual property in synthetic biology.
Notes from the Writers
Over the past 5 minutes of reading time, you hopefully learned the definitions of property rights, intellectual property, copyright and patent, as well as how these definitions apply to synthetic biology.  We also introduced issues of patent law in synthetic biology, a topic that will be revisited in Part 2 of this post.  For ease of future reading, we are providing a “cheatsheet” of definitions as our third blog post that includes definitions from both this post and Part 2.  When reading future posts, we hope that this cheat sheet will help redefine words you may have forgotten.
If you enjoyed this post and learned something from it, please comment below.  If you loved all of it except that one part please comment below; we love feedback.  If there is an issue you would like us to cover at a later date, again please comment below.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html," Since we mainly used this kit for larger fragments, the resuspended pellet was only inverted and flicked to avoid shearing forces. We did not observe changes in color, that is why no pH adjustment were done. Afterwards, samples were centrifuged for 30 seconds and supernatant carefully removed with a pipet. The pellet was washed with 500 μl buffer QX1 to remove residual agarose contaminants and resuspended by inverting and flicking. Then samples were centrifuged for 30 seconds and all supernatant residues removed with a pipet. The pellets were washed twice with 500 μl buffer PE to remove salt contaminants and resuspended by inverting and flicking. Then samples were centrifuged for 30 seconds and supernatant removed with a pipet. Pellets were air-dried for 10-15 minutes until they became white. To elute the DNA, 20 μl of water were added and pellet resuspended by flicking. After incubation according to the DNA fragment size (5 minutes at room temperature (15–25°C) for ≤4 kb; 5 minutes at 50°C for 4–10 kb; 10 minutes at 50°C for >10 kb), samples were centrifuged for 30 seconds. Supernatant, which contained the purified DNA, was pipetted into a clean tube.
Ligation
For ligation of DNA fragments, the mixture was prepared as follows:
... µl DNA (=<200ng in total-> 20-70ng Backbone)
2 µl buffer
1 µl ligase (T4)
... µl water
=> 20 µl in total
After an incubation for 2 minutes at room temperature, or for 1h or over night at 4°C, the product was loaded on an gel for electrophoretic separation of the DNA fragments.
Nucleotide Removal
For removal of excess nucleotides after enzymatic reactions, the QIAquick® Nucleotide Removal Kit (QIAGEN) was used. All solutions were prepared as recommended by the manufacturer. Ten volumes of Buffer PNI were added to 1 volume of the sample and mixed. The QIAquick spin column was placed in a provided 2 ml collection tube and sample decanted to it. The tube was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 1 minute. Flow-through was discarded and the column placed back into the collection tube. Afterwards, 750 μl Buffer PE were added, incubated for 2-3 minutes and centrifuged for 1"

Plasmid construction for the expression plasmid containing Cas9 and gRNA´s
Vector for Cas9 and gRNA expression, assembled by a Golden Gate reaction, containing a URA marker, Cen6 yeast origin and a kanamycin resistance. Adapted from ( Lee et al. 2015 )
The combination of the Cas9 system with DNA repair sequences enables not only knockouts of peroxisomal proteins, but also allows redirecting protein localization by changing protein targeting signals or integration of linear DNA into yeast chromosomes. Genome engineering facilitates yeast strain development for customized peroxisomes.
Figure 3: Design of repair DNA sequences for homologous recombination after inducing double strand break by Cas9
Repair DNA sequences can be used to increase the efficiency for Cas9 guided knocking out of specific genes, but would also allow genomic integration of targeting signals or complete genes.  Adapted from ( Lee et al. 2015 )
The peroxisomal proteome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
The peroxisomal proteome is studied extensively for saccharomyces cerevisiae and contains exactly 67 proteins ( Kohlwein et al. 2013 ). The function is characterized for the most of those proteins and it is known, that yeast peroxisomes are expendable under optimal growth conditions. Nevertheless, some knockouts are lethal under oleate or stress conditions.

We have asked Dr. Hong for insight on how to set up a system ourselves. The set-up they used was a gel box with foam stabilizing blocks for arabidopsis as a model organism. Ultimately, we decided our system would be better suited for larger plants such as leafy greens. However, the visit was still valuable as we learned about what needs to be monitored in a hydroponic system, such as pH and nutrient levels. Dr. Hong also provided us with a sample nutrient solution mix for a hydroponic system. This information was important since the environment which both plants and E. coli are exposed to in a hydroponic system is critical to the successful operation of the Oxyponics.
AUGUST 30, 2017
Dr. Paula Turkon
Since it had been several weeks since we last spoke to Dr. Paula Turkon, we decided to follow-up equipped with our designs and models to get feedback from someone who was a potential end user. We showed her the three-dimensional CAD models and animation of the rails on which the fluorescent light sensor would be attached to detect ROS levels. She responded positively and said they could easily be installed in a hydroponic system as we intended. With us we bought a 3D printed prototype of the the crop planter that would hold the bacteria-containing dialysis tubing near a plant’s roots for ROS detection. Dr. Turkon provided us valuable feedback about making the planter cup’s rings slightly smaller and having more supports incorporated to have more stability with growing seedlings. She thought the cups was nonetheless novel and could replace current planters used in hydroponics. Thus, OyxPonics overall could be incorporated easily into existing hydroponic farms.
Additionally, Dr. Turkon welcomed us to her facility and we were able to observe first hand what hydroponic setups look like and how we could develop our own. With her advice, we decided to obtain greenhouse space to try our hydro"

Growth – Media
As our CENPK2-1D strand was growing poorly in the SC-U medium, we got the advice to try the same medium but with a higher amount of amino acids (SD-U).
Medium
OD at start
OD after 24 h
SC-U
0.1
2.9
SD-U
0.1
9.1
After OD measurements it was obvious, that the SD-U medium gave the CENPK2-1D better conditions for growth
Growth  – Protection against Contamination
To prevent bacterial contaminations, we made a comparison of the growth of our used strand in medium with and without ampicillin.
Medium
OD at start
OD after 24 h
YPD
0
2.7
YPD+Amp
0
2.6
The growth in both media seems equal. So we decided to only use medium with additional ampicillin in future.
Selection of Vector
Requirements for Vector
1. Secretion
Subtilisin E must be secreted as we do not know if it can be expressed active in cytoplasm. For industry secretion is a big advantage as it allow continuous production
2. Shuttle vector
For amplifying the vector easily it needs to have an ori and selective marker in E. coli
3. Selection system in yeast
different than the selection of synthetase plasmid which is tryptophane auxotrophy
auxotrphy must be different from trytophane

Key Questions about safety
Would the materials used in your project and/or your final product pose:
Risks to the safety and health of team members or others in the lab?
No. Our project uses non-pathogenic organisms as well as widely used attenuated laboratory strains. When used under very general biosafety measures, such as the use of safety cabins, adequate clothing, and the sterilization of residues prior to disposal, they are completely safe. Similarly, hazardous materials are handled according to general safety procedures. All lab members are trained on the health and safety procedure prior to the start of the lab work.
Risks to the safety and health of the general public if released by design or accident?
No. None of the organisms used in this project or their products are known to pose a risk to human health even if released accidentally.
Risks to environmental quality if released by design or accident?
No. Our project does not imply the use or production of any products potentially hazardous for the environment. As the release of genetically modified organisms, including those bearing antibiotic resistance genes, even if they are not pathogens, is generally considered a potential threat to environmental quality. As stated above, care will be taken to ensure the correct disposal of genetically engineered organisms. In addition, the use of laboratory strains ensures very low survival rates in the environment.
Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups or states?
No, none of the organisms, chemicals or genetic traits used in this project represent a potential use to security even through malicious use.
Specifically, are any parts or devices in your project associated with (or known to cause):
pathogenicity, infectivity, or toxicity?
No. None of the parts and devices, including protein-coding genes, regulatory elements, vectors and transposons are related in any form to pathogenicity, toxicity or infectious processes.
threats to environmental quality?
No. None of"

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," approximately 50 hydroponic systems and 20 general tools like wrenches, hammers, and scissors. Currently, Made In Space Inc. has tested out the use of 3D printers on the International Space Station, and SLS 3D printing would be feasible on the surface of Mars.
Impact
This project could help a future Mars colony achieve greater independence. In addition, managing solid human waste is a pressing need that NASA is currently trying to address. So far, most methods of waste disposal have been deemed unfeasible. There is a less direct impact to most people on Earth in the present time. However, our system can prove to be an important development in NASA's endeavours towards Mars colonization.

Is synthetic biology the best solution?
Yes. Integrating our pure culture into our PHB-producing system would occur after sterilization, and viability would be a nonissue. Also, in space we would need the highest efficiency possible and this is only supported through synthetic biology.

Uppsala,2016,Team:Uppsala#Project#UnaG_-_-_TEXT.html,"UnaG does not fluoresce, but Akiko Kumagai’s research group showed that Holo-UnaG (i.e. UnaG+BR) fluoresces instantaneously. No other fluorescent protein has a ligand that binds non-covalently to it. This could mean that it is possible to create an inducible fluorescent marker that could be used instead of photoswitchable FPs. Bilirubin does not exist naturally in lower classes of organisms such as bacteria and yeast, so it would have to be added exogenously when research is being done on these types of cells. UnaG has shown the ability of being fused to other proteins via a flexible linker both on the C terminus and the N terminus, making it suitable to use as a fusion marker. (I)
Since UnaG was discovered fairly recently, no mutagenic variations of the protein have been developed with improved characteristics than those of wtUnaG. However, several fluorescent FABPs have recently been discovered in other marine organisms. Two of them are called Chlopsid FPI and FPII. These two were also found in eels, although in another species, and both of them emit green fluorescence. Researchers have identified a tripeptide motif – Gly-Pro-Pro – conserved in all fluorescent FABPs. Chlopsid FPI and FPII are also bilirubin inducible. Alignment of the DNA sequences of UnaG and the Chlopsid proteins show 54% homology. There is a slight blue shift in the fluorescence (UnaG is 498/527 nm ex/em and Chlopsid FPI and FPII 489/523 nm ex/em). The researchers suggest that this blue shift stems from the fact that the 57th amino acid in UnaG is asparagine, whereas Chlopsid FPI and FPII contain a histidine at this site. The histidine would contribute to a more π-conjugated system, resulting in a difference in fluorescence. This discovery suggests possibilities of changing the emission wavelength of these proteins by mutagenesis comparableto what has been done on GFP for the past 40 years. This could in that case enable creation of fluorescent FABPs of different colors. (III)

How to make special symbols $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$,$\pi$, $\sin x$, $\hbar$, $\lambda$, $\ldots$  We also can make subscripts $A_{x}$, $A_{xy}$ and superscripts, $e^x$, $e^{x^2}$, and $e^{a^b}$.
How to write equations. \begin{equation} \Delta =\sum_{i=1}^N w_i (x_i - \bar{x})^2 . \end{equation} It is a good idea to number equations, but we can have an equation without a number by writing \begin{equation} P(x) = \frac{x - a}{b - a} , \nonumber \end{equation} and \begin{equation} g = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{2\pi} . \nonumber \end{equation}
Examples of more complicated equations: \begin{equation} I = \! \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\,dx \label{eq:fine}. \end{equation}
How to align several equations: \begin{align} a & = b \\ c &= d , \end{align}
We can also have different cases: \begin{equation} \label{eq:mdiv} m(T) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{$T > T_c$} \\ \bigl(1 - [\sinh 2 \beta J]^{-4} \bigr)^{\! 1/8} & \text{$T < T_c$} \end{cases} \end{equation}

Cornell,2013,Team:Cornell#notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," submitted the lox site for sequencing and ran a PCR of pC13F to append Kpn1 and BamH1 restriction sites to PSB1C3 for cloning of PpelA. We also ran PCRs using primers 27 and 28 to amplify A. nidulans PgpdA out of pAb13T, and ran a PCR using primers 29 and 33 to amplify crtE + rbs for pC13J out of pC13A. When all was said and done, the gel showed that only the PCR of A. nidulans looked promising, so we cloned this into pC13F.
Sadly, all 20 transformants failed and the stocks are incompetent. We received new cuvettes to retry all of them.  We submitted lox site for sequencing of pBARGPE1 and ran a PCR of pC13F to append Kpn1 and BamHI restriction sites to pSB1C3 for cloning of “PpelA”.

Sydney_Australia,2017,Team:Sydney Australia#Medals_-_-_TEXT.html," a link between the thermodynamic and computationally predicted properties of insulin analogues and their action profiles
We used this to predict characteristics of our novel insulin analogue, Winsulin
For our economic modelling we attempted to elucidate the pressures causing insulin price inflation
We did this via a 50 country analysis on insulin expense and a 10 country breakdown on affordability relative to income bracket
We used in-depth case studies to attempt to explain anomalies within the data and provide context to outliers
 
 
ENTREPRENEURSHIP
We communicated with online Diabetes support communities to identify issues with insulin pricing
We identified open-source manufacturing of insulin and the pump associated with it as an interesting, novel solution to tackling the current issues of insulin pricing
We worked on developing a novel single-chain insulin analogue with simplified purification properties to help reduce the costs of production, and so reduce costs to the consumer
 
We designed four tiers of functional business models to pursue in the future:
Open-source solutions
Small-medium business
Large corporations
State/Public investment
We also communicated with various experts in the field of startup business and the pharmaceutical industry in order to inform our production of these business models
 
APPLIED DESIGN
We designed a novel Single-Chain Analogue based on our research surrounding the issue of insulin affordability. Through:
Case studies
Economic analysis
Business model design
Community outreach
Intellectual Property Rights
 
We spoke to multiple specialists to inform these views, including the authors of the ACCISS report and members of the OpenInsulin project"

Exeter,2015,Team:Exeter#diary_-_-_TEXT.html," the rest of the week. Going into the weekend we went on a team social that was very fun. Once again over the weekend the focus was to further research the three ideas.
Week Three   15/6 - 21/6
Presentation preparation with Joe's weird face
Week three has been the most intense week for us as a team so far. On Monday and Tuesday the presentation began to take shape. Deciding to split the group into three groups worked extremely well as each team focused on one idea and how best to present that idea. Furthermore we mixed the teams up. As some people were almost ‘attached’ to a certain idea due to the fact they had worked on it uniquely so far, we made sure everyone was working on the idea they had focussed the least on.
This was our final week of talks from certain groups and academics. Greenpeace came to talk to us and give us some important factors to consider for each idea.  Wednesday arrived and we spent the morning running through the presentation before actually presenting it to a range of academics in the afternoon. Feedback was mostly positive and we were told all three ideas had great potential. We decided the deadline for choosing an idea was 5pm on Thursday. Thursday was intense. Debate, debate and more debate led us to a vote with the winning idea prevailing nine against two. It was so encouraging that we were unanimous in choosing to go for a well-deserved pint in the Devon sunshine. As I write this the day is Friday and week three is coming to a close. Today is being spent working out the GAME PLAN for how to start making some serious headway with the chosen idea. People’s strengths, preferences and interests have led to creation of various sub-teams.
P.S. We had more difficulty with the Interlab study.
Week Four   22/6 - 28/6
How is it week 4 already? This week saw the beginning of some hard-core modelling involving Brownian motion of both toehold switches and RNA using MATLAB. Many hours were spent toiling over getting the simulation just right, it seemed every time we thought we fixed it, something elsewhere would go wrong.  Thankfully, by the end of the week we had a basic ‘working’ 3D model of  Brownian motion, although it only worked using a few of each of the molecules (laptops don’t have much computing power surprisingly - time to look into accessing the university supercomputers!)
In the lab last week we spent our time working out what was causing MORE issues with the Interlab study. Our focus in the lab will hopefully soon turn"

June 26th
I started working in the new lab.
== Objectives: ==
The final aim is to earn all the following devices and them all together into the plasmid we are suggesting, that will be extracted from P4
I learned to obtain the plasmid sent by iGEM in the 2009 kit plates, and to transform it, the biobricks we are trying to obtain are:
BBa_R1062  Promoter activated by LuxR-HSL complex
BBa_I1352   RFP constitutively expressed and repressed with tetracycline
BBa_J37033     LuxR protein
BBa_C0261    AHL making enzyme
BBa_B0015   Double transcriptional terminator
BBa_P1003      Kanamycine ressistance casette
BBa_J04450     mRFP
June 27th-July 7th
Colony PCR from grown colonies and plasmid extraction from true possitives.
June 8th
My birthday! enjoying it was all my work.
July 10th
We noticed that we needed some other biobricks in order to test the function of our principal components, so we transformed the plasmids coming in the 2009 kit plates:
BBa_I715038   ready to use T7 RNA polymerase inducible with IPTG  BBa_K093005  RBS-RFP  BBa_I13507   RBS-RFP-Transcriptional terminator
The T7 RNA polymerase is going to be used to test the functionality of the final device and of the partial constructions with this promoter.
RBS-RFP is going to be used after the asRNA-double_transcriptional_terminator as a reporter gene. (Check asRNA design)
RBS-RFP-T.terminator If is the case that we can not afford the asRNA after other constructions are finished, we will use this biobrick as a reporter, It would be with a promoter inducible with luxR-HSL dimer (BBa_R1062"

The activity information recorded in each unique DNA molecule, together with its sequence, can be read using Nanopore Sequencing.
In this way, the massive amount of sequence and activity information can be obtained for each and every biomolecule variant!
Applications
CAT-Seq is a unique, high-throughput method, and like every other innovation it is followed by a range of possible applications:
Precise and rapid characterization of large catalytic biomolecule libraries.
Large scale recording of regulatory part activities and their cross-interactions.
Sequence and Activity relationship driven Artificial Intelligence algorithms for novel biological part or system creation."
UFAM-UEA_Brazil,2016,Team:UFAM-UEA Brazil#Project#MerOperon_-_-_TEXT.html," step to characterize this part was testing its Hg resistance and bioremediation with and without MerB gene, as represented below, through an inhibition zone.
It has been use a 10 times concentration variation (20mg/mL, 200µg/mL and 20µg/mL) of HgCl2 in LM (Luria-Bertani variation with half salt) solid media, adding 10µL of mercury chloride solution on its paper disks. The samples were inoculated in triplicate and incubate in BOD at 37°C for 2 days. The results are shown below.
As we can analyze in the figure above, our construction with MerB gene, increasing mer operon spectrum, had a smaller inhibition zone (nearest to the disk), growing better in Hg conditions, with clear difference from other samples (control and mer operon without MerB). As we can see in the graph, measuring inhibition zone length, our construction with MerB had 30% reduced it!
On the next mercury chloride concentration, as shown on the figure below, our construction with MerB gene continued with a smaller inhibition zone, growing even more nearest to the disk!
In 200µg/mL of HgCl2, our construction with MerB gene reached approximately 60% of inhibition zone reduction, one more time enhanced in contrast to genetic circuits only with MerA. Now… the “Grand Finale” experiment in 20µg/mL, presented below!
In 20ppm of HgCl2, our construction with MerB was totally resistant and don’t had any inhibition zone, showing its potential in bioremediation process, metabolizing all the available mercury!
To continue our characterization, we used this part in an improved Mer Operon, with new strongers regulated promoters, to increase mercury bioremediation, as you can see in the synthetic genetic circuits below.
We used two new regulated promoters to compare with natural one. The first test was validated the growth curve in 7.5ppm of HgCl2 in liquid LM media.  The result are shown below.
In the growth tests we used 7,5 µg/mL of mercury, comparing with the device K1355004 (used in 2014) and the new construction. At the best take, the new construction showed  4,6 times better result than the previous device.
The curve from the new construction under our bioreactor conditions had an incredible maintenance of its growth rhythm under 5µg/mL mercury concentration in a 42 hours period.  In posterior analysis, mercury was"

Only on the Peptidosome with the low pH treatment, a cell that was not integrated in the membrane was observed (Figure 15, D).
The results of the growth experiment with the additional treatments were confirmed microscopically. There was no significant improvement in the Peptidosomes treated with acid LB medium compared to the sole integration of washing steps. This confirms the reduced number of colonies in the supernatant of the growth experiment when carrying out the additional treatment methods (Table 2 and Figure 15).
The one loosely attached cell might be a problem for some applications where the surrounding medium is expected to be free of bacteria, therefore, the manufacturing technique of Peptidosomes should be adapted accordingly. An adequate method for this could be introducing the cells by microinjection since there is not a chance that bacteria can be attached to the outer part of the membrane.
3. Surface Decoration
The properties of self-assembled Fmoc-FF surfaces allow tiny objects, such as Dynabeads, to be incorporated into the shell of Peptidosomes. Incorporating Dynabeads enables the control of the Peptidosomes' movements in a magnetic field, thereby providing a powerful delivery tool, which can be used in various applications.
This video is not available for your browser
This video is a short movie about magnetic Peptidosomes.
Moreover, the surface of Dynabeads themselves can be decorated with proteins. His-tagged GFP was selected for this decoration allowing an easy imaging procedure. We optimized the Invitrogen protocol to fit our needs and tested the incorporation of decorated Dynabeads with His-tagged GFP into the peptidosome surface in binding/wash buffer and LB media (Figures 16, 17).
With this, we clearly demonstrated the possibility of Peptidosome surface decoration. Hereby, the GFP serves as a proof of principle that can be exchanged with any other protein of interest and thus can be used for various applications where enzymatic activity of the surface of Peptidosomes or Peptidosome immobilization is required. The surface decoration protocol is compatible with almost any goals due to its flexibility, as the decoration procedure can be performed before and after Peptidosome generation.

Traditionally, we evaluate the impacts of noise using variance-related statistics, such as coefficient of variance. These quantities can only describe how concentrated the output is around the mean value, but cannot tell us how well we can infer one of the correlated random variables from the other. Channel capacity makes a better criteria of noise because it more scientifically depicts the information dissemination process.
We measured channel capacity of the part BBa K1061013. We quantify the properties of TRE promotor.
The link is:
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1061013
Our Improvement
Purpose
Channel capacity evaluates correlation between input and output signals. For instance, if channel capacity is larger than 1 bit, the part can decern between high and low inputs, and vice versa. By assessing this novel quantity, we through light on how much information can a inducible promotor pass on. The measuring and calcualtion methods can be applied to more promotors in the future.
Results
Using EBFP2 as reporter, we measure channel capacity of a simple circuit driven by TRE to be 0.5259, with standard deviation of 0.0058.
Methods
We transfect HEK-293 human cells with our plasmid constructions as described in the form [ref: table]. Different concentrations of Dox are applied to cell culture at the same time.
Transfected cells are cultured for 48 hours before performing flow cytometry, long enough for protein expression level to achieve steady state. FACS examination measures florescent intensity emitted by each cell, from which we obtain a large sample of florescent protein expression level, tens of thousands of cells for each experiment group.
Data collected from flow cytometry are later analyzed on computers. We estimated probability density function (p.d.f.) from data using kernel density estimation, a nonparametric statistics method. Given high and low Dox concentration input, cells exhibit different probability distributions, as illustrated in the example below [ref: fig].

Education & Public Engagement
The history of our team is quite interesting. We didn't start with iGEM, but at the United Nations Biodiversity Conference (COP13-MOP8-MOP2). On december 2016, we had the opportunity to attend this event as youth delegates of the Public Research and Regulation Initiative (PRRI), which, in collaboration with the ISAAA delegation, decided to take an international group of young science students to introduce us to how biotechnology and synthetic biology regulations take place. We sure learned a lot about biodiversity, as well as The Cartagena and Nagoya protocols and their implementation in our countries. However, reality kicked in and turns out that despite all the advantages we can get from this tool, there is a widespread negative perspective on synthetic biology, mainly from activist groups but also from country representatives. Sadly, the problem didn't end there: there was also a big lack of participation from the scientific community and the young people regarding the regulation processes that were taking place. We sat at the real United Nations negotiations and even witnessed the proposal of a moratorium to Synthetic Biology!!!
Considering this situation a problem, with possible negative consequences for the development of emerging technologies, something had to be done. We came back to our homes, inspired, conscious of the importance of effective science communication, and with the conviction to do something to make a change. It was then when we decided to create Youth Biotech, an international association that focuses on science communication, science regulation and science development. Today it's got members from more that 15 different countries who look forward to take the movement to their respective countries. Under the science development track we founded the PHAgave project and we have been carrying out our public engagement activities through this platform since then.
To take science out of the lab and make an impact in our community, we’ve been focusing on hosting and participating in activities and events that share and explain the real implications of the emerging technologies, especially synthetic biology, as well as the importance on developing critical thinking.

In Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthesis, peptides are produced by multienzyme complexes, the NRPS, which form an assembly line, in which every NRPS module is responsible for the incorporation of one single amino acid into the growing peptide chain (for more detailled information on the NRPS system, please visit our Background Page to see our NRPS introduction video)[1]. As previously shown, the natural NRPS assembly lines can be rearranged to create novel assembly lines producing custom peptides (please find our experiments on the Peptide Synthesis Page )[2]. Since the detection of those custom peptides remained challenging when produced in vivo, we developped a method which enables the labelling of non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) with the blue pigment indigoidine (please find our experiments on the Indigoidine-Tag Page ). The Indigoidine-Tag enables for applying high-throughput methods in the creation of NRPS libraries as well as in detection, purification and validation of synthetic NRPs (please find our RFC Page for standardized high-throughput protocols). Custom short peptides might have a great potential for production in industrial scale. Therefore, we try to optimize the efficiency of the indigoidine synthetase indC, which is used for the Indigoidine-Tag.
The indigoidine synthetase indC from Photorhabdus luminescens laumondii TT01 (DSM15139) consists of an adenylation domain with an internal oxidation domain, a thiolation domain and a thioesterase domain [3]. The A-domain adenylates L-glutamine, which is then attached to the T-domain via a thioester bond. The TE-domain catalyzes the cyclization of the glutamine and cleaves it from the T-domain. Each two  cyclic glutamines are oxidized by the Ox-domain, resulting in the blue pigment indigoidine ( Fig. 1a ). The indigoidine synthetase must be activated by an enzyme called 4'Phosphopantheteinyl-transferase (PPTase), which transfers the 4'-PPT residue from Coenzyme A to a conserved serine residue in the T-domain of the indigoidine synthetase, thus transforming it from its inactive apo- to the active h"

Gibson Ridge Software
Mr. Gibson meeting with our hardware committee.
Mr. Gibson, the CEO and Founder of Gibson Ridge Software, worked with the Lambert High School iGEM team, specifically with the Hardware/Software committee to provide advice and feedback on the Chrome-Q. He met with the team during each iteration of the design and helped troubleshoot the electronic circuit.  He also gave direction and feedback for developing the software.
University of Georgia
Gaurav working with the plate reader at UGA.
By collaborating with the University of Georgia’s iGEM team, Lambert iGEM was able to complete the interlab measurement experiments.  These were a series of detailed protocols involving the use of a plate reader to ensure accuracy within the fluorescence data. This allowed both teams to compare their data and openly discuss any unusual results that could have caused issues in the data analysis and interpretation.  Specific errors were discovered and both teams were able to improve upon the technique demonstrating inter-laboratory studies to create a similar, comparable method of GFP measurement.
TAS Taipei
Lambert iGEM team in a conference call with TAS Taipei
Lambert iGEM sent Chrome-Q design files to TAS Taipei early in the design process.  A video conference call was held and subsequent communications took place to offer help and receive feedback. Specifically TAS Taipei gave Lambert some tips on integrating human practices. Lambert was able to share information about working in underfunded labs.
Emory iGEM Team: Ethics Collaboration
Lambert iGEM team with the Emory iGEM team
The Lambert iGEM team was able to collaborate with the Emory iGEM team to discuss the ethics about CRISPR Cas9 along with a group of other Emory students and professors. Through this discussion, they were able to gain knowledge about the different perspectives of genetic modification and to what extent people are willing to justify experiments as ethical. Also, the Emory iGEM team led a tour of their labs to demonstrate their daily lab workings, allowing both teams to grasp the overall purpose of each other’s projects.  Lambert used this ethics conference as a springboard for their own investigations into ethics. "

UT-Knoxville,2017,Team:UT-Knoxville#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"_K2451015), time constraints did not allow us to characterize the circuit in its entirety.  Additionally, our data suggests the nitrogen content of the media can marginally increase Pu Promoter strength per σ54 availability. This is another promising lead to further fine tune enzyme formation. Lastly, our results suggest a high degree of specificity for the Pu promotor.
Setbacks
The Pu Promoter circuit proved our most difficult part to construct, and took on a variety of forms on its way to functionality. Ultimately, the lack of an untranslated region (UTR) (about 7 to 8 base pairs) between the RBS and start codon proved inhibitory enough to prevent any perceivable m-xylene induction. Salis Lab’s RBS calculator proved critical to troubleshooting this dilemma [5][6]. The following table shows the workflow our team underwent to arrive at our functioning construct.
Figure 8: Pu construct workflow
Toxicity Efflux Pumps
Strategy
A common obstacle in metabolic engineering is the buildup of toxic products. This can be extra debilitating for strains designed for heterologous protein expression. However, bioengineered efflux systems have been demonstrated to be a practical solution that carries wide metabolic engineering applications [7]. Our 2016 platform (BBa_K1966003) demonstrated conversion of aromatic hydrocarbons to aldehydes. However, wild-type E. coli exhibits a toxic susceptibility to many of our desired products, namely benzaldehyde.  To develop a more robust microorganism, we set out to overexpress native transcriptional regulators directed to increase organic solvent tolerance (OST) [8], and alleviate benzaldehyde’s toxic effects. Several external stresses are detected by the Mar/Sox/Rob regulon, and it serves to modulate several different pathways, one of which increases expression of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump [9]. Overexpression of the transcriptional activators (MarA+, SoxS+, Rob+) and the broadly non-specific efflux pump AcrAB-TolC has been previously demonstrated to confer resistance to variety of organic solvents and antibiotics [8].
Toxicity Parts
To increase tolerance to aromatic aldehydes, our team designed the following composite parts. The composite parts function as transcriptional regulator protein generators.
Figure 9: Toxicity parts submitted to the registry
The above constructs were all submitted by the UT-Knoxville 2017 IGEM team for this year’s project. Each gene of interest was amplified from E. coli MG1655 genomic DNA, and Gibson Assembled into a linearized vector consisting of p"

Summary
In the interview with Mark we discovered that detecting antibiotic resistance in bacteria is a rather challenging process. There are roughly 61.000 resistant genes and 24.000 genes are unique. Furthermore, even if it is found that the patient has antibiotic resistant genes it does not necessarily mean that this bacteria is the pathogen. In this interview, we realised that our final product of our project should be a device you can use on-site. Additionally, Mark mentioned several companies where they are developing techniques for the detection of antibiotic resistance. He also suggested to look what the farmers are doing now as a protocol when discovering that one of their cows got an infection. With this we could really state where the added values of our project lies. So, the detection device that we are making should be accurate of which antibiotics the farmer then needs to use.

At the same time, we have also optimized the language of the materials to make them more interesting and popular, so that the public can understand at a glance. Next, we will make the organized information into a display board and a brochure. In addition, we designed the activity process in detail, prepared a few small games to attract the public fun, for which we also prepared related gifts, but also made a clear division of labor. Finally, we selected the event venue in the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Scenic Area, mainly considering the favorable audience factors such as huge traffic flow, wide age distribution and balanced education. At the same time, we got in touch with the Administrative Law Enforcement Detachment of Nanjing Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Administration and obtained permission to hold activities in Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum Scenic Area. On July 27th, from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm, we held a publicity campaign in the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. The team members will arrange the event venues and publicize the science through forms such as exhibition boards and brochures. The content covers cancer common sense such as cancer causes, cancer treatment methods, etc., and also introduces synthetic biology and the iGEM team of Nanjing Agricultural University. The whole science popularization activities are rich and colorful, not only simple introductions, but also questions and answers about cancer common sense. The questions mainly focus on ""what is cancer, the way cancer is treated, and the attitude toward the promotion of new cancer treatment methods"". After a day of popular science promotion activities, we have popularized a large number of scientific knowledge about cancer, cancer treatment, new therapies, immunotherapy, etc., eliminating the public's misunderstanding in the field of cancer treatment, and also knowing a lot of people. From the perspective of cancer, we are increasingly aware that such science popularization activities are imperative. Through this activity, the team members applied the expertise acquired in the laboratory to practice and benefited the public.

Here are a few additional notes: 1. After applying the solution that contains DNA sample to the column and centrifuging, reload the sample to the column and centrifuge for a second time in order to make sure that all the DNA samples are bound on the column. 2. Use water instead of elution buffer to elute, for that TE buffer may cause negative effect on enzyme reaction. Heat the ddwater to 50~60℃ in water bath to ensure that the pH of the ddwater is around 7.6. But if the DNA sample will be stored for a very long time, using elution buffer is better.
LB (agar) medium preparation
We used Sangon biotech LB broth medium(25.0g/L) or Sangon biotech LB broth agar(40.0g/L), which already contains yeast extraction, tryptone, sodium chloride (and agar) so that we only need to dissolve the powder in proportion to prepare LB (agar) medium. For LB medium using for bacteria inoculation, split the medium into 5ml and transfer the 5ml medium respectively into 15ml tubes before autoclaving. Autoclave under 121℃ for 30 minutes. As for LB agar medium, after the temperature of the medium cooling down until it doesn’t hurt, add appropriate volume of antibiotic into the medium. Transfer the medium into 90mm plate afterwards. Approximately 15ml of LB agar medium is applied to each 90mm plate. Here are the antibiotics and the corresponding concentration that we used in our experiments:

Test pigment production in E. coli MG1655 and its derivative
Pathway from pyruvate and G3P to FPP. Figure from Yuan et al. 2006.
The first compound in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), derives ultimately from pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (see figure on the right). The rate of carotenoid synthesis is limited by the rate of supply of FPP.
Certain strains of E. coli, e.g. MG1655, have been genetically engineered to up-regulate the enzymes involved in the pathway leading to FPP, thus increasing FPP supply and enhancing carotenoid synthesis. In Yuan et al., plasmid pPCB15 was used as reporter to assess the effect of such up-regulation. pPCB15 contains genes CrtEXYIB derived from Pantoea stewartii (homologous to the Biobricks available, which are derived from Pantoea ananatis) and produces orange beta-carotene as the main coloured product. The results showed that upregulation of enzymes upstream of FPP led more beta-carotene production.
Map of plasmid pPCB15.
In our project, we wish to compare carotenoid pigment production in E. coli strains TOP10, MG1655 and its derivative. Due to greater supply of FPP, we will expect higher level of carotenoid production in MG1655 and its derivative than in TOP10. Working on MG1655 and its derivative makes it easier to assess the effects of Biobricks on carotenoid synthesis, and allows us to develop and refine methods for pigment measurement and characterisation, which can then be applied on TOP10.
We have access to the original MG1655 (""Parent"") and its derived strain, MG1655 PT5-dxs PT5-idi PT5-ispB PTe-ispDF (""Roche""). We first transformed these two strains with pPCB15 for orange beta-carotene production ( Week 3 ). pPCB15 was also transformed into"

filter_dramaRNAi & KRAS
RNA interference (RNAi) is an emerging technology of gene silencing. It uses siRNA segments to destroy specific mRNA, thereby, shut down the expression of target genes. RNAi has been demonstrated as a novel treatment modality of cancer and we decided to utilize this technology to silence the expression of specific oncogene[1]. KRAS is one of the most commonly mutated oncogenes in lung cancer. The mutation rate of KRAS can be up to 25% in NSCLC (a main type of lung cancer)[2]. Thus, we picked KRAS as our target oncogene. Then we designed anti-KRAS siRNA as a therapeutic agent to degrade KRAS mRNA, therefore, repressing the expression and function of K-ras protein. We used a specialized software developed by team SYSU-software to find the ideal siRNA sequence. This tool also designed pairs of oligonucleotides needed to generate short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in the plasmid. When the shRNA plasmids of KRAS are transfected into HEK293 cells, the dsRNA is cleaved into siRNA of KRAS by the enzyme Dicer, and then target KRAS mRNA. However, due to the short half-life period and poor cellular uptake of exogenous siRNA[3], an efficient delivery vehicle is needed to stabilize and enhance the naked small interference molecule's function.

A ligation was made as well of SPL + GFP(+RBS) into pSB4A5, this merely to see the variation in GFP expression amoungst the colonies. The ligations were transformed and left to recover for 2 hours as apposed to the usual one hour, and then plated afterwards.
Hopefully these new ligations work and it was merely a digestion problem before and nothing to do with the usage of pSB2K3 as the backbone nor resistance expression.

Restreaks of pIGR01 and pIGR07 (isnt it pIGR02? lisa 13-10) looked liked the previous restreaks. The colonies that were really green, were still really green.
I made ligations of pIGR07 and pIGR08, and when I transformed I included that ligation mixture made the 06-10-10 containing pBADz1/z2 + RFP.
Then I spend some time talking to Sebastien about sequencing. I will call the company tomorrow and ask what we need to do.
I also talked to Jacobo about using the biolector Friday, and he will just make sure that he is not using it.
12-10-2010 Patrick Anti-terminator group
Our constructs pAT12-pAT16 didn't seem to work, first reason could be cause of the pSB2K3 plasmid used, perhaps the cells were not left long enough to recover and hence express kanamycin resistance. Another reason could be the digestions made of pAT09-pAT11, as it seems the restriction enzymes were not given enough time, the gel illustrated that ~ half of each product was digested whilst the other half was not.
Bottom line is, the transformed products were re-plated today in case they needed more time for resistance expression; all the products needed for the pAT12-pAT16 constructs were pcr'd and digested and ready for new ligations of pAT12-pAT16 if that is the case.
Tomorrow a test will be made with the SPL, which will be ligated with GFP(+RBS) into pSB4A5.

Indeed, the different subunits do not have affinity for each other but can only assemble and emit fluorescence upon excitation when they are all spatially close, which is not the case for a bipartite GFP. With this system, only two sgRNAs/dCas9s fused to their specific GFP tags are necessary to obtain an accurate fluorescence (Nguyen and al, 2013).
Bring DNA Closer tool construction
We have designed a tool based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system to target a specific DNA sequence. We imagined a system that dimerizes under an induction signal to bring two DNA sequences closer.
dCas9 is a protein which precisely recognizes a DNA sequence (contrary to Cas9, it has no nuclease activity) [Fig1]. We chose this system for its high adaptability, as it targets DNA through a sgRNA which could be easily designed. For a reason you will understand very quickly, we chose two orthologous dCas9s which are respectively expressed by T. denticola (TD) and S. pyogenes (SP). As they come from different organisms, they recognize different sgRNAs thanks to their PAM sequence. We ordered from Addgene the plasmids coding for each one of these dCas9s and their sgRNAs.
Figure 1: Specific DNA sequence recognition by our tool based on sgRNA/dCas9 assembling. Association of the heterocomplex composed of dCas9s and their sgRNAs recognizing specific target sequences. Colors correspond to two orthologous dCas9
To dimerize these two dCas9s, we chose an inducible system using the FRB and FKBP12 proteins [Figure 2]. Originally found in mammals, these two proteins form an heterodimer when rapamycin is added in the middle. It is particularly used in protein interaction studies (Cui et al., 2014). However, rapamycin is toxic for bacteria, but studies showed that a mutated FRB (FRB*) still allows dimerization with a non toxic analog of rapamycin called rapalog. The mutations are: T2098L, K2095P, W2101F (Bayle et al., 2006; Liberles, Diver, Austin, & Schreiber, 1997).
A biobrick coding for FRB with the mutation T2098L was already in the iGEM registry (iGEM Part_ J18926) but was not available. Moreover, it contains"

To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help from"

Tn5:adapter DNA complex formation
From previous result, we learned that:
More negative control should be done to confirm integration
50µM adapter concentration was too high. In this experiment 10µM and 25µM adapter will be used.
50% glycerol might be too high. As the transposase already contain glycerol. No addition glycerol will be added in this experiment
Two different amount of Tn5  was loaded with adapter DNA by following the pipetting scheme shown on Table 2. All samples and reagents were kept on ice during preparation.

BBa_J04450
RFP Coding Device
Designed by Tamar Odle   Group: iGEM_Davidson   (2005-06-09)
The colonies are clearly red in color under natural light after about 18 hours. Smaller colonies are visibly red under UV. The RFP part does not contain a degradation tag and the RBS is strong.
LacI sensitive
CAP sensitive
This part is commonly used, but can fail if the system contains LacI or CAP protein.
BBa_R0010
Promoter (lacI regulated)
This part is an inverting regulator sensitive to LacI and CAP.
It contains two protein binding sites. The first binds the CAP protein, which is generally present in E.coli and is asocciated with cell health and availability of glucose. The second binds LacI protein.
In the absence of LacI protein and CAP protein, this part promotes transcription.
In the presence of LacI protein and CAP protein, this part inhibits transcription.
LacI can be inhibited by IPTG.
LacI is coded by BBa_C0010
Usage and Biology
This is a direct copy of bases 0365739 through 0365540 of the E. coli K-12 MG1655 genome, Genbank NC_000913 in reverse complement form. It is the natural promoter for the LacZYA operon. It includes the tail end of the LacI gene coding region, but no promoter region for that partial gene.
BBa_K116640
pTet + RBS + LuxR + T
Designed by Jesse Wu   Group: iGEM08_NYMU-Taipei   (2008-10-30)
LuxR regulated by the pTet promoter. Used to constitutively express LuxR.
K094130
Rbs-mRFP1-terminator
Designed by Shi Lei   Group: iGEM08_iHKU   (2008-10-13)
This part is adapted from part BBa_J04450, with the pLacI promoter deleted. This part can serve as promoter efficiency test kit.
pSB1C3
Plasmid used as a control with Cloranphenicol resistance.
pSB1T3
Plasmid used as a backbone.

This time the BIOSINT_Mexico iGEM team had the opportunity to support the new Guanajuato_MX team. This team is made up of students from different universities, who with the intention of starting their experience in this competition, they decided to join efforts to carry out their project. Competition from synthetic biology, iGEM, is not only based on the successful completion of the main idea of ​​the project, but also has other areas of knowledge in which the teams must approach, the development of ethical attitudes and free spreading information are some of them, as well as integration between different teams. Undoubtedly the support and collaboration between different institutions and iGEM team is vital to achieve this goal; there are many problems that arise throughout the development of the project to meet all the objectives; in this case the Guanajuato_Mx team, with all their encourage decided to participate in the annual version of Interlab Study, nevertheless, its iGEM kit was unfortunately not given them, so this study could hardly do. Fortunately for both teams, we were able to be in contact and because BIOSINT_Mexico did have its kit, with great spirits was given them the necessary material, to perform their Interlab Experiment and still participate in the study. That was how Guanajuato_Mx began working to achieve its mission, were later presented other problems, some doubts were clarified between both teams to get results. Finally, although it was a mutual effort to achieve results, different conditions make it impossible to get them; however, the collaboration was always the best intentions of continuous improvement between the teams.
Guanajuato_Mx, thank you for allowing us to work with you and make us participants in these activities, It will be always a pleasure to participate in this kind of stuff whose sole intention is to spread the knowledge in the best way possible, making friends.

1. We formed a very tuned team where we all enjoyed working with each other and had fun.
2. For our human practice part, we successfully took a great chance to propagate iGEM, our project as well as synthetic biology to advanced teenagers from all around the nation at China Adolescents Science and Technology Innovation Contest, which is a splendid gala for all brilliant teenagers in China to take part in and show their wisdom.
3. Our bacteria can effectively recognize the presence of atrazine.
4. For the biobrick measurement approach part, we successfully used HPLC to test the function of BBa_K1145001 and BBa_K1145002. The controls were set scientifically and the result was very satisfying.
5. We submitted 7standard biobrick parts with high quality and great performance.
6. We added a LVA-tag at the C-terminal of the primitive CI coding region. This tag will facilitate the turnover of CI in the cells.
7. For our model part, we have introduced the space lattice into our model to better describe the movement of bacteria and the distribution of micromolecule like AHL.
8. We successfully utilized the QS system to recruit more bacteria members to move towards atrazine to degrade it.
9. We collaborated a lot with team ZJU-China, and we offered TrzN, a gene can degrade atrazine to them, which may be of great help for their projects.
