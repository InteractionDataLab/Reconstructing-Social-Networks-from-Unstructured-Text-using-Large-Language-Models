SAFETY & PROTOCOLS
1. Lesson Plan
2. Biosensor
3. Antimicrobial Footprint App
Our motivation for developing a lesson plan to be used in conjunction with our biosensor was two-fold:
to engage students in STEM by demonstrating that biology and chemistry have real world applications
and to raise awareness and accountability around chemical use by enlisting the help of students to use our device to monitor environmental levels of triclosan.
To aid us in our development of a lesson plan, we reached out to Community Resources for Science (CRS), an organization that works with scientists to bring their work into the classroom and engage students in hands on, inquiry based learning experiences. Sasha Stackhouse and Morgan Seag at CRS provided valuable feedback on how to present our project more clearly and how to fit our lesson plan to Next Generation Science Standards. Once we got the approval that our lesson plan met their standards, we connected with CRS’ network of teachers in our area -- just a portion of their network of 1,400 teacher.
While we are excited to share our project/message with schools in the area, delivering the instructions ourselves somewhat limits our scope. Ultimately we want to reach students around the nation. To better understand how we could refine our lesson plan to allow for wider distribution, we spoke with Ann Moriarty, an AP Biology/biotechnology teacher at Davis Senior High School.
Ms. Moriarty has a background in research herself and propounds the value of hands on activities in engaging students. In her classroom, for example, students develop an appreciation for biotechnology through running protein assays and performing gel electrophoresis to verify that their restriction enzymes cut the plasmid in the right location.
Ms. Moriarty provided valuable insight on the considerations that go into developing a lesson plan- the most salient being constraints imposed by lack of funding and needing to teach to a curriculum.
In regards to budget constraints Mr. Moriarty talked about the difficulty in planning field trips due to lack of funding. In explaining the first iteration of the lesson plan, which involved taking a field trip out to a local body of water where students would collect a sample for measurement, Ms. Moriarty raised some valid concerns. For example: what happens to students who don't want to go on field trip? Who is going to cover the cost of a substitute teacher, transportation costs, insurance?  In sum, field trips are a logistical nightmare.
So we brainstormed a work-around. Why not have students"

Team Macquarie Australia
We are a team of 33 students from Sydney NSW, Australia. As far as iGEM goes, we are a big group of students, and as a team we have had to work collectively together to deliver our project for 2016. Our team’s participation in the iGEM competition runs parallel to the coursework in the Biomolecular Capstone unit offered at Macquarie University, which limited the time available to us. The team’s work on the project began in August of 2016 and still continues whilst others have been working all year. As such, we are not your typical iGEM team.  Like the Macquarie Australia teams before us, we have found our own way of doing things to complete our project in time. We are excited and proud to deliver Team Macquarie_Australia’s 2016 iGEM Project.

Therefore, plates of B.subtilis transformed with the gene, as well as a sample of the gene in a shuttle vector, were generously prepared and shipped by members of the Breaker laboratory at Yale University. The Bacillus they sent us lacked the fluoride efflux pump usually turned on by the riboswitch, they found that this greatly increased its sensitivity to fluoride.
We then transformed E.coli and wild type 168 strain B.subtilis with the plasmid they sent us and these three strains were used in parallel for subsequent characterisation. Having obtained the DNA, the first step was to check the construct the fluoride riboswitch was currently in before we eventually would combine it with our own output. For details of these experiments, please see our Results page .

Worldwide obesity has nearly doubled since 1980, while in 2008, more than 1.4 billion adults, 20 and older, were overweight.               In particular, many low- and middle-income countries face “double burden” of under-nutrition and obesity. Rates of malnutrition is much higher in low income countries, while there is a greater exposure to high-sugar, high-fat, high-salt foods which are low in cost and nutrients. Such dietary patterns result in low levels of physical strength and sharp increase in childhood obesity with under-nutrition existing side-by-side.
2. In obesity, fatty acids delivered to liver may outpace fatty acid oxidation in hepatocytes, resulting in triglyceride accumulation. Obesity leads to health hazards, including cardiovascular disease - mainly heart disease and stroke, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders, especially osteoarthritis – a highly disabling degenerative disease of the joints, and cancers, such as endometrial, breast and colon cancers.   Combined: http://www.healthcentral.com/common/images/1/19473_13187_5.jpg Cardiovascular: Obesity and other health conditions associated with obesity, including hypertension, insulin resistance, diabetes and hyperlipidemia, are risk factors of cardiovascular disease.  http://www.beltina.org/health-dictionary/obesity-cardiovascular-disease-bmi-table.html Diabetes: Patients with type 2 diabetes are insulin resistant, in which high levels of blood fats, cholesterol and triglyceride levels inhibit cells from absorbing blood sugar needed.  http://www.bubblews.com/news/560642-cause-of-type-2-diabetes Musculoskeletal disorders: Those with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 26.4 had rate of osteoarthritis of the knees 6 times greater than those with a body mass index of less than 23.4. (Ref. J. Rheumatol. 20 (2) 331-5) http://pharmaworlds.com/obesity-a-growing-burden-for-physicians-and-patients/
The fundamental cause of obesity is an energy imbalance between calories consumed and expended. To increase expenditure of fatty acids (calories), HKUST 2013 Team aims to introduce glyoxylate shunt as an artificial futile cycle in HepG2 cell.

Overview
First of all, we evaluated the possible impact of our work in practical production by visiting one of the most notable synthetic biology companies in china, Bluepha. According to their suggestions, we accomplished our project design. We                     then visited three experts, respectively majoring in biochemistry, microbiology and phycology, creating an interdisciplinary communication environment. Based on their feedback, we successfully designed a series of educational lectures                     about synthetic biology for high school students. Furthermore, we successfully collaborated with OUC, UCAS, UESTC and took an active part the CCiC conference. To intuitively demonstrate the core idea of synthetic biology and inspire                     people to participate in gene-designing process, we deigned the first electronic-display system of synthetic biology, e-SAM©, and we hope this device can facilitate future iGEM teams to promote their ideas to public.

The problem of degradation always lies in industrial production, whereas the abuse of antibiotics has lead to the emerge of antibiotic-resistant superbugs. It's the researchers' responsibility to deal with this safety issues raised by                     the interaction between the application and the human society. Our iGEM project aims at the application of self-screening advantageous mutant selection, which can provide a growth dominance to the strains with beneficial mutation.                     As a result, we conducted an biosafety-investigation about the medical application of antibiotics in FuXing Hospital, Capital University. Besides, we participated in a series of academic conferences, during which we exchanged our ideas                     with other participants and sought out for chances of collaboration.

BIT-China,2016,Team:BIT-China#Proof#test3_-_-_TEXT.html," different kinds of inhibitors. The gene circuits are shown in Fig.4.
Meanwhile, we designed three corresponding in-promoter circuits in Fig.5.
We assembled these corresponding circuits together for the final testing.
We assumed that, more arabinose added, more inhibitor will be expressed and the downstream in-promoter will be repressed. That’s what we are going to prove.
But when arabinose was added, RFP intensity increased contradicting with the expected results.                                 Maybe the terminator can’t completely isolate the two devices. Thought of it this way, we change the promoter direction and add another B0015 to optimize the circuits. The circuits are shown in the Fig.9.                                 So we change the promoter direction and add another B0015 to optimize the circuits.
After the pre-experiment, we chose a series of appropriate arabinose concentrations, and they are listed in table.1. The negative control is the strain containing the empty vector pSB1C3 and the positive control is the strain containing the (序号) with no arabinose added.
The improvement of device construction was that we added a terminator and changed the promoter direction. In this way, we could observe the decrease of RFP intensity when the arabinose concentration increases. It indicates that the change of arabinose concentration will affect inhibitor’s concentration, and the inhibitor can influence the expression of downstream gene. We chose the CI-pR circuit to do this experiment and got the diagram of the relationship of the time and RFP intensity under different concentration of arabinose.
From this diagram we can see, when the arabinose’s concentration reaches to 0.0030％-0.0040％, the RFP can hardly express. The result proved that the inhibitor can almost completely repress the killer gene at the turning point. Also,                                 we could say inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene.
Summary:
Above all, we proved that plasmid numbers will influence the concentration of inhibitor proteins, and the inhibitor concentration will regulate the expression of killer gene which is indicated by RFP measurement results.
After connecting with kill gene, the plasmids losing on different levels will influence the expression of killer gene, which means we can sense the plasmid numbers and accordingly decide whether or not to turn on the switch of killer gene. From all these, we can achieve the goal of controlling the number of plasmids as we need.

PACMAN
Binding Affinity Assay
A direct experimental assay for binding of gp37 to pEtN (phosphoethanolamine) would require a technique like ITC which asks for extremely large concentrations of protein for every run. As such, we decided to take a more structural approach to the assay by using Circular Dichroism measurements as our peek into what is going on at a molecular level. The binding of the ligand will change the structure of the protein giving a minor deviation from the normal spectrum. In the presence of a strongly binding ligand, the spectrum would be shifted further. The difference of the CD spectrum with and without the ligand can thus allow us to qualitatively check its binding affinity for the protein.
PAIR
Secretion Assay
A simple secretion assay for MCP-1 attached to the signal peptides was done to check the secretion efficiencies of both HlyA and PelB. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation of overexpressed flask culture was run on an SDS-PAGE gel (along with the cell pellet) to see if the protein was secreted out successfully.
The band size obtained in the supernatant can be used to determine whether the protein was cleaved after secretion or not.
Chemotaxis Assay
To check whether our recombinant Mcp-1 with and without the signal peptides is active, we used a chemotaxis experiment with the protein purified from E. coli. To get rid of LPS contamination the protein was washed multiple times when bound to the column and was dialysed against a sterile buffer.
For Mcp-1 specifically, a series of wash buffers containing decreasing concentrations of urea were used to dialyse the protein sample and refold it from an initial urea concentration of 8M. For Mcp-"

In the wild, legume plants establish symbiotic interactions with rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to obtain several nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate. The root exudates of legume plants contain organic acids, including some TCA intermediates, such as malate, succinate, citrate and fumarate. Especially, in response to phosphorus starvation, malonie, succinic, fumaric, malic, citric, and t-aconitic acids were detected in the root exudates (Ohwaki & Hirata, 1992) . Here, we design the Prometheus E.coli that responses to malate and succinate and will swim to the roots to improve the interaction between the roots and fungi.
Chemoreceptor and Chemotaxis
In isotropic chemical environments, E. coli swims in a random - walking pattern produced by alternating episodes of counter-clockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) flagellar rotation (Fig. 1, left panel).  While an attractant or repellent appear somewhere in the environment, the cells’ locomotor responses specific runs that take the cells in favorable directions (toward attractants and away from repellents), resulting in net movement towards preferred environments.  (Fig. 1, right panel).
Fig. 1  Random and biased walks. Left: A random walk in isotropic environments. When the cell's motors rotate CCW, the flagellar filaments push the cell forward. When one or more of the flagellar motors reverses to CW rotation, that filament undergoes a shape change (owing to the torque reversal) that disrupts the bundle. Until all motors once again turn in the CCW direction, the filaments act independently to push and pull the cell in a chaotic tumbling motion. Tumbling episodes enable the cell to try new, randomly-determined swimming directions. Right: A biased walk in a chemoeffector gradient. As cells swim up a concentration gradient of attractant, they spend more time smooth swimming than tumbling; this modulation of swimming behavior is manifested as a chemotactic response.

Applications to other disease
There many other diseases where screening has the potential to be effective - and miRNAs can be used as biomarkers to achieve this. MiRNAs, and their links to diseases, are still being researched. However, new relationships are constantly being discovered, and they have the potential to be applied to a myriad of cancers - and potentially other diseases in a point of care setting.
Pancreatic Cancer
Elevated levels of miR-196a and 196b can act as biomarkers for pancreatic cancer. These could be used for the screening of high risk individuals, for example those with familial pancreatic cancer. Current imaging methods used for screening are often unable to detect early cancers and high grade precursor lesions in high risk individuals [18] . The main reason mass population screening cannot be done is that there is no suitably accurate test. [19] Early detection could increase survival rates, as it allows curative pancreatic resection surgery. [18] Similar to NSCLC, late detection is a primary reason why mortality rates are so low - pancreatic cancer is asymptomatic in early stages, and symptoms usually only present themeselves in later stages where it is far more difficult to treat. [20] At stage 3 there is a median survival rate of 6-11 months and at stage 4 it is 2-6 months, [21] whereas surgically resectable pancreatic cancer has survival rates of 11-20 months [22] . Currently only 8% of people diagnosed are able to have surgery due to late diagnosis. [23] MiRNA as a target for screening could allow early detection and thus reduce mortality rates.

It has been shown that levels of 3 miRNAs found in urine are indicative of prostate cancer with high accuracy - giving the potential for a non-invasive test. [24] Furthermore, prostate cancer is another good candidate for screening - there are 100% 5 year survival rates when its detected in stages 1 and 2, 95% in stage 3 but this plummets to 30% in stage 4.

004 appears to be a general constitutive promoter, but 007 appears to have a definite response to TNT over other promoters. Although expression appears to slightly increase between 0, 2.5, 5 and 7.5 ul TNT, there is a steep difference between the expression shown in 7.5ul TNT and 10ul. This may indicate a certain cut-off point at which the promoter activates.
Summary
iLOV presents a viable option for use in E. coli, as its fluorescence is much greater than that of E. coli. Of our two promoters, 004 appears to have no specific response to TNT, while 007 did appear to have a relative increase in expression as TNT concentration increased. This suggests to us that with some modification it could form the basis of biosensor for TNT, or some part of a regulatory system.

From left to right: control (biofilm only), control (ink only), biofilm mixed with 0.1x ink solution. More ink was pulled down when mixed with biofilm, and the color of the supernatant is clearer than the supernatant of the ink only group. Experiment: William Chen, Yvonne Wei
When ink was mixed with biofilm, we saw a 50% decrease in absorbance, compared to a sample containing only ink. Experiment: William Chen, Yvonne Wei
In return, CGU_Taiwan helped us independently verify that overexpression of OmpR234 (BBa_K2229200) produces more biofilms than control (BBa_K342003).
A) Our experimental results showed that E. coli overexpressing OmpR234 (BBa_K2229200) is producing more biofilm than a control which does not overexpress OmpR234 (BBa_K342003). B) CGU_Taiwan independently tested our constructs using crystal violet, a dye commonly used to quantify biofilm formation. BBa_K2229200 showed higher absorbance compared to the control BBa_K342003, reflecting the formation of more biofilm, which matches our results. Experiment: Yvonne Wei
LAMBERT_GA
We received and 3D printed LAMBERT_GA’s Chrome-Q device. We used this device with our synthetic biology class when they started to clone DNA constructs that expressed GFP.  Students monitored the effect of temperature on GFP degradation at 25, 37, 60 and 100 deg C.   We also had a great video chat  with their entire team in May 2017 to share project ideas & topics, summer plans, iGEM HS life, etc.  We always enjoy seeing them at the jamboree!!"
Munich,2018,Team:Munich#Software_-_-_TEXT.html,"To support the statistical information in the table visually we also added two pie                                     charts that correspond to                                     the relative and absolute values in the table. These two plots will help you to                                     gain information about the                                     number of bases and reads that were found in a reference file and make a conclusion                                     about the possibility                                     of contamination.
Additionally, there is a bar plot representing the distribution of the read length                                     in the FastQ file you                                     uploaded. This chart could be used for evaluation of the quality of sequencing or                                     even be helpful by                                     evolving theories about files with filtered reads. For your сonvenience all                                         plots are saved in the                                         output directory specified in Step 1.
Section 2:
In the section below you will find a filter which you can optionally use to extract                                     and save distinguish                                     parts of the read FastQ file: reads that were mapped to the reference (aligned                                     switch) and those which were                                     not (not aligned switch), in other words possibly contaminated reads and reads that                                     can be used for                                     downstream analysis (in case the reference FastA file you used is a possible                                     contaminant. If you added the                                     FastA file of the organism you expect to sequence, not aligned reads are                                     contamination).
If you uploaded multiple references files one more filter will appear (All                                     references): filter of reads                                     that are aligned to all references or reads that are aligned to none of                                     the references.
With this filter, it is possible to refine sequencing data and consequently, achieve                                     preferable results by                                     downstream analysis. It can also give you a hint about the origin of the possible                                     contamination, as the                                     reads that are not mapped to the expected organism can be checked with BLAST .
Once again all files will be saved in your output directory specified in Step 1.
How sequ-into works
We brought together a straightforward intuitive interface built with Electron and React , that gives the                     user easy access to the state-of-the-art long read alignment tool GraphMap which itself is highly specialized for nanopore sequencing.
To make this possible we run a python script in the background that relies on HTSeq as                     infrastructure for                     high-throughput data and pysam to handle the genomic                     data sets.
Sequ-Into In Detail
Sequ-into has the aim of bringing the sequencing data analysis and the laboratory                                     protocol optimization in                                     close proximity.
While highly specialized tools and pipelines for third generation sequencing data                                     analysis are available,                                     they often are not handy nor convenient to use as a first assessment right after or                                     during the sequencing                                     run.

TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Policy Practices#Application scenarios_-_-_TEXT.html," disease, etc. However, human hemoglobin is a biomarker for diverse irregularities in the intestines, whereby still follow-up research has to be done after positive results. From gastroenterologists of the AMC Amsterdam we got the suggestion of COX-2, an enzyme that can be found in the intestines at an early stage of colon cancer. Both Joost Drenth and experts from the ICC saw opportunities of Calprotectin as another biomarker, which is a protein that is associated with inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn’s disease and Colitis.  Calprotectin is specifically correspond to inflammatory diseases and thus can distinguish inflammatory diseases from irritable bowel syndrome, which has the same symptoms. By designing aptamers that specifically bind to human hemoglobin, COX-2 or calprotectin, the biosensor can be implemented in the intestines. It can sense the actual situation in the intestines and detect the biomarkers accurately and at an early stage instead of identifying it afterwards in the feces. The high specificity of aptamers is crucial, because other variants, such as bovine hemoglobin, can be found in the intestines as well. As mentioned above, the distinction between different intestinal diseases can be made directly within one test.
Our biosensor can be combined with auto fluorescence imaging. This imaging technique (combined with endoscopy) uses auto fluorescence to detect polyps whereby the intestinal tract lights up as green and the thickenings in the colon become purple. This current technique is not reliable as it doesn’t detect the polyps. By using fluorescent proteins on the intracellular side of our biosensor and the right biomarker, our sensor can accurately detect polyps and secrete a fluorescent signal that can be observed with this imaging technique. Furthermore, in a more distant future, the biosensor can release visible colors when it has detected a biomarker that for example can easily be observed in the feces. This would be easily for people to do at home and facilitates the large scale screening within a population. Besides detection, a more promising development is the secretion of medicine using COMBs when it has detected a biomarker. The detection of biomarkers can lead to the release of transcription factors which induces various signaling pathways in the bacteria causing the biosensor to produce medicine. There are some critical notions on this: the bacteria must be contained and cannot colonize within the intestines. This can be accomplished by bringing the bacteria into alginate beads. As described on our safety page .
Additionally, medicines have strict criteria, whereby each package needs to be equal and have the same dose. This is difficult to"

Nevertheless, accessing patient                       data have been proven to be extremely difficult due to the lack of the necessary ethical assessment and stiff data protection policies of sequenced data. However, the team has plans to validate Ginga with additional data and we are                       already in progress of completing an application for International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) regulated by the Data Access Compliance Office (DACO). The study we are interested in contains WES data from 52 melanoma patients                       and matched normal samples. We hope to gain access to this data to be able to keep supporting and improving Ginga.
On the other hand, the ethical considerations regarding the used of patient data were carefully evaluated and all the data protection protocols were correctly assessed and followed. The datasets are completely anonymised and have no                       identification that could lead or allow the tracking of the origin patient. Furthermore, we have disclose the data and the results made available for the community are processed and cannot be used to reconstruct the full genome of                       the patient. Furthermore, the whole data was safely secured in AWS cloud storage and encrypted. The raw sequences were never stored in any local drive. Once the data has fulfilled its purpose, the raw data will be completely and                       safely remove from any device or cloud storage.
The Ginga Github containing all the results of this analysis can be found here.
Dataset
The data used for validating the pipeline was extracted from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) toolkit. The samples were extracted from a study from Department of Molecular Biology of Cancer, Medical University of Lodz, Poland (ID: PRJEB27635).                   The study contains whole exome sequencing data from 8 different melanoma patients according to the following description: Melanoma specimens were obtained during surgical interventions, and grown in vitro in serum-free EGF/bFGF-containing                   medium as described previously (Sztiller-Sikorska et al., 2012 Melanoma Research). DNA was extracted using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit from Qiagen according to manufacturer protocol. DNA samples were subjected to Nextera tagmentation followed                   by index PCR, first hybridization, capture, washes, elution, second hybridization, capture, washes, elution and enrichment of DNA fragments. The samples were subjected to two rounds of exome enrichment, followed by real-time PCR quantification                   (KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Kit) prior to sequencing.
The samples were sequenced using NextSeq 500 sequencing of the cell DNA after in-vitro culture. The different samples extracted can be found in the table below:

Overview
As Peter Carr, the director of judging said, ""Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work."" To make synthetic biology accessible to public and address some questions ""beyond the bench"", relating to ethics, sustainability, safety, environmental impact and feasibility, we, Tianjin iGEM team, well planned a variety of human practice activities.
Educational & Public Engagement
By hosting Science & Education Exhibition in Open Day on our campus where over 30,000 people entered our campus and Showed their interest in our exhibition , we worked with people of all ages and education levels, from children to adults, to spark new scientific curiosity, to enhance their understanding of biology, specifically synthetic biology and to establish a public dialogue from voices outside the lab. Additionally, through holding such science lecture for students, making yearly social practice report,we did our utmost to make synthetic biology accessible to both students and teachers.
Recycling & Reusing PET
Primarily, we read quantities of journals to learn about overseas and domestic conditions of recycling and reusing PET.  Meanwhile, in order to obtain information concerning the status quo of Chinese recycling of waste PET, we attended the 10th seminar on China’s plastics industry and interviewed project-related experts, thereby acquiring the experts’ concerning ethics, environmental impact and economic analysis of our project. What we did assists our team in exploring the prospect of the project.
Local Hospital Visit
We were decided to hear more stakeholders’ voice about our protein chip, and we hoped to learn about the current information about tumor detection means and obtain experts’ feasibility and risk assessment of our project through human practice activity. Thus, we went to General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University to get experts’ professional advice and investigate the needs of patients.
Talks & Media
We held panel discussions and attended various meetings and seminars in order to exchange ideas"

Tokyo-NoKoGen,2011,Team:Tokyo-NoKoGen#metallothionein_-_-_TEXT.html," this result, fMT could bind to Cd(II) inside the cell, because it helped E. coli resist Cd(II). This result is supported by our experiment of changing the promoter from Pconst(Low) to Pconst(High),  where E. coli expressing metallothioein under Pconst(High) could resist Cd(II) concentration better.  From the result that E. coli expressing more metallothionein could survive Cd(II), it could be deduced that metallothionein is binds with the metal ion inside the cell preventing E. coli from cytotoxicity.
Matching our purpose of using metallothionein in E. coli for metal collection, we have successfully observed that fMT could still maintain its function even when fused to the PuP1~18 tag protein. The PduP1~18 fused metallothionein that captures metal ions will then become encapsulated inside the BMC and be collected.
We have successfully managed to observe that expressing metallothionein inside the E. coli can help them tolerate Cd(II) containing medium,  and that the protein are functioning by binding with Cd(II) inside the bacterial cell and preventing cytotoxicity.

USTC,2015,Team:USTC#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," is necessary to import an exogenous porin with higher effiency of small molecular tranportation, such as OprF derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
OprF represents one of the largest pore sizes on bacterial outer membranes, allowing diffusion of polysaccharides in a range of 2000 to 3000 Da. The overexpression of OprF in E. coli will drastically improve the antibiotic absorption capability, like antibiotic condensation occured in E. coli.
Viroporin: SCVE from SARS Virus
Viroporins are similar to porins in which they oligomerize within the membrane to form pores and this oligomerization often occurs between hydrophobic, transmembrane and alpha-helical domains of the proteins.
SCVE, SARS Caronavirus Envolope protein, is a kind of effective viroporin within 76 residues that is found normally pentamerized in bacteria. SCVE is permeable for many small molecules, which is originately designed for apoptosis of cells triggered by virus. Implementation of SCVE in ROSE may potentially improve the permatilibty of small molecules including antibiotics.
Inhibition of Efflux System using CRISPR
Efflux system is a kind of mechanism found in microbes responsible for many moving molecules, especially some toxic substances, microbiotics.
Strucuture of EmrE, 3B61 in PDB
According to previous researches, efflux system contributes a lot for bacterial antibiotic resistance, or multidrug resistance(MDR). For example, in E. coli, AcrAB efflux system has a physiological role of pumping out many bile acids, fatty acids to lower their intracelluar toxicty. It would be an attemptation to go directly reverse to antibiotic resistance,which is to inhibit the function of efflux system. In order to completely inhibit the major efflux system of E. coli in genetic level, CRISPR would be an impressive solution for totally deletion of the function of efflux system.
Clutersted reularly interspacaed short palindromic repeats, abbreviated as CRISPR, are some fragements in prokayotic DNA with short repeats. Natually, CRISPR/Cas9 system is an important immune system that is able to resist the existence and reproduction of exogenous genetic materials, directly recognizing and then cut these genetic fragments, such as phages and plasmids, by CRISPR spacers, which is quite similar to RNA interference(RNAi) discovered in eukaryotic organisms.

I was captured by the fascinating nature of biology and engineering, and iGEM offered me a good chance to devote my passion and creativity into this subject. I want to utilize my knowledge to solve certain problems. In the team, I am responsible for conducting experiments and writing necessary paperwork. I feel content when I was staying in the experiment room.
Hongyu Liu
My name is Hongyu Liu , a senior from Yali Experimental Middle School in Changsha. Looking at the pictures on the textbooks, I felt curious about the tissues in the creatures. How do those tissues work in my body? How can a monad survive with such a small size? Such questions drove me to find out more about biology. So I decided to join iGEM, to explore synthetic biology. In my team, I am in charge of setting up the wiki, which gives me a valuable chance to learn website programming.

University_College_London,2012,Team:University College London#HumanPractice#DIYbio#Evaluation_-_-_TEXT.html," the collaboration was.
Depth of Collaboration
One of the important evaluation criteria for citizen science projects is the “degree of participation”, ie. how involved the citizen science collaborators were at different stages of the project. We designed a simple survey (adapted from ""Public Participation in Scientific Research: a Framework for Deliberate Design"", see reference) that each collaborator filled in after the workshops.
The results are a validation of our approach: both iGEMers and Biohackers felt they contributed in equal parts towards the collaboration.
Interviews of Workshop Participants
We held semi-structured interviews of about 30 minutes with 5 iGEM students and 4 participating Biohackers, to evaluate the results of the workshop.
iGEM Participants
What’s unique about the Biohackers?
“The Biohackers come from different backgrounds, but they’re united by the idea of doing biology, exploring it in its different aspects.”
“They’re very keen to know and understand each step in a protocol and why that step is important. They want to get the science behind it and sometimes go even deeper than us student scientists, because for us, it’s often just a procedure, but for them, everything is interesting.”
“Their approach to science leads them to really see each step in its own right.”
“I was very surprised to find a group of people who are so motivated and curious about biology that they’re willing to give up their spare time for this project. They’re very dedicated.”
What are the Biohackers’ motivations?
“Pure desire to discover more about the world around them. It’s a lot closer to the renaissance spirit of exploration than what we normally see around us.”
“I think they’re interested in synbio because of the resemblance to electronics, which is the background for a lot of them.”
How do you think the Biohackers will develop?
“Science is continuously trying and re-trying with different conditions. So the fact that the Biohackers haven't got so many results before at the Hackspace is not as demotivating for them now that they see that [academic science] is not always successful either.”
“I think the Biohackers gained a lot of experience in terms of structure because within science, the steps to achieving a specific goal can sometimes be very hazy.”
What did you learn about supervising amateur scientists?
“I learned that enthusiasm and excitement for the field counts for a lot. Even though the Biohackers didn't have training, because of their interest they pick up stuff quickly.”
“Sometimes we're skipping too many details. [When working with amateur scientists] you need to think more"

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#Project-content_-_-_TEXT.html," monooxygenases are enzyme complexes which provide organisms called methanotrophs with the ability to use methane as their sole source of carbon and energy. There are two basic forms of the enzyme: A membrane-bound particulate one (pMMO) and a cytoplasmic soluble one (sMMO). While the genes for the pMMO complex are present in almost all methanogens, sMMO is only present in a smaller group of organisms. The expression of the respective forms is dependent on the copper concentration, mediated by a so-called “copper switch”. If the copper concentration is high, pMMO is expressed and the expression of sMMO is inhibited. If, in contrast, the copper concentration is low, sMMO is expressed. The two MMO forms also differ in their substrate specificity in that sMMO has a much broader substrate range which includes, for example, long-chain alkanes or aromatic molecules [1].  pMMO, despite being much more common than sMMO, is far less characterized due to its membrane-bound state and the analytical difficulties coming along with it [2]. Therefore, we chose sMMO as our subject matter. The enzyme complex catalyzes the oxidation of methane to methanol, additionally involving an oxygen molecule and NAD(P)H:
The sMMO complex consists of three main components. The first component, the hydroxylase MMOH, is made up of the three different subunits α, β and γ which are arranged as a heterodimer (α2β2γ2). The α-subunit houses the active site of the enzyme where the oxidation of methane takes place. The reductase component MMOR oxidizes NAD(P)H and shuttles the electrons to the hydroxylase. The electron transfer is facilitated by a [2Fe-2S]-cluster and an FAD cofactor bound to the reductase. The regulatory protein MMOB seems to have a function in modulating electron transfer because it binds to the same site of MMOH as MMOR and thus there is a competitive relationship between the reductase and the regulatory protein [3]. The active site of the enzyme contains a non-heme diiron center. Under resting conditions the iron ions are both in the ferric state [FeIII-FeIII] and can be reduced by uptake of electrons from NAD(P)H to the mixed-value [FeIII-FeII] and diferrous [FeII-FeII] states. These transitions are important for the activation of dioxygen and thus methane hydroxy"

Fully recovered after the semester break we continued our work on the project. And now it really started to turn into a fulltime job. Everyday meetings became a common occurrence and the app progression skyrocketed. Obviously compelled to fulfil the stereotypes about programmers, our progress oftentimes peaked well after normal people should be at home, enjoying their free time:     Thanks to the continuing support of the chair of games engineering Würzburg we had a professional UI kit, which resulted in drastic visual improvements. The game logic was finalized and soon we had a working app and shifted our focus on fixing bugs, adding the last features and improving the user experience.

End of August
Semester Break
The semester break resulted in a lot of skype meetings and solo programming. But the work paid off! At the end of august, we had a small UI and the first working marker, displaying an ogre instead of a virus. But just one more month of hard work resulted in functioning user management, huge improvements in the UI and first interaction possibilities with the correct 3D models.
15th of August
Final concept
We experienced a setback in our project, when the iGEM organizers informed us about the strict no sticker policy at the Convention Center. This seemed problematic at first, since we planned to replace the GPS locations with QR-Codes. Scanning such a code would lead to an encounter with a virus or potential loot. This challenge turned into an opportunity for collaboration, albeit not an easy on: We had to find the contact data from every attending team, write a personalized e-mail to them and ask for their permission to pin one of our QR-Codes next to their poster. In the end, around twenty teams answered very enthusiastically (thank you guys!!!). And for the rest: Prepare for us at the Giant Jamboree. We will be coming for you, armed with lots of QR-Codes and candy bribes.
July
Support
Unfortunately, two out of our seven team members had to quit due to conflicting schedules. Their departure threatened our project severely, since both were recruited especially for programming purposes. But in July, our team was reinforced by not only two, but three new members! Daniel and Jonas, both studying human-interaction for their master degree and Tobias, who is an aerospace computer engineering student. Due to their programming experience they soon became a very important part of our team.

H2O2 DECOMPOSITION MODEL
Purpose
In our experiment, we found it hard to measure the intracellular H2O2 concentration, so we                     controlled the external H2O2 concentration in culture to confirm our system'                     function. Although the                     H2O2 can entry the cell quickly through simple diffusion, we needed to build                     up a model to simulate                     the intracellular H2O2. At the same time, this model will provide a base for                     roGFP2-Orp1 Michealis                     equation model.
Model simulation
Firstly, in order to describe the process in cells more accurately, three reactions in this process                     are considered: diffusion, fast degradation and slow degradation. The fast degradation is caused by                     some natural reduction molecular (like Glutathione) directly react with H2O2.                     And slow degradation                     is led by enzymatic degradation.[1]
Fig.1 The kinetic model for H2O2 degradation
ODE model
$$\frac{\mathrm{d_{\mathit{p}_{e}}} }{\mathrm{d} t}=k_{1}(p_{i}-p_{e})v$$
$$\frac{\mathrm{d_{\mathit{p}_{i}}}                     }{\mathrm{d}t}=k_{1}(p_{e}-p_{i})-(k_{2}+k_{3}\frac{g}{k_{g}+g})p_{i}$$
$$\frac{\mathrm{d_{\mathit{g}}} }{\mathrm{d} t}=-k_{3}(\frac{g}{k_{g}+g})p_{i}$$
The ODE model accounted for intracellular and extracellular H2O2 levels, and the                     consumption of a finite                     antioxidant capacity using three rates:

Tsinghua,2012,Team:Tsinghua-A#Project#Scalability_-_-_TEXT.html," the expression of Y will be under the control of the promoter in this sequence. Combining it with the sequence above, Y will be expressed once A’B’ or AB is true.
Thus, we have realized the transformation of all these 10 kinds of logic relations using this system. The figure below is the whole system.
When deal with N-input system, we use a more clear and modularized design. All two-input logical relations can be divided into AB, AB’, A’B, A’B’, so we have the equation Y = a*AB + b*AB' + c*A’B + d*A’B’(a, b, c, d=0 or 1) Therefore, there is an easy thought building module as follows:
The output of AB, A’B, AB’ and A’B’ depends on these four flip module. For example, if Flip Module 1 is flipped, AB can’t influence the expression of Y. Although we can express all relations in this way, it will cost one more flip module. In addition, if we want to express logical relations with N-input, we will have to build 2^n flip modules. Obviously, it’s difficult to put into application if we need to use more inputs. Comparing with this method, with less flip modules, the previous design is more expected. From the discussion above, we can find that all two-input logics can be expressed and transformed. Now we try to extend our conclusion to N-input logic. In fact, all N-input logic relations can be expressed by N-1 input logic with the equation f(A1, A2...An)=An *f(A1, A2...An-1, 1) + An’ *f(A1, A2...An-1, 1) We can build any N-input modules in theory if we have got all N-1 input modules. Of course, our system has its own limitation. The whole system is too complex. We can divide the system according to our requirement.

Moreover, improving the binding ability of the PC chain and exogenous ligand can help promote the combination of TC and PC chains, which leads to a higher output. It follows that we obtain a method to improve the system efficiency while preventing system saturation output from decreasing: improving the binding ability of the PC chain and the exogenous ligand while reducing the binding ability of the TC chain and the exogenous ligand at the same time. This will be one of the ideas for our further experiment.

Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace"

dCas9 Production Rates from mRNA
We were unable to find a peptide chain elongation rate for S. aureus, so instead we used the values reported in BioNumber 107869
which gives a range of 0.59-3.17 amino acids per second per ribosome in Streptomyces coelicolor, another gram-positive bacteria. Freiburg's dCas9 part from last year
is composed of 1372 amino acids. This translates to a range of 0.0258 to 0.1386 dCas9 molecules per minute per ribosome. We were unable to find ribosome densities in S. aureus, but found two different estimates for ribsosome density in Bionumbers: 0.22 ribosomes per 100 codons (i.e. per 3 nt coding sequence)
and 3.46 ribosomes per 100 codons
. Using our assumption of 3 nt:1 amino acid, we then multiply to get the 0.0057-0.4797 range of dCas9 molecules per minute.
Degradation Rates of dCas9
We were unable to find any specific data on dCas9 degradation, so instead we used a protein half-life of sarA measured in S. Aureus by Michelik et al.
. We chose sarA rather than a protein more chemically similar to dCas9 because data on sarA was readily available and because dCas9 is transcribed using the sarA promoter, which allows us to at least capture sensitivity of the degradation rate to production.
Production Rates from the sarA Promoter
We used the time-series data given by Cheung et al.
to estimate the rate of production from the sarA P2-P3-P1 promoter in S. aureus. The figure from their paper is reproduced below. After diluting 1:100, the S. aureus strains were serially monitored for OD_650. We used data from the sarA+ strain, as that's more like a wild-type S. aureus strain.  Using the laboratory-conditions doubling time of 24 minutes given in given in
, we found that the bacteria would re-enter stationary phase after 2.5 hours; for time-points after 3 hours, the number of number of sarA genes producing fluorescence could be assumed as constant. For this reason, we excluded time-points prior to 3 hours. We then converted from fluorescence units to number of fluorescent molecules using"

I started studying at the University of Bielefeld in 2005 on the subject molecular biotechnology. During my BA-thesis I optimized batch and fed-batch E.coli fermentation with the focus on the steadiness of plasmids.
In my master course I switch to ""Genome Based Systems Biology"" to amplify my knowledge about molecular biology. Currently I am working on my master thesis, which deals with the metabolomic profiling of heart failure patients. I try to identify possible metabolites as candidates for a biomarker. This could be used in clinical routines to discriminate between the stage of ""ill"" and ""healthy"" in order to improve medical attendance.

The university has become my second home since I started to study molecular biotechnology in 2005. Within my studies in Bielefeld and abroad, I focused on glycobiology, soon. Future plans are to start a PhD in glycobiological research. Beside studying, and this time is limited but accepted, I do endurance sports by riding the mountain bike or running. Reconstructing classical racing-bikes and cooking natural gourmet-menus are my facorite activities inside. The latter can be connected to our capsaicine sensing-system by predicting spiciness in my self-made meals.
By synthetic biology numerous human requirements can be realized in future.

BIT-China,2018,Team:BIT-China#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," for health and beauty, many chemical detection methods emerged around the                         20th century. (such as, oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), total oxyradical scavenge                         capacity (TOSC), the peroxyl scavenging capacity (PSC), the ferric reducing/antioxidant power                         assay (FRAP), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and so on)
The main measurement principle of chemistry methods is to characterize the reducibility of                     antioxidants by redox reaction with kinds of oxyradical. Chemistry methods has the advantages of                     handy, efficiency and accuracy.
However, this measurement principle is one-dimensional. On the one hand, its detecting conditions                     are almost different from the physiological environment that cell live in so that chemistry methods                     can't evaluate the antioxidant capability of antioxidants in the complicated metabolic process. On                     the other hand, living cells are integrated with multiple natural anti-oxidant systems, including                     anti-oxidant enzyme system, reductive system, post-damage repair system and so on in which                     antioxidants play a significant role and chemistry methods can't provide the stage of living cell.                     By the way, in 2012, USDA's Nutrient Data Laboratory (NDL) removed the USDA ORAC Database for                     Selected Foods from the NDL website because of the poor authenticity and low credibility of the                     chemistry methods. To sum up, the disadvantages of the chemical methods are two key words, low                     biological relevance and low credibility.
So, we design a detection system based on living cells that create a living-cell stage for                     antioxidants' performance. This improves biological relevance and credibility and the living cell                     is yeast, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.
Why do we choose Saccharomyces Cerevisiae?
We chose yeast as the chassis cell of the product rather than HepG2 liver cancer cells, macrophage                     cells or Caco-2 colon cancer cells ect. Why?
● First, as we all know, the early researches on the mechanism of human diseases were explained                         by means of model organism yeast.
● Second, aging of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in stationary culture, often referred to                         as 'chronological aging', is a frequently applied system to study aging of eukaryotic cells.
● Last but not least, recently, human beings have the ability to synthesize yeast genome,                         which is an amazing breakthrough in the history of understanding of nature. Therefore, we                         choose yeast because of its practical application value and great potential in future.

①The safety of lab
Alarm bells
According to the Ministry of Education “2008-2009  General Undergraduate Colleges Laboratory Information Statistics”, there are  26479 laboratories in 1129 total regular undergraduate colleges in China,  laboratory area 2 6.015 million m2. With so many  laboratories, safety accidents have occured from time to time. In 2009, a  university teacher of the department of chemistry mistakenly accessed CO gas  into 307 lab, which should have been accessed to 211 lab. A woman doctor died  because of this fault; In 2010, students and teachers of a university in  northeast of China used goats without being checked in their experiments, which  lead 27 students and 1 teacher were diagnosed as infected with brucellosis; In  2013,  a postgraduate student named Huang Yang from Fudan University died  of poisoning in Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital. According to the report of the  police's investigation, a toxic chemical compound was found in the drinking  water dispenser in Huang's dormitory room, and this toxic chemical compoud is  taken out of a laboratory.
Ponder why
——Why do such tragedies repeat again and again?
These terrible incidents are not mere  coincidences and it reminds us college students of the importance of  lab-safety. Thus we studied a large number of reports and literature to analyze  the causes of? laboratory accidents.  First of all, leaders and managers pay insufficient attention is the main  reason. Second, management system and mechanism are not sound. Lacking of  safety consciousness also cannot be neglected in causing safety problems. Last  but not least, non-standard hardware construction is also a key reason.
reflect on our own
——What is happening to our lab?
Laboratory  safety awareness is the ""Achilles heel"" to our lab. Too much facts  tell us that most accidents are caused by negligence of researchers. Do  experiments without wearing gloves or lab coats, pile up clutter at random in  the laboratory, or eat pineapples in the"

A mature system of all-round resources sharing could definitely make iGEM a better community. Before it could be accomplished, let’s make the first step by setting up an information sharing platform to promote material sharing. Team Nankai has already designed a model for i-Share.

2. iShare Survey
Before a functional platform could be established, we surveyed its popularity among iGEM teams this year. Questionnaires were sent to 281 iGEM teams separately and 82 of them were filled and retrieved. Statistics and analysis of the questions are as following.
Most of those teams were undergraduate teams (76.14%), some were graduate teams (20.45%) and two were high school teams (2.27%).
Q1. Which section is your team in?
Also most teams surveyed were from Asia (53.41%), some were from North America (21.59%) and Europe (18.18%), 5 teams were from South America (5.68%) and one team from Africa (1.14%).
As we explained, “ishare” wants promotes communication and material sharing between iGEM teams. However interactions between teams are greatly limited by the distances of teams. It’s easier for us to reach those teams that are close to us, teams in Asia, but it’s pretty clear that we still need help in organizing real material sharing events on anther continental.
Q2. Which region is your team in?
Among those teams interviewed, 77% of them had difficulty finding experimental materials related to their projects and about 53% of those troubled teams said their project was greatly delayed due to the lack of materials.
It’s usually very difficult for a new team to start on their project. We experienced this inconvenience last summer and that was where the idea of “ishare” came from. Information on wiki could sometimes be too overwhelming, and most of the time we never know how to contact a team by just reviewing their wiki. Therefore it would be great if “ishare” can provide a chance for two-way communication as, a supplement for team wiki. Teams who join “ishare” could put project description and e-mails on it, so"

Identify societal issues mostly addressed by iGEM teams
Propose a comprehensive review on synthetic biology from the iGEM point of view
Analyze content and create debates within our team, Europe and iGEM community
Step 1: Scanning of the wiki
We dedicated a good deal of time just to actually go into each wikis of each years since 2007 until 2011 and found what were the themes tackled by the teams. A priori, we told ourselves that obviously  teams having a clear human practice tab were to be considered but as in the past iGEM competition it was not mandatory to include such discussion  we thought that people might have included it within a more general discussion and this is why we read all of them. Every time there was a discussion about bio-safety/bio-security, ethics or any kind of reflexion revolving around synthetic biology up to the application of the project was taken into account. The primary raw data was huge, but we already had quite an overview of what had been said. This is where we agreed between us to discard discussion on applications of a project since most teams where mentioning it. Second, we created six convenient categories that are as follows:
Public education
This includes bringing to the public (defined as other iGEM teams, scientists or the general public) a presentation of what is synthetic biology (SB) or the specific iGEM project may it be in the form of a forum, a conference or classes given to students.
Public perception
This includes getting to know the opinion or the preconception of what is SB, genetic modifications of organisms and any relevant pieces of information about their knowledge in biology/modelling/engineering. We also included in that part the social and political framework in which iGEM evolves.
Patents and licenses
This is a rather specific discussion or questioning about laws, patenting regulations and other legal concerns.
DIY bio
The Do It Yourself (DIY) movement is at the cross-section of many societal and scientific debates therefore it is a section in and of itself.
Ethics
This is the most vague section as it includes bio-safety, bio-security issues as well as questioning about application and societal implications of iGEM and biology at large. As a matter of fact any thorough investigations and questioning revolving around SB was included here.
iGEM tool development
Some teams decided to give back to the SB's community in another form than BioBricks, some of them developed ""how-to"" guides and others software programs.

DESCIPTION
L-tert-leucine is an unnatural amino acid which plays an important role in various industrial products, especially in pharmaceuticals. With its application, many methods were developed for its preparation in the past decades. Some of them have low conversion rate and poor chiral selectivity.Thirty years ago, scientists developed enzymatic reductive amination to produce L-tert-leucine by using leucine dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase. This technology greatly improved the yield and excellent enantiomeric excess value of L-tert-leucine. It is regarded to be one of the most efficient routes. But due to the different activity of leucine dehydrogenase and format dehydrogenase, this method is not perfect(Figuer 1) [1]. The cofactor regeneration may be broken in reaction processes.
Figure 1 The enzymatic reductive amination for synthesizing L-tert-leucine and the bug of this method
In order to solve this problem, we put forward many methods. The basic idea is variable control. We constructed plasmids which bear leucine dehydrogenase gene (leudh) and formate dehydrogenase gene (fdh). One plasmid which contains both leucine dehydrogenase gene and format dehydrogenase gene controls the copy numbers and the transformation efficiency. And the only variable is efficiency of ribosome binding sites or strength of promoters. So the first method is changing different ribosome binding sites. Because of the weak activity of formate dehydrogenase, we connected fdh with the strongest ribosome binding site from iGEM registry, which is numbered BBa_B0034. Then, we changed the ribosome binding site of leudh(Figure 2) [2].

Since the recycled toilet paper is derived from paper, we looked into the monetary value of recycled toilet paper in combination to the resource, paper. After this we looked at the price of the toilet paper, and compared to the price of wood. This way, we could make a parallel to the toilet paper CO2-eq. The cradle to grave carbon emission of paper is 0.9 CO2-eq per kg paper (Croezen & Lieshout, 2015; figure 2 gives a visual representation of the factors determining the carbon emission of paper feedstock).
Figure 2. Life cycle assessment of offset paper production (Silva et al., 2015).
The cost of paper is €150 per ton. Due to the fact that toilet paper recycling is still in its infancy, it was hard to define the representative price for this resource. However, after talking to several experts( as you see here ), we came to a price estimate of  €15 per ton. Since, toilet paper holds 10% of the monetary value of paper, we divided the CO2-eq by 10 as well, giving our recycled toilet paper feedstock a carbon footprint of 0.09 CO2-eq per kilogram.

Table 1. The carbon emissions of our feedstock, recycled toilet paper.
Next we need to know how much energy (and therefore, how carbon emissions) is required to produce 1 kilogram of StyGreen. The energy requirement is based on the following formula (see table 2):
From the energy requirements we can now derive the process emissions in CO2 per kg StyGreen by means of the following formula (see table 2):
This brings us the a process emissions of 1.229 CO2 per kg produced StyGreen. If our genetically engineered yeast had a 100% conversion rate, we would need 10 kilograms of recycled toilet paper to produce 1 kg of StyGreen (based on the theoretical maximum yield). Which would mean that the carbon footprint of our StyGreen would be 2.129 CO2-eq per kg.

FAU_Erlangen,2016,Team:FAU Erlangen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," better absorber for sunlight than GFP. In sunlight, wavelengths between λ = 500 – 510 nm possess the highest intensity. While the absorbance maximum of hibiscus tea of λabs = 517 nm matches that quite closely, the absorbance maximum of GFP with λabs = 475 nm is much more off.
To further improve this system, the idea of tandem solar cells using both fluorescent proteins and hibiscus tea emerged. When the emission spectrum of the protein and the absorbance spectrum of the dye have a sufficient overlap, emitted photons from the proteins can excite dye molecules a second time and therefore increase the quantum yield, leading to higher currents. Some tests have been carried out using tea and GFP or tea and mCherry. While results with GFP were rather poor, cells with mCherry and tea provided higher currents than cells using only tea as photosensitizer. However, differences were in the range of standard deviations and therefore not significant enough to lead to any general conclusions. Another drawback is the morphology of the TiO2, since without a stabilizing biofilm underneath the TiO2 layer did not attach to the glass substrate very well. Both those problems still need to be tackled, making the idea of tandem solar cells just a concept for now.
Future Prospect
As an outlook, tandem solar cells using fluorescent protein and hibiscus tea could prove to be very efficient. Taking into consideration that the adhesion of metal oxide layers to the glass substrates have been much better when biofilms are grown underneath, solar cells with biofilm, tea and fluorescent protein should be tested as well.
Another very interesting approach would be to combine our project with the iGEM project from TU Darmstadt 2014. They focused on a biological synthesis for organic dye molecules by E. coli, namely anthocyanins, to use them in Grätzel cells. By combining their dye synthesis with our biomineralization, completely biological solar cells could emerge.

Press release from TUM
Joint TUM and LMU Team Win First Prize at iGEM Competition in Boston
Manufacturing Live Tissue with a 3D Printer
04.11.2016,  Research news
At the international iGEM academic competition in the field of synthetic biology, the joint team of students from the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU) won the first rank (Grand Prize) in the “Overgraduate” category. The team from Munich developed an innovative process which allows intact tissue to be built with the use of a 3D printer.
The international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition encourages students from the field of synthetic biology to implement innovative ideas and to contend with their biotechnology projects. The competition, which was initiated by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), has been organized by the iGEM Foundation since 2003 while the MIT campus in Cambridge, MA, hosted the event until 2014. Among the 300 finalist teams this year there were twelve from Germany, including a joint team from TUM and LMU of Munich.
The 2016 iGEM project of the year, led by Professor Arne Skerra from the Chair of Biological Chemistry at TUM and sponsored by the Research Training Group GRK2062 of LMU, examined the growing problem of insufficient donor organs in transplant medicine. “The participating students from TUM and LMU developed an innovative method that should ultimately make it possible to manufacture intact tissue, and possibly even complete organs, with the help of a 3D printer,” said Professor Skerra explaining his current project group. “This breakthrough was only made possible by a combination of synthetic biology, molecular biotechnology, protein design, and technical engineering.”
3D PLASTIC PRINTER BECOMES ‘3D BIOPRINTER’
One question the team asked was: What if the printed tissue could fulfill entirely new functions in the body, such as the production of therapeutic proteins? The printing of non-living biological material such as cartilage is already state-of-the-art. However, substantial obstacles still had to be overcome on the path to printing complex cell structures. “And this is exactly where this year's project began, in which live cells were printed into"

DNA Gel Electrophoresis
gDNA PCR samples from 22/8/2018 were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer. 5μL was pipetted into each lane. The gel was imaged using a gel documentation system with UV-light.
This gel shows various bands, but no integration (5680bp) nor intact lacZ (4818bp). This suggests the parental strain is contaminated with a lacZ-deficient strain. This goes along with the absence of any expected blue colony phenotype from the transformation done on 20/8/2018.

@ Burkett Lab  Notes from Robert Buck:
Today, we have re-run the gel on the two fragments of the modified TAQ part, and the results show the
experiment to be ready to move on.  We have the modified pieces and have started running a gel to purify the
products before PCRing them together.  I am uploading a picture of the gel re-run (which needed re-running
due to some bad buffer the last time.)  The first two lanes are 1kb and 100 bp ladder, the third is prefixed TAQ,
and the fourth is suffixed TAQ.
August 30
@ Burkett Lab  WOOHOO!!! Once more into the fray...
It was a great meeting. The enthusiasm of fall semester starting filled the halls of the school, and created a warm environment to reconnect with the group after a month's downtime in a land of transport troubles.
Progress is continuing to be made on PoliColi. Some buffer problems have been addressed, and we're hoping to have successful results showing within the next week or so. We still need to ligate the ignition and then we'll need to put the whole thing into the C3 plasmid, and test it. We have had a NY iGEM team volunteer to test, but we'll need to test compared to commercial product, and folks within DIY-Bio have offered to test as well. We'll also need to show our purification protocols and write up our characterizations.
Some work on the wiki is needed. We still need pictures uploaded, and even taken of the participants. Please update days with your journal entries of what has occurred and your reflections in regards to troubleshooting so we can show a path to those without these experiences. The"
York_UK,2013,Team:York UK#Notebook.html_-_-_TEXT.html," again amplified via PCR but this time using Phusion polymerase for high fidelity (Thermo Fisher). Gel confirmed that everything went fine and specifically. Using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) we clean up the PCR product, then measure the concentrations using NanoDrop1000, do the required calculations and then proceed to the main reaction:
In 60 minutes at 50 ˚C we joined all of the 5 fragments using the Gibson Assembly Master Mix provided by NEB. Confirmed by a PCR.
The PCR was not fully specific but it is unclear whether these fragments formed during Gibson reaction (main fragment joining sites are identical RBS) or because the temperature used was too low (51˚C & 58˚C). 3rd and 4th lanes are negative controls. 1% agarose dyed with SYBR-Safe, QStep4 ladder.
Before August 11th
During this time we tried putting all of our genes inside the pSB1C3 iGEM plasmid but with little luck. Everything seemed to be working fine up until the point when we realised that colony PCRs are not so trustworthy. It appeared clear that most of the colony PCRs came out as false positives after we decided to run the PCR on already purified plasmids. However, some samples were already on their way for sequencing (thinking that we actually got something within our pSB1C3 backbones we sent them). The sequencing results gave us an answer: we planned it all wrong! Graphical summary:
So all of our parts that were to be put inside the iGEM plasmid only had XbaI and SpeI cutting sites, but we were unaware that they actually had complementary sticky ends and it was nearly impossible to ligate something in between.
We fixed it with new primers which add the remaining part of the prefix and suffix. However, we lost 2 weeks worth of productive labwork.
August 12th
So after receiving the new primers we continue working. This time we're using Gibson's assembly to directly insert our mtr part into pSB1C3, this allows us to skip any problems that might occur during digestion or ligation.Note that during design of these primers we decided to produce two different mtr parts, one of which would lack the promoter and the first RBS(crR12) which we thought might not be as convenient for other teams.
So today we tried amplifying mtrAB(from the previous Gibson), mtrC(from previous PCR, should have used the genome) and pSB1C"

Since we have already amplified the backbone (pSB3K1) we can make the Gibson assembly to make the Pconst-TetR plasmid.
Mutation PCR, using HifiPLUS enzyme and TD PCR. 1kb+ ladder.
The latest mutation PCR yielded large amounts of product. The two bands might be a little worrying, but overall this is a lot better than any of the previous trials, with the old polymerase. The stitch PCR will be ran tomorrow.
On the side, more reporter and lysis plasmids were assembled (together with a control, containing only the backbone), from the previously made gibson fragments (PCR purified on 2nd August 2011).
Wednesday, 03 August 2011
Alessandro made glicerol stocks of Vincent's plasmid (J61002-Ptet-RFP) and purified the PCR product of the day before (Pconst-TetR) to make the Gibson assembly (using the already amplified backbone of pSB3K1). The Gibson assembly for the pSB3K1-Pconst-TetR (using either equimolar ratio of backbone-insert either 2 times insert) and for Reporter-RFP/Lysis has been plated.
Stitch PCR, using fragments from 29 July Mutation PCR
Douglas ran the stitch PCR on the latest mutants, unfortunately yielding virtually no product. Only the PQ39LV31YM42 mutant has detectable amounts of product in the correct size, but then it also had a much larger concentration of template (or so it seems by eyeballing the mutation PCR's gel).
Likely causes:
The common sequence DNA was lost during PCR purification (Doug accidentally used the high cut-off buffer), in which case the mutation PCR should be repeated from scratch...at least for the common sequence.
The 3' final and 5' final primers are not suitable for the stitch step. Concentrations and heat cycles should be accurate, because they worked for the mutation PCR.
Nadine transformed and plated Doug's mutant TetR plasmids from 26.07. She prepared the X-gal and IPTG solutions needed for the control, but they still need to be filtered.
We tried a first colony PCR on J61002 Ptet-RFP cells, but nothing got amplified... Tomorrow we'll try the primers on purified plasmids to see it the problem comes from here"

UT-Tokyo,2012,Team:UT-Tokyo#Project#Inhibition#Discussion_-_-_TEXT.html," so that urea production rate is expected to rise compared to Ptrc-RBS-rocF on low-copy-plasmid / ArgR binding site on high-copy-plasmid (Tokyo Tech 2011). Furthermore, although a single ArgR binding site introduced downstream of Ptrc-RBS-rocF did not derepress arginine biosynthesis, it is thought that sufficiently long ArgR binding sites introduced downstream the Ptrc-RBS-rocF binds to many more ArgR proteins and derepresses arginine biosynthesis, consequently enhancing the urea production rate.
Modeling
To assess the effectiveness of our method, we made a model and to calculate estimated differences in transcription factor availability with and without adding tandem repeats of binding sites.
We start with up the equilibrium reaction:
By introducing binding sites into high-copy plasmids, the following reactions are added:
Let
[I]:=concentration of the transcription factor alone
[G]:=concentration of the genomic DNA alone
[GI]:=concentration of the  transcription factor - genome DNA complex
[T]:=concentration of the binding site on plasmid alone
[TI]:concentration of the transcriptional factor - binding site complex
Also, we assumed that the equilibrium constants, k, are equal.
This leads to
[GI] = k [I][G]
[TI] = k [I][T]
[I]+[GI]+[TI]=const=:X (Total concentration of the transcription factor)
[G]+[GI]=const=:Y (Total concentration of the genomic DNA)
[T]+[TI]=const=:Z (Total concentration of the binding site on plasmid)
What we want to know is how
changes from a situation where [G]:[T] is 1:0 (wild type) to 1:1000 (introducing 10 tandem binding sites into a 100 copy  plasmid), because
represents the proportion of Genomic DNA bound by the transcription factor. Let u:=

By substitution,
we set the variables y:=Y/X, z:=Z/X, t:=1/kX.

Now, we solve this equation for the LacI transcription factor because its k is known.

The concentration of genomic DNA is

From the above, we caluculated u against X (Total concentration of the transcription factor) for several values of Z/Y(the number of binding sites introduced) = 0, 1, 10, 100, 1000 and obtained the graph following

The consumption of alcoholic beverages is part of global culture. Many places in the world have native alcoholic drink, which consumption is related to local events, parties and festivals [3]. Today, the global market of alcoholic drinks generates over a trillion dollars yearly [1].
Even though the consumption is large, most alcoholic beverages are not included as a formal share of the market. The  commercialization of “non-standard”, and the problem of adulterated beverages, despite both being neglected topics, is an increasing risk in leisure events. An estimate by the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that about 30% of the alcoholic drinks sold in the world are not registered, reaching two-thirds of all the consumption in India, and shocking 90% in East Africa [2][3]. It is a global issue that has raised the concern of international organizations such as ICAP and Amphora Project .
Figure 1: Infographic showing the proportion between registered and unregistered drinks around the world.
Noncommercial beverages represent a serious risk to global public health, essentially due to the possible presence of drink contaminants that might lead to intoxications, and even to death. The mostly found contaminants are methanol, long chain alcohols, acetaldehyde, ethyl carbamate (possibly a carcinogen [4]) and metallic ions, such as copper and lead [5] [6] [7]. Among all contaminants, methanol regularly causes cases of severe symptoms and death, which appear often in the news. Our team decided to explore the possibility of detecting methanol in alcoholic drinks through engineered microorganisms, aiming to create a method that is not only accessible, but cheap and scalable, to analyse non-registered alcoholic beverages. In the process, we also intended to generate useful BioBricks for the Registry of Parts.
Figure 2: News showing the current problem relevance.
A Neglected Problem
Methanol can cause serious health disturbances, from metabolic acidosis to neurological problems [5].

 Our collaborations
Collaborations in the iGEM competition are important for us as well for other teams because it’s a source of mutual help. We don’t consider other teams as competitors but mostly as a source of inspiration. We hope to have helped some             teams too. In this competition, mutual help is essential for present a project as successful as possible in Boston.             Networking, sharing and communication are the keys in research and did our best to keep them at the centre of our working philosophy!
OUR MEET-UP: Biotech4Change - 3 mins “Present your iGEM project” pitch
During our meet up at the European Parliament we gave the opportunity to other iGEM teams to present their project in 3 mins in front of the public and the panel of experts! It was a unique opportunity in an incredible venue! Since                 we were the only Belgian team we really wanted to valorize our work and share it with other teams from across Europe! More info about the conference .
We were happy to host 3 teams: Lund (Sweden), Paris-Pasteur (France), TU-Eindhoven (Netherlands).

They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Parts Improvement_-_-_TEXT.html,"592023 and BBa_K592024 . However, we discovered that they did not put a terminator after the mTagBFP CDS. We wondered if the observed fluorescence outputs will be different with versus without a terminator. Therefore, we decided to perform an experiment for comparison. The experimental results showed that the observed fluorescence levels were lower without a terminator.
Given our results, we would like to caution future users in referencing the relative promoter strengths reported by Uppsala Sweden 2011, as their measured expression levels, generated by parts without a terminator, may not fully represent the true strength of the tested promoters.
THE INVESTIGATION
We hypothesized that the expression level of mTagBFP is affected by the presence or absence of a terminator.
An experimental construct was built where the mTagBFP generator ( BBa_K592100 ) was driven by a constitutive promoter (BBa_J23101) and a medium RBS (BBa_B0032). It was compared against its counterpart which harbored a terminator, BBa_B1006 3’ to the CDS. Constructs without promoters served as controls for auto-fluorescence. We then performed the same experiment but used BBa_B0034 as the RBS instead. Both of the results showed that the observed blue fluorescence outputs were lower when the transcription was not properly terminated.
Figure 1. Comparison of the expression levels of a BFP generator with and without a terminator. (a) Circuit diagram illustrates experimental setup of the experiment harboring BBa_B0032. (b) Experimental results of the experiment harboring BBa_B0032.(c) Circuit diagram illustrates experimental setup of the experiment harboring BBa_B0034. (d) Experimental results of the experiment harboring BBa_B0034. Error bars represent SEM of 3 independent experiments on 3 different days.
Our results indicated that the proper expression of mTagBFP requires a terminator; thus the previously submitted part BBa_K592023 (BBa_B0032-BBa_K592100) and BBa_K592024 (BBa_B0032-BBa_K592100) are translational units only and should not be considered as acceptable alternatives to mTagBFP generators, which have terminators.
In this experiment, we have improved BBa_K592023 (BBa_B0032-BBa_K592100) and BBa_K592024 (BBa_B0034-BBa_K592100) by adding a terminator BBa_B1006 3’ to these parts. Both of the improved parts, BBa_K1899001 ("

iGEM gives me the chance to  spend the lonesome summer holiday in the lab, to taste the sweetness and  bitterness of working as a researcher, and to build our dream starting from  scratch. I have spent a lot of sad time watching pieces of blank agarose gel or  bare culture plates, but also a lot of happy time enjoying my success in  cloning and good news from DNA sequencing. iGEM conveys the idea of creativity,  efficiency, hard work, and also persistence, which should be valued by all  scientists of tomorrow. Let us all appreciate the infinite possibility of  synthetic biology through iGEM!

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," to target different pharmaceuticals in the wastewater, Pharem was the perfect partner to receive important feedback about our enzyme and where they think it could work best.
Input:
A treatment of pharmaceuticals in wastewater before biological treatment is unique, because everyone else is targeting the final effluent. With that approach we would avoid the contact between antibiotics and bacteria in the treatment plant.
Adjustment:
Worked on a final implementation of our solution before the biological treatment to avoid the contact between antibiotics and bacteria in the wastewater treatment plant.

Description: PhD candidate at the Department of Energy Technology, School of Industrial Engineering & Management, KTH Royal Institute of Technology.
Input:
For an industrial application you need to separate the beads from the wastewater so you can treat them isolated and make them reachable.
Adjustment:
We added a separation system to the construction of our product. With that conception we completed the recycling system and were able to fuse it with the important recovery system.
Final Stage
×
The beads carrying the laccase in a wastewater treatment plant are mixed with the wastewater in a tank one step before the biological treatment. They receive aeration from the bottom of the tank, which prevents the beads from sedimenting. The connection pipe between this tank and the biological treatment contains a magnetic separation system shown as a turning wheel with magnets (red). This brings the beads to a separated tank where they are recovered in a washing solution and pumped back into the tank containing the wastewater. With this concept, we enable recycling of our enzyme with a magnetic separation system and are able to fuse this construction with a recovery system that washes the beads and keeps the enzyme active. We keep the needed infrastructure low and make our enzyme on magnetic carriers reusable to detoxify wastewater from pharmaceuticals.
Following the path of water
×
Access to clean water reduces infectious diseases and keeps the marine homeostasis at bay. The process of keeping the water clean plays a central role in our communities, but the process can differ depending on geographical location. This is due to different regulations and laws that are implemented, and it is also affected by economical factors. We, therefore, met with several experts and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) professionals to pitch Biotic Blue.

Besides, a constitutive promoter called LacI promoter and LacI protein sequence in front of that, found on peT45-b vector’s another part. It is obvious that this part is IPTG-dependent, so Western Blot can be performed easily with the help of His Tag to observe PotB59 expression and S-tag to observe PomA expression.
In this part’s design we confronted with the same problem as we did in Hns part design . So we planned to clone them into PSB1C3-T7 plasmid, which we designed. By doing this, we will have the proteins synthesized in high amounts with the help of T7 but there won’t be any additional amino acids.
Results
PSB1C3-HNS/HNS-T108I/PotB59-PomA CLONING
We cloned IDT G-Block genes into PSB1C3 vector in order to make it ready to be submitted and have many copies of it. For this purpose we digested PSB1C3 vector and HNS,HNS_T108I, PotB59/PomA G-Blocks with ECoRI and PstI restriction enzymes. Then we ligated these cut genes into the plasmid by using T4 DNA Ligase . Ocurring products were transformed into BL21 competent cell strain. To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was perfomed with Verify Forward and Verify Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly t the band should be 314 bp long, but if colony PCR worked, then bands should be at 744 bp long line for HNS and HNST108I genes, and 2045 bp long line for PotB59/PomA gene. As the result of colony PCR, the possible right cloned colonies were incubated in liquid culture for 16 hours. After this incubation, we isolated plasmid DNA from this bacteria culture by miniprep plasmid isolation method. We controlled obtained colonies with cut-check for a second cloning control. We used EcorI and PstI restriction enzymes for cut-check.
