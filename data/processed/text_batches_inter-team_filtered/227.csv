Greensboro-Austin,2013,Team:Greensboro-Austin#Standard Proposal_-_-_TEXT.html," submission plasmid, pSB1C95, featuring the homing endonucleases I-SceI and I-CeuI and their corresponding restriction enzyme sites for quality control purposes. Parts MUST be submitted between the BioBrick prefix and the BioBrick suffix in pSB1C95, and the homing endonuclease sites I-SceI and I-CeuI MUST NOT be contained within the part itself, though the probability of this is negligible for gene-sized or even operon-sized parts (Fig. 4). There are no other rules or restrictions for part submission.
The Genbank file for our proposed submission standard may be found here: Media:PSB2C3.gb
Unlike typical 6 bp restriction sites, these homing endonuclease sites are 18 bp and  27 bp in length, with a tolerance of sequence degeneracy corresponding to a normal  restriction site 10 to 12 bp long. However, the probability of even a 10 bp sequence  randomly occurring in a submitted part is orders of magnitude lower than a 6 bp site,  thus effectively eliminating the problem of illegal sites for the purposes of rapid quality  control (Fig. 4).
Fig. 3: Comparison between the probability of the occurrence of homing endonuclease sites RFC[95] and the current BioBrick RFC[10] restriction sites in a sequence of a given length.
Conclusion
Maintaining a genetic part repository is an inherently labor-intensive and error-prone process, but one that supplies a valuable service to both veteran and novice research groups. It is important to employ strategies that enable simple quality control workflows and maximize utility to the end user. We believe that the Open Sequence Format eliminates user problems associated with sequence restrictions while minimally impacting quality control workflows at the repository. Please see the RFC link above for full details.

Harvard iGEM Club for their administrative and logistical support
NEGEM for valuable feedback on our ideas and presentations
Our Inspiration:
We would like to acknowledge previous researchers both within and outside iGEM, whose work informed our design and experiments:
Yoshida et. al. Their 2016 Science paper A bacterium that degrades and assimilates poly(ethylene terephthalate) discovered and characterized the enzyme that forms the basis of our project design. The paper also documents the catalytic activity of PETase expressed in an E. Coli chassis.
UC Davis iGEM 2012 We adapted their pnpb assay protocol for our own experiments to determine the catalytic activity of PETase. They showed that pelB worked as a signal sequence for sending LC Cutinase (which is similar in size to PETase) to the extracellular medium, which gave us evidence that it might work for PETase. Read more on their work here.
Oxford iGEM 2015 They showed that YebF, a protein naturally secreted to the extracellular medium in E. Coli lab strains, when fused to their protein, successfully secreted the protein to the outer membrane.

CH2.2.4 - MANUFACTURING
“Have you ever heard of nanotechnology? Well, biology is a nanotechnology that already exists, and that actually works. The ribosome is a programmable nanoassembler embedded within a reproducing machine. Could we responsibly use biology to manufacture useful products, from the nanoscale (atoms) to the decascale (buildings and bridges)? What can biology be programmed to manufacture?”
Example:
BioFactory for Efficiency
The current methods for purification of biomolecule from cellular lysate are expensive and time consuming.
BioFactory are modular microfluidic chips that modified enzymes attached onto the surface of corresponding chip, and when combined in series, these chips operate as a linear biochemical pathway for continuous flow reactions. To reduce the undesired reaction and lower the costs of producing bio-pharmaceuticals in the future, E. coli was engineered with the mechanism for light-induced apoptosis, so they only flow through the through the microfluidic channels, coating them with the desired enzyme, so the traditional protocol is unnecessary.

Public Health Agency of Canada
Look through regulations carefully and at the end applications
We spoke with Brigitte Cadieux, a senior policy analyst for new and emerging technologies, Jennifer Mihowich, who works in the biosafety risk assessment unit, and Melanie Sabourin, a biosafety education officer from the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) to discuss the regulations surrounding protein nanocompartments. They suggested we look through the regulations across the different agencies carefully as terminology is not always the same. In Canada products and pathogens are regulated and not technologies so there are currently no regulations for the use of our system as a technology. However, under some legislation, virus-like particles are considered microorganisms and that legislation would still apply to them. They told us that under the acts that PHAC monitors, our PNCs would be classified as Risk Group 1 and thus exempt from their regulations. In terms of explaining our project to non-scientist audiences, we were advised to change our language to keep it simple. We were also told that even though our project is not using viruses, it would be good to have an example of viruses being used in a positive way when speaking to the public. Overall, this interview was helpful in examining if our system would be safe and what the regulatory landscape is surrounding it.

Compare your project to current methods in use
We spoke with Nicole Kimmel, the aquatic invasive species specialist with Alberta Environment and Parks. She helps to oversee the five components of the aquatic invasive species program: policy and legislation, education and outreach, monitor, inspection, and response. She said that one of the larger threats that they are setting up prevention methods are zebra mussels. Current detection methods that they employ are substrate monitoring in various lakes in the province, tow nets through lakes, and are starting to explore environmental DNA methods. For prevention, the province is using boat inspection stations and have done studies on using potash (potassium chloride) as a treatment though is still in the process of being registered as a treatment with the federal government of Canada. When asked if they had heard about Zequanox, she said that they have, but it is too cost prohibitive for Alberta to use. She suggested that we consider the advantages and disadvantages of our project with these methods. For our project, she said that we would"

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!
Zhisheng YU
Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point

The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.

Introduction
General description
Proof of Concept
Introduction
While Catalytic Activity Sequencing began as a method for catalytic biomolecule activity recording, we have also created a way to adjust CAT-Seq to record activities of regulatory part libraries. In addition to the activities, cross-interactions of different regulatory parts can also be measured.
We highly suggest to read the main design section of CAT-Seq first, as we will not go over the main design scheme here and will only build upon it further.
Adjusting CAT-Seq system for Regulatory Sequences
Just like in the main CAT-Seq design page, we again divide the Regulatory CAT-Seq design page into two parts:
1. Design description - an in depth explanation of how a particular part of our system works, how it should be used in real-life situation and why such design choices were adopted.
2. Proof of Concept - a story about how we applied the design using specific components and parts to build Regulatory CAT-Seq and demonstrate that it works as intended.
General description
As already established, the Catalytic Activity Sequencing records the activity of different catalytic biomolecules in separate water droplets simultaneously. That is achieved with the help of Substrate Nucleotides. In turn, unique catalytic biomolecules produce different amounts of Product Nucleotides, which can then be quantified by adding them to their own amplified template DNA and later sequencing those molecules.
Yet, the activity of the catalytic biomolecule is not the only aspect that can influence the amount of Product Nucleotides that are produced. If all of the droplets would contain the same catalytic biomolecule, but each droplet would have a different concentration of that biomolecule, we would get different amounts of Product Nucleotides. For example, droplets with large amount of biomolecules may produce a large number of Product Nucleotides and vice-versa .

USTC,2016,Team:USTC#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," derived from the environment, the state of air, water, and the climate are of particular concern. To protect our planet, the waste of plastic, or 'White Pollution' for more exact, must be settled down.             As a synthetic biology lab, we first studied a lot about 'plastic's biology decomposition'. Though we didn't choose it as our project at last, we found synthetic biology a useful tool to deal with white pollution in the future. Then we held about 3 conferences to discuss what and how we can do to deal with plastic waste with synthetic biology. During the discussion, we came out with some practicable solution. A bright future with no more white pollution is showed in front of us.             After that, we held a environmental friendly event called 'Plastic for Plants' combined with some popularization of science. We asked college students to collect their used plastic things for about 3 months and bring them to us then. We would send these bottles to the plastic recycling center and we would give students some plants as a reward.           Integral elements for a sustainable development are research and innovation activities. From the recycling center, we were told that the percentage of plastic that can be fully recycled, rather than downcycled or go to waste can be increased when manufacture technique improves. On the other hand, the use of biodegradable plastics is increasing. As future synthetic biologic scientists, we are determined to green the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development in the future.
Lecture for High School Students
We invited a group of high school students to see our laboratory and tell them something about synthetic biology and our project. In this way we hope to share some knowledge of science and attract them to devote to themselves to the process of discovering mysteries of nature in the future.
A lecture on general molecular biology, synthetic biology and iGEM was held in July. We introduced the basic molecular biology mechanism and iGEM to high school students who were deeply intrigued in biology.
In the beginning we introduced iGEM to students using 3 interesting iGEM projects as examples. Then we held a small class for the students: we exquisitely prepared a presentation specifically for students to introduce to them the basic knowledge of DNA and genetic engineering with simple words and lovely pictures.
We talked about the scale, location, function, discovery and shape of DNA based on history and researches as well as knowledge of genetic engineering introduced by a project done by USTC in iGEM 2014.
We also included a brief history about the development of synthetic biology in the lecture"

XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#Applications_-_-_TEXT.html," well-known that nowadays drug-release is a very hot research field. Many efforts are focusing on how to modify or delivery drug using materials such as synthetic polymers, liposome or nano shell which can respond to differences between different intracellular environments. Our oscillatory gene circuits provide a more biofriendly way for drug release. Our future plan is to make some deep exploration in this field.
2.2 Protein Synthesis
What else, a resonance may happen among the oscillators which results in a peak synthesis of protein under some conditions. This phenomenon can be used to increase the yield of some medical proteins such as antitoxic serum and antibody[9][10].
2.3 Prevention pathogen
In the applications of controlling pathogens, quorum sensing system plays an important role in regulating growth and reputation of microorganism. So we could restrain quorum sensing system to control microorganism to make our life more healthy and nice. The most important part in the metabolism of pathogens controlled by quorum sensing system is the synthesis of toxin and the formation of membrane system. If we can restrain these two kinds of effect may we decrease some potential diseases resources and improve the effects of antitoxins. What's more, it is a particularly attractive point to prevent pathogens through restraining their quorum sensing system instead of killing them directly as it offers the prospect of combating effectively infections resistant to all existing drugs. As we all know, just treat diseases via using antibotics or antitoxin can help these pathogens improve their resistance to various drugs, which is very dangerous for us human being. To date, although we've found that different fungus form different signal molecules, the quorum sensing system almost takes part in cell morphological transformation and information communication. We think our oscillatory gene circuits provide a very useful and meaningful model to promote more and more research in this field[11].

In order to achieve the highest rate of production of the desired metabolites, steps along the pathway should be monitored in order to minimize ""bottleneck"" steps.
Workflow
Our model system for a metabolic pathway is the violacein pathway used in yeast. This pathway produces four distinct chemicals from five distinct enzymes of which only two contribute to the variety in color changes. We developed a strain of yeast that use the violacein chemicals and are responsive to different chemical inputs due to inducible promoters. When these inducers are added, a color result can be observed.
Figure 1. Violacein genetic pathway.
In order to make observed color changes quantifiable, we decided to build a low-cost instrument for measuring the color of the culture, processing this color using RGB values, and interpret this color as ""desired"" or ""undesired."" Then, the flow rates of inducers into the culture are autonomously adjusted to optimize the system towards the desired color. This system uses inexpensive and easily-accessible parts, with a Raspberry Pi for computation, such that it would be easy and affordable for other labs or start-ups to implement on a low budget.

Gold Medal Parts Requirement
In order to meet gold medal requirements, we worked to improve the function of three BioBricks submitted by previous iGEM teams. We codon optimized them for yeast, which should result in a quicker response time to chemical inputs when implemented in our system. We also removed illegal restriction sites in order to make them more suitable for BioBrick assembly. More detailed information can be found on our BioBricks page.

Figure 15 illustrates all the proteins that are upregulated due to the presence of pantothenate kinase II. Proteins that are associated with each other are linked and proteins involved in metabolism are highlighted in red.
We performed String analysis on the proteins that were upregulated in order to determine the effect of pantothenate kinase II on the proteome of E. coli. In Figure 15 the proteins involved in metabolism are highlighted. It is not surprising that a large amount of the proteins are involved in metabolism, as pantothenate kinase itself is a metabolic protein. The three central proteins in the figure; tpiA (triose phosphate isomerase), PGK (phosphoglycerate kinase) and pykF (puryvate kinase) are all involved in glycolysis. NuoG (NADH dehydrogenase subunit G) is involved in the electron transport chain, another mechanism by which the cell generates energy. The rest of the upregulated proteins did not have as clear a correlation. The increased amount of glycolytic enzymes indicates an increased energy consumption in the cells, due to the presence of pantothenate kinase II. The fact that coenzyme A is utilized in the oxidation of pyruvate, fits with the increase in glycolytic enzymes.

Biotech Industry Funding Assessment
In order to have a brief understanding of the funding conditions of teams from China, we distributed a survey concerning their funding this year. In this survey, we mentioned several questions, such as 'where they got the funding', 'how much they have got', 'materials they need to apply for funding', etc. We got several replies from Fudan-Shanghai, SJTU-BioX-Shanghai, Tsinghua, etc. According to their replies, we have found an interesting phenomenon. Most of iGEM teams depend on the support of related departments of their school as well as the College of Biological Science. Only a few teams have won funding from biotechnology companies, such as SJTU-BioX-Shanghai. Even though they have got support from Merck and GeneScript. Only Merck promises to offer cash support, while GeneScript offers discounts of reagents. However, teams from Europe earn major funding support from biotech companies. For example, Imperial College London has earned support from welcometrust, eurofins,NEW ENGLAND BioLabs and QIAGEN. Paris Bettencourt has won support from Thermo, Invitrogen, Eurogentec, MINES ParisTech, geneious,lif technologies, GATC, ROTH and so on.
The above phenomenon leads us into investigating the current situation of Chinese biotech firms and R&D (research and development). Although Australia, Korea, Japan, and China stand out in terms of biotech company number, sheer number is not an appropriate indication of the industry's performance level (Figure 1). The R&D expenditure of China is far lower than that of USA (Figure 2). It reveals the limited investment in scientific research and development in China's biotech companies. Special regulation of investment in China more or less plays a significance role in this problem. There has not been an incentive to promote biotech companies or biotech industry to invest in new fields, such as synthetic biology. Besides, their lack of knowledge of synthetic biology has led to their unwillingness to invest in the research of this field.

Part I: All you need is LOV
Expanding the synthetic biology toolbox using LacILOV
LacILOV is a novel, photoactive fusion protein of the LacI repressor DNA binding domain from the lactose operon of E. coli and the Light Oxygen Voltage (LOV)-Sensing domain from Avena sativa (oats) [1] . The LOV domain is derived from asLOV2 and activated in the presence of blue light through a flavin mononucleotide (FMN). FMN transfers energy to a catalytic cysteine and induces a conformational change in the protein. In the absence of light, it is hypothesized that LacILOV behaves much like the lac repressor, dimerizing and binding to the lacO promoter sequence, Ptrc-2. However, in the presence of light, specifically of wavelength 465 nm [2] , the repressor monomerizes and no longer blocks the promoter site allowing RNA polymerase to start transcription.
Experiments/Testing:
In order to characterize the kinetics of LacILOV, we designed a simple composite part by placing mCherry, a fluorescent reporter, under the control of the LacILOV-controlled Ptrc-2 promoter. The part mCherry (BBa_K2469003) was selected as a reporter because it is chromoprotein, i.e. a fluorescent protein with an emitted wavelength visible to the human eye.
Figure 1. LacILOV mCherry part BBa_K2469003
Given the sensitivity of the LOV domain from asLOV2 to blue light, specialized equipment was designed to exclude ambient light and deliver precise wavelengths and intensities of light to our cells. https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Hardware. Design, assembly and programming of the light delivery systems was documented and improved upon based on feedback.
Figure 2. Fluorescence assay for LacILOV mCherry and Reporter Switch Design
To characterize LacILOV, cells containing LacILOV-mCherry construct were grown under a consistent light intensity and the fluorescent output was measured at different time points. To account for the rapid growth rate of cells in the exponential phase, the fluorescence date was divided by the optical density. A statistically significant difference was observed between cells grown in light and in the dark. However, since the activation time was slow, we"

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html," two chains of the template are equivalent: it makes no difference to the tree structure (Huffman code of each node) if they are exchanged. Hence, several equivalent chains should be matched to a certain set of chains in the species only once.
The algorithm of species matching is of the most importance since it provides technical support for structure-based description of species and reactions. It costs most of the running time. We will try to increase the efficiency of the codes of this part.
Generation of products based on reaction templates
Within MoDeL definitions, product templates are composed of both ST parts and NST parts. The ST parts are all transfered from reactants or modifiers. A transfer table is defined in each reaction template to label where does each ST part comes from and goes to. It seems to be very easy to generate Chain-Node structure of products from reactants and mod modifiers based on the transfer table. However, it doesn't.
Consider first a template reaction with one reactant, X-A-B-Y, where A and B are both NST parts and X and Y are both ST parts with type ANY. If it could be digested by a certain enzyme, the products should be X-A and B-Y. In the real biological system, if there is a species with structure C-A-B-C, where the first part C and the last C binds to form a tree node. If we try to digest the A-B bond, the species would not be split into two pieces as expected because the two products are connected by the tree node. To generate the structure of products correctly, we design a three-step mix-trim-split algorithm to solve this problem.
Mixing, trimming and splitting: three-step algorithm to generate products.
The first step is to mix reactants and products. The mixture includes all chains of reactants except for those which are matched to the templates as well as all trees. It also includes all chains and trees of products. And now we have a mixed species with chains and trees from different sources. It is worth noting that chains and trees of modifiers will not be added into the mixture. The next step is to trim the trees. Trees with leaf nodes that are not defined in chains will be removed from the forest. The last step is to split the products out from the mixture. This is because the mixture may not be one standalone complex. For example, it may have two unbound and uncorrelated chains. In other words, some chains that are not connected with others via tree nodes should not be incorporated into other species. The final standalone split species are real products in the system.

In terms of the respective ability to adsorb copper and cadmium, we compare genetically-engineered yeast, SCRaMbLE yeast and original one.
As is illustrated in Fig.5-1 and Fig.5-2, engineered yeast significantly absorbs more ion than the control group without any improvement. Furthermore, SCRaMbLE yeast also shows excellent adsorption capacity, comparable to genetically-engineered one.

  Since the information of many existing BioBricks is incomplete, thus the usage of the BioBricks will be affected. It is necessary to standardize the minimum information required for a qualified BioBrick. Furthermore this standardization will reduce the time to locate and find a BioBrick. So it is essential to create a default template for storing the information of BioBricks.

The tubes were centrifuged lightly and left for incubation for an hour. We then placed the 11 tubes into -20 freezer.
We then prepared some %0.8 agarose gel and 1XTAE buffer.
500ml TAE + 4 gr agarose
To prepare 1X TAE buffer, mix 980 ml of water with 20ml of 50X TAE buffer.
Today we discovered that the JM109 tramsfromations had worked and so miniprep cultures for these were set up. We did these in LB+Amp and LB +Amp +Tet to make sure that the cells still had Tet resistance.
Did digests of pGFPrrnb and Arun's ara fragment and ran these on a wide well gel to fragment prep them.

Introduction
Since we did the ligation of sleB and pSB1AT3 yestoday, we will perform transformation today. also,our new primers for cwlJ has arrived, we can PCR cwlJ fragment using new primers(clwJnoCut). New primers doen't contain restriction site for standard Biobrick. So when we get the cwlJ PCR fragment, we need to run another PCR with original primers.
Experiment procedure
DNA transformation (Phil Style)
Step 1:Get ready for ice box and water bath(42C-45C).
Step 2: take out E.coli competence cells from -80c freezer and put it into ice box immediately for 30 mins.
DH5-alpha: which were prepared by our iGEM team.  JM109: which were bought form company.
Step3: Seperate the original cells into two tubes, one for our ligation DNA, one for control.
Step4: Add ligated sleB:pSB1AT3 20ul to one tube, for the control one, the pSB1AT3 backbone was added. After votex them, put on ice for 30mins.
Step5: Put the tubes in water bath 43C exactly 50 sec.
Step6: Put the tubes back to ice for 2 mins.
Step7: Add 0.9ml liquid LB to each tube and incubate 37C for 1 hour.
Step8: Pray 200ul cells on LB+Amp plate, 37C overnight.

Project Description
A repressor is a protein capable of binding DNA to a specific DNA binding site called an operator. The presence of a repressor bound to an operator prevents the access of the RNA polymerase to the adjacent promoter and in turn shuts down the expression of one or several genes that are transcribed from the concerned promoter. This negative regulation is called ""repression"". The activity of a repressor can be modulated via several mechanisms; for example, a repressor can interact either with an inductor (in this case it detaches from the operator to allow transcription), or with a co-repressor (which binds to and enhances its final fixing to the operator for further decrease of the transcription).
We propose to design a system in which the transcriptional expression of a gene (or of an operon) is repressed within a given temperature range. Such a system could be used to detect whether cells have grown within a defined temperature range. It could also be used to constrain the cell viability within or outside a set temperature range.
To create the above described system, we propose to design a repressor which is present and active only within a temperature interval. How to restrict the activity of a repressor to a defined temperature range? We propose to use i) a RNA thermometer that allows the repressor translation only above a certain temperature (T1) and ii) a thermolabile repressor that would be inactivated above a given temperature (T2). With such a system, the repressor is expected to be active between T1 and T2.

Localization
As an example of combining adhesiveness with other properties, we decided to localize the Mfp-5 to one side of the cell. This combination can be used for the fixating of bacteria in one direction and their flagella in an other, specific direction. When all bacteria are attached in the same direction, and all flagellae are orientated in the other direction, this will produce a particular flow pattern on nano-scale. One could create in this way a so called bio-motor. In a more fundamental point of view one can use head-to-head binding of bacteria for creating a line or circle of bacteria. The iGEM team of SDU-Denmark 2010 has produced a phototaxis system.One of the proteins they used was a transmembrane transporter  clustered to one specific side of the cell. Denmark achieved this by the use of specific directed proteins, which are involved by the formation of the flagellae, attached to their construct is sensory rhodopsin. Replacing this rhodopsin with our construct, or attaching our Mfp5-GFP to the sensory rhodopsin, enables localization of Mfp5.

UCLA,2013,Team:UCLA#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," the situation was fully understood. The outside world that we so reproached with their fancy vacuum cleaners and such was coming crashing down, and we, we were the chosen ones. God had smiled down upon us. At least that's how we saw it at first.
Then everything changed for us. Someone from the outside figured out that we were the solution. Our blood. The immunity, the cure, ran through our veins. Through an injection of just a small amount of of one of our people's blood, immunity could be transferred to another person. One liter of our blood could cure almost a thousand of the afflicted. Like a tidal wave had crashed down on us, our community was forever changed. We were at the center of the world. We had to give our blood to the children, they were the most precious. No, we should give it to the politicians and leaders, they were the ones that could rebuild society. A community once so quiet and isolated, had to make decisions that would affect the future of man. Division started to arise. We all agreed initially that the community had to act as one. Any decision we made had to be the decision of the group. It would not be so easy. Some advocated selling our precious resource to the highest bidders. The money could sustain us for endless generations to come. Everyone had their own idea of what was right, a different vision of how to shape the future. Humanity was ours for the molding. It was never said, but it was at the back of all of our minds. Until we made a decision, however, not one drop of our blood would be given to anyone. Then Tevya disappeared.  He was just a boy of 14. No one goes missing in the community. It just did not happen. This had to be something else. Then Job, then Jakob. Then Tsaitl was taken, my own daughter. Fear swallowed all of us. We finally gave in. We surrendered ourselves to the will of the Republic of South Africa in return for protection.  The bombs fell next. The other nations would not sit by and be eradicated. They demanded their own share of our blood. It seemed the greatest war in the history of mankind is about to begin. That is where I find myself. Locked in my cell in South Africa as I hear the bombs fall around me.

SJTU-Software
We have always maintained a good relationship with SJTU. We met at Taiwan and shared our thoughts about the development of Biohub with them. They think highly of the feature of experiment record.
""Your experiment recording provides a simple and quick method for routine experiment. It could save a lot of time for us experimenters. They create the template of the experiment process which could record each experiment clearly and show the experiment to others easily. It is very convenient to sharing the ideas of experiment and communicate with each other. However, there are also some things which need to be improved. Some experiments may do two or more things in the same time, for example, when experimenters centrifuge something and they need to operate supernatant and precipitate separately so that it may be better to improve the function at these situations. Also, you could add visualization function in the editor which makes the showing process more clearly.""
We really appreciate their suggestions and now we are doing our best to improve our project.
UESTC-Software
We invited UESTC to experience Biohub and they gave us useful feedback. ""Biohub’s UI is awesome and has a sense of science and technology. Also, Biohub can respond fast and smoothly. However, there are also some places need to be improved. For example, there is no introduction to the function of Biohub at its homepage. Besides, it would be better to add the user guide to editor which could be very important for green hands.""
We have got a lot from their feedback and now we have improved our function and made our project better.
Team USTC
We had communicated with Team USTC frequently and realized that writing the experiment reports may be a difficult and duplicated thing. We got the inspiration from them and decided to develop our project now. During the process of developing, they helped us to build a professional and easy-to-use editor and a powerful search engine to help experimenters work effectively. They provide the knowledge we need and experience the functions and help us improving our project."

Synthetic Biology survey + General public
Introduction
Synthetic biology and the human body are two aspects that are hugely controversial when put in the same sentence. So, we wanted to start our project off by finding out what the general public think about synthetic biology to find out how they would feel about using synthetic biology to tackle healthy ageing in humans by releasing a short survey. The survey also gathered information on the gender, age, and their level of knowledge in Synthetic biology. We felt that it was important to gather data that accurately represented the variety of knowledge in the general community and to see if these factors affect the outcome of the survey. Not only were we able to get data from the UK, but we also got response from the general public in Spain, Germany, Italy, Indonesia, China, Hong Kong, Lithuania, Ireland, USA, Sweden, Mexico and Portugal, an international opinion on the issues raised in the survey.
We also wanted to find out what the Chinese community thought about our project and synthetic biology, in order to maximise our impact on the general public and perceptions of synthetic biology and genetically modified organisms. Therefore, Yuqiao was able to translate the same survey into Mandarin and distributed the survey through our Wechat account. We were able to get 120 responses from this survey, which adds up to 286 participants from our survey, 94.17% are in China (including Hong Kong, Taiwan Macao, South China Sea Islands and the Fishing Island) and 5.83% are in elsewhere. The participants were answering the survey in Chinese which is then translated to English by our team member Yuqiao.

Lethbridge,2016,Team:Lethbridge HS#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"asmid into a bacterium the same concept, or is it separate in classification?  To answer this, we must look at the fact that bacteria rarely complete the duty we are attempting to task them and secondly are we making any changes to life at all or for pointless reasons. Whether or not changes are made is an important factor because we are not adjusting the organism’s genome but instead simply placing a plasmid inside, much like an organ transplant which has no criticism within the church. We asked Father Wilbert, the Canmore parish priest, what he thought about our area of work and his main concern was the involvement of human life and how critical the idea of working to better society is.
A person’s contribution to the evolvement of mankind is important when participating in work that is not always deemed right. A historic philosopher named Kant theorized that right or wrong is based off of one’s actions to fulfil a duty, and that good will is the ultimate virtue because it cannot be turned to selfish reasoning. (3) The Catholic belief coincides with Kant’s ideas on good will. This also includes the importance of bettering mankind when participating in synthetic biology, rather than using it to accomplish immoral ends. A similar topic related to ethics is a person’s conscience for the vatican says that “science without conscience can only lead to a mans ruin” (1) We must be aware of the complications that can arise and know personally what is right from wrong. “That everyone might see clearly that the Church and her Pastors are not opposed to true and solid science, whether human or divine, but embrace it, encourage it, and promote it with the fullest possible devotion” Pope Leo XIII. Understanding that the Catholic Church completely supports scientific advancements for the improvement of our race is important, but to do it properly and ethically is vital.
The line between religion and science is not black and white, allowing room for varying perspectives. Therefore, outlining the rights and wrongs within a project is difficult to do without including bias. The position of this and any other project on the spectrum of right and wrong should rely on the well considered and fully informed decisions of many diverse perspectives if any conscientious progress is to be made.
Thank you to the OLS Canmore team for giving us their ethical review of our project"

It produces lactase intracellular, and suicide gene regulates flora quantity at the same time. When the number of bacteria reaches the threshold, suicide mechanism will be activated, then intracellular lactase will be released to the gut.
Thus, it guarantees the proper number of bacteria in the intestines, and continuously produces lactase, achieving the goal of sustainable and effective treatment of lactose intolerance.

Modification of Lactic Streptococci to Produce Arginine to Treat Oral Diseases
In this project, we transfer the gene segments which can code the synthesis of arginine from the corynebacterium crenatum to the lactic streptococci of which the lactate dehydrogenase has been knocked out through gene engineering, then put the modified lactic streptococci to human oral cavity so that arginine can be secreted in abundance when it’s acidic ,which is good for prevention of dental caries. Caries, one of the most common oral disease, is caused by that the cariogenic bacteria from the oral biofilm produce so much acid because of metabolism that pH declines to certain level which leads to enamel demineralization. Arginine is alkaline so it can improve the oral pH; it can increase the absorption amount of fluorine of enamel, enhance the antiacid ability of the surface of enamel and facilitate the remineralization of enamel. There is not much arginine in the mouth, but Glu, the synthesized substrate of arginine, is rich in our mouth. The lactic streptococci is a kind of oral probiotics, which can adhere to the surface of oral mucosa planting itself and develop and restrain the breeding of pathogenic bacteria. Besides, it has acid resistance and can produce bacteriocin which is totally good to oral health. We control the synthesis condition below pH 5.5 using pH control promoter, so arginine will only be secreted in abundance when it’s acidic and has a risk of dental caries.

K1319000
RFC [25] Version of E0020
This part is an RFC [25]-compatible version of BBa_E0030. The start and stop codons have been removed to make it RFC [25]-compatible and the part is flanked by the RFC [25] prefix- and suffix-sequences.
The coding sequence encodes EYFP (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein) which is derived from A. victoria GFP. The excitation is 512 nm and the emission is 534 nm. This part was used to create the parts K1319001 and K1319002. It can also be used in a fusion protein instead of E0030 due to its RFC[25] compability.

RFC [25] - compatible dark quencher based on K1319000 (E0030) called REACh1
This part is a RFC[25] dark quencher that is based upon K1319000 (the RFC[25] version of E0030/EYFP) called REACh1.
Two mutations were introduced that eliminated fluorescence:

Usage and Biology
This protein is designed to be a dark quencher for GFP ( E0040 ) in a FRET system. When used in a fusion protein with GFP it reduces the observed fluorescence of GFP drastically. In the biobrick K1319013 this is realized and the proteins are fused together with the linker K1319016 which includes a specific TEV protease (available as K1319004 ) cleavage site. The fusion of the proteins bring GFP and REACh1 in proximity to each other which allows GFP and REACh1 to act as donors and acceptors in a FRET (Förster Energy Transfer System) system. GFPs emission energy is thereby taken up by REACh1 and released as thermal energy"
BNU-China,2014,Team:BNU-China#edu.html_-_-_TEXT.html," is a high school in Gaomi, which is a countryside. And the other is a famous high school in Beijing, the second high school attached to Beijing Normal University. There were many differences.
Above all, the studying conditions in the countryside Gaomi is humble. The size of their school is small, the buildings are old and they are short of some necessary teaching equipment, such as the computers, projectors, experimental equipments and so on. On the contrary, the second high school attached to Beijing Normal University’s condition is much better. For example, their biological laboratory is well equipped, which is as complete as the lab in the university. They have enough microscope to satisfy the demand for every student. In a word, the school provides their students with sufficient support to foster their study interests.
What impressed us is that the students in the countryside were eager to know what we talked to them because everything might be the first time for them to hear of. The bad condition didn’t prevent their curiosity to science though they couldn’t get the chance to do research now. They are all hard-working and they have to help their parents to do housework or something else. While the students in the second high school attached to Beijing Normal University lives a opposite life. They can concentrate their focus on what they like and the school can inspire their interest and broaden their horizon in various ways and make use of kinds of resource. As a result, they can know much more and build up a scientific thinking way in their early ages.
The input of the government in Beijing takes more than in the countryside. And the government concerns more about the improvement of the city’s school. Consequently, the schools in the city can gain better and better condition and realize their desire to see and do more. But the lack of concern, the schools in the countryside achieved little. We can’t emphasize the essential role of our government any more, but we also have to do something to change the circumstances and improve the students’ study condition in the countryside.

Proposal
Dear iGEM Foundation & all iGEM teams:
We are a team from BNU-China. When we were doing human practice in China’s rural areas, we were deeply moved by the students there. When we were talking about some knowledge out of their text books, they showed amazed expression and were thirsty to know more, for most of them don’t have any access to the Internet and the only way to know the outside world is by TV. However, TV program never deliver scientific knowledge timely"

Part: BBa_K2492000
In short : A reporter for the visualization of transgenic neuron-AWB, it also can roughly estimate the expression level of injected plasmid.
Modified GFP with three introns which can help well expression of GFP in C.elegans. In our group, we use it to indicate the location of neuron AWB in C.elegans. We integrated podr-10::CoCHR::GEM-GECO::GFP transgene in C.elegans by microinjection. Modified GFP will be highly expressed in AWB driven by promoter str1 (no biobrick part).
Part: BBa_K2492001
In short: Part BBa_K2492001(CoCHR) provides channelrodopsin(CoCHR), which serves as a light switch. In order an part to manipulate neuron activity through ~470nm excitation light, we choose this part, which is benefit for sensitive to blue light.
It’s the central part of our project. Part BBa_K2492001 contains CoCHR(Chloromonas oogama channelrhodopsin) [1], a cation-selective light sensor, which promptly generates a large permeability of divalent cations after absorbing photons from our excitation light source.
In our project, we hope to investigate how olfactory messages are transmitted by the neuron systems. In order to decrease delay of response comparing to chemical stimulus, we choose optogenetic techniques. Since C.elegans do not have sense to light, we express channelrodopsins in pairs of neurons as light receptors. CoCHR is the channelrodopsin in transgenic AWA. In order to express CoCHR in A"

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html," the genome of B. subtilis was PCRed and placed into a BioBrick vector. First, primers specially designed to anneal to the PxylA+RBS+comK region within B. subtilis were used to amplify and isolate the desired gene. This took multiple tries, but was eventually completed. It was discovered that the amplicon required an extension time of 3:00 minutes at 72 ° C in order to be successfully amplified, an unusually long period of time for a sequence of only ~840 base pairs. The PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel and the gene was extracted using the EZNA Gel Extraction Kit by Promega. As mentioned previously, the objective was to place comK, including its xylose inducible promoter and RBS, into a Biobrick vector. This was made possible by excising the RFP gene from an RFP Generator Biobrick plasmid and replacing it with the comK gene. Both the vector and insert were digested with XbaI and PstI, and the product was cloned within Top10 E. coli. Our secondary objective was to remove the EcoI and SpeI cut sites contained within the open reading frame of the comK gene. Unfortunately, this could not be completed before the deadline.
However, we have successfully biobricked and sequenced the lacZ gene. It is on its way to Boston!
Desiccation and heat conditioning of B. subtilis spores
It was decided that the long term, freezing, and short term, refrigerating, storage B. subtilis spores should be subjected to complete desiccation, drying, and then  subjected to heating.  These heating conditions were designed to imitate conditions that  the spores might be subjected to while in the dignostic device.  Two temperatures were  chosen, 40 °C and 60 °C.  Because the device would be in very hot developing countries for what could be years hot, but still environmentally plausible, temperatures were tested.  As well, long and short term storage spores of spores that were made in the presence of xylose, either with xylose added when bacteria was added or xylose added  when SG x2 was added, to test if the desiccation and temperature treatments had any adverse  effects on spore regeneration.
The same method of desiccation as above was used and then the spore were either placed on a hot plate, for 40 °C, or in a water bath, for 60 °C"

High School Students
Tuesday, October 14th
On Oct 14 2014 Stefanie and Nadine visited a high school in Bern as a part of our human practice project. The girls had the chance to teach students at the age of 16-17 years. Through these lectures, we attempted to impart the basic principles of synthetic biology and encouraged the students to participate in a discussion of the concepts presented. In these discussions we tried to focus on risks to humans, health, the environment and the public. The structure of the lessons was really open for personal inputs from the side of the students. The topics discussed ranged from whether you should or should not express GFP in other organisms (the question of freewill came up), animal trials in research, GMO's in general to the production of artificial meat in bioreactors.
Furthermore former iGEM projects were quickly outlined and their possibilities and potential discussed. Thus, we increased the level of awareness of synthetic biology and simultaneously teach the students how to approach complex problems. Another aspect of our visit was to promote the studies of science in general. The students were encouraged to ask all questions that came to their minds.  This school visit belongs to the outreach aspect of our human practice project as it aims to share knowledge with the public.

UIUC-Illinois,2012,Team:UIUC-Illinois#Notebook#MeetingNotes_-_-_TEXT.html,". Among 4 plates hopefully there will be results! =)  - Bob - ran a gel of Cara’s PHAT optimized PCR. Started a digestion of it. Working on wiki, more specifically putting all of the lab notes from the google doc on the wiki in nice little tables. Will also contact Melissa.  - Cara - did gel purification of the PHAT optimized PCR. The band is not the right length, but the PCR has consistently yielded this band. Therefore purified it and wants to find what it is. The suspicion is that the primers and PCR are working and the part is messed up. Digesting the vector or sequencing the part are good things to do at this point. Will type up a protocol from Brad and send it to everyone about growing things in a controlled environment for PHAT.  - Uros - talked to Todd in detail about the tethered PUF to CFP construct ourselves. He thinks that we can do it ourselves and complete it before August. The plan involves making alot of primers (angela will help). In parallel will construct a plasmid with the CFP parts so that we can have a control to see how the CFP works. have to check if CFP is in the kit and if we can just PCR it. Still the debate: do we synthesize or do it ourselves? it’s the problem of time and money. will sit down and create a very detailed plan with Todd tomorrow.  - Adi - been working on the wiki, Alex will come down on Saturday and everyone should come to lunch to meet him and discuss  - Angela - everyone needs to create a powerpoint of work and data to present at the advisor’s meeting tomorrow. Having problems with comp cells because transformations aren’t working. So is going to take some iGEM comp cells and try the same ligation transformations. It that doesn’t work will then transform with boughten comp cells. Prepared more ligations so will continuously ligate and transform until results. Finished the primers for primer extension and checked with Kori about making a standard protocol. Next week the primers will arrive and will start cloning the modular PUF reporters via primer extension.
7/16/12 Monday Reflection:  Optimistic goals:  *By the end of the summer, 4CLSTS and BM3 and mutants BM3 tethered with PUF for the scaffold project and biobrick TAL  *Entrepreneurship: Concern about the project progress. Send out our constructs for Patenting.   *Necessary PUF synthesis if PUF doesn’t get cloned by the end of July."

We did a PCR cleanup of the pC13AI Gibson pieces, electroporated (time constant was 2.88 ), and plated the cells. We continued taking masses for Aspergillus with afp1 growth assay and began a growth assay with inoculating discs. We measured the colonies of G. lucidum (control, and in the presence of various antibiotics) one final time, as they reached the maximum possible sizes for the petri dishes they were growing in.
We plated pC13AI. We are continuing Aspergillus growth assay, and completed the G. lucidum growth assay.

Two gels, each with 20 wells, were run simultaneously for fluorescence. The DNA samples loaded were from a Q5 PCR on pC13BQ with pC13AT, pC13BQ with pC13AU, pC13BR with pC13AU, pC13BR with pC13AT, and pAK13AO with pC13F. pC13BV was transformed into electrocompetent BL21 E. coli. A culture of G. lucidum was diluted and homogenized, and 150 μL aliquots were spread on plates and let dry. Paper discs were soaked in 100X solutions of geniticin, hygromycin, ampicillin, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol and placed in the center of each plate. We miniprepped holin 8 & 9. The results from the growth assay do not look good. However, we found that the T7 polymerase in BL21 is controlled with an IPTG inducible promoter, so more pC13BA was grown with IPTG and plates were all re-inoculated with the corresponding amounts. An appropriate volume of LB was also added to some plates to account for mass changes. The zone of inhibition tests were also restarted with recultured (with IPTG) pC13BA. The pC13BN transformations yielded no colonies.
Today we ran a gel to verify insert lengths from Q5 PCR products of fluorescent constructs. We also transformed our T7 + hygromycin resistance construct into E. coli for characterization, and set up a zone of inhibition experiment to test the efficacy of antibiotics and antifungals on G. lucidum.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," while I rendered them into .avi files. Together we now understand the entire process from importing .pdb files to output animations to .avi files; we are ready for production.
For next week, after meeting with Cesar, we had agreed to focus on animation for now. The physics and details can be added later as we gain experience and insight with the molecules we working on.
Week 15: August 5 - August 9
Justin kept working on animating TALE binding to DNA, except this time he will also add ferritin, coils and linkers. The result is ferritin sphere + 12 TALE's + 24 coils and linkers + 1 DNA. Unfortunately the computer he is working on is not powerful enough to smoothly handle this, as a result of the slow response from the computer his progress has been slow. For me the work is to animate immobilized TALE binding to DNA. The difficulty lies in finding out how TALE should deform such that it can bind to DNA while one end of it is immobilized. For this Justin and I actually spend some time playing with wires that represent TALE and DNA to figure out the proper motion. Moreover Maya just behaves oddly on our computers; sometimes we can't generate DNA using the ePMV plug-in, sometimes the button on the Maya shelf will disappear. As a result we have accumulated a lot of technical questions that we were hoping to address.
We spent a lot this weeks meeting with Cesar talking about the big pictures and the approach he would like to see. He advised us to abandon the way we had been doing animation, which is by key framing, and switch to Nucleus engine. We are going to hold off on these adjustments until after our meeting with Merry, the expert on Maya, has taken place.
Week 16: August 12 - August 16
The computer Justin was using for his animation work complained about the depletion of RAM. As a result he couldn't work effectively in the lab, so we agreed to let him work at home for he has a much powerful desktop. This means that except Monday he was not here with the rest of the lab, but he will show up on the group meeting next Monday to report upon his progress.
Our meeting with Cesar on Monday resulted in division of labour between Justin and me. From that time I will be working on the quantitative modelling (on what problem is yet determined) while Justin will be responsible for the animation (that is, the entire story telling). This supports the decision of letting him work at home, for now there is no need of cooperation between the two"

in the oilsands? Do they have any concerns about its implementation? We consulted with two professionals working in biotechnology and ecological development in Alberta.  Both of them emphasized that while the concept sounds great, it is important that we keep in mind the safety and ethics of our project.
How can OSCAR and FRED be designed with safety in mind? From our various conversations our team looked toward both physical
and genetic design considerations to ensure that from the outset, both FRED and OSCAR were designed in a safe and functional way.  This involved incorporating physical containment features in the  biosensor and bioreactor designs and employing biological kill switch mechanisms.
How can we teach people more about FRED, OSCAR, and Synthetic Biology? From our interviews it was clear that not many people knew about synthetic biology or its applications in the oil and gas sector.  For this we partnered with the Telus Spark Centre, the local Science Centre in Calgary, to help communicate synthetic biology to them.  We also developed a video game that had its debut at the centre and educated adults and kids on synthetic biology in a fun way!

    After that, we assumed that there will be x% of bacteria can present the property we need. Then we can get population of expressed bacteria:
        fex(t) = x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Because we need the oxalic acid-time function, we assume the speed of oxalic acid secretion of per unit of bacteria is v. So the total speed should be:
        V(t) = v*x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Since the secretion of oxalic acid should be accumulated, we take the integration of total speed of time. We used WolframAlpha program to find out this integration.
        ∫1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t)) dt=3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C0
        ∫V(t) dt=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C
    Because the function should began at (0,0) point, we can find out constant C in function.
        0=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55*0))+C         C=-3.522*log(19.37)*v*x%         C=-10.438*v*x%         Substitute C=-10.438*v*x%
        Soa(t)=v*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438)
    This is oxalic acid-time function.
    We also need to find out lipid-time function. Obviously, it’s more complicated than last function, since the decomposition speed cannot be a constant.
    The fex(t) function should be also available in this part. Starting constructing process, we assumed that initial total lipid is N, lipid that decomposed is n, and the decomposing speed is relate to following factors:
    k: a constant representing efficiency of lipase     (N-n): remain amount of lipid     fex(t): quantity of expressed bacteria
    And there should be a function meaning that decomposing speed is proportional to the remain amount of lipid and quantity of expressed bacteria:

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#ModellingAndPrototype_-_-_TEXT.html," coefficients that are necessary to convert the input values to colours by going 255/component reading for white colour. When a colour is measured by the sensor, we multiply each of the components by corresponding coefficients and then convert it to the name of a colour. We also wrote a C++ program that takes the sensor values as an input and does all necessary calculations to output the actual colour of the sample.
Additionally we designed our experiment to measure the fluorescence of RFP and RFP cell count using a plate reader over a time course of 30 minute increments overnight. We prepared overnight cultures and are planning on diluting the samples by 4 to create 6 triplicate samples. The plate reader shakes the samples at a set speed and keeps the temperature constant. Our samples will be shaken at the fast speed. We plan to do a couple of experiments at different temperatures of 30 degrees C and 37 degrees C to see how temperature affects cell growth and fluorescence. Using this data we are going to plot the different concentrations and observe cell count/fluorescence vs. time course of 30 minutes to determine which concentration produced optimal results and at what time period. This experiment will help us determine a threshold for the optimal concentration and if this value plateaus, or decreases over time.  Using this data we will be able to determine parameters of this component of the system and be able to incorporate it into the entirety of our model.
Additionally this weekend consisted of a workshop in Lethbridge with the iGEM 2014 Lethbridge Team in which we were able to continue working with our data and modelling.  We also received valuable feedback regarding different aspects of modelling we should further explore.

Week 11: July 14th - July 18th
This week started with looking more into our Arduino - sensor set up. The colour sensor works a majority of the time, but every once in a while it would not turn on or would turn off when the serial window is opened in Arduino Programming Environment. Unplugging the Arduino and plugging it back in helps to get the sensor working again. The fact that the sensor is not working every single time suggests that there might be impurities in our circuit or code. We will be contacting lab technicians at Schulich School of Engineering that work with Arduino to arrange the meeting to discuss the problems with our set up"
ESBS-Strasbourg,2010,Team:ESBS-Strasbourg#Project#Strategy_-_-_TEXT.html," protein-splicing system that was moderately regulated by red light in vitro65. Lastly, Voigt and colleges employed the light-dependent interaction between PhyB and PIF6 to activate target proteins in vivo. The nucleotide exchange factors Tiam and intersectin were recruited to the plasma membrane in a red-light-controlled manner where they activated their GTPase effectors Rac1 and Cdc42, respectively. In their activated form, the GTPases promoted formation of cell protrusions, and thus the motility of fibroblasts could be controlled by red light.
With this first successful in-vivo application Voigt et al. have shown that the PIF-interaction with the PhyB photo sensory core (residues 1–642) is irreversible in infrared light. By assaying PIF6, which has the strongest interactions of all previously reported PIF domains, against different variants of PhyB they demonstrated that the tandem C-terminal PAS domains (residues 1-908) of PHYB are necessary to confer rapid photo reversibility under infrared light. The interaction with PIF3 has been too weak to cause significant translocation.
 
Upon these findings, we decided to tests different variants for the implementation of our system: for the phytochrome constructs we choose PhyB residues 1-908 (PhyB900) and the photo sensory core domain residues 1-642 (PhyB650) in combination with PIF3 (residues 1-100) and PIF6 (residues 1-100).
The choice to include the shorter PhyB650 variant in our tests is reasoned by the risk of a potential sterical hindrance of ClpX due to the fusioned PhyB. Due to its reduced size, the PhyB650 construct provides an additional control for the case that the system implementation using PhyB950 does not produce results. Further, binding strength and kinetic parameters depend on the composition and nature of the individual system, so we thought it a good idea to test the findings of Voigt et al. in a novel background.
The question of the chromophore
Since the plant phytochromes PhyA and PhyB employ the modified tetrapyrroles PCB or PΦB which are not available in most tissues and cell types, these chromophores must be supplied either exogenously or endogenously. It is possible to produce the holophytochrome in E. coli by co-expressing two genes from Synechocystis for chromophore biosynthesis together withcyanobacterial chromophore 1(Cph"

Development 3 (July 15 - July 21)
16 - 17 Jul 2012
Met with Orit to show her the UI. Got threading to work, and now during searches a spinning circle of dots appears and the UI remains responsive. Search is still a little slow, and Kathy found some problems with searching for a part specifically by name. It doesn't work properly at all - sometimes it gives parts without data (which have no business moving past the filtering), sometimes it returns the desired part and then some. Will people who search for a part by ID always want only that part? If so, we can run a check for the ""bba_"" string in front. But if people want related parts and things to show up as well (less likely?), then it's alright as is. Still slow though, and sometimes it returns nothing or duplicates. After that, we started working on the data sheet that users can bring up using the element menu.
Also backend but of a slightly different flavor: working with Kathy to integrate with Eugene. Permutations were operating automatically using all the parts, which was very slow. But it worked! Had some problems with line breaks in some text files we were using to direct the process, and found that in some areas Eugene had dropped some crucial characters while writing for some reason. Very strange! But we went through and ctrl-fed the errors and fixed them. Anyway, we also switched permutations from ""use all available parts"" to ""use selected parts"" where selection was indicated using a highlight. We also applied this to level 1 modules in addition to parts, so eugene permutations should be well integrated now. The first half of today however was spent catching up on google power searching. Though I use google every day, I learned some new things about it. Hopefully I'll be a more effective searcher in the future.

It was a lovely day at the beach, when suddenly thunderstorms
Demo for international guidance counselors: we showed Photo River, the Sifteos, and the MoClo Planner. And then it was Beach Day! Pretty event-filled and most of it on the road. We ran low on gas on the way there, going out of our minds wondering if we were going to make it to the gas station (we did), and finally got to the beach. About an hour later, the sky"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"Ap2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).
Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production."

Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," of spending it into pure R&D. Consequently patents sometimes paradoxically discourage innovation.
Contrary to the previous case, some patents may protect wide discoveries (also known as foundational patents). For instance, the patent granted to Myriad genetics covered the whole gene functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 and all applications that could follow on possible ways to diagnose and cure breast cancer. This kind of patent stood against innovation, preventing any creative use of those genes by any other actor than Myriad Genetics, or leading to any other use linked to this DNA sequence (possibly there would have been many, considering the complexity of biological regulations).
As a consequence, the patent system may allow the formation of major entry barriers on some industrial domains. It is notably the case in some markets of the pharmaceutical industry in which new companies cannot easily enter anymore because they would need to buy the licences of many expensive patents from the incumbent firms.
Last but not least, the philosophical questions raised in the last two centuries concerning patents are to be considered. As this is not a philosophical essay, we will content ourselves with a brief resume. According to the American economist Thorstein Veblen (1908), a patent is illegitimate as it privatizes a collective work any invention crucially depends on the previous ones : how would a trolley have been invented if the wheel had not been invented before ?. Veblen emphasizes this idea when he argues that:
The initiative and technological enterprise of individuals, such, e.g., as shown in inventions and discoveries of more and better ways and means, proceeds on and enlarges the accumulated wisdom of the past. Individual initiative has no chance except on the ground afforded by the common stock, and the achievements of such initiative are of no effect except as accretions to the common stock. And the invention or discovery so achieved always embodies so much of what is already given that the creative contribution of the inventor or discoverer is trivial by comparison. (1908)
This thinking still applies nowadays on different themes. So the question remains : why should a sole actor gather all the economic benefits from this collective process?
Consequently, in some cases, having an economic alternative to the patent system may actually be a good thing.In this perspective the leading economists Claude Henry and Joseph Stiglitz assert that :
The patent system is only one part of a society's innovation system, through which the production of knowledge is financed, incentivized and organized. Too much attention has been focused on IPR (intellectual property rights), and too little on alternatives, e.g. open source systems, publicly financed innovation and prizes. (2010)
In a recent paper"
UrbanTundra_Edmonton,2016,Team:UrbanTundra Edmonton#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," ask him a few question regarding his contribution to this simulation, and about the conditions needed for sustained living on Mars and his responses are featured below.
Which Martian Simulation study were you part of? HI-SEAS?
Mr. Ross: Yes, I was part of the HI-SEAS Mars simulation. I participated as a crew member on the second overall mission, which was considered the first in a series of three psychological studies. Our mission was 120-days, or 4-months long, and the following two missions in the series were 240 and 360 days respectively. HI-SEAS stands for the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation, and is operated by the University of Hawaii with funding from major sources like NASA.
What role did you play in the simulation?
Mr. Ross: My role during the mission was the “Systems and Communications Specialist”. However, the roles were not determined prior to the study, so we had the choice of title based on the responsibilities we managed during the mission. Since my background was in experimental physics, I was immediately learning about the automated systems and “life support” equipment that we used in the field. Having a background understanding of Linux and the Mac operating systems were also assets that I had that other crew members didn’t. Ultimately, I became the crew contact for our ground controllers for all of the off-the-grid systems that we used.
What key results and factors was the simulation focused on or analyzing?
Mr. Ross: This mission was focused on the psychological challenges facing astronauts on long-duration space missions. We focussed on simulating a 4-month ground simulation, but many of the lessons are translatable to other highly-isolated outposts (including Antarctica). As a result, we were responsible for divulging a lot of emotional information through surveys, keyword mining AI’s, and other psychologically relevant tests. We also wore biometric devices to measure things like our pulse, skin conductivity, ambient noise volumes, and proximity to other crew. We also routinely gave saliva samples as a means of measuring our stress levels through the hormone cortisol.
Was the conservation and recycling of resources an important consideration in making this simulation a comparable analog to a real Martian mission? How critical is sustainability in a future manned Mars mission?
Mr. Ross: Yes, in fact, we had a resident expert on our crew from NASA. Annie Caraccio is a chemical engineer working at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, on materials reclamation and waste management problems. All of the waste we generated was sorted and weighed throughout the mission in order to ascertain what typical loads on waste systems might be (at the very least it’s a good"

We performed a co-immunoprecipitation to prove that our coils actually bind to each other. Figure 7 shows our results. The immunoprecipitation worked! Therefore our coils bind to each other and can be used in our system!
Figure 7. Immunoprecipitation assay showing that the E and K coils interact with each other. The first three lanes show E coil, K coil and E coil with K coil pulled down with IgG (control) antibody. The last three lanes were pulled down with a anti-GFP antibody and probed with a anti-his antibody. The E coil is fused to GFP and the K coil is fused to TALE with a his tag. Therefore, if we pull down with GFP and probe with his-antibody a band would appear the size of TALE. This indicates that both the GFP and the TALE are present and that is possible upon coil-coil interaction.

We experimented to determine whether the linkers are effective in our FerriTALE system, compared to direct fusion. Figure 8 shows that the use of the E and K coils allow our system to work optimally. As predicted by our modelling,direct fusion is not desirable, meaning the ferritin and TALEs need to be linked.

Furthermore, dFBA simulations were subject to a sinusoidal light regime with a period of 24 hr by constraining the light exchange reaction to the output of a sinusoidal function. To avoid simulating the production of light, the sinusoidal function was limited to a maximum value of 0. The sinusoidal function had an amplitude of -30 with neither an x nor y offset.
As for simulating growth during the night, previous work has tracked the glycogen content during a 24 hour period [13]. This data showed that there was not a constant linear consumption rate during the night, so we therefore divided the night time glycogen content into three intervals, fit each interval with a linear model and used the slope as the consumption rate for that interval. The glycogen data and calculated consumption rates are shown in fig. 5.6
Figure 5.6. The graph of glycogen content on the left was taken from Angermayr et al. 2016 [13]. Three night time consumption rates were calculated from this data for the intervals shown in the table on the rate. In order to calculate these slopes in units appropriate for dFBA, this data was first converted from %(mg mgDW −1) to mmol gDW −1. Three different linear models were then fitted to the converted data specified by the interval and the consumption rate was taken as the slope of the linear model.

Table 1: Main effects screening experimental design: CFPS reactions contained concentrations of each salt supplement according to the table above. The pattern column shows whether a salt was present (✔)  or absent (X) from the system.
CFPS reactions were performed using supplement solution premixes with salt concentrations as determined by the main effects screening design. Reactions were incubated with 1.7 μg plasmid DNA encoding sfGFP (superfolder Green Fluorescent Protein) at 37 o C for 13 hours. CFPS activity was calculated as fluorescence intensity at 13 hours minus fluorescence intensity at 15 mins. This data was then used to generate a bar chart of Contrast values and a Half-Norma Plot (Figure 2 and 3) to determine which factors were having the most effect on CFPS activity. It should be noted that predictions for non-primary factors (i.e. interactions) may be inaccurate as they were forced-orthogonal. Considering the primary factors, magnesium glutamate was found to be the salt supplement with the largest contrast value, followed by potassium glutamate. This suggests that these two salt supplements were the most important. Sodium oxalate had a lower contrast value than either of the two glutamate salts, and was considered to have moderate importance in terms of CFPS activity. Ammonium acetate had an extremely low contrast value, suggesting that it may be unimportant for enhancing CFPS activity.

Contrast values were used as an estimate of a factor’s effect on the response. Interactions (*) were forced orthogonal.

Review of the crowdfunding file for Fondation UGA. It is not finished yet, the communication part has to be written by Vincent. I then worked on the fluorescence unit, especially on the dichroic filter and the photomultiplier. My researches were not really productive, as I did not understand the data sheet: I sent an email to the company to get some explanations (about the window material and the transmission). Concerning the dichroic mirror, I need to do some experiments to make sure I correctly understand how it works, as it changes from a scheme to another.
Yesterday I wanted a dichroic mirror under the tank, but it might not be necessary, a curved mirror should be enough, as the optic fiber should be located at the image focal point of the mirror. The “laser” will be reflected as well, but the dichroic mirror should deviate the light. If necessary, a filter could be used as well.
Most importantly, I found how to get a precise wavelength with a white light. It can be done with a monochromator device, it is explained on the bibliography file (I need to go more through this part). It can be really useful as the wavelength can be selected by moving the cristal.
For the automatisation part, a wheel in the (xy) plan seems to be a good idea. It keeps the pipette and the temperature units (Peltier unit and heating resistor) fixed.
To do: keep working on the fluorescent unit. 2nd modelling. Onshape.
05/10/2018
1st approach on Onshape. I modelled a lens, a dichroic filter, a well and the photomultiplier. However, the previous apparatus imagined is not appropriated to the project. First, it is hard to select 2 wavelengths with a dichroic mirror. Moreover, a photomultiplier needs a high voltage alimentation (800 V at least !); it is dangerous enough to work with UV light, I will not risk an electrocution on top of that.
The new system is presented in the figure below:
The sample is alternatively lighted by the blue and red LEDs, so that the fluorescences do not overlap. The filters are coherently placed in front of the camera thanks to servomotors (in position OFF, the filter could be in front of the corresponding LEDs, in this case the scheme is"

1. Introduction
In order to achieve the natural plants' temporal pattern for producing plant hormones in E. coli, we introduced an incoherent feed forward loop to our circuit, including a new hybrid promoter part ( BBa_K1139150 ). Plants produce their hormones transiently rather than steadily (Takei et al., 2001) (Fig. 3-7-1).  Moreover, continuous overexpression of hormones is harmful to plants (Thiman, 1937).  Thus, we thought that it should be important to achieve this transient temporal pattern for producing plant hormones in E. coli, too. By applying the incoherent feed forward loop, the transient pulse of gene expression can be generated (Basu et al., 2003; Mangan et al., 2006).
Fig. 3-7-1. Temporal pattern for producing plant hormones in plants
Our designed system with an incoherent feed forward loop is shown in Fig. 3-7-2.  We newly developed the RM/lac hybrid promoter, which is activated by CI and repressed by LacI (Fig. 3-7-3).  We planned to ligate a hormone synthase part downstream of this hybrid promoter.  Our mathematical model (Fig. 3-7-4) shows the pulse wave which the temporal pattern for plant hormone production should achieve (details about"

Control : S17-1 with our conjugative plasmid pK18mob, with Cas9 BUT without the sgRNA (no targeting)
Recipient : Dh5alpha, or DS984 (with CmR gene in chromosome) or TOP10 (with a TEM1 gene in chromosome). Each of the recipient strain have our reporter plasmid (with RFP or GFP)
The pre cultured strain were centrifuged, and resuspended in fresh LB, and keeped at 37°C for about one hour the regenerate the pili. Note: for first tests we used PBS to wash antibiotics of precultured strain, but we don’t use it anymore,         to prevent bacteria from stress. Then, 5ul of each strain (donor, recipient and control) were spotted on a LB plate. For conjugation, 5ul of donor strain (and also control strain) were spotted over 5ul of the recipient strain. The plate         was incubated at 37°C between 3 hours and 20 hours. After than, each spot (donor, recipîent, control,"

Procedure
Gel on colony PCR from yesterday.
Setup of BioLector experiment.
MiniPrep selected colonies and make restriction digest analysis.
Results
The gel from colony PCR. From left to right; Sec1, Sec2, Sec3, TAT2 1, TAT2 2, TAT2 3, TAT3 1, TAT3 2, TAT3 3, TAT3 1a, TAT3 2a. Where the different TATs are either with(TAT2) or without insertion of 2 additional amino acids to ease the primer design. 1kb plus ladder( invitrogen )
No results from restriction analysis because we saw no bands on the gel. We assume that this is caused by the low DNA concentration.
Conclusion from today
TAT2 1 and TAT3 1a have the right bands on colony PCR and will be further analyzed.

Transformation of competent cells
If starting with frozen competent cells, warm tube/cells by gently twirling between your fingers until just thawed (i.e., at ~0°C). Then, immediately place on ice for about 5 minutes.
Set up transformation as follows:
Add to 15 mL plastic round bottom tube on ice:
0-9 µL TE (Tris 10mM + EDTA 1mM)
1-10 µL DNA (10-100 ng)
10 µL final volume → /!\ 10% max of the cell competent volume
Add 100 µL of competent cells and mix by gentle repipetting. This method can be scaled down 2- to 4-fold. The maximum volume of DNA should be ~1/10 volume of cells and the maximum mass should be <= 100 ng of DNA for 100 µL of cells.
Incubate cells on ice for 20-30 minutes.
Heat shock the cells exactly 90 seconds at 42°C.

Clearly State the Attributions – All attributions made to our project have been clearly credited in the Credits section .
Improve and/or Characterise an Existing Biobrick Part or Device – The characterisation of the OmpR-regulated promoter BBa_R0082 was improved, as the level of noise was studied on different vectors.
Induction and inhibition of the pBAD promoter, BBa_I0500 , were studied, whereby the characterisation of this part was improved.
Furthermore, we characterized if the periplasmic beta-glucosidase could make E. coli live on cellobiose in fluid medium BBa_K523014 , submitted by the 2011 iGEM Edinburgh Team .  The data obtained in these experiments are presented in the demonstration and results section .
Silver Medal Requirements
Validated Part/Contribution –  We created the part BBa_K2449004 , containing a cellobiose phosphorylase. This enzyme enables Escherichia coli to survive on cellobiose, which we validated by growth experiments. The data obtained in these experiments are presented in the Demonstration & Results section .
Collaboration – We have collaborated with several teams throughout our project by taking part in discussions, meetups, and answering questionnaires - we even hosted our first meetup for our fellow Danish iGEM teams. You will get to read all about this in the Credits section .
Human Practices – Our philosopher, historian, and biologist have discussed the ethical and educational aspects of our project in great detail. In extension to their work, we have been working extensively with education and public engagement .
Gold Medal Requirements
Integrated Human Practices – Regarding the
development and implementation of the device, we reached out to and remained in contact with city planners from our hometown throughout our project. This regarded advice and conversations on anything from the possible design, value, safety, use, placement, and plastic type of our device. We also made sure to integrate the findings of said conversations into our overall project. Last but not least, we focused on demonstrating this process on our wiki in order to inspire future iGEM teams.
Model Your Project –  Through extensive modelling , we have learned that it is possible to regulate bacterial dormancy. However, the modelling showed that it would be inadequate to only regulate the toxin RelE, as this would make the bacteria unable to exit dormancy. To regulate dormancy properly, would also require tight regulation of the antitoxin RelB. This information was used to shape the entire approach of the light-dependent dormancy system.

Lanzhou,2016,Team:Lanzhou#Notes_-_-_TEXT.html," preliminary test by treating fish with different concentrations of mercury (0.1mg/L,0.15mg/L and 0.2 mg/L) in order to determine the best concentration. Finally, the concentration we chose to use in experiment was 0.1mg/L. Cyprinus carpio of size ranging from 7.483–8.348 g weight and 5.75–6.52 cm length, were introduced into fish tanks of 20-L capacity, which contained 6 L tap water. Each tank contained ten fish. We fed fish with fodder containing engineered E. coli and used a commercial fish feed containing crude protein (Min 30%), crude fat (Min 20%), crude fiber (Min 4%), moisture (Max 5%), and algae (Max 25%) as control. We fed fish, changed water (containing 0.1mg Hg2+) and recorded mortality, external signs, and growth conditions of the fish everyday. Also, we extracted the flesh of dead fish in order to detect the mercury.
These work was done by Zhichen Lin, Xinyu Zhou, Jindian He, Ning Chai and Qi Li.
Week 18(Aug10-Aug17)
The experiment on Cyprinus carpio was going on.We dissected dead fish by sterile scissors, got the bacteria from gut and extracted the total DNA using TIANamp Stool DNA kit.
These work were done by Xinyu Zhou, Puxin Wang, Yiding Xu, Ning Chai and Anqi Wei, Zhicheng Lin, Zheyuan Zhang.

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#29 July 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," There were two ways of constructing this circuit: one being cutting out Pqrr4 + B0034 and inserting it into K082003, and another one is K082003 being the insert and Pqrr4 + B0034 being the vector. However, I forgot that K082003 is in a plasmid that has kanamycin resistance, and just went ahead with putting K082003 into the Pqrr4 + B0034 plasmid. This was done by cutting the sequenced Pqrr4 + B0034 with speI and PstI, and cutting K082003 with XbaI and PstI. Apparently though, the BBK CP primers that were made by Thane are only compatible with pSB1A__ vectors, meaning if I had put Pqrr4 + B0034 into K082003 vector, I would not be able to verify it using the current BBK CP primers.
b. Construction The insert, being the K082003, was put away into the -20 freezer, and the vector, being the Pqrr4+B0034, was phosphotased. The two were than ligated together, then transformed into TOP10 cells.
3. Verification of K082003
Because I have to make sure the cells that iGEM provided/sent us contain the right parts, I have ran the restriction digested K082003 on a 1% gel. This part is about 756bp long, and the following is the picture of the gel:
As you can see, there is a band slightly above 700bp region in the cut K082003 lane, meaning the piece of interest is likely to be present in the plasmid. In the Uncut lane, multiple bands are visible, some of them being nicked and supercoiled plasmids, resulting in running at different speeds on the gel.

Second Life: Trouble shooting notecards and scripting
Today, I tried running all of the lab missions and 'general' procedures for the equipment, I noted when things weren't quite working with one another, or if instructions weren't clear enough. I was able to fix a few typos and scripting errors, but we still need to streamline a lot of the activities. That is what I'll be working on tomorrow with Katie. We also introduced Emily and Carol to Second Life, hopefully Emily and Fahd will get a better idea of how to run conferences and hosted events in Second Life after a bit of exploration.

British_Columbia,2011,Team:British Columbia#Notebook#Week 6_-_-_TEXT.html," out different flight options.
Hoping to start the presentation early, the team was assigned homework: everyone needs to watch at least one of the top presentations from last year (ex. Slovenia, Peking, Bristol, TU-Delft, Imperial College London, Cambridge) to gauge the calibre of presentations. Next meeting, we will discuss the pros and cons, and what we like about the presentations, and what we want ours to potentially look like.
Ideas for the wiki template were discussed: Vicki and Gurpal are thinking of having a big tree on the main page with menu buttons on the tree, with a pine beetle being the cursor. Brainstorming will continue.
There was a minor mishap in the lab (don't put glass centrifuge tubes into a particular centrifuge machine!), but the issue was dealt with appropriately, and in the end, everyone was happy!
1,8-Cineole
After 5 SDMs, transformations and minipreps, Jacob should now have ECORI-less, SPEI-less, XBAI-less, PSTI-less pg-tps-cin and pgxe-tps-cin. The gel of the restriction digest has the correct number of bands. Sequencing is the next step to confirm this result.
beta-Pinene
All 3 transformation plates (P2SDM1, P2SDM2, P2SDM3) have colonies! Marianne set up overnight cultures, mini-prepped them and sent them for sequencing. Hopefully the SDM worked and the beta-pinene synthase gene no longer has illegal cut sites.
(-)-Limonene
SDMs have failed thus far. More troubleshooting: use less pfu as the glycerol content in the enzyme could alter the reaction - prepared 3 samples, each with 0.5uL pfu, 1ul pfu, and 2ul pfu, respectively. Also prepare a sample using 0.5 taq polymerase only. Also increased the annealing temperature and elongation time.
Again, gel verification shows no bands. More troubleshooting: use a different cycling condition.
Again, no bands. Something is amiss... Vicki might start pulling out her hairs soon.
IDI1, HMG2 metabolic genes
Yeast colonies were found for HMG2, p330 and Cin, but not IDI1.  The yeast transformed with IDI1 did not grow on a URA- plate.  This may be because the nutrient marker was mutated in the plasmid, but this would not affect PCR to amplify the gene out. "

CosR activates biofilm formation and represses motility
To help maintain osmotic tolerance
Solute molecules stabilize intracellular levels of water/pressure
Salinity a significant factor in affecting growth and distribution of Cholera
Cholera epidemics correlated with increased salinity in riverine and estuarine habitats
Biofilm formation facilitates cholera survival
Salinity affects expression of biofilm genes
CosR represses motility and activates biofilm formation
Uses CosR to adapt to changing salinity environments
Cholera depends on its ability to form biofilms for virulence as a human pathogen
WT and mutant CosR grown in ASW (50% artificial seawater media)
Mutant defective in biofilm growth
Grown for 72 hours
Also grown in LB

Cholera diarrheal disease spread through contaminated water
Exists in water as clumps of cells
Fully virulent in the intestinal milieu
Conditionally viable environmental cells
Biofilm formation dependent on quorum sensing
Controlled by cell density----regulatory
Cholera transmission in vivo-formed biofilms convert to CVEC upon introduction of cholera stools into environmental water
Cholera transit between intestinal infection and hypotonic aquatic environment
Phage predation
Concentration of pathogenic cholera far less than that required to induce infection
Clumps of cells referred to as conditionally viable environmental cells
Can be cultured in the lab using an enrichment technique
Genetic regulators of quorum sensing and biofilm formation affect the development of CVECs
Ileal loops of adult rabbits ideal model
Mutation in hapR resulted in more biofilm-like clumps"
NCTU_Formosa,2014,Team:NCTU Formosa#project_-_-_TEXT.html,"eromone. With the pheromone scent, our device can trap and collect more and more insects of the same species.
Inner Shell：

Fig.5-5-4 Inner shell schematic diagram.
Similar to the outer one, the inner shell is also composed of 4 trapezoid planes and is removable from the base. The only difference  is that its top is not sealed so to allow entry of the captured insects.
1. There would be a container of PBAN solution placed at the bottom.
2. Blue LED light bulbs will be installed around the top of the inner shell plane to attract the first female insect.
Latch：

A part to stabilize the pyramid.
1. Stabilize 4 corners of the bottom.
2. To make sure the outer shell can combine with the inner one tightly.
Advantages
1. We successfully trap the targeted female moth in our device, forcing them to release sex        pheromone by ingesting PBAN, which results in attracting more insects of the same kind.
2. The inner shell is removable so it’s easier to replenish new PBAN solution and the food for the insect.
3. Compared to conventional light bulbs, LED is much brighter and conserves more energy. It could powered by battery so it’s also easier in practical use.
4. The PBAN system can run day and night. Its function won’t be affected by sunlight.
5. Pyramid is a good-looking form and can enrich the entire device with a technological feeling.
