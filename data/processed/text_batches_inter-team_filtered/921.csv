There are two different kind of hepatotoxins: microcystins and nodularin. Both are cyclic peptides that have several shared features. One of these features is that both have the unique amino acid Adda incorporated into their structure; Adda is only found in cyanobacteria. Microcystins are normally found in fresh waters, while nodularin is encountered in brackish waters. As there is more previous research on microcystins, and they are the most common cyanotoxins in freshwater systems, our research has focused on it. (Welgamage, 2012)
Microcystins are cyclic cyanotoxins that consist of seven amino acids. They have the unique β-amino acid Adda, and two of the seven amino acids vary between different variants of microcystin. Due to the variation in these two amino acids, there are at least a hundred different variants of microcystin. The most common variant is microcystin-LR (MC-LR), which has leucine and arginine as the varying amino acids. It is also the most potent of all microcystins. (Welgamage, 2012) The structure of microcystin-LR is presented in the figure 2.
Figure 2. Microcystins can differ by two amino acids, which are marked in the structure of MC-LR with orange. For MC-LR these amino acids are leucine (L) and arginine (R). All microcystins as well as nodularins have the unique β-amino acid Adda ((all-S,all-E)-3-Amino-9-methoxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-10-phenyldeca -4,6-dienoic acid) in their structure.
Out of all cyanotoxins, the ones that have a cyclic peptide structure (such as MC-LR) are the most dangerous to humans. Because of this cyclic structure, they are very stable, to the extent that they do not get degraded in the acidic environment of the stomach upon ingestion. Because of this, they can reach the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, where they inflict their toxic effects. High dosages can even cause death, with the LD 50 value being 5 mg/kg in mice. Exposure to lower dosages may also promote tumor formation. (WHO, 2003)
Different species of cyanobacteria produce different toxins, but there can be some variation"

Introduction
The key focus in this project was put on the characterization of the regulatory elements that our switch comprises of; repressor and anti-repressor from the Gifsy1 and Gifsy2 phages and terminator and anti-terminator from lambda and P22 phages.
As a proof of concept for the regulatory systems several constructs were made in low-copy-number plasmids. By means of the reporter proteins GFP and RFP we were able to investigate our colonies under a microscope and in a fluorometer to see if the expected reporters were expressed and thereby if the BioBricks work as expected. In addition to that, we also ran some measurements in a BioLector which can detect both OD and fluorescence simultaneously and thus also makes it probable that our BioBricks work as expected.
The measurements carried out in the BioLector also form the basis of the characterization of the BioBricks. From the plots derived from the measurements we are able to see the effect of the Gifsy1 and Gifsy2 promoters when the repressor is expressed.
As a means of characterizing the anti-terminator N we developed a Synthetic Promoter Library (SPL) which is an ideal way of fine-tuning gene expression. The SPL comprises of a wide variety of promoters with different promoter strengths and by cloning the SPL in front of the N protein it is possible to determine the right level of expression and thus the right promoter. However, as the idea for the SPL was evolved it became clear that the SPL could indeed be used to characterize and/or fine-tune other BioBricks and thus the idea of making the SPL as a standard was developed.
The experimental work has been divided into three parts. Here you can find results and characterization of:

We decided to have the carrier for: reducing the loss; improving transport efficiency; targeting the carrying to aimed location and preventing bacteria from releasing into the environment to some extent. And why CNC? Trap Termites (termites love woods); High biodegradable and biocompatible; Achieve self-assemble esaily; Easily available and economical.
Finally, a series of simulation experiments have been conducted. These experiments helped us to understand the cellulase, and confirm the terminator are efficient. Based on the result of simulation, we improved a device with the function of monitoring and terminating for better achieving.
GOAL AND BUSINESS PLAN
TERMITE TERMINATOR aims to kill the whole nest of Coptotermes formosanus. Our project will be started from Zhejiang province and finally to China even more countries. Nests are terminated and could save people‘s life and numerous economic and wood resources losses.
The major working area is started in particular environment such as houses and some historical sites. Once area is limited, it become much more easier for us to control and considering safety points. And also, could cut down costs.
In the following ten years, if possible, it could acheive mass production of TERMITE TERMINATOR and could be widely used with our designed devices. Factory is the base and during improvements as well as experiments, social users data is collected for further promotion and perfection.
CONTEXT AND APPLICATION
Forest protection agency
Economic forest plays an important role in human's world. It provides people with raw materials of construction, food, medicine and industry. Thus, there is a group of people working in the forest protection agency to take care of these trees. But what make them stressfol is that the forest regions are always inhabited by termites. Trees that destroyed by termites will lost their economic value. What's more, termites have tenacious vitality and will soon spread through the forest. They are always one of the toughest problem for those forest keepers.
In order to get rid of termites in the whole economic forest region, the forest protection agency contact ZJUTT. Technical staff will go to the forest for field trips to evaluate the severity. With the map and other information that the agency provided, ZJUTT will draw up a plan with the optimum locations for killing devices placement. Tree keepers together with company technicians will bring the device to the place. Calcolated amount of food have been beforehand put into the device. After a period of time technicians will come again to check if one more dose or a new plan is"
Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"GAC & PAC).  On the one hand, the by-products produced after the redox reaction catalyzed by ozone (O3) have unknown ecotoxic effects. Coupled with slack control of removal rates due to the variability of wastewater content, skepticism is raised regarding Ozonation’s suitability. Commenting on Ozonation, Christian Baresel voiced: “Ozonation of untreated wastewater leads to the ozone targeting other carbon sources than the ones you want (i.e. pharmaceuticals), which leads to high ozone levels needed, which is not economical. Ozonation large scale system like the size of Linköping (serving approximately 100,000 people) is 0.1 SEK/m3 which is relatively affordable. However, you need polishing after Ozonation, and that pushes the cost quite higher’’ (Personal Communication C Baresel 20 Jun 2018).
On the other hand, despite sufficient efficiency of Activated Carbon on removing pharmaceuticals from wastewater, financial concerns associated with its usage keeps its implementation limited. Regarding Activated Carbon Christian claims that: “Activated Carbon is a better solution than Ozonation because combined with biological filters (MBR) tenfold increase can be achieved in the lifetime of activated carbon granules. However, you need to have really clean water in order to use it. Otherwise clogging becomes an issue” (Personal Communication C Baresel 20 Jun 2018). Even in this case, the increase of activated carbon granules’ lifetime cannot offset MBR’s installation and operational costs.
In our quest to better understand the profile of the existing solutions we visited Kungsängsverket WWTP, located in Uppsala. There, we learned that investigator engineers, Elin Kusoffsky and Jesper Olsson, concluded, after conducting a thorough assessment, that either Ozonation, Activated Carbon or a combination of both could be the chosen solution for treating wastewater from pharmaceuticals in their WWTP. Specifically, the designated investigators estimated for Uppsala WWTP that 15gr of O3 per m3 of wastewater and approximately 20 minutes retention time will be needed for sufficient removal of pharmaceuticals, resulting in acceptable costs for Kungsängsverket WWTP standards. Although it was clearly admitted that the energy consumption will be increased from 0.05 to 0.1 kWh/m3 (between 10 and 30 % more of the existing value without advanced treatment) the investigators still considered Ozonation as a satisfactory solution. Additionally, Jesper Olsson’s statement “With PAC, the pharmaceuticals are not eliminated, they end up in"

Overview and Introduction
Microfluidics is a scientific field that exists at the intersection of the fields of engineering, physics, chemistry and biotechnology. It deals with the manipulation of microlitre volumes of liquids which are processed on devices called microfluidic chips. As a result, microfluidics allows complex protocols and procedures to be performed on chips.
There are a variety of different types of microfluidic chips in existence. For example, digital, paper and centrifugal microfluidic chips are all in use today. MARS focuses on continuous flow microfluidics fabricated from polycarbonate and PDMS.
Problem Statement
If a synthetic biologist would like to use microfluidics in their lab, they would follow the traditional design and manufacture workflow. This consists of three general stages divided into:
Design
Manufacture
Implementation
Designing, manufacturing and using a microfluidic device  requires significant knowledge investment in topics such as the basics of fluid dynamics and specialised software such Adobe Illustrator. If a synthetic biologist does not want to design their own chip, they can search through published literature. However, these devices are often highly specialized and not useful for the average synbio researcher. After either designing their own chip, or selecting a published microfluidic, they would begin the time consuming process of designing and modeling their chip  using Comsol. Once the design is finalized, they can move on to the manufacturing stage of the workflow. Most microfluidic fabrications methods, such as soft lithography, require a high initial startup cost, technical agility, time investment and more educational investment to learn how to correctly manufacture the chips.
After manufacturing their device the synthetic biologist can then move onto implementation and testing. However, there are many difficulties that may arise when testing a device. For example, certain chips may require some external apparatus, such as off-chip metering or electronic components. These can vary from design to design, adding additional costs and time investment in learn how to use them.
Even after investing time and money into this microfluidics workflow, success is not guaranteed. The process may need to be repeated dozens of times to get a fully functional microfluidic chip.
These difficulties with replicating and"

Peshawar team in iGem 2016 attempted to detect the level of CO and NO2 using a single reporter system. We improved upon the project with an unique circuit that can be used for different pollutants whose promoters are known. Apart from detection we also intend to capture the pollutants and use them by co-culture with a suitable microbial system.
Pollutants in the biosphere pose a major threat to most organisms. Our project seeks their containment through detection and capture. Current technologies like PTR-MS aren’t cost effective and have limited deployment. Luckily, our practical alternative (gECO) bypasses these limitations, by harnessing the power of millions of years of evolution, coupled with a few months of ingenious genetic engineering (different cassette for different substrates).
Inspired by control systems engineering, gECO utilizes positive feedback loops to increase sensitivity and negative feedback loops to ensure stability, thereby ensuring the detection and capture of various toxic substances. The co-culturing of these engineered E.coli with naturally existing microbes (that can utilize these noxious substances) ensures their consumption. The hardware integration is deceptively simple: paper strips with LB and glycerol (in a particular ratio) house the engineered E.coli. On contact water, the cells activate expressing chromoproteins in proportional measure to the external pollutant concentration. Overall, the setup is lightweight, aesthetic, cost effective, ensures detection, capture and consumption of various toxic substances.

Our primary goal is to optimize the production of pABA by identifying and isolating genes relevant for pABA synthesis and transforming them in Escherichia coli (E. coli).
Experimental Design
Source: http://www-abell.ch.cam.ac.uk/research/Shikimate.html
Our p-aramid production is focused on the manipulation of E. coli’s native Shikimate metabolic pathway to maximize the synthesis of our monomer p-aminobenzoic acid. In this pathway, pABA is an intermediate for folate synthesis [2].
First, we wanted to enhance the activity of the first enzyme of the Shikimate pathway. This enzyme is 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase. By introducing more copies of the gene and overexpressing this enzyme in cells, an increased amount of carbon will be funneled into the pathway. The pathway then proceeds and produces (after several intermediate products) chorismate, which is partially funneled to produce pABA. Blitzen blue plasmid was used to transform DAHP synthase into E. coli.
Second, our introduction of genes PabA, PabB and PabC facilitates the production of enzymes that are responsible for the conversion of chorismate to pABA. Chorismate is transformed into para-aminobenzoic acid through chemical reactions involving the enzymes 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate (ADC) synthase and 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate (ADC) lyase, with the former encoded by PabA, and the latter encoded by PabB and PabC. Our approach was to introduce extra copies of genes PabA, PabB, and PabC into our cells. PabA and PabB together produce ADC synthase, which is responsible for the conversion of chorismate to 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate. Expression of PabC results in ADC lyase, the enzyme that would convert 4-amino-4deoxychorismate to pyruvate and our desired product, pABA.
Since pABA is an intermediate in the folic acid pathway, pABA will be consumed in the pathway’s downstream chemical reactions"

As a senior iGEM team, Peking University has provided many reliable and effective suggestions for                         our projects. After the introduction of the team project, we started brainstorming on the                         project together, the most prominent of which is the proposal for high-throughput application of                         the test method of the project, and the proposal of team cooperation.
Through this interflow, we have enriched our ideas on this project, and we are also moved by the                         enthusiasm of Peking University students. This is our first collaboration, which provides a lot                         of different ideas for our project.
Northeastern University
Time: 27 Aug, 2018
Location: The Meeting Room of Northeastern University Life Science Building
Participant: Four iGEM teams from Northeastern University and Dalian University of Technology
Content:
The meeting began with the introduction of their project by the iGEM-A team of Northeastern                         University. Team A's research project is engineering probiotics, and they expect to study                         methods to alleviate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and prevent colorectal cancer (CRC) that                         may be triggered. The next is the Northeastern University iGEM-B team. Team B students turned                         their attention to wine and its excess lactic acid.
After the students of Northeastern University showed up, the students of DLUT-A team brought                         their team's research on gout disease. High levels of uric acid in human blood may cause acute                         gouty arthritis, etc., and existing methods for treating high levels of uric acid have many side                         effects. The students of the DLUT-A team plan to oxidize uric acid to 5-hydroxyisouric acid by                         engineering bacteria to express a uric acid oxidase. The compound is decomposed and quickly                         decomposed into allantoin which is easily metabolized, thereby reducing uric acid.
Finally, the DLUT-B team brought a portable introduction to the detection of β2-microglobulin. By                         immobilizing the Nanobody on the slide, a change in the alignment of the liquid crystal causes a                         change in the brightness of the image to detect an excessive excess of β2-micro in the urine. As                         a possible marker of chronic kidney disease, β2-micro is an effective and portable method for                         early detection of chronic kidney disease in patients with diabetes and hypertension"

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#History_-_-_TEXT.html," the Baltic Sea ecosystem is particularly susceptible to hazardous pharmaceutical substances [14].
One of the main substances that contributes to pharmaceutical pollution and its implications in the Baltic Sea ecosystem is the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX). SMX has been detected to be one of the most prevalent Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) not only in WWTPs’ effluent streams but in rivers located in the Baltic Sea region too, as presented in Figure 2 [14].
Figure 2. The top 20 pharmaceuticals measured in highest concentrations in river water samples in the Baltic Sea region [14].
It has been found that SMX may alter the catabolic function of bacteria comprising marine biofilms by altering their carbon source utilization (15). Changes on the transcriptional profile of genes associated to cell envelope and outer membrane were observed, as well as changes of genes involved in replication when freshwater biofilms were exposed to SMX concentrations as low as 1.94 nmol/L (16).
SMX has even been detected in flounders (Platichus flesus) inhabiting the Baltic Sea in concentrations exceeding 50 μg/kg, meaning that SMX can even move up in the food chain (14).
Additionally, SMX contributes to the rising problem of antibiotic resistance when it is released in the aquatic environment. It has been shown that resistance to SMX alone is one of the most common single antibiotic resistances and remarkably, is associated with the main cross-resistant profiles. Consequently, it becomes apparent that SMX except for its ecotoxicological effects also drives antibiotic resistance by its presence in aquatic environments (17).
Given that the removal rates of SMX in WWTPs are inadequate to substantially prevent or limit its release in the aquatic environment of the Baltic Sea, SMX’s occurrence in the region will continue to persist. In support to this conclusion comes the fact that the biggest WWTP in Sweden, Henriksdal, located in Stockholm, removes 48% to 73% of SMX existing in the influent (18). As Sofia Andersson, a process development engineer in Henriksdal WWTP stated when we visited the facilities in Stockholm: “Pharmaceuticals, in general, are not degraded in a WWTP, they go either to the effluent water or the sludge’’ (Study visit S Andersson 10 Jul 2018). A statement aligned with the monitoring data on the removal rates of SMX.
Altogether, for these reasons, we believe that SMX occurrence in an aquatic environment is one of the key drivers of pharmaceutical pollution in the Baltic Sea. It poses an"

Glasgow,2017,Team:Glasgow#testpage_-_-_TEXT.html," RNA degradation [4] . To make a 70ml 1.2% agarose gel, we added 1.4ml of additive-free 1.5% hypochlorite bleach to the melted agarose. We loaded 2μl of each RNA sample, 3.3μl of NEB 6x purple loading dye and 14.7μl RNAse free water. In total this equated to a 20μl loading solution. An Invitrogen 1kb+ DNA ladder was loaded in the first wells as a reference. Electrophoresis was performed at 70V for 40 minutes. The gel was then post-stained with Ethidium bromide and imaged on a Bio-rad Gel Doc (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Checking for RNA quality using a Bleach gel. Top five are control samples and bottom five are casein exposed samples. 1-5, left to right.
The gel picture shows a well-defined RNA profile for all 10 samples (tRNAs at the very bottom, 16s and 23s rRNAs at correct ratios, no genomic DNA stuck at the top of the wells), with no visible degradation.
We then quantified each sample to ensure we were sending adequate concentrations of RNA (Table 2). The 10 RNA samples were quantified at A260 in a spectrophotometer. Samples were diluted 1/50 (8μl into 392μl RNase free water, for 400μl quartz cuvette).
Table 2: RNA quantification data
Satisfactory replicates were sent to Glasgow Polyomics for processing.
Results and Discussion
Bioinformatic analysis of our results revealed that we had uncovered 24 differentially expressed genes, 11 of which were upregulated in the presence of casein (Table 3). In terms of gene function, we expected to see links to protein degradation. Based on the upregulated genes observed, we suspect that we may have missed the window for isolating these transcripts, as the upregulation here seems to be related to amino acid transportation rather than the degradation of proteins.
Upon analysis of the differentially expressed transcripts, we observed that the most upregulated variant had a 0.419 log2 fold change i.e. just under 1.5x the expression relative to the control (Figure 2). We concluded that the lack of distinct disparity in expression deems this set of genes unsuitable with regards to our SIM device. To switch the SIM device on, we would need to find a promoter common"
BostonU_HW,2017,Team:BostonU HW#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"The efficiency of the mixing itself can be measured using the following equation[2]:
\[\gamma = 1-2\left [ \frac{\int RGB-RGB_{avg}dL}{\int dL} \right ]\]
Once this value is obtained the channel primitive can be measured to see if it is suitable to perform the needed function.
Valve Actuation
Even though it can be easily observed that a fluid is not traveling over a valve, it is not easy to determine whether the PDMS is being properly actuated by the primitive. In order to evaluate each valve’s functionality a valve actuation test can be performed.
This quantitative test involves modeling the deflection of the PDMS as a beam using Euler–Bernoulli beam theory, and modeling the valves as a simply supported beam at both ends with a uniformly distributed load.  This is an acceptable approximation since the valve geometry is axisymmetric. The maximum deflection of the beam would be equivalent to the PDMS deflecting into the circle valve. In this equation E is equal to the value of the modulus of elasticity for PDMS, and I is equal to the moment of inertia.
\[\Delta Z = \left ( \frac{5}{358} \frac{Fl^{3}}{EI}\right )\]
We would substitute the value of length in the max deflection equation with the diameter value of the valve. We can than calculate the force needed in order to fully actuate the PDMS into the circle valve.
\[F = \left (\frac{358\Delta Z E I }{5D^{2}}\right )\]
The next step is to convert that value of force into a value of pressure. Can use the formula:
\[P = F \times A\]
Lastly, since we know the volume within the chip and tubing the syringe is connected to we can use Boyle's law to calculate for the amount of volume we would need to pull the syringe back to actuate the valve.
\[P_{1}V_{1} = P_{2}V_{2}\]
Metering Accuracy
The metering primitive was developed to dispense relatively accurate volumes of liquid. However, for biological experiments a certain level of accuracy is required when it comes to volumes used. In order to ensure this primitive is dispensing relatively accurate volumes of liquid, a metering accuracy test must be performed. This quantitative test is broken down into a two part process:
Image Processing
After running the metering portion of your chip, pictures need to be taken before and after the oil has dispensed all the"

Biosafety in Dry Lab
Q1: What about the biosafety level of Parts recommended by S-Din?
A: There are two major parts in iGEM, First is to choose a safe enough Chassis to redesign the circuits. Second, we need a safe enough Parts as material to make a Gene blueprint that benefits human beings. Therefore, this year, iGEM safety community announced 2017 White List.
Q1.1: The sources of Parts and its Safty Level in the database of S-Din?
A: The source information is stored in our database including the original chassis and the adapted chassis. The database has been screened manually at the mid-late stage of development (Check Human Practice/ Project Assessment). Here are the results.
Figure 1: Risk group distribution of parts from S-Din's database.
Figure 1 shows the Chassis information and corresponding risk group in S-Din Database. It’s clear that all Parts with source information of Chassis belong to Risk Group 1& 2 which are granted to use in iGEM project. While the prohibited Risk Group 3& 4 won’t be displayed in S-Din. ( iGEM Safety 2017 Risk Group )
Unfortunately, there are still many Parts without Chassis information due to the incompletion of Registry which will likely cause potential biosafety danger when our users designing new circuits. But we’re also lucky to find DSMZ Database to track down the original chassis of every part, none of them are tagged with Dangerous.
Wrap up: Every Part whose source information is known come from Risk Group 1&2 that are relatively safe.
Q1.2: Are those Parts stored in the"

RBS Strength to Translation Rate
Altering the RBS strength of the ribosome binding site in a plasmid, can be completed by altering the genetic makeup of the RBS. This was modeled through the utilization of the RBS Calculator created by Dr. Howard Salis, at Penn State University. Using the forward implementation of the calculator, one input's their protein coding sequence, organism, and target translation initiation rate. The calculator then outputs the RBS sequence required to achieve such a translation initiation rate under the conditions outlined.

Screening the Initial Diversity
The core of our system is the combination of an initial library with in vivo mutation and selection, to optimize Evobodies by directed evolution. To get in this evolutional process, some binding proteins must show at least a marginal affinity to the chosen target protein. Low affinity binders get mutated and selected in vivo during  culture growth under an increasing selective pressure.  To make sure the designed binding proteins can attach to several target proteins and the Monobody and Nanobody libraries can deliver initial Evobodies, which can be optimized by mutation and selection, we performed a phagemid display , using phagemid pAK100 and M13 derived helper phages.
After assembling the pAK100 backbone with the CDS of our designed binding proteins via Gibson cloning, the phagemid was transformed into electrocompetent E. coli ER2738 and plated on LB agar, containing chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Thus, we generated a comparative small library of about 3000 clones for each, Monobody and Nanobody coding phagemids, as a test library for the use in the phagemid display.

SDS PAGE GEL BOX SETUP
Lock gel in place on one side and dummy slide on other side of gel box
IMPORTANT: Load gel with short side first!! Loading tall side first could damage the gel and causes the gel box to not run properly
Remove comb carefully so as to not puncture/deform the wells
Overflow inner chamber with 1x SDS Buffer
Fill outer chamber with 1x SDS Buffer until the bottom of the inner box is slightly submerged
PROTEIN PURIFICATION FOR SDS PAGE GEL
Put 40uL of each sample in eppendorf tubes
Place on dry heat bath for ~5 minutes so cells release proteins
Centrifuge for 1 minute at ~10K RPM
You should find pellets in all of your samples at this point
Use a pipette set at slightly over 40uL to pipette out the supernatant (avoid touching the pellet)
Add about 8uL of 5x SDS buffer dye to each sample. (approx ⅕ of sample that was centrifuged)
SDS PAGE GEL RUN
Clean out each well of the gel with 1x SDS buffer with a pipette set to 18 uL (use well-compatible tips)
Load 7 uL of ladder into second well
Load 18 uL of samples 1-3 into wells 2-4, respectively

Toronto,2017,Team:Toronto#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," this protocol makes ~25 plates.
Once you take the plates out, store them upside down on your lab bench. Label the plates with [your name]–iGEM 2017–[date]–[media number]–[antibiotic stripe]. Once labelled, you may stack the plates to free up workspace.
One stripe along the sides corresponds to CAM, two stripes corresponds to AMP
Allow the LB media to cool before pouring. The LB will start to settle at ~30°C.
If you are preparing selective media, add antibiotic to the mixture. Swirl the flask in a circular motion to mix. If you don’t know whether or not you are preparing selective media, ASK.
Use concentrated liquid stocks for the antibiotics.
Recommenced antibiotic concentrations:
Chloramphenicol (CAM): 25μg/mL
Ampicillin (AMP): 100μg/mL
Take an empty plate and open it slightly. You do not need to open it all the way to pour the agar.
Pour agar until 2/3 of the plate has been covered, or approximately half of the plate has been filled when viewed from the side. Pour the agar slowly to prevent the formation of bubbles. Swirl the plate in a circular motion to distribute the media evenly on the plate.
If you pour too much LB, you will not be able to produce 25 plates. If you don’t pour enough media, it may minimize bacterial growth.
After pouring, set the plates to cool in stacks of 4-5 to save space and flip the plates to prevent condensation forming on the agar. Don’t stack plates too high - we want to minimize the risk of spills. Allow the plates to cool for at least 20 minutes until the agar has solidified.
Rinse the Pyrex bottle with water before the remnants solidify and become hard to remove.
The plates can then be stacked and stored in plastic bags (ideally, re-use the plastic bags that the plates came in.)
Store LB agar plates in a 4°C freezer. They should be good for 1-2 months.
Leaving the lab
Prior to leaving the lab, you should:
Clean dirty glassware, or at least set aside the glassware to be cleaned by a designated individual.
Wipe down your workspace.
Ensure that all materials have been returned to their places, and that the plates have been properly stored in the fridge.

The Problem
Introduction
That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind – Neil Armstrong
15 July 1965, a memorable day for every human interested in our deep space. After six unsuccessful attempts, NASA's Mariner 4 finally managed to send back 21 pictures of the Martian surface: The first pictures ever taken from another planet from space. Our interest in this red planet never diminished and now, after 46 unmanned missions, serious plans are being made to finally travel to this inhabited planet. 27 September: SpaceX announced their plans to send humans to Mars by 2024 and start the colonization of this planet. But the question might rise: Which hurdles do we have to overcome in order to survive and make the colonization of Mars a success? Synthetic biology and space colonization share a common feature; both seem like science fiction, but are actually happening right under our noses and will be the topic of our future. So why not combine these fields and make a contribution to Mars colonization? The subject we are working on will be one of the bigger problems for building a self-sufficient colony on the planet. We aim to get rid the toxic compound perchlorate. Martian soil contains a fair amount of up to 0.5-1% of this compound, which is 10.000 times more concentrated(?) compared to concentrations found on earth. Because of these high concentrations, cultivation of edible crops would be impossible.  Also, there is an increased interest in perchlorate contamination of drinking water on earth toxicity. 7
Perchlorate
Perchlorate is a chemical anion, which consists of one chlorine atom and four oxygen atoms arranged in tetrahedral geometry (ClO4-) . 8 The salts, such as ammonium perchlorate (NH4ClO4) and sodium perchlorate (NaClO4), are extremely soluble in water and dissociate in their partner cation and the perchlorate anion relatively quick. Due to the high activation energy associated with the reduction of perchlorate, the anion is very persistent in the environment. This causes the accumulation of the toxin in surface- and groundwater. The main source of perchlorate found in drinking water is primarily associated with releases of ammonium perchlorate by military operations and aerospace programs. It can be biologically degraded by a number of bacteria possessing perchlorate reductases, enzymes that facilitate the reduction of perchlorate. Unfortunately, many of these organisms prefer oxygen and require specific growth conditions to be able"

By sad, frustrating experience, we’ve surmised that there is a problem with the patches of TT9901 and TT9907 to which we keep returning for experiments.  We received these strains from the John Roth lab at UC Davis as three small glass stabs.  Whenever we plate them on LB directly from the stabs, we always get spotty growth.  We believe that we’ve been ignorantly selecting for host cells that are not susceptible to bacteriophage lambda.  To correct this, we’ve selected 32 colonies from 3 patches: 15 colonies from one patch of TT9901, 15 colonies from one patch of 9907, and 2 colonies from our control strain that lacks the lambda lysogen, TT25281.  We’ve started these as overnights.  Tomorrow, we’ll freeze down one mL of each strain, and with the remaining culture, we’ll make top agar lawns using X1 top agar.  In the middle of these lawns we’ll add a drop of hydrogen peroxide, which is known to stress cells enough to cause lambda to convert its lytic cycle.  Any lawns that show plaques relative to a non-H202 control top agar lawn will be strains that we know have lambda and can become induced to lysis.

It’s a good thing we chose to run this experiment with 15 colonies from each strain, because very few showed plaques.  Specifically, the 9th, 10th, and 20th strains had plaques"

After a period of time technicians will come again to check if one more dose or a new plan is needed. Finally, the termites disappear from the region. Devices will be taken back to the company for sterilization and reuse.
Ancient building protection department
Many ancient buildings are made up of woods. To some extent, woods are fragile. They can be destroy by fire, strong wind and importantly, termites. These ancient buildings are significant coltural property and if we lose them, we may lose them forever. Fortunately, thanks to today's technology, some wood structures are able to be repaired and consolidated. But if the damage is due to termites, repairing will be only a temporary protection.
The ZJUTT (ZJU TERMITE TERMINATOR) sees this problem and therefore cooperates with the ancient building protection department. When repairing is needed, ZJUTT technicians will show up first, rather than the maintenance worker. If the termites are convicted by the technicians, termites control shoold be applied first to eliminate the future danger. Devices are placed in optimum places and taken back by our technicians.
In order to keep these buildings in safety, ZJUTT will provide the monitoring service. Every few years, special devices will be placed near the building. These devices are used to attract termites to check if there is any new hidden termites nest. With the monitor, precaution can be taken and use ZJUTT devices kill termites before they cause any damage.
School
Under the dazzling sunshine of summer, students are sweating, reading their textbooks. There is a little annoyance upon their faces, because the final exam is coming. However, that is not the only problem. What's more annoying is that, the termites are also coming! Every summer, the termites are flying all around. They are hovering around your head. They stop at everywhere, your arms, your clothes, your desk and your textbooks. Termites are really bothering students' school life.
The school principal decides to help his students. He advise the school stuff to buy a few small size termites killing devices from ZJUTT. Following the instruction, they open the outer shell, put the box of food inside, spread some water on the surface of the food, and place the device in a corner where is dark, damp and termites can be seen. Outside the shell there is a warning sign to prevent students' contact. When 3 months pass and there are nearly no termites, take out the food box form the device and burn the rest food if"

, we found that the bacteria would re-enter stationary phase after 2.5 hours; for time-points after 3 hours, the number of number of sarA genes producing fluorescence could be assumed as constant. For this reason, we excluded time-points prior to 3 hours. We then converted from fluorescence units to number of fluorescent molecules using the quantization measurements provided by Wu & Pollard
and, using our assumption of a fixed number of active sarA genes, considered the relative change in number of molecules to be representative of the per-promoter rate.
We were interested, however, in the changes of concentration rather than the changes in the raw number of molecules. As the name suggests, Staphylococcus aureus are spherical in shape. Assuming that all S. aureus are spheres, the volume of the cell can be determined. The diameter of a USA300 S. aureus cell was previously measured as 1.1 μ•m
resulting in the overall cell volume to be calculated as 5.575•10-15 L. The number of molecules were thus converted to units of molar concentration in the cell, specifically nanomoles per litre (nM). The exponential fit used to find the rate constant is shown beside the figure from Cheung et al. above.
This resulted in a exponential model a•ebt with a b rate constant of 0.0011 nM/min.
Initial Model Results
Using these estimated parameters, we simulated our differential model of the CRISPR system. It was immediately clear that these parameters, scraped from assorted publications, did not provide an accurate system model once combined. Below are two simulations of the system dynamics using the parameters found in the literature. On the left the system is shown with CRISPR repression active and on the right is a simulation where:
or rather, the system simulated without any repression of YFP Transcription by CRISPR. Both plots use 6 as the expected final fold reduction.
The difference between the two plots is negligible. This unrealistic behavior emerges directly from the parameter values. The mRNA degradation dynamics prevent sgRNA from reaching any significant concentration, so there is never enough dCas9-sgRNA complex to influence YFP expression. However, in both plots the YFP mRNA levels plummet from the high initial concentration because the degradation rate is so much higher than the production rate.
These plots do not fit with the observations of CRISPR interference systems reported in the literature
. To ensure that our parameters were at fault, rather than the fact that we were"

Using Bacteria:
Escherichia coli
First, we decided to produce Curdlan with Escherichia coli , because Agrobacterium tumefasciens because both of them are Gram negative bacteria and have a lot of membrane similarity. Moreover Escherichia coli is a simple bacteria that can be grown and cultured easily and inexpensively in a laboratory unlike Agrobacterium . Indeed, Curdlan production in Agrobacterium requires Nitrogen Starvation and its growth parameters need to be relatively precise. This is not the case with E. coli in our project.
Since E. coli naturally produces UDP Glucose (metabolite number 3 on Figure 5), adding the (1→3)-β-glucan synthase would theoretically allow Curdlan production. We therefore inserted the three genes which code for the β-glucan synthase and metabolic transporters in Agrobacterium (crdASC) into E. coli . However, since our gene sequences for crdA, crdS, and crdC originally come from Agrobacterium we decided to optimize our gene codons for E. coli with IDT codon optimization tool in order to make sure that our gene would correctly be expressed. Furthermore, we decided to place the genes under an easier control than N-starvation by using a promoter which is activated in stationary phase. (osmY, BBa_J45992 characterized by MIT in 2006). This should theoretically allow maximum production in simple conditions.
All three genes were synthesized by IDT separately with the correct ends to allow integration in the iGEM plasmids and an easy creation of our biobricks. We planned on amplifying our fragments by PCR and creating different biobricks with different assemblies of our genes and plasmids in order to find the effect of each gene on Curdlan production and to verify the efficiency of our promoter.
In order to have control over the different culture perameters we also decided to use M63 culture medium. This is the medium which is used for Curdlan production in Agrobacterium and is also interesting since it is a minimal medium which allows us to easily vary parameters and optimize production. Furthermore, since Curdlan is a glucose derivative, being able to control the amount of sugar in the medium is interesting for production optimization. We plan on testing the effect of the following parameters on Curdlan production:

P.fluorescens pf-5
is not pathogenic to mammals and has passed the acute toxicity test of the Ministry of Agriculture of China [6] . It can be released commercially or directly into the field. Moreover, it is a plant-promoting bacterium [7 ] that combines with green plants to further enhance its bioremediation ability.
Finally,
P.fluorescens pf-5
is a model strain with a clear genetic background for genetic modification.
Promoter library
When compared to platform organisms such as Escherichia coli, the toolkit for engineering
P.fluorescens
is under developed. Heterologous gene expression in particularis problematic.It is vital that a flexible set of molecular genetic tools be available. In other organisms, tuning protein expression can be very important for achieving increased yields from engineered pathways, but there are no well-characterized promoter libraries in
P.fluorescens
to enable rational tuning of protein expression[8 ].
To improve the
P.fluorescens pf-5
toolkit, we organised a library of native promoters (n=25). We used Luciferase Reporter Assay Kit to characterize the strength of each promoter. Promoter strength prediction in
P.fluorescens pf-5
was then achieved by mathematical modeling.
In our model，encode each three-base sequence with quaternary number(A,T,C,G represents quaternary number 0,1,2,3 ),and then get a vector with 64 dimensions from AAA to GGG, which calculates the frequency of appearance for each type in DNA sequence [9].We preliminarily assume that there is a simple linear relationship between the 64 components of this vector and the final result, and preliminarily confirm our hypothesis by comparing the difference between calculated value and measured value by solving sparse equations.Subsequently, we further strengthened our model by using the neural network model with stronger stability and more relevant parameters, and obtained an algorithm to predict the promoter strength.
Nicotine degradation engineered bacteria
In addition to the formation of the promoter library, we also constructed a nicotine-degrading engineered bacteria using
P.fluorescens pf-5
as the chassis.

We made our stall interactive and spoke about our project whilst encouraging discussion, and performing a luciferase demonstration as a tool. We held three open day stalls, one alongside Warwick Univeristy and Sheffield University to promoted our project.
Science Cafe Talk-Synbio, STI self testing, and a pint
An interactive talk at the Cardiff Science Cafe by Asal and Rob proved a popular night of pop culture references, two-way questioning, prizes, and surveying attendants on home testing kits before revealing our investigation results. We promoted our project, and asked the audience to complete our survey, followed by questions and a discussion. Asal and Rob engaged in a discussion with the audience about our investigation into self testing kits for STIs, making others aware of the negative aspects as well as the positive when discussing our investigation results. We finished off by promoting glowworm conservation.

We had several articles published about our team and project in our award winning student newspaper, Gair Rhydd, to gather interest. Our team, project, and human practices efforts were featured in XMUChina's newsletter, which was circulated among iGEM teams, and on their social media, for wider public consumption. We were active on Twitter, on which we were followed by and retweeted by various organisations e.g. MHRA, BioSure, many iGEM teams, SynbiCite etc."

Engagement
Based on the definition of public engagement, which the myriad of ways in which the activity and benefits of higher education and research can be shared with the public, this year we team iGEM Tianjin conducted the mission of scattering the concepts of PET bio-degradation, synthetic biology and iGEM competition to ordinary people mainly in two aspects---Education and Public Engagement.
Education
Primary School
On the afternoon of September 23, 2016, we went to Baitangkou primary school to make a presentation, aiming to let more pupils learn about the conception of synthetic biology and arouse the consciousness of fighting against the plastic pollution and protecting our earth. During the class, these primary students were filled with enthusiasm and eager to answer the questions we asked, which revealed their interests in synthesis biology. The meaningful class ended up with intense debate of how to deal with white pollution. We gave out our team emblem stickers and some other gifts to them.
iGEM
Middle School
On Sep.18th, we departed for Dagang No.1 Middle School. We gave a lecture to students about iGEM and synthetic biology. They asked questions with great enthusiasm and felt curious about the knowledge out of books. Although the speech was over till 5:30 p.m., some students were still asking about synthetic biology.They thought that knowledge they studied at school was traditional and out of date, iGEM could make them get in touch with the cutting-edge knowledge of synthetic biology. We are very delighted to bring students some new knowledge and meanwhile we invited them to visit our laboratory and conduct some experiments.
Tianjin
University
On September 27th, five members of our team went to Tianjin University of Science and Technology (TUST) and gave a speech on what is synthetic biology and how to set up a iGEM team. TUST is a key university in Tianjin, which is famous for its excellent fermentation engineering and food engineering subject. Almost all the seats were occupied by audience.Since the term of iGEM competition is almost a band new term for"

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!
Best Basic Part Special Prize
To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.
Please note: Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize."

We kept the liquid cultures from yesterday at room temperature and added EDTA to keep them overnight. Today we re spun them down to get a pellet and then we pipetted 21 ul (because EDTA was already added) into each PCR tube and ran temperature tests starting at 55 °C to 95 °C in 5 °C increments for 30 minutes on each temperature. We also re ran the tubes from yesterday to see if anything interesting would happen with their color and if they would regain any of it. We don't expect them to because they went to 95 °C yesterday and lost their color which we think means they were denatured. Pictures of the experiment are shown below:
Before heat new run of 12 chromoproteins
This picture is taken before any heat is added. The 7 tubes in the top row and 5 tubes in the bottom row are the 12 chromoproteins we are running from the culture from yesterday. The top row is the chromoproteins that expressed color from culture and in order from left to right are: BB, DT, VP, PP, CP, SO, LO. The bottom row are the 5 chromoproteins that did not express color from culture and in order from left to right they are: VV, MP, SP, TP, DM.
Before heat all chromoproteins
This picture shows each set of 12 chromoproteins. The top two rows are the ones we are running today to see if they have a color change similar to the ones we ran yesterday. The bottom two rows are the ones we ran yesterday and we are seeing if they change colors at all (we do not expect them too because we believe they were denatured at the high temperature we ran them at yesterday). The top row in each set are the chromoproteins that showed color from culture and are in the following order from left to right: BB, DT, VP, PP, CP, SO, LO. The bottom row in each set are the 5 chromoproteins that did not express color from culture and in order from left to right they are: VV, MP, SP, TP, DM.

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,". More precisely, biofilms can cause infections in the human body, affect water quality, and damage industrial installations and equipment. Research and industry have been working to find various solutions for preventing and removing this threat. Potential solutions, such as health products, drugs and industrial removal products, are tested on artificially formed biofilms.
Figure 1. Fields and industries affected by detrimental biofilms (4Inno.com)
The problem with biofilms formed artificially is that they are time consuming, difficult to control and to reproduce. This means that artificial biofilms do not reflect natural biofilm characteristics, making product testing unreliable. Therefore, biofilm-removal products may have a different effect when used in natural settings, with unforeseen negative side-effects and reduced efficiency.
Figure 2. Design of the prototype of our DIY 3D printer
Our project is entitled Biolink and provides an alternative to current biofilm formation technologies. We use a 3D printer, which we call The Biolinker, to form layers of a designed bioink made of bacteria that can bind together into a desired structure.
Biolink helps biofilm-related industries in several ways. First, it brings reproducibility and control to how bacterial biofilms can be artificially formed. Second, biofilm printing adds automation and scalability, making biofilm formation processes more efficient, and thus, cheaper. Hence, Biolink can help to design safer and more effective anti-biofilm solutions by increasing biofilm testing process efficiency and resemblance to reality.
The Biolink Project
Our printing system, called Biolink, can be summarized in the following sentence: biofilm producing bacteria are printed with the help of a flexible scaffold hydrogel. First of all, our homemade bacteria (modified to make biofilms) are mixed with a solution of sodium alginate and subsequently with calcium chloride. There, the Ca2+ molecules keep the structure fixed creating a stable gel. This hydrogel-bacteria mixture is then induced with rhamnose, a sugar specific for our promoter,  which makes them synthesize CsgA, the linking molecule. CsgA proteins polymerize to an amyloid structure surrounding the cells and connecting them to each other through the scaffold. Once the cells are all attached in the structure defined by the gel scaffold, it is no longer necessary. Consequently, the hydrogel is dissolved with sodium citrate. But the cells are still connected due to the curli amyloid! So, we obtain a perfectly defined 3D structure made of bacteria.

The Biolink project promotes the open source and educational spirit of iGEM. Our 3D printer"

MOTIVATION
As part of our project brain-storming process, we had been looking through some of the previous projects for inspiration. However, when we start looking into how teams tackle the problem of their project safety, we realized that most teams uses kill switch as their genetic containment strategies. However, there are no practical implementation and standardization of the strategy.  We wanted to create a universal safety switch that teams can easily implement it into their project in the future. We were inspired by the application of recombinases in eukaryotes where only a specific gene inside the cell will be knocked out without harming the cell itself. As a proof-of-concept, we therefore uses the Cre-lox system to illustrate how recombinase can excise the gene of interest in the DH10b strain of E.coli bacteria that are easy to grow and safe to use in the laboratory.
Having received feedbacks from people joining our organized activities in Hong Kong Science Park, where the majority is parents,                             it surprisingly shows that our samples view GMOs to be more safe if the genetically modified                             gene within an organism has been knocked out before the consumption. We, therefore, directed                             our focus on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) with the addition of time delay controlling                             the expression of gene of interest for safety reason.

TOWARDS OUR APPLICATION
Feedbacks from the participants in our workshops surprisingly shows that the public view GMOs, specially food to be more                             safe if the genetically modified gene within an organism has been knocked out before consumption.                             We, therefore, directed our focus on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) with the addition                             of time delay controlling the expression of gene of interest to satisfy the public’s concern.                             Time control mechanism can allow the genetically modified crops to grow under extreme conditions                             to increase crop yield while having this foreign gene removed before reaching the consumers so                             that these crops will be considered safer in the public"

YouTube Channel
Our overall goal with the YouTube channel was to provide answers for other iGEM teams as well as to provide general knowledge for the public. This means that we not only included instructional videos but we also conducted interviews to provide different perspectives on a variety of scientific subjects. Visit Duke iGEM 2017 on YouTube or click here to see our entire channel!
About our YouTube Channel
Duke iGEM 2017 is an group of slightly eclectic individuals who call Durham, NC home at least for the foreseeable future. Between classes, basketball games, and lab work we make educational videos as well as interviews with our members and members from our collaborators! We hope these videos help answer questions that you may have! If you have any suggestions feel free to let us know!
Special Guests!
Throughout the course of our channel, we had several guests on our Channel. Members from Oxford, UW Seattle, East Chapel Hill High School, and Gaston Day iGEM teams collaborated with us on several interviews. We also were able to interview our own shadows with Justin Park and Daniel Getman, the two students we taught over the summer (click here for more information on their experiences).These videos are below.
Interview Series
As shown above, our team interviewed several other iGEM teams. However, we also interviewed our own members to hear their perspective on science! Below are just some of the interviews we conducted of our own team.

BGU_Israel,2015,Team:BGU Israel#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"ix-Maseille, Questioner
Aix-Marseille Université (France), proposed a collaboration. They needed to collect a lot of information about chewing-gum and GMOs around the world.                  They prepared a small survey, and we went to the streets and interviewed random people.                 It was a fun challenge. We received a gold badge for our help.
Aix-Marseille project idea:
""Nowadays, chewing gum is the second urban pollutant after cigarette butts. To clean chewing gum, specific engines are used but they are heavy and expensive. The time required for its use is long and they need a large quantity of water. Besides economical aspects, chewing gums have an environmental impact. They are dangerous for the wildlife such as birds. Indeed, believing that it is bread, they eat chewing gums and choke. Regarding these alarming facts, we have decided to create a new environmentally- responsible way to sanitize our streets.""
China-Amoy university, article
Amoy iGEM team issued monthly newsletter that enabled igem teams from all over the world to share information about their project and discuss issues concerning it and synthetic biology in general.                         For this year’s version of the Newsletter iGEM Amoy contacted iGEM  Ben-Gurion to include us in the 2015 issue.  We had the honor to collaborate and publish an article about our project in the fifth issue of 2015 Newsletter. We described  our project and an update on our progress.

⇒ PCR machine is now operable. Basic programs have been written, but not all the functions of the machine are known. No    protocol for using the PCR machine has been written.
⇒ Usage of the autoclave was determined. No protocol exists for autoclaving yet.
⇒ 25 plates were made using 10g LB agar stock, 250mL deionized water, and 250μL ampicillin from vials left over in the stupid white box in the freezer. Original protocol called for distilled water-abbreviation ""dH2O"" was misinterpreted to mean deionized. Not known if the     plates are viable due to this error.  House-made protocols will use the following abbreviations to avoid this confusion:
∴Distilled water: dH2O
∴Double distilled water (from the machine): ddH2O
∴Deionized water: DI water or diH2O
A protocol has been written for plate production. As it depends on the autoclave protocol, however, it cannot be considered complete.
⇒ Simple inventorying took place, with the locations of pipettes, ethanol, hardware, and the master gas shutoff(!) determined.
⇒ Inventorying will continue tomorrow, and a PCR reaction may be attempted. Protocols for the PCR purification kit (Miniprep) will be modified during this time, assuming the PCR reaction proceeds. No method currently exists to determine PCR outcome, as no gels or gel mix is available in the lab. Along these lines, it may be beneficial to find an ultraviolet spectrophotometer to run these tests.

USTC,2017,Team:USTC#Demonstrate#2_-_-_TEXT.html," S2- and CysDes functions well.
Figure 4. CysDes enzymatic activity
(20mM cysteine)
Figure 5. S2- production as function of cysteine concentration under catalysis of CysDes
5.Transmission electron microscopy image of CdS nanoparticles on bacteria
From the above, we can see that this enzyme CysDes has strong enzyme activity to generate S2- ion from cysteine. However, in this photocatalyst system, the duty of this enzyme does NOT just stop here. It needs to precipitate CdS nanoparticles with additional Cd2+ ions in the system. In the toxicity text section, we can see that strain expressing CysDes had a better resistance than wild type strain. This primarily proves the assumption that this enzyme can enhance the bacteria’s resistance to Cd2+ ions by precipitating them.
To valid this assumption further more, we used Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to take a closer look to the bacteria. With this, we can valid the existence of CdS precipitance with our own eyes!
Here, we need to express our most sincere gratitude to those teachers in Center for Integrative Imaging(Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale). They helped us to process those samples for TEM.
We prepared four samples—the strain expressing CysDes with and without additional Cd2+ in it and the same for the wild type strain. Here are the results for these four samples.
Figure 6. TEM results
(from 1 to 5: WT, WT+Cd2+, CysDes, CysDes+Cd2+,CysDes+Cd2+)
As you can see in these five pictures, compared with other samples, group 4 and 5 had more precipitations on the surface of the bacteria significantly. Although we have followed every step in the protocol from other papers, our bacteria did NOT have so much precipitation as them. It may result from the fact that there are too many varieties in this experiments. So we could not repeat their results. However, these pictures still provide us with a solid evidence for our assumption! This enzyme can produce S2-, which can precipitate Cd2+ to form CdS nanoparticles for our final goal——utilizing light energy to generate more electrons!
6.Effect of CdS nanoparticles to cathode-current
To see whether CdS nanoparticles can increase the cathode-current as we expected, we added CdS quantum dots kindly provided by team ShanghaiTech into the culture when we were forming bio-film onto the surface of a graphite electrode. Theoretically"

Summary of all the work we have to do for the logic gates.  These are the necessary genes we needed to cloned into the logic gates.
Fro And1: rbs-luxI and rbs-Ci-ter
For Xor1: rbs FimE ter
For And2: reversed rbs luxI
For Xor2: reversed rbs-RFP-ter
Week 6 (15-21 July)
Amplification of fimE recombinase (rbs+fimE) from the Michigan Team.
Minipreps, and electrophoresis checking-> good amplification.
Week 7 (22-28 July)
Problem with AND1, the synthesis is not correct. We cannot go on with this gate. We planned order a new synthesis.
Amplification of a new rbs-luxI (BBa_K516011). We realized that the first rbs –luxI we amplified was not the good one (wrong size).
Cloning of rbs+fimE with a terminator, wrong electrophoresis profile.

Exeter,2013,Team:Exeter#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," molecule species, with the exception DNA, are constitutively expressed. Molecule species apart from DNA, RNA polymerase and ribosomes have spontaneous decay rates, as variance during the time period of the system run has been taken as negligible. Phosphorylated species spontaneously dephosphorylation rate. Molecule species are represented as agents with the exceptions of the pigment proteins and ATP, which are modelled as concentrations of tokens.
The initial condition only contains DNA, RNA polymerase and ribosomes, and OmpR (which is naturally present in the E.coli), all other agents and tokens are produced by processes of transcription and translation. Constitutive expression of light sensors and intermediates are required before the cell can begin to respond to light.
Cell absorption spectrum calculation
The final output of our model is a surface plot of absorption intensity as a function of time and wavelength. It reveals how the absorption spectrum and thus the colour of the cell changes with time. It also reveals how long it takes to reach equilibrium, the moment of greatest contrast and many other important features.
This image shows the combined absorption spectra of the cyan, magenta and yellow pigments over time calculated from the data in the graph alhpa1 above. It is a beta run of our absorption spectrum plot (MATLAB).
Each protein species has an associated absorption spectrum.
This image shows the absorption spectra of the cyan, magenta and yellow pigment proteins
This image shows the absorption spectra of the red (Cph8), green (CcaS) and blue (LOVtap) sensor proteins. Note we are using YF1 instead of LOVtap but the LOVtap spectrum is used in our model.
This multiplied by the population of the protein at a point in time gives the contribution of that protein to the total absorption spectrum of the cell at that moment. The sum of the contributions from each protein plus the absorption spectrum of the background cell gives the total absorption spectrum of the cell at that moment. This calculation repeated for every time step gives the total absorption of the cell over time.
This images show the combined absorption spectra of the cyan, magenta and yellow pigments over time calculated from the data in the graph alhpa1 above. This is the same surface as in the previous plot but viewed from another direction (90 degrees anticlockwise from the previous image)
Data sources
The model is based on data from literature and theoretical conjecture:
The stochastic rates are ballpark figures for E.coli cells and are non specific.
All absorbtion spectra do not have relative intensity all peak around 1 arbitrary unit.

Besides, a constitutive promoter called LacI promoter and LacI protein sequence in front of that, found on peT45-b vector’s another part. It is obvious that this part is IPTG-dependent, so Western Blot can be performed easily with the help of His Tag to observe PotB59 expression and S-tag to observe PomA expression.
In this part’s design we confronted with the same problem as we did in Hns part design . So we planned to clone them into PSB1C3-T7 plasmid, which we designed. By doing this, we will have the proteins synthesized in high amounts with the help of T7 but there won’t be any additional amino acids.

PSB1C3-HNS/HNS-T108I/PotB59-PomA CLONING
We cloned IDT G-Block genes into PSB1C3 vector in order to make it ready to be submitted and have many copies of it. For this purpose we digested PSB1C3 vector and HNS,HNS_T108I, PotB59/PomA G-Blocks with ECoRI and PstI restriction enzymes. Then we ligated these cut genes into the plasmid by using T4 DNA Ligase . Ocurring products were transformed into BL21 competent cell strain. To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was perfomed with Verify Forward and Verify Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly t the band should be 314 bp long, but if colony PCR worked, then bands should be at 744 bp long line for HNS and HNST108I genes, and 2045 bp long line for PotB59/PomA gene. As the result of colony PCR, the possible right cloned colonies were incubated in liquid culture for 16 hours. After this incubation, we isolated plasmid DNA from this bacteria culture by miniprep plasmid isolation method. We controlled obtained colonies with cut-check for a second cloning control. We used EcorI and PstI restriction enzymes for cut-check.

OD600 = 4.1 (500 ul) and
OD600= 1.3 (750 ul)
x to OD600 = 0.2 (OD after dilution)
4.1 * (0.05) = .205 OD
1.3 * (0.075) = 0.0975 OD ???? too low
subtilis doubling time = 25-40 minutes
1:30→ 0.4 abs
2:30→ 0.85 abs and 1.0 abs
Electroporated at 5:30pm, following Eppendorf and its original “High osmolarity improves the electro-transformation efficiency of the gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis” (Xue et al. 1999)
Measured concentration of pBU110 miniprep: [pUB110 miniprep 1] = 367ng/ul sample

Met with Kurt and a new grad student today at 11 as usual. We discussed various methods to improve our yields in assembling the RSR array, including using PCR amplification with the pUC57 primers we used for sequencing to create the insert in excess prior to gel extraction. Also discussed PCRing PCR products to increase yield (we will likely try this for CasABCDE and Cas3 w/ the current primers).

The 2015 IIT Madras-India team designed the SPusp45 part ( BBa_K1654007 ). but no characterization data provided. Here, we provided characterization data. We found that the SPusp45 signal peptide can be used to secret protein of interest outside of the cell using the β-galactosidase as an example. The western blot result was provided. So we verified this part ( BBa_K1654007 ) and provided documentation in the Registry.   The 2015 Concrodia-Canada team designed the SPusp45 part ( BBa_K1887002 ). After thoroughly reviewing the literature as well as wiki (the 2014 Groningen-Netherlands team and the 2015 IIT Madras-India team), we found that the SPusp45 signal peptide is of the length of 27 amino acids, but not the length of 38 amino acids as stated by the 2015 Concordia-Canada team.So we clarified this part ( BBa_K1887003 ) and provided documentation in the Registry.

Protein Purification - Dialysis
Finally the fusion protein is dialysed and concentrated. 4.5mL of sample (MonoQ chromatography elution fraction 2-10 of fusion protein) were dialysed according to the purification protocol with dialysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 1mM beta-Mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5).
Protein Purification - Concentration
After dialysis, 4.5mL of sample of fusion protein was concentrated to a final volume of 0.6mL and  stored at -20℃, according to the purification protocol. Trace amounts of contaminating background was observed, however, the fusion was significantly more in quantity and the background was tolerated for functionality testing. The final concentration of the solution was determined according to the BCA protocol and resulted in a concentration of 0.56mg/mL.

Model 1:
According to the case process we guess that : the amount of information stored (a growth time of yeast) is related to the initial inputs of two yeasts, The amount of α-factorsecreteby α yeast, and the promoting efficiency of the promoter. Therefore,  the information storage is set as the output value, and the other parameters are set as the input values.Then the partial correlation coefficient is performed to verify the accuracy of the verification and which input is most relevant to the output.
Model 2:
The relationship between the time of information storage and the amount of α factor, time, promoting efficiency, the amount of yeast, and amount of alpha yeast was determined by model 1. They divided the experiment into two parts. The first part is that:  a yeast and alpha yeast compete for growth without secretion of alpha factor. The second part is that: in the case of α-factor secretion, the two yeast growth for fighting, and the death rate of α yeast is the expression rate of Bax gene, and the expression rate of Bax gene is related to the start efficiency of the Fig2c promoter. In order to measure the efficiency of the start of the Fig2c promoter, the promoter efficiency of the promoter was measured by the amount of fluorescence by inserting the  fluorescent protein gene of EGFP.
Through the above experimental process, we have established two mathematical models:
1)Competition model:
    The change trend of OD value of yeast with time was reviewed, taking the maximum value of the slope r1=r2
2) fighting model:
They putted in different proportions of yeast and calculated the information storage time by modeling. At the same time, the ratio of yeast can be predicted by different storage times. NEFU-China provided a web-based, fully interactive modeling platform that not only provided some information for their wet experiments, but also enabled future iGEM teams to build more efficiently based on our work.
In the laboratory,our team has simulated the exhaust gas ratio which can be found in literatures .The corresponding proportion of the gas was mixed manually and the gas was injected into water to prepare an unsaturated solution. The content of carbon dioxide in the solution was tested continuously according to the time of the gas entering, and this was used as the"

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Modeling#Hybrid_-_-_TEXT.html," is well-defined as long as they stay within in    the domain. To give a complete picture however, we also    need to specify what agents should do when they attempt    to cross the spatial boundaries of the simulation.    Initially we implemented a simple “freeze” boundary    condition, which means that the bacteria are simply    forced back to the edge whenever they tried to exit the domain.     However, as our model got more sophisticated it became    apparent that simulating an entire petri dish would    not be feasible. Therefore, under the assumption that    our system would produce similar patterns over the    entire petri dish, we decided to implement periodic    boundary conditions. This means that we treat the    simulated domain as a “unit cell” which is repeated    ad infinitum in all spatial directions. As a result,    an agent that tries to exit the simulation box at    one side re-enters from the opposite side, like in Figure 13.
Figure 15
Periodic boundary conditions. Click to enlarge.
Periodic boundary conditions are easily implemented    by taking the modulus of every coordinate with the    length of the periodic domain in that dimension as modulo (26).
$$    x' = x \; mod \; L_x    \;\;\; \text{(26a)}    $$    $$    y' = y \; mod \; L_y    \;\;\; \text{(26b)}    $$
One last complication is that cell-cell interactions    across domain edges are possible with periodic boundary    conditions. To compute those, virtual cells containing    virtual agents are used that represent real cells and    agents close to the opposite edge of the domain, but are    translated to appear to come from outside the domain.
Partial Differential Equations Module
To implement the partial differential equations (4) we have   to discretize our domain into a grid and apply some   computational scheme that describes the evolution of our   fields in discrete timesteps. We will discuss only the scheme   that we employed for the two-dimensional model.   Furthermore, boundary conditions are described below as well.
Computational Scheme
As mentioned earlier the concentrations of AHL and leucine     are modeled using partial differential equations.     In the colony level model these equations are solved     explicitly. Explicit schemes do not require a lot of      work per timestep, but unfortunately are not     unconditionally stable.     If $\Delta t$ the timestep, $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$     the distances between grid points in the x and y-direction     respectively, and $D$ the diffusion coefficient, the     condition for stability"

EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," CAPOEIRA’s vaccine system, for multiple reasons:
Encapsulin was shown to have an effective activation of dendritic and T cells in vitro and in vivo
Encapsulin allows for the easy conjugation of libraries of neoantigen, as this can be realized through genetic ligation of the neoantigen oligonucleotide sequences to the C-terminus of Encapsulin
Encapsulin, along with the neoantigens, can be expressed in a rapid and straightforward manner using the cell free expression system
Such expression systems might help in reducing the cost of generating libraries of peptides by other technologies such as solid-phase peptide synthesis
Encapsulin
Encapsulin (Figure 2) is a protein cage nanoparticle found in the thermophilic bacteria Thermotoga maritima. Its crystal structure has been recently solved, and was published in a paper in 2008 ( Sutter et al., 2008 ). The Encapsulin multimer is assembled from 60 identical 31 kDa monomers having a thin and icosahedral T=1 symmetric cage structure, with interior and exterior diameters of 20 and 24 nm, respectively. The multimer automatically assembles from the monomers once expressed, as it leads to a lower energy state. The C-terminus is outward pointing, allowing for easy conjugation of peptides after the C-terminus ( Moon et al., 2014 ).
The Encapsulin monomer was modified by inserting a Hexahistidine linker (GGGGGGHHHHHHGGGGG) between residues 43 and 44 of the WT Encapsulin ( Moon et al., 2014 ). This was shown to convey exceptional heat stability and better hydrodynamic properties for the Encapsulin multimer. These properties are crucial to obtain a simpler and more efficient purification of the Encapsulin protein.

Vaccine Design Project
The vaccine design process aimed at establishing a platform that receives a library of neoantigens from Ginga, and outputs a library of vaccines that incorporate these neoantigens on the surface of Encapsulin (Figure 3).

Overview
    This year, team Tsinghua-A utilized synthetic biology’s techniques to build up a system in E. coli which can simulate the complicated relationships within or between populations. We want to simplify the complex systems in nature and draw some interesting conclusions from this concise system. Since any hazardous accidents were unexpected, even if the chassis organism we used were barely E.coli EPI300 and E.coli MG1655, which are classified into Risk Group 1, it was also necessary for our team members who were in charge of the wet-lab experiments to receive indispensable lab safety training. A graduate student, Peng Shuguang, and a PhD student, Wei Lei, in our lab, who are experienced and scrupulous, offered us training on experimental skills and lab safety. Here we want to share our experience on lab safety.
I General Safety Training
    Before we started our experiments, all of our team members responsible for the wet-lab experiments received detailed and rigid training on biosafety and lab safety from Wei and Peng. The training included standard experimental procedures, usage of biosafety cabinets and normative disposal of experimental waste etc. During the first few weeks since we started our experiments, either Wei or Peng stayed with us all the way in the lab to supervise our manipulations. They gave us guidance and enlightened us when necessary. During our time in lab, we kept thorough lab records, including protocols, consideration on error-prone steps and careful discussions etc. None of us conducted experiments on our own until he or she could pass a check on lab safety and experimental operations.

Running Tests on Purified Honeybee Protein
As per Michael's suggestion I am running a Dry Film Test in order to determine the weight by volume percent of silk protein in our samples.
Tristan is running a BCA assay with Jessica on the samples from 5/26 and 7/29.
Dry Film Test
Weighed out 100 ul of 5/26, 7/29 and a 3% SDS solution as a control.
3%SDS = 0.0991 g, 5/26 silk = 0.1001 g, 7/29 silk = 0.0940 g
Need to keep in mind that the 5/26 ad 7/29 silks are not directly comparable, because one was solubilized in 750 ul of 3% SDS and the 5/26 was solubilized in 2 ml of 3% SDS, and the 5/26 was from a 250 ml culture, and the 7/29 was from a 100 ml bacterial culture.
BCA
Using a Thermo Kit, Jessica prepared 9 standards.
I made a working reagent of 25ml reagent A mixed with 0.5ml reagent B by inverting.
100ul of each standard, sample, and blank was added to microcentrifuge tubes.
1ml of the working reagent was added to each tube, except the blank, and vortexed for 10s.
All tubes were incubated at 37C for 45min.
All samples were transferred to cuvets and run in a spectrophotometer."

Mascot  had almost finished, only problem here was that it cannot sit or stand by  itself. Maybe thicker legs and heavier body can solve this problem.
Saturday,  July 28th
Experiments:
In order  to verify part PcI-RBS-gfp(LVA)-TT and ligate this part to others, did another  digest for restriction analysis and ligation. Sadly, the gel result was still  disappointing: three bands were observed after double digestion. But two of the  bands revealed that they might be correct, yet being contaminated. So Advisor  Wu decided to extract gel with correct bands and perform ligation.
 
Sunday,  July 29th
Experiments:
Still  stuck at PcI!!! Isolated plasmid from the streaking plate from original  transformation one. Digested for restriction analysis and ran on a gel. The  result was still not pleasant. Taking advice from another graduate student  Zheng, diluted the liquid culture in 10-6 and 10-7 times  and spread on LB Agar with Amp.

Goal:  ligate Pcons-RBS-tetR-TT + PtetR
In the  morning, we started on the first try. After plasmid isolation and digestion,  ran on a gel and result was still sad. So we try again in the late afternoon  and performed ligation.
The  colonies in the plate of the previous day grew well, so picked one colony of  each plate and streaked lines at the same time.
Team  Meeting:
Wang  summarized the genetic circuit parts finished last week, and restated the  essentials of attitude and carefulness when conducting experiments. Xie  presented his communication with iGEMers in The Hong Kong University of Science & Technology. He communicated with the team members and have a pleasant  discussion.

Experiments:
Digital  Display:
Goal: To  verify all the plate streaked or spread in July 29th.
Isolated  plasmids and ran on a gel. The result was not perfect but still satisfying. One  of the ligation turned out correct.
Sophia sent  everyone an e-mail, pointing out the time limitation and rest tasks of  experiments. The lab team was divided into three groups in charge of digital  monitor, time delay and cell immobilization, respectively.

Discussion
When counting cells, some dead cells were observed, and those cells were not included. The second day morning, some of the cells on the petri dish are round and suspended. Cells were few and scattered. For dishes with 5,000 cells, only several cells can be observed in one field under 4X objective lens. For dishes with 50,000 cells, near 10-20 cells can be observed in one field under 4X objective lens.

Bielefeld-Germany,2010,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," Hence the user of our sensitivity BioBricks must be aware of the risks concerning working with phage DNA.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
There is no specifical group. There is a safety and a desinfection officer at our institution who support our project.
4.Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Every team must be aware of the risk that might be based in the organisms they use and they modify. Maybe a general safety instruction, which can be downlaoded from the igem.org page will be helpful to secure the research done in this competition. Moreover a list of risk organisms, with easy acces on the igem.safety page, would be a great benefit. Additional the safety page could be tidied up to ease the acces to the key facts. Hence a small safety summary, like a checklist would be useful.
Certainly, it has to be said that the safety of the project must be reviewed by the team performing the experiments.

At each single conjugation event, with the expression relaxase, the corresponding tandem oriT pair is lost with the rolling-circle replication. Sequential conjugation and deletion of the different oriT pairs can be achieved by fine control of relaxase expression. To report the ending of tandem conjugation process, a reporter gene is attached after the last oriT pair, and hence expresses after all conjugation events happened.The resulting tandem signaling conjugation process will allow them to develop networks of bacteria capable of sequentially assembling tasks.
The riboregulator system was incorporated in Into their circuit to provide  an interface for interaction between their conjugation system and general genetic devices  to realize the goal of assembly line. According to the data that they measured, they concluded that  the open ratios of Key1 -Lock1 and Key 2-Lock1, the open ratio of key1-Lock1 was 3.3 times higher than  Key2-Lock1.

1% bleach: Centrifuged spores re-suspended in 50 μL 1% bleach.
70% ethanol: Centrifuged spores re-suspended in 50 μL 70% ethanol.
Drying: Centrifuged spores were completely dried in a Vacufuge at 30 °C for 10 minutes.
Heating at 60 °C: Centrifuged spores were placed in a hot water bath at 60 °C.
Heating at 90 °C: Centrifuged spores were placed on a hot plate at 90 °C.
The spores were subjected to each of these conditions, at 5:35 pm on September 25, 2014, and left for 24 hours before  they were re-suspended in 50 μL of distilled water.  From this solution the spores were centrifuged to separate spores from the supernatant so that the spores could be spread on LB agar overnight to see if the spores were able to regenerate and cultures were able to grow.  This allowed for quantitative data to be taken of the cultures to see which conditions proved to be the hardest on the spores.
Transforming B. subtilis spores
The final design of our device would contain B. subtilis in the spore form due to its robust nature. Before the blood sample reaches the compartments containing B. subtilis, the cells need to be activated back to the vegetative state. Due to this, it was essential to test activation and transformation directly from spores. We made our first attempt by pelleting cells from long-term and short-term stored spore solutions and added LB, xylose, and linear thrC DNA (~200 ng) at the same time. We incubated these tubes for a day, and spread them on plain and spectinomycin plates. There was growth on plain plates but not spectinomycin plates, suggesting unsuccessful transformation. One reason for failed transformation might be the addition of insufficient DNA.
Transforming B. subtilis with PCR product
We continued trying to biobrick lacZ. This week the team focused on getting parts ready for submission. We are having issues plasmid switching out parts.
Sporulation with xylose

Hong_Kong_HKU,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,", so the growth of bacteria with BBa_K2764003 is similar to the rest. Then, after T=2, the amount of AlkL is enough to give a toxic effect, such that the effect of cell growth inhibition is favored over the effect of cell growth boost, hence, there is negative growth observed for bacteria with BBa_K2764003.
Given the extremes of cell growth inhibition and cell growth boost exhibited by bacteria with BBa_K2764003 and bacteria with BBa_K2764001 respectively, it is not unreasonable for bacteria with BBa_K2764002, which has medium promoter strength, to have cell growth between the other two. This also supports the push-and-pull hypothesis that suggests bacteria with BBa_K2764002 is able to offset some of the toxic effect of AlkL by importing fatty acids, but to a much lesser extent than bacteria with BBa_K2764001, resulting in stunted growth compared with the control. However, near T=8, it can be seen that growth of bacteria with BBa_K2764002 is almost the same of that of the control. This further supports the hypothesis that cell growth is slowly favored as more fatty acids are imported by AlkL over time into the cell to boost growth.
In conclusion, it can be said that AlkL certainly has an effect on host cell growth. It is proven to exhibit toxicity by its inhibition of host cell growth, as shown by the first half of the graph. However, it may also aid the growth of the host cell, as shown by the second half of the graph.

The Formaldehyde sensitive promoter expression is normally repressed by FrmR however, when Formaldehyde is present, the bond is broken triggering transcription of the GFP coding sequence and subsequently the triggering a colour output.
Figure 2: SBOL Visual Detailing Formaldehyde Biosensor System
Design Stage
In order to implement the Formaldehyde biosensor variant to the Sensynova platform, a design was created by replacing the IPTG sensing system in the original detector module with the construct detailed above, creating part BBa_K2205030 . We chose to redesign the Formaldehyde biosensor detailed above to mirror the design used when producing the Psicose detector variant. The system detailed in the image below is made up of the constitutive promoter present within the platform triggering transcription of the FrmR repressing the PfrmR and subsequently the connector 1 of the Sensynova platform. We have also replaced the colour output present in the TMU-Tokyo design, we have added our part BBa_K2205008 , which produces our first connector in order to trigger a response from following modules of the Sensynova platform in the presence of Formaldehyde.
Figure 3: Formaldehyde Biosensor Modified Design
Figure 4: Formaldehyde Biosensor as the Detector Unit
Part BBa_K2205030 detailed above was designed using Benchling and virtual digestions and ligations were simulated resulting in the plasmid map detailed below.
Figure 5: BBa_K2205030 in PSB1C3
This part was created as a design only. The part BBa_K2205030 was not ordered for synthesis through IDT and subsequently not submitted to the registry.
Conclusions and Future Work
Due to time constraints, we lacked the time to synthesise, implement and characterise this part into the Sensynova platform within the lab. Future work on this part would include characterisation in vivo guided by the modelling of the framework when customised as a formaldehyde biosensor and testing against the Sarcosine Oxidase adaptor module currently present in the framework.

OBSERVATIONS
When the Tamura was added, small liquid bubbles appeared on the surface of the HFIP. They looked kind of like oil bubbles on water
I think that the bubbles are water that isn't mixing with the HFIP
This makes no sense though -- Wikipedia states that HFIP is miscible with water
Other sources corroborate that HFIP should be miscible with water. After all, the main point of HFIP is that it's crazy strong at hydrogen bonding
Alternatively, maybe the bubbles are protein aggregates? They look so liquid though
After about an hour or so, there were two pieces that were still solid in the liquid
I poked at them with a pipette tip to try to push them and dissolve them
They behaved exactly like gels
After about another hour, the solid pieces still weren't dissolving, and the Tamura was just sitting on top of the solution.
I vortexed to try to dissolve the solid pieces and to mix the Tamura in. The same protocol by the Lewis group states that vortexing to mix the dope is ok
After about another hour, I tried to pipette the dope to place into the syringe
the damn dope had gelled up and I could not pipette it.
POSSIBLE CAUSES OF THE GELATION

the fact that I used a pipette tip to mix the dope around
addition of water in the Tamura

This been my second time participating in the iGem competition I am a 17-year-old student in fifth semester of junior high. Having the Japanese and Mexican Nationalities is what makes me unique. I am as an Asian has to be “naturally” (such a stereotype -_-) interested in science and technology, but besides that I am a really open minded and a happy person. That’s why I have the best of both sides of Mexico and Japan. I was really interested in the competition because I could learn more about a topic that I am passionate about and to experience such an international and intercultural event will make my world bigger than the really one. This year been the president of the team gave me an irreplaceable opportunity which opened my eyes and realize how difficult is to accomplish something, but not impossible.
