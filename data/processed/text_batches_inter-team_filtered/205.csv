In order to characterize their increased tolerance of copper or/and cadmium ions, we designed and conducted two different sets of experiments, in both visible and quantitative manner, to test their ability to cope with adverse environmental conditions.
CONSTRUCTION
This vector consists of three parts, an estrogen-inducible PCLB2 promoter (BBa_K2407002) , the Cre-EBD sequence (BBa_K2407005) and a CYC1 terminator (BBa_K2407003) . We used overlap PCR to ligate these three parts and then the plasmids with URA3 and HIS nutritional label respectively through enzymatic digestion and ligation. Then this composite part (BBa_K2407011） ,was sequenced and proved to be accurate by using the promoter's forward primer and the terminator's reverse primer. The electrophoresis results below also showcased that the sequence length (about 2800bp) was correct.
Fig.3-1 This is a simplified version of this vector expressing the Cre recombinase enzyme. Cre-EBD is the coding sequence of Cre recombinase; PCLB2 is a constitutive  promoter in yeast; CYC1 is a terminator.
CHARACTERIZATION
Dilution Assay
We conducted dilution assay on SC solid media containing 0.14 mM cadmium ions. Experimental groups are S1, S2, S3, and S4; control groups are synX (the yeast strain containing a synthetic chromosome X), BY4741 (wild-type haploid yeast), and BY4743 (wild-type diploid yeast). Results are shown in the picture below.
Fig.3-2 Experimental groups: S1, S2, S3, and S4; control groups: synX, BY474, and BY4743. Yeast cells were picked up from single colonies on solid growth media and diluted by 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000 times.
Apparently, the experimental groups have a survival advantage over control groups. In this picture, S1 is able to develop a large single colony even after it is diluted to 100000 times on SC solid media containing 0.14 mM cadmium ions; S3 and S4 are able to grow when diluted to 100000 times but the colonies are much smaller than that of S1. Although S2 is not as good as the other three, it still shows higher resistance to cadmium ions than"

Modelling PQS
Sigmoidal Signal Response Revealed
Objectives
Sigmoidal Expression of mCherry in PQS System
Stochastic Simulations Elucidates the “Switch” Behaviour
Increasing promoter numbers increases mCherry expression
Conclusions
Objectives
We wanted to find a method of increasing the expression of mCherry in our engineered PQS system.
Sigmoidal Expression of mCherry in PQS System
When our PQS system was induced with synthetic PQS, no mCherry was expressed. We attempted to use mathematical modelling to find out why, and how the situation could be resolved. After constructing a series of ordinary differential equations1 we established the following relationship between PQS and mCherry:
The above equation was then analysed in MAPLE2 for varying PQS concentrations using the parameters in table 1.
Fig 1. shows how the concentration of mCherry increases over time. The general trend is that the rate of expression of mCherry is proportional to PQS signal strength. Most striking is the rapid switch from low expression to high expression as the signal is increased.
When the gradients of mCherry were plotted against PQS concentration (Fig 2), the result was a sigmoidal curve with sharp transition located between signal values of 0.1µM and 1µM.  Below this, expression was effectively zero, and above it, expression was uniformly high.
These results suggest that the levels of synthetic"

In these images we observe that the system only posses an stable equilibrium point.
By making the model a little more realistic we added another form of dependance of the substance concentration change in time. We also added a saturation term and a degradation term.
Non Linear Simulation
In the following images we appreciate that there is a bifurcation point such that we obtain two different dynamics, one in which the system saturates and other in which the substances concentration reaches the zero value.

Extension
With the two approaches above we did not obtained an oscillatory behavior as expected. Nevertheless, an idea emerged from the team. There could be an use for the dynamics we encountered. The idea was to 'reset' the system every certain amount of time. This 'pacemaker' system looks like this:

NAIT_Edmonton,2015,Team:NAIT Edmonton#Trial7_-_-_TEXT.html," In addition to that, Eduardo kept our entire group organized and focused on our end goal. Eduardo really had a hand in everything - he attended meetings on behalf of our team, he conducted research and assisted in literature review, filled out our lab log books with David (with extreme neatness), and somehow, he was always willing to do more. Eduardo never missed a day coming into lab, and even came in on the weekends.
Eduardo has truly been an indispensable asset to the team and an even better friend. We could always count on him to listen, advise and provide the emotional support in this chapter of our lives. Friends are the siblings that we were not originally given. It is an honor for us to be your ""siblings"" - to be your iGEM family. Thank you, Eduardo, oh Captain, our captain.
David Barilla
You will never meet a kinder, more loyal man than Mr. David Barilla. Although he was extremely busy balancing work, iGEM, and family - he always made time to come to NAIT everyday and work on our project - even if that meant losing precious sleep and workout time.
In our team, David spearheaded the documentation of our experiments and protocols; kept us all grounded and sane; wrote SOPs and logbooks; developed our modified silver stain protocol; and helped in the lab to run experiments (plasmid precipitation, cloning, and mini-prep among many) with Eduardo. David even went as far as learning to code HTML to try and share the load with his more computer savvy team mates.
""Best friends are people who make your problems their problems, just so you don't have to go through it alone."" There is no better way to describe David. He always knows the right thing to say to bring a smile to everyone's face. He has an amazing sense of humor but also knows when to get down to business. Thank you, David. The summer has been an absolutely amazing experience with you in the lab! We will always treasure your random bursts of classic rock and even your incredible (yet sometimes outrageous) ideas.
Johannes Coomansingh
Joe is the light of our team. His incredible sense of optimism has really helped our team stay positive throughout all the speed bumps of our project. Without Johannes to brighten our lab days with his ramblings and non sequiturs, our iGEM journey would have been much more stressful. Thankfully, he was present everyday to keep us lighthearted.
Joe really is Mr. Congeniality. As our ""HR Guy"" he has really gone above"

Week 6: Project planning, Gibson assemblies planning, First Matlab simulations
Wednesday, July 2nd
We have a clear organization of the different experiments we would like to perform.
We want to optimize quorum sensing to have non-leaky non-cross-talking constructs. We want to prevent cross-talk between integrases and check their dynamics with different quorum sensing promoters. Then we will test the XOR gate without production of LuxI, to check how it works without the loop, and we will finally test our final construct with the loop, hoping that the delay between GFP production and the possible second switching due to AHL production is long enough to have enough fluorescence.
The red line is our critical timeline. Numbers of days are very optimistic,therefore we multiply the whole timeline by 2. The stars stand for modeling inputs.
Tasks organization with critical timeline in red.
We have also clear plans for the Gibson assemblies to perform. As an example, here is the plan for regulator plasmids :

Risk-Benefit Analysis for genetically modified plants
Since genetically modified food is cultivated the general public is concerned about the ethical implications of this new technology and more importantly the possible dangers to human health and the environment. To address these public concerns we put together a comprehensional risk-benefit analysis to determine whether the negative public perception of GMO´s is reasonable or result of an ill-informed misconception.
Benefits
Extensive testing regarding human health in comparison to traditional food which could prevent ingestion of high levels of mycotoxins, alkaloids and other noxious substances
Higher yields through the introduction of resistances towards parasites and viruses
Creating health beneficial functional food (additional vitamins, higher calorie density etc.)
Eliminating allergens in highly allergenic foods to make them available for more consumers
Increased agricultural acreage by making plants more resistant to certain atmospheric conditions
Cheaper production costs resulting in cheaper prices for consumers
Possible widespread distribution of therapeutic substances such as vaccines
Reducing the use of pesticides which pose serious health concerns if ingested
Risks
Unexpected gene interactions with genes other than the induced ones
Increased cancer risk if transgenic plants have higher pesticide residues than wildtype ones
Possibility of introducing a protein into the food which could act as a new allergen
Chance of unwanted horizontal gene transfer
Genetic manipulation of a specific organism may pose a threat to biodiversity
We have to add that the above mentioned risks and benefits of GMO´s do not regard distribution and marketing and we aimed to analyze only the scientific implications of this technology.
Further evaluation of the risks
Today science is already at a successful path in minimizing all possible risks associated with GMO food. The mentioned risks are only a select few of all conceivable scenarios but we thought them to be the most conceivable ones.

Paris_Bettencourt,2011,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Potential Application_-_-_TEXT.html," large numbers of identical, parallel processors with each having limited computational ability and local interactions. The term amorphous computing was coined at MIT in 1996 (ref: Amorphous Computing Manifesto by Abelson, Knight, Sussman, et al). Examples of naturally occurring amorphous computations can be found in many fields such as: developmental biology (the development of multicellular organisms from a single cell), molecular biology (the organization of sub-cellular compartments and intra-cell signaling), neural networks, and chemical engineering (non-equilibrium systems).
The nanotube network described in the article published by Dubey and Ben-Yehuda [1] is a great opportunity for amorphous computing in cells. This is a non-specific communication channel where cells can exchange proteins only with their close neighbours. In our case, instead of having a broadcast communication system (such as quorum sensing), nanotubes can be compared to a peer-to-peer network. Nanotube will simplify communication between cells by reducing possible information loss and a good way to know the distance between cells (which is a great asset in amorphous computing).
With this network, we can harness the computing power of an entire colony but still follow (through fluorescence for instance) the behaviour of individual cells. The non-specificity of the nanotubes is an important asset for such an application. The molecules that can be used for information transfer will not be limited to a small number like in quorum sensing. The fact that molecules are not released in the medium is also a great advantage.
This would require a fine tuning of the network and the test of several molecules diffusing through it. Our designs are perhaps the first emitters and amplifiers that will be required for such an application.
Medical application
The nanotube communication if efficient, is one potential mechanism that would allow a population of infectious bacteria to survive an antibiotic treatment. Indeed, if a resistance appears, such mechanism helps the bacteria to resist together even before plasmid is transferred from one cell to another.
A treatment blocking the formation of the nanotubes in gram positive bacteria would be an efficient drug to prevent antibiotic resistance apparition in case of long infection period. Drugs with such capabilities can be given in complement to standard antibiotics.
For the moment, the genes at the origin of the nanotube formation are unknown. There is a lot of fundamental research ahead to find the proteins governing this process.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Indigoidine_-_-_TEXT.html,"5 µl of of the reaction mixture were used for transformation. The remaining volume was used for quality check on a gel with small pockets (10 to 20 µl in volume).  The following primers were used for all CPEC experiments into standard BioBrick backbones: BBa_J04450_stem_loop_fw, Bba_J04450_B0034-RBS_ATG_rv, Bba_J04450_B0029-RBS_ATG_rv. The reverse primers (rv) differ in the ribosomal binding sites they introduce: Bba_J04450_B0034-RBS_ATG_rv contains the ribosomal binding site used in J04450, Bba_J04450_B0029-RBS_ATG_rv introduces the ribosomal binding site B0029 which is of weaker than B0034.
Generation of the ccdB-Ind construct
To minimize the background colonies when exchanging the T-domain of the indigoidine synthetase we generated the ccdB-Ind plasmid  where we replaced the indC T-domain with the ccdB gene (Modul structure: AoxA-ccdb-TE) which kills E. coli TOP10 cells but not E. coli OneShot ccdB survival cells. Test-transformation in both E. coli TOP10 and the E. coli OneShot ccdB survival cells showed that background colonies could be eliminated by this strategy (Plattenbild top10 vs survival cells). We used the ccdB-Ind for all further CPEC experiments aiming to swap T-domains. Primers for the backbone CPEC fragments were designed to facilitate the amplification of the entire ccdB-Ind plasmid while omitting the ccdB sequence (compare to Figure??). Assembly of the finale indigoidine synthase products with exchanged T-domain was achieved by CPEC as described or above or HiCT ( RFC 99 ).
Examination of T-domain borders
We exchanged the T-domain of indC with the T-domain of bpsA and varied the size of the exchanged DNA sequence, thus examining several domain borders (compare to Figure ??). We used the CPEC assembly method and the indC-ccdB plasmid for this approach.
Test of various T-domains from different NRPS modules
For the investigation of additional T-domains from less related NRPS modules, we selected the border combination b31??? which was positive in the test with bpsA. We used the T-domains of the following genes: Table 2: Genes of which T-domains"

Nevada,2011,Team:Nevada#Notebook#Temp2_-_-_TEXT.html," to PCR this stock at 65.5.
PetBD worked really well at several temps but 63.5 Celsius appears to be the best temp, strong band that was very clean. This worked out so well I might try just running a 50 ul solution at this temp and saving it as backup stock. Confirm the same clean band with a 5 ul run of solution through gel.
CmR did not work at all  I was told K56 was the integration vector sent from Utah State but was unable to confirm that in any of my team’s notebooks. Will double check with David today and see if he has that same number in his note book. If it is correct, maybe need to play with DNA concentration and temps again.
*E. coli group has extra CmR, will ask Megan to bring over some of this stock (pSB1C3 – iGEM vector) for next PCR. Shintani thinks that maybe vials were switched in the beginning (KmR PCR also not working) or something went wrong during purification.
With better stock will run temp gradient PCR on CmR again.
7/22/11:  Gel for GLF at 65.5C yielded no bands.  Ran PCR of GLF at 63.5C.  Faint bands, attempted gel purification, will run confirmation gel on Monday.  Ran PCR for PETBD (50ul), which also yielded no bands.  Will run another gel for a shorter time period on Monday.  Will discuss options/next steps on Monday with the group.

Go Green
The iGEM Goes Green initiative was introduced by the TU Dresden 2017 team in order to encourage other iGEM teams to approach the competition through a green lens. Many teams make impressive strides in applying synthetic biology to solve complex environmental challenges. However, an often overlooked matter is that of the development of ecoconscious lab practices and tools for ecological footprint analysis to be utilized during the iGEM journey. Realizing this, TU Dresden set out to establish a movement among the iGEM teams of 2017 to critically evaluate their project methodology. They decided to facilitate this through composing an extensive guide consisting of examples and suggestions.
As we had joined the iGEM competition for the joint opportunity of contributing to the iGEM community and to create a channel for discussions on environmental sustainability, we were more than happy to join the Goes Green initiative.
Here follows a short list of the things we considered upon reading the Goes Green guide
In the lab
The laboratory freezer was defrosted and all old samples were disposed of after they had served their purpose.
A conscious effort was made to promptly turn off any lights and electrical devices after use.
The sash of the fume hood lowest level of for convenient operations possible when conducting experiments.
The autoclave was only run once properly filled. We encouraged this by autoclaving the materials from other scientists and by planning our experiments well in advance.
The scale of experiments was kept at a minimum to minimize waste and use of laboratory consumables.
Pipette tips were purchased in bulk.
Environmentally hazardous chemicals were avoided when possible.
Others
A conscious effort was made to minimize paper consumption. Communication and research was kept online to avoid excess printing. Articles were exclusively read online.
Our personal electronic devices were all turned off or put in energy saving mode when not used.
Everyone used the bike as the main source of transportation.
Public transportation was utilized when the team needed to travel longer distances.
Prior to ordering lab material, we researched different vendors to minimize shipping distances.
The choice of financial institution was based on their sustainability policy.
Throughout the project we continuously advocated environmental sustainability and made efforts to communicate it with the public.
We want to applaud TU Dresden for an excellent initiative and hope that many iGEM teams decided to rally behind them. #GoGreen

About the Michigan Synthetic Biology Team
We are the University of Michigan’s only student-run synthetic biology research and design team. Our team and project development is driven entirely by undergraduates and is separate from any faculty labs.
Members:
Cristina Castillo
Cristina is a senior studying Cellular and Molecular Biology and Biomedical Engineering. She is currently the president of the team and led the wetlab work.  Cristina is super smart and really sweet.  She likes coffee, bubble tea, and frequently gets Panera.  She often meows and watch out if someone turns on latin music, because this girl can dance.
Jennifer Knister
Jenn is a senior studying Cellular and Molecular Biology and Biomedical Engineering. As the Principal Investigator, Jenn thought paper based gene circuits were super cool and set about designing riboswitches to add to their uses.  She instructed much of the experiments and designed new switches to test, even when she was three time zones away in San Francisco over the summer. She has mad frisbee skills and she is a dog whisperer.
Jeremy Kuo
Jeremy is a senior studying Microbiology and Music, and is currently the treasurer of the team. He was indispensable for fundraising, consulted with people in industry, and also learned html from Max so we could do this wiki.  Jeremy is spent his summer wrangling kids as a U of M math and science summer camp and got them super pumped about science.  When he is not giving out two liter jugs of bubble tea to team members, he also enjoys taking pictures of banana bread.
Nick Emery
Nick is a sophomore studying Cellular and Molecular Biology and Biomedical Engineering. Despite being his first year on the team, he has been invaluable for the design and wet lab work.  Nick works in two other labs on campus and is somehow graduating super early, next December.  Nick has a moderate addiction to caffeine.  When we asked Nick how much time and energy he had for this project, his answer was “Infinite.”

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki_-_-_TEXT.html," the gene switch. We also made an interactive simulation available to everybody to best illustrate how our idea actually works.
To control the amount of blue light on our cell cultures, we created the LED rig device. This enabled us to perform diverse experiments in order to characterize our light response element. These results show that our light response element is able to regulate the downstream gene expression precisely. In addition, the response time is in a ten-minute-scale, which enables constant and nearly real-time control over bacterial cultures. In addition, we hypothesize that this system is also applicable to bioreactors, which would enable higher level of control in industrial bioprocesses. However, our fully functional prototype is still under ongoing development.
We have developed an open approach to biotech business inspired by the business models for open source software. Following the Open Source philosophy, we will distribute open Aalto-Helsinki Bioworks technologies for free to everybody - as long as they share the improvements made on the technology. Therefore, we empower our users to participate in product development. Our business model is based on hardware and wide range of services offered to our customers.
During the summer we participated in Aalto Entrepreneurship Society’s Summer of Startups 2014 incubator programme to learn the essential entrepreneurial skills, such as pitching, investor relations, customer-driven development and explaining the science for general audience. See our Demo Day video for details.
iGEM is an international experience and as the first Finnish team, we went to find advice and experience around the globe. We contributed to the iGEM community by building a BioBrick Seeker tool which makes it easy to find parts of your interest in the 2014 BioBrick distribution. This tool has been used by iGEM teams all over the world! We also did a lot of cooperation , including filling out surveys and having skype conversations and live meetings with current and previous iGEM teams from France, Colombia, Switzerland, USA and the Netherlands. We even made a video together with ETH Zürich team to Colombia team’s challenge.
We wanted to raise awareness about synthetic biology in Finland and also showcase researchers’ work to young people and undergraduate students. Therefore, we have been reaching out to general public, especially young people via social media , including Facebook , Twitter , Youtube , Flickr and our own blog. We’ve shared stories, pictures, videos and experiences to our followers. In addition, we have been featured in radio interviews and articles on magazines and webzines. We also made a silly game: Flappy Coli . We have a public team webpage, aaltohelsinki.com , where you"

BBa_K1132020: rbs-YF1-rbs-FixJ-term-pFixK2-mRFP1
This composite part can be used for a blue light sensitive system. It is built with 4 preexisting parts: rbs-YF1-rbs-FixJ (BBa_K592016) with a terminator (BBa_B1010) and followed by FixK2 (BBa_K081014)-rbs-mRFP1-term (BBa_K592006). Rbs-YF1-rbs-FixJ is a regulatory protein working with the promotor FixK2. In darkness, YF1 is phosphorylated and gives its phosphate group to FixJ. Once phosphorylated, FixJ can bind to FixK2 promoter and actives it. In light, FixK2 promoter can't work.
A final construction was made with a constitutive promoter (Bba_J23116) but this promoter seems to weak to generate enought copies of YF1-FixJ to activate FixK2.
Adding a strong promoter before this biobrick can improve the system.

General Inducer
BBa_K1132021: TetR-pTet-rbs-mRFP1-term
This biobrick is a tool to use the couple TetR-pTet system. In this construct, a modified coding region of TetR (BBa_C0040) was assembled before pTet-mRFP (Bba_I13521). pTet is a constitutive promoter. TetR is an inducer that binds to pTet promoter and thus, represses the expression of the downstream gene controled by pTet. Supply of tetracycline or its analog aTc (anhydrotetracycline) is known to bind to tetR and invert the operation (inhibits expression of mRFP in this case).  A further construct was made by assembling the promoter BBa_J23116 upstream. (Construct available here: BBa_K1132022 ).

Tsinghua-A first entered the iGEM Jamboree in 2011 and progresses have been made ever since then. With instructors and team members from the Department of Automation, we have an advantage in modeling construction. We have team members from all kinds of departments, School of Life Science, Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences and Department of Automation. We hope we can do better this year.
OUR PROJECT
QUESTION(THE QUESTION YOU WANT TO ASK THE OTHER TEAMS): 1.HOW TO OPTIMIZE OUR HELA CELL CULTURE IN DMEM MEDIA ? 2.IS THE DMEM COMPOSITION AFFECT HELA CELL CULTURE ?
The TALE assembly strategy uses the Golden Gate cloning method, which is based on the ability of type IIS enzymes to cleave outside of their recognition site. When type IIS recognition sites are placed to the far 5’ and 3’ end of any DNA fragment in inverse orientation, they are removed in the cleavage process, allowing two DNA fragments flanked by compatible sequence overhangs, termed fusion sites, to be ligated seamlessly. Since type IIS fusion sites can be designed to have different sequences, directional assembly of multiple DNA fragments is feasible. Using this strategy, DNA fragments can be assembled from undigested input plasmids in a one-pot reaction with high efficiency. We chose the native TALE AvrBs3 as a scaffold for customized assembly of TALE constructs. The"

RBS Strength to Translation Rate
Altering the RBS strength of the ribosome binding site in a plasmid, can be completed by altering the genetic makeup of the RBS. This was modeled through the utilization of the RBS Calculator created by Dr. Howard Salis, at Penn State University. Using the forward implementation of the calculator, one input's their protein coding sequence, organism, and target translation initiation rate. The calculator then outputs the RBS sequence required to achieve such a translation initiation rate under the conditions outlined.
Relating Translation Rate to Proteins Produced
Translation Rate to Proteins Produced
The effect translation rate has on the protein production, was accounted for in the Salis Lab RBS Calculator Code. Thus, by simply declaring the desired translation initiation rate, the code properly took into account the impacts on protein production.
Maximum Threshold of Secretion
Is There a Maximum Threshold of Secretion?
Is diffusion the rate limiting step? Do CsgA pile up in the cell?
After 1 second, a spherical particle of radius 10 nanometers, has a displacement of 6.6 micrometers due to Brownian motion in water at room temperature. Determined via;
Assuming this model represents movement of CsgA, diffusion is not the rate limiting step.
Degradation Rate
Degradation Rates
The degradation rate of mRNA is on the order of 2 to 5 minutes.
The average protein half-life is approximately 23 hours.
Therefore, degradation rates do not impact curli protein production, as this would imply most of the curli proteins being degenerated during biofilm formation (which can take days). Given this is not the case, and curli protein are fully present in our biofilm, the degradation rate of curli proteins is negligible.
Anderson Promoter Library
Anderson Promoter Library
The Anderson Promoter Library was utilized by QGEM, given the specific measured promoter strengths, as seen in the table below. By incorporating these known strengths into our ratiometric program (as a factor of transcription rate), QGEM was able to precisely model the outcome ratios of proteins in our biofilm.
The promoters/parts, BBa_J23101 through BBa_J23119, are a family of constitutive promoters - BBa_J23119 being the consensus promoter sequences. Their sequences simply differ in the -35 and -10 consensus regions.
The promoter strengths listed are relative promoter strengths - hence, having units [RPU]. The relative promoter strength of external promoters, those not found in the Anderson Library, can be measured via a procedure found with the"

The construction of B3 proceeded with the ligation of the TraI/terminator segment with P-LasR/RBS and was followed by the transformation of competent bacteria to subsequently verify the possible completion of the construct.
6th Week (1–7 August)
The Tra box-CMVmin sequence was cloned into pIRES2-EGFP (without CMV), so we wanted to repeat the earlier week’s experiment and see if, following the correct AHL signal, cells would express EGFP. Curiously only a light fluorescence was detected, either due to an error during the cloning steps, or because of the low translation efficiency of the IRES sequence.
Meanwhile the sBLA we ordered by synthesis arrived, so we set out to amplify this construct in order to clone it in an appropriate vector and assay it’s activity.
The results from last week’s sequencing confirmed the successful completion of the bacterial constructs A2 and B2. The sequencing of A0 and B1, on the other hand, did not give the same results. On the contrary, we found a few discrepancies between BBa_K392008’s sequence and that which we were making reference to till now, so the work to re-construct A0 and B1 is still ongoing.
Finally, the construct B3 was completed, controlled, and then ligated into B2.
7th Week (8–14 August)
The synthetic sBLA construct was cloned into pSEAP downstream of the Tra box-CMVmin sequence. This plasmid was then tested after transfection into HeLa cells and successive AHL induction in order to verify the secretion of the enzyme. Early analyses showed negative results, probably due to the low levels of protein produced or to errors during the cloning design. We then set out to do more clonings into other vectors in order to further test sBLA activity. In particular we cloned the synthetic sBLA into pIRES2-EGFP (either with and without CMV), and we also amplified pWW1015 to clone its sBLA into pcDNA3.
Meanwhile we started working on the bacterial construct A1, similar to B2 but with a TraR activator instead of the LasR activator under the constitutive promoter.
The bacterial constructs A0 and B1 have been completed, ligated to two different reporters (RFP and GFP, respectively) and assayed for their activity in response to the appropriate AHL signals (OC8 and OC12, respectively). This assay, which gave good results, showed that these constructs coding for an AHL-inducible beta"

2.2 two operons O1 and O2 (double promoter)
   It is common for prokaryotic cells to have two operons in a specific DNA site and there are also many useful double promoters in the iGEM Registry database. For example, BBa_I739104 is a double promoter (LuxR/HSL, positive / P22 cII, negative). In order to model these circuits, several rules and situations have to be considered:
   (1)If both O1 and O2 host repressors, they can bind either cooperatively or not.[14] Cooperativity between repressors implies an increase of the repressor affinity towards O2 when O1 is occupied;
   (2)If both O1 and O2 host activators, they can bind either cooperatively or give rise to synergistic activation, which increases the promoter strength with a consequent increment of the transcription initiation frequency;
   (3)O1 hosts an activator, while O2 hosts a repressor, which has proved to be easier for oscillator-building;
   (4)Just to be simple, we do not consider the complete competition and cooperativity among the inducers or corepressors.
   Like the example BBa_I739104 mentioned above, we can deduce the following equation for the transcription process:

Internet Conference
Similar cooperation like us and NYMU_Taipei, NCTU_Formosa had also happened internationally. Two of our team members went to UIUC, Champaign, Illinois for visiting. While they were at USA, they contacted the local UIUC_Illinois iGEM team. After several arranging between both team leaders, we and the UIUC_Illinois team held a group meeting with each other. Due to the geographic barriers, we can only held international conference through the internet. We then had our international conference online on the same specific time, a bright night at Champaign, Illinois and a sunny day in Taipei,Taiwan. We introduced our team members, shared both our projects, post questions at each other and provided advices. The team members at the USA further went on deeper discussion with them and took a tour at UIUC_Illinois’ laboratory. Thanks to them, we had more detail understanding about how iGEM works and how to reshape our project focus. It was really a great time talking to you, thanks, UIUC_Illinois. We were happy to know that you guys also entered the World Championship!!

Podcast Collaboration
We collaborated with the teams of the University of Cornell , SDU-Denmark and University of Illinois , in the production of a podcast about some of the Ethical, Social, and Environmental implications of large-scale genetic engineering projects in modern society by creating a series of videos accessible  to the general public. Our topic was the Genetic Modified Organisms.
Our task was to present a video of ""Genetic Modified Organism"", in which we explain what is happening nowadays with it, and some implications that this topic has in the society. We tried to explain it in a way that everyone understands the idea.
Our video focused on transgenic organisms. We wanted to give simple examples so that the general audience could learn about how genetic engineering techniques are being used to satisfy increasing demands of food, how they might help cure diseases, and produce medicine in large amounts to reduce costs. We also included alternatives of how animals are being used without genetic modification, for example, by taking advantage of their dung as a  non-poisonous repellent.We want to thank them for this opportunity.

Everyone.
May 2, 2011 - May 5, 2011
May 2, 2011
Brainstorming based on ideas we had in a preparation meeting. Main ideas were investigating biofilms, biosensor development, and promoting methane production over sulfur production.  While the discussion leaned towards creating a Biosensor, we decided that we needed more information to make a decision and researched different types of cells in tailings ponds that are able to detect and/or break down naphthenic acids.
May 3, 2011
Everybody presented the findings of their research about different cells to the group. We determined to create a biosensor and discussed the specific requirements for it. One of the most obvious problems was how the cells would react to the presence of naphthenic acids. The three options we decided to test were via pigment secretion, fluorescence, and an electrochemical response.
May 5, 2011
Research on the two different project paths was continued. We decided on developing a biosensor for naphthenic acids in tailings ponds.
We finished the first draft for the OSLI application and began editing it.
May 6, 2011
We worked on the OSLI application and did more research on the background of naphthenic acid reporters and sensors.

LEUVEN MEETUP - 10/07/2017
The KU Leuven team invited us to the iGEM symposium they have organised. The symposium was the 7th of Octobre in         Leuven in their university. The goal of this meeting was to meet teams, we were 5 teams to be present (München, Aachen,         Amterdam, Leuven and us) but also to practice for the oral presentation and for the poster.
We first had the pleasure to have a lecture in medical devices from one of their professor which was really interesting and         we learned many things about what we could do with medical devices and how we can employ them.
After the first lecture we started the teams presentations, it was fascinating to hear all teams and learn from them,         give them opinions, advice for Boston.
After teams presentation we had the last lecture from their PI about the life as a scientist. It was an amazing         lecture, we were all emotionally touched and it remind us the real work as a scientist to be in contact with the society         all the time and feel what we do, do it with passion and nothing else.
We finished the symposium with the poster presentation. Each team had to talk about their project briefly, and comment         the other posters.
The symposium they organised was a really nice adventure, in which we learned and shared many things, we went back         home with new friends, a lot of advice and comments about how to improve our poster presentation and our oral presentation.         We gave them back advice too.
It was a very great and helpful experience. We also had the time to visit the city of Leuven, which is a very cute city.
We want to thanks the Leuven team for inviting us to their symposium and for receiving us to their place to spend the night!

Add 75% ethanol on top of the solidifying stacking gel.
When the gel is solidified, remove the ethanol and pour the stacking gel on top of the separation gel and immediately place the gel comb on top of it.
Allow the stacking gel to solidify, then remove the plates from the casting station.
The gels are ready for usage, or can be stored at 4 °C in liquid for later usage.
Preparing samples
Add 5μL protein Loading Dye to 20μL of protein sample.
Incubate the samples for 10 minutes at 90 °C.
Running SDS-PAGE gel
Run the gel at 150 V and 25 mA.
The gel is finished when the blue line is at the end of the gel.
Processing SDS-PAGE gel
Turn off the power pack before opening the gel box.
Remove the gel from the cassette and place the gel in a clean staining tray of the appropriate size filled with a layer of MilliQ.
Gently allow the gel to slide from the glass plate into the water.
Microwave the gel for 40 seconds on low heat.
Allow the gel to shake on a moving platform for 2 minutes.
Discard the water.
Add clean MilliQ water and repeat step 15-17 two times.
Cover the gel with a layer of SimplyBlue SafeStain.
Let the gel stain on a moving plate for approximately 20 minutes.

Models
In our design, we aim to manufacture psicose, which has a lot of advantages over other sugar or sweeteners as is mentioned in the research of the psicose. The advantages of psicose include low energy, benefit to diabetes and hyperlipidemia, making psicose become more and more popular in people. People can get a psicose sweetener or food rich in psicose, in which psicose is synthesized by biological ways, because using chemical ways is not a good choice to synthesize clear and edible psicose in a food grade for the containing of unhealthy and poisonous by-product in chemical synthesis methods.
Nevertheless, biological methods in producing psicose are inefficient due to the low enzyme efficiency of D-psicose 3-epimerase. The efficiency of D-psicose 3-epimerase is different due to the various environment system and the different concentration of substrate (sounds amazing due to the efficiency of enzyme irrelevant in most occasions).
Our aim is to model our project and predict the situation before wetLab or in the future. Also, it is necessary to validate our model and prove that our model is available.
The first model we established is the dynamic models for the four devices. The concentration of reagent and  product can be measured by wetLab and the results are the same with wetLab and the model from SYSU-Software, which validate our dynamic model by sharing our wetLab data.
The second model we made is the production simulation model and conversion rate model. We use probability theory to simulate gene mutation process and the directed evolution. Thus, we get the production prediction and the conversion rate prediction, as well as the time we need to improve an enzyme.
The third model is the hairpin coupling model. We cooperate with OUC-China and set up hairpin coupling model with the theory of statistical thermodynamics and gene expression. Thanks to the help of OUC-China, we can set this model and predict the hairpin coupling coefficient.
The forth model is market prediction model. We set up this model based on HP data from the survey"
MIT,2016,Team:MIT#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," for automatic cells seeding using a syringe pump. B) Input and output wires are connected to inlet and outlet of the microfluidic device. A 3D-printed frame is used to put the device on the microscope's placeholder, allowing dynamic monitoring. C) A syringe pump is set up to continuously pump the solution containing cells into the channel during seeding (seeding flow rate was: 20 ul/min, cell density: 120E4 cells/ml).
Results
Model 1
Figure. Images of microfluidic channel, 24 hours after cells seeding.
After 24 hours, the channel was completely dried out. The images didn't show any cells inside the channel even though cells in the control culture dish grew normally (image not shown), which was seeded at the same time with as microfluidic device. Since we couldn't check for cells inside the device right after seeding, We couldn't narrow down the main reasons for unsuccessful cell culturing in the microfluidic device. Thus, we decided to repeat the experiment (using model 2) with dynamic monitoring right from the seeding stage.
Model 2
Video. Images taken inside the diamond chamber, first 340 minutes after seeding. Frame rate: 3fps. Each image frame was taken at 10 minute interval. Red arrows: indicate cells. Blue arrows: show evidence of poliferation
Right after seeding, the cells were still in suspension; therefore, they all had spherical shape. After about 20 frames (190 minutes), they started to elongate and shifted out of focal plane. At the 26th frame (250 minutes after seeding), the cells were out of focus, which could indicate adhesion of the cells to the chamber's surface. The blue arrows point at cells showing evidience of mitosis, including appearance of two nuclei within a single cell and formation of the metaphase plate. Unfortunately, at the end of the video (after 350 minutes), the media within the chamber dried out, which has been a major problem for our experimental setup.

Purpose
As our way of giving back to iGEM, we created a screening tool for use in Gateway cloning reactions.  In the past Gateway reactions have used the ccdB death gene as a negative selection tool to pick bacterial cultures that have successfully taken up a copy of the desired plasmid.  However, due to a patent on ccdB and negative selection tools in Gateway, iGEM had to remove all ccdB-containing parts from their registry"

Enzyme activity of ECOL , measured after incubation with 0.4 mM CuCl2 and measured at OD420 via oxidized ABTS.
What an awesome day! We were sitting here with Tecan preparing to do our usual measurements as suddenly super ECOL appears. It came over from Team Cultivation and surprised all of us with its activity (see Figure 1).  This time we incubated the enzymes for 2 hours in 0.4 mM CuCl2 before measurements. Also we measured longer to make sure to notice every single activity of ECOL . Stay tuned!

Evry,2014,Team:Evry#Biology#Chassis_-_-_TEXT.html,"ität Düsseldorf, Institute of Molecular Enzyme Technology (Group of Bacterial Photobiotechnology). Dr DREPPER succeed to transform several strains of a genus very closed to our Pseudovibrio, the genus Roseobacter.
We made competent cells and then we effected the developed transformation protocol (see section Protocols ), which is an electroporation at 2000 V.
Figure9: Maps of PBBR1MCS and pRhoKHI-2.
Once again, after a lot of tries, we failed to have transformant of Pseudovibrio denitrificans growing on plates supplemented with chloramphenicol, even if pBBR1MCS is a plasmid supposed to work in almost all GRAM- bacteria and those two plasmids work in bacteria very close to Pseudovibrio.
Creating a new plasmid
After trying to transform Pseudovibrio denitrificans with the pSB1C3 plasmid which did not work, we had several hypothesis:
-The promoter of the Chloramphenicol resistance gene does not work in our bacteria
-The origin of replication does not work in our bacteria
-There is a system degrading exogene DNA in Pseudovibrio
To verify these hypothesis, we chose to find specific constitutive promoters and origin of replications in an other member of the genus Pseudovibrio, which genome has been sequenced, the FOBEG1 strain. (lien article)
A strong constitutive promoter of FOBEG1 was found with a genome browser. Upstream sequences of vital and cell cycle independant genes were explored. We were interested by the transkelotase, a key enzyme of the pathway of pentoses phosphates.
We can assume this enzyme should have a good constitutive promoter, or at least have a reliable and strong expression. To be sure to have the whole promoter sequence, we exported the sequence (fasta format) from the beginning of the ORF of the transkelotase, to the end of the previous ORF. This sequence was amplified with primers 5 and 6 (see primers table in Protocols ).
After a PCR, we obtained a 6000pb band for Pseudovibrio ascidiaceicola, and no band for Pseuvibrio denitrificans. These PCR product was sent to sequencing, as shown in figure M.
Figure10: Result of promoter sequencing.
Thus, there is 94.1% of identity between the transketolase promoter of the Pseudovib"

Example Projects:
The 2017 team created a catalogue of 3D printable lab equipment to increase customizability and access to printable lab wear and decrease cost to teams.
Waterloo iGEM 2017 also wanted to indirectly gauge the public’s opinion on the project through the use of an Implicit Association Task (IAT). This task can show if people have an implicit, or subconscious, bias against or towards certain words. By utilizing words that relate to our lab project in the IAT, we can determine which words are most likely to provoke a subconscious reaction in the general public and use this information to tailor the presentation of our project to decrease public bias.
Waterloo iGEM’s 2017 project were engineered prions that had enhanced function when in the amyloid state, and the team investigated the use of our engineered proin joining aptamers (oligonucleotides) to the prion domain amplify the detection rate of viruses.
Open Science:
Another important aspect in the design of a project is open science is to documented in a way that others can build upon: improving the flow of information, minimizing restrictions on the use of intellectual resources, and increasing transparency of research practice. With a scientific field as new and novel as synthetic biology, it is imperative that all accomplishments and research is open for all teams, research groups and industries to access in order to advance and progress the field forward as efficiently as possible.
Public Engagement:
Education & Public Engagement allows for outreach and education work regarding synthetic biology. Great public engagement projects will focus on establishing a dialogue or sparking new scientific interest in the synthetic biology community in general (and not your specific project). This criteria is not limited to just members of the policy team - all members of iGEM should get involved.
The current iGEM rubric contains four aspects for evaluating Education & Public Engagement:
Did their work establish a dialogue?
Does it serve as an inspiring example to others?
Is it documented in a way that others can build upon?
Was it thoughtfully implemented (i.e., did they explain the context, rationale, prior work)?
Example Projects:
Waterloo iGEM 2015 gave weekly sessions to children at ESQ (Engineering Science Quest), a children’s camp on the Waterloo campus.
Waterloo iGEM runs a synthetic biology workshop for top high school students attending SHAD Valley in Waterloo. In this workshop, we introduced concepts within synthetic biology, conducted lab experiments, and discussed social aspects of science"

A little extra about our project:
Food Spoilage ­ What your mom doesn’t know about! Food spoilage is a common kitchen disaster hiding behind a closed shelf or buried deep within   refrigerator which all of us have been frustrated with. It is one of the most important reasons a   lot of quality edible food product go to waste. Spoilage is characterized by any change in a food   product that renders it unacceptable to the consumer from a sensory point of view. (Lone Gram,   2002)  In reality it is a vibrant problem though pictured individually this picture does not zoom   out beyond minor negligence in kitchen – leaving yogurt out in open, cauliflowers pushed too far   behind in the chill tray.  However these food spoilage incidents do happen at industrial and farm   level  too  where  a  lot  of  quality  raw  product  can  go  to  waste  before  it  can  be  made  fit  for   consumption. Expenses which would have to be taken into consideration because of it would   include:  medical  care,  including  hospital  costs;  laboratory  investigations;  the  cost  to  the   economy generally of production and wages lost through illness; loss of production and market   share  for  food  manufacturers  implicated  in  outbreaks,  and  legal  expenses  in  the  event  of   prosecution or claims for compensation (Eley, 1992). All of this accounts for a large economic   loss. There are two main reasons for food spoilage: ­ “Naturally occurring biochemical changes” and   “Microbial Activity”. Similar to human’s digestion microbes – bacteria and fungi break down the   food particles into simple derivatives acids and similar other waste products may be released   changing the physical properties and chemical structure of our food. In severe cases they can   cause food poisonings and in extreme experiences have also resulted in death!  Between 1980­  1989 Cases of food poisoning bacteria in England and Wales rose from 10856 to 25818. (Eley,   1992). When food gets  spoilt we generally tend to identify it by tasting or detecting  change in  color,   texture or smell.  Simple and comfortable these tactics are, they elude us from identifying these   issues beyond our daily context. One simple example"

Growth Experiments - Validating our co-culture design and medium
----------------
Question: Was it possible to create an isolated compartment by using a dialysis membrane?
Experiments:30 cm of dialysis tubing was filled with 1 mg/ml Dextran Blue solution dissolved in miliQ-water. The tubing was closed using clips from spectrum labs. The filled dialysis tube was carefully placed in a 1000 ml flask with sufficient miliQ-water covering the tube. If the tubing was leaky, Dextran Blue would be visible in the surrounding water.
Result: Even after five days of incubation on a shaker at room temperature, no dextran blue was observed in the surrounding water (Fig. 1).

Surveys
An important aspect of our project was understanding how our GM bacteria would be perceived by the public. Public perception can often be a barrier between scientific progress and real world application. The main objectives of our surveys were to determine the public’s knowledge of GMOs, access their comfort level with GMOs, identify any specific areas of concern with genetic engineering, and access their comfort level with our project in particular. Our methods for conducting the surveys were approved by the MSU Institutional Review Board (IRB) as scientifically valid methods. We stood on Grand River Avenue across from MSU’s campus, and asked everyone who walked by to fill out a survey anonymously. We did this for a few days every week during the month of July 2018. Afterward, we tallied all of the surveys to get our final results. The survey itself consisted of a disclaimer paragraph, per IRB regulations, informing the participants about the purpose of the survey, and the contact information for one of our PIs. This was followed by three demographics questions, and then seven questions designed to better understand public opinion of GMOs. All questions were ""multiple choice"" style.
Demographics
Overall, 363 people filled out our surveys. Because we surveyed people at a location so close to campus, we were aware that our polling population might have some bias. We saw this bias in our demographic results, where 52% where typical college-aged students. However, we still think that our data can provide some useful insights into the general population’s opinions. We purposely chose a location near a public bus stop and near businesses, so some of the people we polled would be younger and older, and have varying education levels, as better represents the general population.
Results
Our results show that the general public's opinion of GMOs varies dramatically. Public education and awareness will be an important part of making our GM bacteria marketable. We were happy to see, though, that most people were at least open to learning more about our project. As shown in the results from question 5, only 7% thought that genetically modifying bacteria instead of a plant was unacceptable. The other 93% were at least open to discussion"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP."

Intestinal use
The gastrointestinal tract is packed with up to a 100 trillion microbes, called the microbiota [1] . This life-sustaining microbiota assists in producing essential vitamins and the digestion of important nutrients. Perhaps the most promising discovery is that these microbes play an essen¬tial role in protection against pathogens and communication with our immune system [2] . Disturbances within the communication of the microbiota and our immune system, is associated with many different pathologies, such as Crohn’s disease, colon cancer and even obesity. A specific, reliable and rapid sensor for these diseases and biomarkers is still lacking. The development of our device can thereby be a first step towards such a diagnostic tool, and in the distant future even for treatment of these pathologies.

Rice University iGEM Team
This year, we collaborated with Rice University's iGEM team on an app that would                   display information such as structure and function of a molecule once the user                   'imaged' a moving crystal. The purpose of this project was to make a way for people                   to get a better understanding about molecules such as hemoglobin, as well as provide                   insight as to how the structures are determined.

After we interviewed the specialists who are famous in the food and sweeteners area, the current situation of sweeteners was getting clearer in our mind.Generally, most of them used by us have the  main shortages which are high calories and bad taste even though they might be very sweet.We based the human sweetness receptor on our design and hypothesized to construct the signal conduction path in the yeast
VISIT SOME AUTHORITATIVE CORPORATIONS
When several constructions of gene had been finished and tests had been carried out, the COFCO which is the one of the top 500 corporations and the most advanced food suppliers in China became our next interviewee.Some of the managers showed up to welcome us and  they are the principal of innovating new product—Mrs.Zhao, the one of vice chairmen of the company—Mr.Huang and the doctor who is responsible for the manipulating of electronic tongue technique—Mr.Liu.We had a long but meaningful chat about the current device used by most of the  food producing companies, which made us realize that the generally used machine’s range is so limited that it is hard to measure the sweetness conveniently as well as some devices like electronic tongue technique would only be efficient after the association with the assessment given by workers, which results in the humongous uncertainty.Therefore, an innovative bio system which relies on Synthetic Biology to observe and select new types of sweeteners will have a non-negligible contribution to the society.Finally, we accept the advice which came from COFCO and what they suggest is to let us start with some classical and conventional sweeteners like stevia rebaudiana,  liquorice and Momordica grosvenori.
COOPERATION WITH OTHER UNIVERSITIES
At the latter phases of our project, we organized Beijing University, Lanzhou University and Jilin University etcetera to make a big chat about what we had done so far and held three scientific speeches to introduce the development and the common use of sweeteners in our daily life, which contributed to the increase of popularity of iGEM as well as Synthetic Biology.Ultimately, we collected the critical advice from the audiences in time and accept one of"

Panama,2010,Team:Panama_-_-_TEXT.html,"osa. Rhamnolipids have many applications because of their natural biosurfactant, emulsifying, fungicidal, antibiotic and pharmaceutical properties. Rhamnolipids can also operate in extreme conditions such as high temperature, pH and salinity. Rhamnolipids have low toxicity and are biodegradable compared to their synthetic chemical counterparts. A rhamnolipid is composed of a rhamnose sugar molecule and a b-hydroxyalkanoic acid. The rhamnolipids are almost exclusively produced by pathogenic microorganisms. For this reason we propose the non-pathogenic nature of E.coli as an attractive candidate for commercial rhamnolipid production by assembling our rhlAB gene into a BioBrick using synthetic biology to engineer this new rhlAB producing bacteria for human benefit.

This construct BBa_K875004 is designed for the expression of an already described engineered antinorovirus (NoV) monoclonal antibody (mAb 54.6) in fusion with LPP-OmpA. The antibody is expressed in a single chain fragment variable (scFv) format containing light (VL) and heavy (VH) variable domains separeted by a flexible peptide linker. It has already been reported that the scFv 54.6 binds a native recombinant NoV particles (VLPs) and inhibits VLP interaction with cells. LPP-OmpA functions as a leader sequence and an anchor to display the scFv ot the bacterial surface.The construct consistes of T5 Lac Operator (Bba_K875002), ribosomal binding site, LPP-OmpA-scFv 54.6 antinorovirus, Histidine tag (6HIS), Terminator (B0015).
T5cumate repressed Tse2 mediated, antihorizontal transfer mechanism
This construct BBa_K1175003 is a modification of the part designed by iGEM2012 Team Trieste it has a T5cumate inducible promoter suppressed by the CymR gene integrated genome into the chassis E.coli Nissle 1917. This part will not be suppressed by CymR in the bacterial cells that have taken up the plasmid.
WHAT: We are repurposing cellulolytic genes to increase bioavailable energy by breaking down cellulose into glucose, which can be used for humanitarian efforts, economic mobility and Industrial application
WHY: Increase bioavailable fuel sources for human consumption, economic growth and increased reliance on local resources.

Outreach Overview
Cornell iGEM aims to foster a meaningful impact on the local and global communities by sharing our knowledge in synthetic biology and engineering principles with those around us. To this end, we have reached out to community members of all ages through the YOURS mentorship program, project presentations, and community involvement, to garner a greater understanding of synthetic biology as a whole.
YOURS Mentorship Program
Cornell iGEM’s main outreach focus this season was a one-on-one mentorship program between team members and elementary school students through Cornell University’s Youth Outreach Undergraduates Reshaping Success (YOURS) program. The purpose of YOURS is to provide kids living in low-income mobile home parks near Ithaca, NY with opportunities to learn and grow. Our mentorship program aims to introduce under-served local elementary students to synthetic biology and to develop a better understanding of genetic engineering and its underlying principles within each mentee.
Our mentorship program not only taught students core concepts of science, but also emphasized our 2015 project. Each week, we crafted a hands-on modular lesson which built upon scientific principles introduced in previous sessions. We showcased the direct application of synthetic biology in the world around us by explaining how each concept could be used to combat bacterial coldwater disease in salmon. We began with basic biology lab techniques, progressed to learning about proteins and the cell, and culminated our seven week program with a visit to a fish hatchery.
Many of our mentees are not exposed as often to science in the classroom as Cornell iGEM students were during their own childhoods. But, limited access to instruction in science did not stop the local elementary students from jumping into the projects we set before them with enthusiasm. We were inspired by the curiosity, creativity, and tenacity of these students as they strove to learn as much as possible about the world around them. We mentored local students, but they taught us that the beauty of science truly lies within the messy yet fun aspects of scientific experimentation.

Above is model's parameters from past published documents: these parameters' values are all determined under the condition of NO's amount of substance is 220nH, at this time，D1=1，D2=D3=0，cGMP’s initial concentration is  0，VsGC,max, KPDE, K4is constant.
2.3 Innovation analysis of cGMP combined with PKG
In our modeling, we assume that, compared with the synthetic rate of cGMP, PKG was activated by cGMP and the target cell phosphorylationis is relatively a fast event. The regulation of cGMP can be evaluated by the normalization function of the concentration of cGMP, A ([cGMP]): when the available amount of cGMP reached the minimum (i.e.: [cGMP]→0, namely: no impact), A→0 ; when the available amount of cGMP reached the maximum (i.e.: the greatest impact), A→1. Therefore, we consider cGMP as a molecular switch of adjusting start and termination of the reaction. We use the Hill Equation to approximate the function:
Km and the Hill coefficient(nH) relatively represent the value when variation tendency of model changes and the step degree of switch. This is only an approximate empirical formula, we can get the precise equation by experiment data. Considering that the reaction rate of cGMP combined with PKG is fast, we assume that the regulation process is reasonable. Therefore, any value of target number Q which is generated by the changes of the amount of cGMP can be generally described by the following algebraic equation:
Q=Qbasal+AcGMP(Km,nH)Qchange
Qbasal represents the basic situation of cGMP, Qchangeepresents the biggest change of which is induced by cGMP. Q can represent the rate constant of enzymatic reaction, conductivity of ion channels and so on.
But due to the restrictions of our students’ own level, we can’t make mathematical reasoning for the complex process deeply, so we can only write the main idea as above. As to describe this process by mathematical model language completely and to draw a conclusion which is consistent with the actual situation, we can complete it only to wait until after we improve ourselves.

Macquarie_Australia,2012,Team:Macquarie Australia#collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," the Asia region was lower than expected considering it is the largest region. The surveys also contained contradictory information. Some members from the same team stated that the wiki was updated each week, whilst another stated it was in the week before the wikifreeze. The distribution show that the Asian region has significant delays in the posting of content compared to other regions, in particular East America and Europe. If iGEM were to place a greater emphasis on collaborations than the delay in wiki updates may hamper the Asian region.
The Asian region shows a trend towards updating at the last minute. Team Macquarie's data was removed. The number of responses from Asian teams was very small and the large contribution by a single team shifted the distribution to suggest a different pattern.
Wiki and Open Source
The view on wikis was unanimous, they are functioning as expected and needed. The question was used to show that the spirit of iGEM revolves around communication and sharing of ideas. The responses per region did not change dramatically.
A collaboration Award
The idea for the survey was born from this question. Alongside Human Practice, helping another lab group (from our perspective this is collaboration) was a gold medal requirement. We then found it surprising that best collaboration is not eligible for a Special Award and yet best Human Practice is. Both are equally hard the judge. The Macquarie Team felt strongly that collaboration should be a bigger part of iGEM. Most worthwhile scientific endeavours benefit greatly from collaboration and we are excited for what future groups could produce collaborations were explored more.
The overwhelming majority of the community (83%, 99 responses) wanted to see an award for best collaboration. We, along with many other groups, felt that it would be hard to judge and would require the criteria to be carefully spelled out. This result was particularly exciting for the team as we found many responses that wanted to actively seek collaborations but found that seeking them were often very difficult. The lack of content on some teams wikis makes it difficult to determine what they are doing. Communication is also hard to establish and so teams often do not collaborate.
The potential impact of the award
The effect of a potential award on the desire to collaborate with other teams was mixed. Very few believed it would not affect their desire the collaborate. Many felt that they would be interested in collaborating with other teams knowing that a Special Prize was available. The judging criteria behind the award was a significant problem amongst the people surveyed. It is a serious concern and it is something that would require significant thought and planning before it is introduced.
Potential Ideas
Respondents provided many unique ideas to try to promote collaborations"

Teams that Collaborated With Us
As this is the first time our institution has participated in the iGEM competition, we decided to make a guidebook for future iGEM teams. We reached out to many other teams, particularly in our New Application track, and asked them to enlighten us on some of the hardships they faced throughout this year's competition. With their help, we created our iGEM survival guide for our policies and practices. We hope that our guidebook will be useful for future teams.

Starting from an agar plate containing a Candida genomic library, we add 1 mL of LB medium and we mix it. Then, the mix was transferred into a tube. We stored part of the culture in glycerine and another part (200 μL) was mixed with 5 mL of LB media and Amp (2:1000).
The tube containing the genomic library was grown at 28°C for 1 hour. Then, we made minipreps.

(1) The different ways in which the outcome of an action - e.g. developing and using a new technology - can be uncertain, and the importance of not mixing them up.
(2) How society should deal with uncertainty - comparing two popular approaches, namely the 'Precautionary Principle' and Risk-Benefit Analysis.

G3P Δ1-18
Infection of Escherichia coli by filamentous bacteriophages as M13, fd, f1, is mediated by the phage gene 3 protein (g3p or pIII). This protein of 406 amino acid residues, has a signal peptide,  two N-terminal domains and one C-terminal domain, separated by two flexible glycin-rich linkers.  All three domains are indispensable for phage infectivity.
The signal peptide (1-18aa) address the protein to the cell membrane before being cleaved. (We deleted it).
The first N-terminal domain (N1) binds to the bacterial periplasmatic domain of TolA ( TolAII ), receptor presumably at the inner face of the outer membrane.
The second N-terminal domain (N2) gives recognition of the host cell by binding the F-pilus on the surface of E. coli. F-pilus is encode by the F episome of male"
