Campus Day
On Wednesday, March 17th several hundred potential Waterloo students were able to take part in a lab tour where they were able to participate in hands on activities. The high school students learned more about iGEM, synthetic biology, and opportunities in science.  Students were able to view GFP in Arabidopsis thaliana under a fluorescent microscope, learn about our past projects, practice pippetting, learn about gel electrophoresis, view results for gel electrophoresis, learn about the importance of model organisms, examine RFP plates, and learn about past iGEM projects. This event allowed us to illustrate the exciting opportunities in science and engineering to students beginning post-secondary education.
This was a really rewarding experience for us because we were able to make a strong impression on students who were trying to choose their science career path.  Many of the students who participated in the event were unsure what options were available to them as science students. When we educated the group about iGEM and synthetic biology they were extremely interested in how they could pursue this path in their education and what possible careers it could lead to.  Some of the students stayed in the lab for a long period of time checking out all of the demonstrations and trying to gain as much experience as possible. It was really great to see high school students so keen about expanding their science horizons. It has inspired us to try and enrich the science experience of as many students as possible.
CACUSS (Canadian Assoication of College and University Student Services)
This conference held on June 14th, was for individuals who work in the student services area at universities from all across Canada. We featured our ""work alongside other student"" projects.  The goal was to educate individuals who do not work directly with synthetic biology but are important in fostering a healthy scientific community.  We featured our iGEM work and information about the future of synthetic biology. Visitors to our display had the opportunity to check out demos featuring gel electrophoresis, DNA, and RFP. We hoped to educate the group about what synthetic biology is and teach them about some basic techniques.
This event allowed us to communicate with members of the public who did not know very much about synthetic biology. At first, many of them seemed very unsure about what we were trying to accomplish. Some people even likened it to genetic engineering disasters or out-of-control pathogens. Once we explained more clearly the potential and goals behind iGEM people"

Talk Play Love
We are 9 undergraduate students, 2 graduate advisors and 3 faculty advisors from various disciplines including Pharmacology, Physiology, the Life Sciences, Materials Engineering, Chemical and Biological Engineering, and Engineering Physics.
Get up close and personal!
With the aim of dispersing Staphylococcus aureus biofilms, our team is working to express an endogenous bacteriophage and biofilm matrix-degrading enzyme DspB under the control of the agr quorum-sensing system. We are using existing BioBrick parts (e.g. the P2 promoter) as well as our own new DspB Biobrick part. We have also developd a new standard for working with bacteriophages.
Learn more at our Project page!
Our new and characterized Biobrick part is the biofilm matrix-degrading enzyme DspB. In addition, we have further characterized the existing promoter Biobrick parts, P2 (BBa_I174106) and Pcon (BBa_J23100) in Staphylococcus aureus.
For more details, visit our Parts page!
We have developed a model of biofilm population dynamics as affected by our engineered bacteriophage. Using this model, we are able to run simulations that predict outcomes of the system and construct informed hypotheses to test with our system.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Labwork#1 September 2009_-_-_TEXT.html,". The concentrations of the primers are as follows
pMA1 = 30.6 nMoles
pMA2 = 31.3 nMoles
Therefore the amount of water to be added to each of the primers is:
pMA1 = (30.6 x 5) = 153ul
pMA2 = (31.3 x 5) = 156.5ul
The next thing to do is make 10x dilutions by extracting 50ul of each of these hydrated primers and adding them to 450ul of sterile distilled water.
2) PCR
We carried out PCR reactions in the same way as described on 21/08/2009 along with the stochastic switch team. It must be noted that the annealing temperatures for pMA1 and pMA2 are 63.1°C and 62.9°C respectively.

TJU_China,2018,Team:TJU China#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,", we made some attractive postcards as well as bookmarks as the         award, in case certain visitors want to gain more details about synthetic biology in our project or provide particular         information about the assignment.
Figure 13. Citizens of different ages took part in the ""ball collision"" activity.
The purpose of these activities is to spread basic gene knowledge in an accessible and easy-to-understand way. Furthermore,         the unique festival is a stage for us to communicate with society, including all kinds of citizens. With no disappointment,         the professional in biology gave us much help, told us about their experience in labs which wouldn’t be found in         books. Our work turned out to be a great success. Many visitors showed great interest in the cartoon about CRISPR.         The games attract many children to participate in activities and learn knowledge at the same time. After all, developing         children’s interests is more significant than dumping education. We hope to provide opportunities to citizens and         also want to gain help through this grand activity.
First-year students in Lab
When the freshmen finished their first month in college, we invited them into our lab. A teacher in our lab communicated         with them about synthetic biology, including the knowledge hierarchy, scientific directions, and future employment.         We hope they can better understand what they are going to be educated for and what they want to learn. What’s more,         we also provided them with opportunities to use some simple experimental apparatus and hope to give them more chances         to get in touch with experiments, which is useful for their future study.

Our application scenario plan
Safety
In the Laboratory The students working on this project received laboratory safety training and were supervised during all experiments. All manipulations involving GMOs only took place in a contained biosafety level II laboratory and the usage of GMOs was only required for the production of the biosilica protein (made using E. coli bacteria). The protein was made in the cell and when the cell was lysed, the protein was released and the GMO destroyed. Therefore, there was no release of the GMO during this process. In the Field. All personnel using the Mos(kit)o will be trained to ensure proper usage of the device. The kits are designed to be safe and user friendly, requiring no scientific background. The operators will not have any contact with the infectious materials, reagents, or the newly produced protein.
Different context of our application
Upon successful completion of our lab work and following informed discussions with stakeholders, we illustrated two application scenarios where the Mos(kit)o would be utilized: in developed countries and in developing countries. The diagram below explains the life cycle of our device, beginning with the production of the biosilica protein and concluding with real life applications and potential outcomes. Context 1 describes developed countries where agencies or municipalities like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US or the French Interdepartmental Mosquito Control Board (EID), respond to emergencies. A warning is received from a specific location and these agencies are responsible for distributing the Mos(kit)o and ensuring that appropriate personnel are deployed to endemic areas. Currently, the CDC has an Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) that responds during public health outbreaks. They are responsible for identifying the causal agent(s) and they are tasked with assisting endemic areas with efforts to prevent and/or control the transmission of the disease(s). 2 A similar institutional set-up can be found in France. Following our conversation with a division director for mosquito preparedness at EID (acronym), we developed a practical example illustrating the utility of the Mos(kit)o device. Presently, administrators manually test endemic areas, which is labor and time intensive. The design of our device eliminates these conditions by using stationary traps and a patch capable of simultaneously detecting multiple viruses. Additionally, the division director of EID expressed interested in our device and suggested the need to have these traps within certain distances from hospitals where infected people are treated or airports because it is a transit place for global entry/exit from endemic areas. Our device would be used as an important proactive measure that could protect non-inf"

Congo Red clearing assay
As an initial screen for cellulase activity, we used the Congo Red assay. Congo Red is the sodium salt of benzidinediazo-bis-1-naphthylamine-4-sulfonic acid and binds strongly with amyoids such as cellulose yielding a red colloidal solution.  When the cellulose is degraded the red color disappears leaving a pale-colored halo.
We constructed K392039 and K392041 as tests constructs, containing the E. coli PelB secretion tag and C. fermi endoglucanase CenA or exoglucanase Cex, respectively. These constructs were transformed into bacteria and the transformants spotted onto agar plates infused with carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) bound with Congo Red. Degradation of CMC results in a halo appearing around the spotted colony.
CenA constructs.
Clockwise from left: CenA only; CenA with PelB; negative control.
Cex constructs.
Clockwise from top: Cex with PelB; Cex only; negative control.
From the results it appears that spots corresponding to secretion-tagged cellulase parts are brighter than non-tagged, suggesting higher CMC-clearing (ie. extracellular cellulose degradation).
Microscope observation of cell surface display
Since confirmation of surface display by antibody staining is too costly we decided to observe GFP-chimera protein.
We made a test construct consisting of surface display tag attached to GFP, K392038 . Yeast cells were transformed with this part and then stained with propidium iodine (PI), which stein live cell's wall, because PI cannnot transmit through cell membrane. Therefore we stained cell with PI before fixation. The stained transformants were then observed under a fluorescent microscope.
scale bar : 1 micrometer
As shown above, GFP intensity is co-localized with PI. Since PI is localized to the cell membrane, ie. exterior of the cell, we can infer that GFP is being displayed extracellularly. Some GFP can be seen dispersed around the cell; this might be Aga2-tagged GFP that has failed to bind to Aga"

Indian iGEM Meetup at IISER Pune (2017, July 15-16):
iGEM Team IIT Delhi sent its representatives to the Indian iGEM meetup which was held at IISER Pune and was attended by 9 iGEM teams from India and iGEM Peshawar (Pakistan, was on Skype conference). The purpose for this was to discuss projects and strategies among the teams and help each other with problems that were being faced. The possibility of collaboration was also discussed among other topics. The event ended with a friendly dinner. Being the most experienced team from India, iGEM IIT Delhi gave a good presentation at the meetup to other teams in terms of experience and well discussed and interacted among upcoming iGEMers.
With Knowledge Comes Responsibility- Session On ‘ETHICAL ISSUES IN SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY’ :
We conducted four sessions on ‘Ethical issues in Synthetic Biology’ in a course of Professional  Ethics & Social Responsibility (NEN100) at IIT. We addressed various Ethical Issues like Bioterrorism, Patenting and Creation of Monopolies, Uncontrolled release, Creating Artificial Life etc. in our sessions which was followed by an interesting ‘Case Study Discussion’ session wherein students were divided into groups and allocated the case study and asked to come and discuss the case study and identify the concerned Ethical issue, and draw the conclusions with the rest of the class. Finally, we took the feedback and conducted a survey which consisted of the questionnaire related to Ethics in Synthetic Biology. Feedback obtained from the students on the workshop conducted: 8.3/10   (No of students:85)
NIN 100 (Introduction to Engineering):
It’s a course common to fresh entrants of IIT Delhi, it has an important role to play in terms of orienting and exciting students in the subject of engineering. iGEM IIT Delhi gave its orientation in one of the sessions of this course.

II. Assembly of the Purified Proteins using Various Assembly Buffer Conditions
Purpose: To optimize gag VLP assembly and determine if assembly is favorable under acidic or basic conditions and to determine the effect of having a 8X His-tag on VLP Assembly.
Attributions: John Banasihan followed a modified version of Ryan’s protocol on VLP assembly and created an assay that tested the tagged and untagged Capsid only protein (Construct 3a).
Materials and Methods: A 200 ml induction was performed for construct 3a (HisTEV-CA2). The inclusion bodies were purified according to standard protocol without lysozyme. The proteins were separated for further His-cleavage. For the tagged proteins, a buffer exchange was immediately performed to suspend the proteins in the three different VLP buffers, acidic, neutral, and basic. The proteins selected for His cleavage were dialyzed with non-denaturing wash buffer and then cleaved with AcTEV protease overnight. The cleaved proteins were then dialyzed with the three different VLP buffers. All protein concentration were determined via nanodrop and 100 ng from each protein would be used for VLP assembly.
VLP Assembly reactions would contain 100 ng of each protein, 20 mM DTT, 200 mM MgCl2, and the protein’s VLP assembly buffer to"
Penn,2013,Team:Penn State#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM served as a crash course in plant and synthetic biology. Although difficult at first, it has proven to be a rewarding experience for her.  As part of the iGEM team she worked on the vanillin project and human practices. Outside of iGEM, she is a home body that enjoys reading, the cinema and spending time with family and friends.
Phillip Cygan
As a man of intelligence and drive, Philip joined iGEM this year for the first time. Going into his Senior year at Penn State, Phil is a Mathematics Education Major, planning to educate high school students in the complex ideas of mathematics and all it has to offer. Philip is involved in Penn State through many organizations and sports, leading a very active lifestyle. As an active student, he decided to try iGEM, even with a very small background, and is working on the Cas9 project and learning more than he imagined he could. He has become a lab rat, spending nearly everyday in lab, working on this project. Phil, not just a student in Math and Education, but a student in synthetic biology now too!
Sam Ewell
Sam just finished his third year of Biomedical Engineering at Penn State. His studies have focused on human biology, so iGEM has been a good opportunity for him to explore plant biology as well. During the summer he helped with the website and the butanol project, but his main focus was running our plant nursery. In order to test all these different ideas we needed a small army of plants and he made sure they grew up to be strong little soldiers. When not studying or caring for plants, he enjoys being the best.
Stephanie Everhart
Stephanie, going into her junior year at Penn State, is a Secondary Education Major in the chemistry option. She hopes to one day become a high school chemistry teacher that can inspire more students to pursue a future in science.  iGEM has given her the opportunity to explore different facets of science, which has proved very rewarding. As part of the iGEM team, Stephanie has focused her efforts on the education outreach aspect of the Human Practices component. Outside of iGEM, Stephanie enjoys running, hiking and indulging in a good movie. In addition, she is a strong advocate for military appreciation as the president of the Dear Hero Program, a student run group on campus that sends letters and care packages to troops overseas.

[ edit ] Friday
Primers for mutagenesis have arrived
We used the DNA parts from the second PCR to insert them into a TOPO-vector. The second PCR showed more results so that is why we used these fragments.
LBmedium was made with X-gal to select cells afterwards.
Plasmids were inserted in competent cells by heatshock and those cells were plated out on the X-gal medium.
Week 6: 10 August 2009 - 16 August 2009
[ edit ] Monday
There was no result from our setup on Friday. We think there was an error with the protocol because we didn't shake before incubation. So we did a new transformation of every gene.
[ edit ] Tuesday
We also received another strain of Agrobacterium. We brought this new strain in culture.
To make things clear the genes from the first Agrobacterium will from now on be called A,B,G and R for respectively virA, promotor region virB , virG and rpoA. For the second Agrobacterium we will use W,X,Y and Z to indicate the same genes.
We achieved good results for genes B,G and R. There were clear white colonies after plating the competent cells with the TOPO vector on X-gal agar plates with ampicillin. We isolated the good colonies again.
There was no result for A. This was probably due to a fault with the competent cells. So we started TOPO transformation by heatshock all over for A.
[ edit ] Wednesday
B,G and R were stored for further procedure. A failed again: there was no visible growth. This second time there was no problem with the competent cells because we used a commercial product instead of a self made. We assumed there was a problem with adding the polyA-tails to the PCR product because, when redoing the gelelectrophoresis, there were no errors with the PCR product.
We did a new PCR on the bacteria with the inserted plasmids for B,G and R to check if the gene was inserted correctly.
PCR was performed for W,X,Y and Z to isolate the genes.

DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," for high schools. According to their regulations ( Danish version here ), highschool students are not allowed to modify plasmids. They are allowed to work with E. coli K12 strains and transform them with antibiotic resistance plasmids and test there transformants, but they are not allowed to purify the plasmid for the purpose on re-introducing it into E. coli or modify it. This means that while Danish high schools would be allowed to receive the iGEM Parts Distribution and transform the parts into E. coli, they are not allowed to modify the plasmid.
In addition to the regulations, materials propose a problem as not all high schools have access to standard molecular biology lab equipment such as: PCR machine, gel electrophoresis, and centrifuge.
Last the cost of restriction enzymes, ligases, competent cells, and other reagents is a limiting factor for the possibility of high schools to engage in iGEM.
Solutions
In order to achive these solutions, we teamed up with Biotech Academy, which is a student-run non-profit organisation that provides free learning materials in biotechnology for high schools and middle schools.
The goal is to send up to a 100 purified plasmids from the BioBrick Registry in quantities that can be used for cloning out to up to 200 highschools. By sending out selected BioBricks in enough quantities to do restriction based cloning, we would make it possible for high school students to make their own BioBrick for the first time. In addition, we ensure that the biobricks they would receive and work with are in compliance with the rules from the Ministry of Education.
In addition, the shipment of BioBricks would also include the standard iGEM restriction enzymes (EcoRI, PstI, XbaI, and SpeI) and DNA ligase. Biotech Academy received so far 70,000 DKK from the Lundbeck Foundation for costs associated with development of the project.
It was our goal that high schools would not be limited by lack of equipment. The project was designed so that it can be done without any special equipment. By using 3A assembly and digesting the two BioBricks with different restriction enzymes, it is possible to achieve this omitting the need to do PCR or gel extraction. Since antibiotic resistance is a concern to the Danish Ministry of Education, we designed the experiment to only contain two plasmids and one antibiotic resistance marker. We tested it and saw that in 1/2 the cases the two BioBricks were ligated correctly, when they were digested for"

Results [1,2]
Each cell population, which represents different time range of the monitoring, has been subjected to an annexin V assay at the instant looked for. Unfortunately, a wrong dilution of the annexin buffer caused the death of each cell population during the test. Even if results were convincing for the monitoring at +24h, +30h and +48h by simple comparison between the control and the test population in the microscope (figure 1), we could not confirm it by cytometric analysis.
Figure 1 : cells morphology with or without p53 wild-type incorporation
Because we could only start DU-145 culture at the beginning of October, the two weeks needed to reach the necessary confluence did not let us to try a second experiment.
However, several studies showed that to bring p53 wild type into tumor mutated cells launch the apoptosis process. It is notably the case of the study leaded by Chunlin Yang in 1995, who was working, like us, on mutated p53 prostatic cancer cells (Tsu-pr1). The p53 wild type were not transfected by electroporation but by infecting tumor cells by non replicatives adenoviruses containing p53wt (AdCMV.p53). 48 hours after the infection of a tumor population with AdCMV.p53, a high expression of p53 is correlated with an important rate of cell death. If control populations (non-infected cells and cells infected with adenovirus containing lacZ gene, AdCMV.NLSßgal) show a similar and healthy morphology, condensation and cell detachment are observed in p53 infected population. To check if the death process followed by cells correspond to the apoptotic way, a migration on agar gel of their genome has been realized.
Figure 2 : Electrophoresis on agar gel of isolated non-infected DNA cells (a), infected by AdCMV.NLSßgal (b) and AdCMV.p53 (c).
Infected by AdCMV.p53, cells show multiple bands (laddering pattern) while non-infected cells or AdCMV.NLSßgal infected cells show a unique one at high molecular weight. These results indicate that the cell induced by p53 wild type is from apoptotic origin by the genome fragmentation observation, consequence to the CAD (Caspase Activated DNase) activity, a specific endonuclease of the apoptotic process.

If we assume that the production rates of vanillin and cinnamaldehyde equal during growth without phage, then we expect the product formation curves to separate with increasing MOI. Figure 5 shows that our model, run at two different MOI's (two orders of magnitude apart), predicts the qualitative trends we were expecting to see.
Figure 5 - Theoretical product formations based on co-culture dynamics.
Probabilistic Model
For the probabilistic simulation of co-cultures we utilized the cell programming language gro, which was developed by the Klavins Lab at the University of Washington [2]. The model considers two strains of bacteria on a two-dimensional plane under attack of one virus. One strain (green) contains a specific spacer element for the ""control"" phage and is granted immunity, whereas the other strain (yellow) is susceptible to phage infection. In the simulation, susceptible bacteria entering regions with high phage concentrations are very likely to become infected and upon lysis increase the phage concentration of that region. Below is a timeseries illustrating the control of susceptible cells with phage addition over the course of one batch cycle. Here, the amount of viable susceptible cells remaining over time can be controlled by adjusting the starting phage-to-bacteria ratio, allowing for optimal product formation.
The video of the above simulation is presented below:

The Importance of Collaboration
The iGEM Competition stresses the importance of collaborations between scientists and encourages teams to significantly collaborate with one or more iGEM teams. Collaboration is an important component of scientific research in general, as it teaches will-be scientists to exchange ideas and assist others in their innovations. Our team has collaborated with several iGEM teams as well as a team of undergraduate researchers outside of the iGEM Competition.
University of Minnesota (UM) iGEM Team
Our collaboration with the University of Minnesota (UM) iGEM team began when four UCSC team members Skyped with two members of the UM team. During the meeting, we exchanged information about our projects and our progress on them, and we noticed that the human practices portion of UM’s project was lacking; with our strong background in outreach and human practices, we helped UM develop their own. Four of our iGEM team members met the UM team at their lab in Minnesota. When talking with them, we realized that their project had much more potential value than they were aiming for; we advised their team to reach out to areas affected by their project target (mercury ion pollution), and to speak with  environmental regulatory groups in Minnesota to gain insight about potential users. We also suggested they start a crowdfunding campaign so their entire team can attend the Jamboree in Boston, since they had not considered that to be an option. We believe we significantly helped the UM team by mentoring them in these various aspects of their project.
iGEM Team in Montpellier, France
We discovered an iGEM team in Montpellier, France through the iGEM Troubleshooting & Collaborations Facebook page created by iGEM Thessaloniki. Their project, Vagineering, aims to create a non-hormonal contraceptive. Our projects both address inadequate access to contraception, so we were interested in collaborating with them. UCSC team members Skyped with the Montpellier members and discussed our projects and progress. We suggested that the Montpellier team spend more time developing"

3. What legal requirements do I have to fulfil in order to be able to use GMMs in my business?
In order to use a GMM in your business, one needs to fulfill numerous requirements. The development of any GMM must be monitored by the CTNBio and the regulatory agencies. If your company is going to start working with GMM, the first step is getting the Certified of Biosafety by CTNBio and create an internal committee of biosafety. Then, you need the approval by the regulatory agency (e.g. Anvisa for human purposes and the MAPA for agriculture purposes). You are going to need to fulfill a lot of requirements in order to get the registry and the permission to develop your research in your lab.
For agriculture purposes, once you have finished your research inside the lab, the CTNBio will evaluate it and emit a position paper that will allow you to do a planned and controlled release. To do that, you are going to need to fulfill the requirements of the Normative Resolution n. 6 of November 6th, 2008.
For medical purposes, once you finished your research inside the lab, you are going to need to ask Anvisa for a registry of biological medication and you are going to need to fulfill all of the requirements stared in the Resolution n. 55 of December 16th, 2010.
Once your product is registered and approved by CTNBio and MAPA or Anvisa, you will be able to release and/or commercialize it.
4. As an employer who exposes their workers to biological agents, what safety measures am I obliged to adopt?
There are no rules regarding specifically the exposure to biological agents; the employers must monitor the exposure levels under the same rules for other substances (Act 3214/1978).
5. As a consumer, how do I know if a product I want to buy contains GMOs?
Currently, if the product is made of a GMMs plant/seed or if the final product contains any traces of a GMM used as an ingredient, the package must have a symbol “T” of transgenic (figure below) on its package and the words “This product contains [name of the organism] transgenic.” However, the Congress and the Senate are currently voting on a project that modifies this law to remove the “"

Today we ran our digested CRO insert on the low melt gel, and under the UV light we saw the band we were looking for. Clarisse excised the band and we performed a ligation reaction according to the protocol and using the vector that we had already run on a low-melt gel last Thursday. After incubating for 30 minutes at room temperature, we performed a transformation into DH5alpha. The selectable marker of pLAT is ampicillin.
We ran our low melt gel with our Cro insert. After 45 minutes, we put the gel under UV light and cut out the insert. We then performed a ligation of our vector and cro insert. After 30 min, we did a transformation and inserted our newly ligated plasmid into DH5alpha.

(Thursday) When we dropped by today two of our plates (out of four) were contaminated. The two contaminated plates, we noticed, were the two plates that were old. The other two plates had a few colonies, but the was not a significantly greater number of colonies in our plasmid + insert + E.Coli plate than there were in our control plasmid + E.Coli plate. Kelton went ahead and streaked the few colonies we had to singles. We can PCR-verify if any of them have the plasmid. Meanwhile I am going to redo the transformation today. I will plate 4 plates: one 50 microL test, one 100 microL test, one 50 microL control, and one "

Der var så dejligt ude på landet; det var sommer, kornet stod gult, havren grøn, høet var rejst i stakke nede i de grønne enge, og der gik storken på sine lange, røde ben og snakkede ægyptisk, for det sprog havde han lært af sin moder. Rundt om ager og eng var der store skove, og midt i skovene dybe søer; jo, der var rigtignok dejligt derude på landet! Midt i solskinnet lå der en gammel herregård med dybe kanaler rundt om, og fra muren og ned til vandet voksede store skræppeblade, der var så høje, at små børn kunne stå oprejste under de største; der var lige så vildsomt derinde, som i den tykkeste skov, og her lå en and på sin rede; hun skulle ruge sine små ællinger ud, men nu var hun næsten ked af det, fordi det varede så længe, og hun sjælden fik visit; de andre ænder holdt mere af at svømme om i kanalerne, end at løbe op og sidde under et skræppeblad for at snadre med hende.  Endelig knagede det ene æg efter det andet: “pip! pip!” sagde det, alle æggeblommerne var blevet levende og stak hovedet ud.  “Rap! rap!” sagde hun, og så rappede de sig alt hvad de kunne, og så til alle sider under de grønne blade, og moderen lod dem se så meget de ville, for det grønne er godt for øjnene.  “Hvor dog verden er stor!” sagde alle ungerne; thi de havde nu rigtignok ganske anderledes plads, end da de lå inde i ægget.

The government of the United States of America is the federal government of the republic of fifty states that constitute the United States, as well as one capital district, and several other territories. The federal government is composed of three distinct branches: legislative, executive, and judicial, whose powers are vested by the U.S. Constitution in the Congress, the President, and the federal courts, including the Supreme Court, respectively. The powers and duties of these branches are further defined by acts of Congress, including the creation of executive departments and courts inferior to the Supreme Court.

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."

We used MonoQ chromatography to polish the fusion and remove any remaining contaminants. The fusion eluted in a broad peak (figure 15, lane 6-14) from the resin, however the fractions are relatively pure and the dxCas9 contamination was mostly eliminated.
Figure 15. 8% SDS PAGE of MonoQ chromatography of fusion (expected size 214.7kDa). Lane 1 molecular ladder (kDa), lane 2 starting material, lane 3 flow through, lane 4 wash, lane 5 elution 1, lane 6 elution 2, lane 7 elution 3, lane 8 elution 4, lane 9 elution 5, lane 10 elution 6, lane 11 elution 7, lane 12 elution 8, lane 13 elution 9, lane 14 elution 10, lane 15 elution 11.
We also evaluated nickel affinity chromatography, however we experienced a lot of difficulty binding the HIS tag to the nickel beads. Majority of the fusion was detected in the flow through and detailed results can be found in our notebook. Additionally, the complete upstream and downstream process for Tn5 transposase (BBa_K2643002), dxCas9 (BBa_K2643001) and dxCas9-Tn5 fusion (BBa_K2643002) is documented in detail on the biobrick registry.
3.3 Fusion Protein In Vivo Functionality Test
Design: To visualize in vivo whether a donor DNA sequence can be integrated close to a target sequence, we built a strain that harbors the dxCas9-Tn5 fusion protein (BBa_K2643000), as well as a lacZ gRNA expression cassette (BBa_K2643010). The cell is electroporated with a kanamycin resistance cassette flanked by MEs (BBa_K2643011), which can be recognized by the Tn5 transposase domain for cut and paste integration near the gRNA target. This disrupts the lacZ gene and renders beta-galactosidase catalytically inactive, which can be visualized by blue/white screening with X-gal. In parallel, we have electroporated an E. coli strain that only harbors the Tn5 transposase for comparison with untargeted integration.

440-f and 1333-r
947-f and pSB3K1-ext-r
The protocol asked for a 25 uL aliquot with
2.5 uL Thermo Pol buffer (TPB)
0.5 uL dNTP
0.5 uL primer 1
0.5 uL primer 2
1 uL plasmid
0.25 uL TAQ
He went on to transform the non-randomer RFP minipreps and the T7-const-c2/c11, lac1, and lac2 3 constructs into BL21 cells This was followed by the production of a 96 round-bottom well plate with 100 uL of LB with 1 uL of Kan. Twelve colonies from each plate were chosen and swirled into the individual wells. This plate was put on a shaker overnight (after having been sealed with the Easy-Breathe adhesive paper).
Thursday, 8 September 2011
Sequencing of T7-const-C2 returned the correct sequence, as did the Control PCR, so it seems that the lysis cassette has found its way into the T7-const-C2!
On the other hand, sequencing results for pSB TetR-LacI show that the Ptet promoter before LacI is mutated: we have 3 deletions and one mismatch. The deletions are in the two binding sites of TetR, probably preventing TetR action on the promoter. This can then explain why we had a low RFP expression in the paltereader for the pSB TetR-LacI + J6 Plac-RFP cotransformation: we thought Pconst was too weak, leading to a too big LacI expression, but actually the problem was that TetR couldn't repress well LacI. Nadine made liquid cultures of J61002 Ptet-RFP because we were running out of DNA. We want to send it for sequencing, to be sure that in this plasmid Ptet is OK - although the experiments suggest that yes. She also made liquid cultures of the successful ligations (see yesterday's results) in order to sequence-verify them afterwards.

From a biological point of view, arginine constitutes about 5% of proteins in E. coli and  is an important element of many processes (1)(for more details on biology of arginine please visit our project website . We chose to model the arginine part of the project because the dynamics of the inhibitory feedback loop and the effects of its perturbation are hard to intuitively predict based just on the knowledge of the pathway, but at the same time are not hard to model. This model was intended to help us to formalise analysis of the"

Modeling Interactions Between 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACCD) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC)
Introduction

1TYZ Strutural Modeling Using PYMOL
Homologous Alignment Modeling
Introduction
1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase is a pyridoxal 5’ phosphate (PLP) dependent enzyme that catalyzes the chemical conversion of  1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate,  the immediate precursor of ethylene synthesis in plants, and water to ɑ-ketobutyrate + ammonia. Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate  and water, and its two products are ketobutyric acid and ammonia (1). This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolyses, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in compounds that have not been otherwise categorized within EC number 3.5.
Figure 1: A visual representation of the ACC deaminase catalyzed reaction.
ACC is emitted from seeds or plant roots and then metabolized by bacteria expressing ACC deaminase activity, which stimulates plant ACC outflow, decreasing the root ACC concentration and root ethylene evolution and increasing root growth. The widespread of ACC deaminase activity has been noted in several Burkholderia species. The common association of these species with plants suggests that this genus could be a major contributor to plant growth under natural conditions. From this perspective, the approach of reducing the production of ethylene levels in plants by increasing the activity of ACC deaminase may be an effective strategy to improve plant growth under a variety of stressful conditions, such as flooding, high saline conditions, and drought. In this work we investigated the kinetic properties of ACC deaminase, structural properties including ways to mutate residues surrounding the cofactor Pyridoxal Phosphate binding site, and ultimately used modeling to determine which homolog of ACC deaminase"

Conclusion
PUF Tethering Conclusion:
After trying to optimize and tether PUF to cCFP several times, it was concluded that the tethering primers need to be changed. In Fig. 4 amplification of both PUF and cCFP was attempted before actual tethering and the result seen was primer dimers. Even after a gradient of temperatures, different PCR buffers, and primer concentrations were used, the result stayed the same. This showed that the problem laid in the primer sequences themselves.
Due to the difficulty of tethering two proteins together through a linker sequence and a shortage of time, it was decided upon that PUF (WT & 6-2/7-2) bound to split-fluorescent proteins would be sent for synthesis by a company. Split-GFP tethered to the PUF proteins was sent for GenScript to synthesize, however, only one construct was successfully produced. The production of the second construct was halted after numerous tries and thus, planned in vivo and in vitro tests were omitted due to the lack of both parts.
RNA Scaffold Data:
In order to start the endonuclease assay mentioned in the design portion, a few necessary components needed to be collected. Both WT & 6-2/7-2 PUF-PIN were purified by Ni-NTA columns and then quantified through BCA analysis. Although the BCA analysis gave quantitative numbers, the SDS-PAGE gel showed large amounts of impurities in the elution fractions. Therefore, the concentrations determined by the BCA analysis should be taken as approximate due to the actual purity of the desired proteins being roughly 30-40%. Even though the purity of the proteins is sub-optimal, the RNA endonuclease enzymes used have multiple turnover, meaning they could cleave multiple RNA strands rather than cleaving one and ending the reaction. Before the endonuclease assay could be ran the RNA scaffold designed needed to be synthesized which was done through in-vitro transcription with the Invitrogen MEGAscript® T7 Kit. The expected length of the scaffold is 126bp and the NEB ssRNA ladder showed homology with the 150bp band. However, with presence of only one band and approximate length homology, it can be concluded that the expected scaffold construct was produced.
The preliminary endonuclease assay in Fig. 6 showed promising results. Although there are many variables which need to be optimized, there was cleavage of the scaffold seen most distinctly in wells with WT PUF-PIN and"

Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)
Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease that leads to deformity and destruction of joints by bone and cartilage erosion. It is estimated that 1% to 3% of the world population is affected, being most common in developing countries. This disease affects about two to three times more women, aged between 30-50 years, with peak incidence in the fifth decade of life (Alamanos & Drosos, 2005; Mota et al., 2012). In Brazil, the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis in adults ranges from 0.2% to 1%, corresponding to an estimated 1.3 million people affected (Alamanos et al., 2006; Ferraz & Ciconelli, 2003; Woolf & Pfleger, 2003; Laurindo et al., 2002; ACR Clinical Guidelins, 1996; Symmons et al., 1994; Marques Neto et al., 1993).
In 2007, RA was the fourth largest budgetary impact disease, consuming 10.4% of the resources (Carias et al., 2011). Studies have shown that the biological disease-modifying drugs have ongoing high cost, and the annual cost of treatment per patient estimated between € 13,500 (US$ 15,296.01) and € 15,000 (US$ 16,995.56; Hoebert  et al., 2012). In Brazil, a 48-month course of treatment with conventional regimen followed by biological costs R$ 1,701,286.76 (US$ 438803,94; Monteiro & Zanini, 2008), and the cost of six months of treatment with infliximab is R$ 19,698.00 (US$ 5,080.60; Venson et al., 2011).
The mortality rate of patients with RA is higher than in normal population, and life expectancy decreases according to the severity of the disease and when it started ( http://www.artritereumatoide.com.br/artrite-reumatoide/#epidemiologia ).
Inflammatory macrophages are central cells to the pathophysiology of disease due to their prominent numbers in the inflamed synovial membrane and at cartilage-pannus junction, their clear activation status and their response to successful anti-rheumatic treatment.

It’s win number two for the University of Lethbridge student researcher/entrepreneurs who form the Synbiologica Ltd. team.
CEO Isaac Ward (3rd year, Neuroscience), first-year Biochemistry student Erin Kelly and Chemistry and Biochemistry masters students Mackenzie Coatham and Harland Brandon have developed a new method of detecting hormones, and are in the process of patenting their idea.
Their proposed biomedical device technology -- called “Biologically Enhanced Assay in Real-Time” -- is expected to bring next-generation hormone detection to the research, agriculture and medical markets.
In addition to winning $10,000 in the SouthVenture Business Plan Competition in March, the group recently took first place in the Tech Stream side of the Chinook Entrepreneurial Challenge, an annual business planning competition hosted by Community Futures Lethbridge Region.
They received another $10,000 in cash, a one-year lease on space in the tecconnect -- An Alberta centre for New Commerce -- a high-tech business incubator operated by Economic Development Lethbridge -- plus a host of other in-kind prizes including business consulting from MNP and ActionCOACH, and several thousand dollars worth of media services.
“I am extremely proud of the Synbiologica group for their achievements and wish them continued success,” said Dr. Dan Weeks, the U of L’s Vice-President (Research).
“The U of L is a comprehensive research institution that offers significant research opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students. This approach is important as it equips our graduates with the knowledge and ability to thrive in their research and entrepreneurial careers.”
The competition evaluates and awards business plans submitted by entrepreneurs who have taken advantage of the free business training provided by Community Futures across Southern Alberta. Finalists were chosen from 24 groups that submitted business plans for the challenge.
While he has to be a bit cautious about revealing details because of the patent process – an expected six to eight-month timeline -- Ward said their idea will significantly improve the way in which hormones are detected.
“Hormones – and hormone imbalances -- play very important roles in understanding behaviour and mental health, pregnancy as well as development and aging of all populations,” Ward said.
“We are pursuing new technology for the detection of hormones that provides rapid results that are 93 per cent more cost effective than traditional antibody technology.”
The team’s market analysis showed diverse applications and projections for growth, with a two to three-year timeline to produce a marketable device. The first test runs of"

Our Records
Although we are very interested in ""bioclock"", what to do in this iGEM project was really difficult to decide. After discussing and searching paper for few months, we finally decided to make ""UV induced oscillator"", as described on the Project page. The oscillator was based on the previous work, the switching device was added to control the oscillator as we want. As we were not quite sure whether this circuit really work, so we decided to analyze it in silico, by modeling.
Detailed experimental plan was settled near the end of July. Since the promoter of the oscillatory device was synthesized products and unavailable from any oforganism, we had it synthesized. It took almost a month until we receive the DNA!!
When making the oscillator, we needed the plasmid vector of p15A origin which has low copy numbers and ColE1 origin of high copy numbers in E.coli cells, as strict control of the total protein amount was required. Among iGEM parts, pSB3K3 plasmid vector had the p15A origin and BBa_J63010 had ColE1 origin.
ColE1 origin plasmid were successfully cloned from 2009 Spring Kit Plate1, 7D. Meanwhile, the cloning of p15A ori plasmid was somehow of extreme difficulty. The first parts we choose to clone was 2009 Spring Kit Plate1, 7M and start to clone it from August 6, but never had it been available. After numerous unfruitful trials, we gave up and decided to get it from 2009 Spring Kit Plate3, 21D on September 24, but this parts neither couldn't be cloned. Finally, Chiba team gave us the BBa_I7100 parts, and now we were able to use it. Come to think of it, it took so long to change our plan of what part to be cloned. It was perhaps due to the difficulty of sharing information. Since we are on four project at the same time, it was very hard for each member to fully catch up with all the experiments ongoing.
Other genes are also cloned after numerous failures. Although wiki freezes on 21 October, we are still trying to complete our experiments. You will see whether we can succeed or not at the Jamboree!!

Molecular approach
Expression of the TEV protease is induced by 3-oxo-C12-HSL. The protease cleaves the GFP-REACh fusion protein to elicit a fluorescence response.
Modeling Flowchart
For our two-dimensional biosensor, we thought of different methods to generate a faster and stronger fluorescence response from weak promoters. In our molecular approach (left) to detect P. aeruginosa, a fusion protein of GFP and the dark quencher is cleaved by the highly specific TEV protease which is introduced behind the weak quorum sensing promoter.
To validate our hypothesis, we developed a model of our molecular approach using the CAD tool TinkerCell (Chandran, Bergmann and Sauro, 2009).
Model of our molecular approach in TinkerCell (A) and the output over time (B)
The molecular setup of the novel 3-oxo-C12-HSL inducible biosensor (A) yields results indicating a strong and fast fluorescence output after induction (B). A directly inducible system was modeled and added to the plot for comparison.
In the figure displayed above, we compare the response time of the fluorescence signal between our theoretical system and a traditional biosensor, we included a direct expression of GFP in the same plot. In the results shown above, the strength of the promoter used for the direct GFP expression (traditional approach) is twice as high as the strength of the promoter upstream of the TEV coding sequence in our new approach. Despite a weaker promoter, a higher GFP concentration is generated in the model of the novel biosensor, predicting a quicker response time of our system.
The model predicted that our approach should be an improvement over the commonly used direct expression, so we"

UT-Tokyo,2016,Team:UT-Tokyo#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," in activating the sigma11 promoter. However, when its functionality was tested previously, by iGEM-UT Tokyo 2014, the results suggested that the anti sigma 11 was not able to repress the activity of ECF 11. It was hypothesised that anti sigma11 not functioning due to “ the sigma factors [were] expressed more than the anti-sigma factors could repress their activation of the corresponding promoters.” Thus, we attempted a new characterisation this time ligating anti 11 on a high copy plasmid and ECF sigma11 on a low copy plasmid in order to increase the level of anti 11 relative to sigma11.
The figures below show the result of our characterisation and the previous characterisation of anti 11 done by UT-Tokyo 2014.
Figure 8. Functionality assay of anti 11 by increasing concentration of anti11 relative to sigma11.
Instead of generating sigma11 on backbone pSB1C3 as done in by iGEM UT-Tokyo 2014, sigma 11 was generated on backbone pSB3K3 and anti11 in pSB1C3 as an attempted to increase the level of anti11 relative to sigma11. The measurement shows that there is a significant level of difference between the anti sigma 11(-) construct and antisigma 11 (+).  However, the difference between the complete OFF state (without sigma) and with anti 11 state is also very significant.  Data represents an average of 3 samples with error bars representing the standard deviation.
From figure 6 above, it can be suggested that anti sigma11 can function to inhibit the activity of sigma11 as the fluorescence output from the sigma 11 promoter was significantly reduced in presence of anti11. Nevertheless, the anti sigma11 is not strong enough to function as a “switch” that can turn the promoter back to the state when there is no ECF sigma11 present.

Industry Representative
    We also reached out to a biotech company in Canada to receive an industrial perspective on the uses of our project. After explaining our project to the representative, he gave us advice on where to find resources to help develop our project. Following that discussion, we talked about applications of optogenetic systems, co-culture systems, and finally applications where the two ideas are combined. A notable application that was proposed was the use of co-cultures to study fungal infections. Even in vitro, it is difficult to study the function of the fungus, so our optogenetic system can be used to slow down the growth of the fungus. This idea was further explore in the Project Application.
Project Applications
    The use of optogenetics to maintain a stable and tunable co-culture is a very powerful tool that opens up many doors in both industry and research. To explore some of these doors, we looked to industry leaders and professionals from different fields of biology for inspiration on how they envisioned the world (including their own work) could benefit from the use of a controllable co-culture system. By combining our own imagination with their ideas, our team has outlined a series of project applications that can help propel various aspects of industry and research.
Application: Production of Functionalized Taxanes for Chemotherapy
    Taxane therapy is a form of chemotherapy that has dramatically increased the survival rate of breast cancer patients over the last few decades. This drug is able to inhibit mitosis and interferes with microtubules in a cell, which has been proven to be an effective treatment for cancer cells. The production of taxane has a complex pathway, however, by using a co-culture of E. coli and S. cerevisiae. Their unique properties and functions can be exploited to create optimal environments for different steps of the pathway. E. coli, known for its high growth rate, can be engineered to produce large amounts of taxadiene, which is one of the intermediate products in the production of taxanes. S. cerevisiae, known for having advanced protein expression machinery, is a more suitable host for expressing cytochrome P450, which is an enzyme that functionalizes taxadiene through the catalysis of multiple oxygenation reactions. Currently, the co-cultures are maintained by using a media that only contains xylose as a carbon source, which is used by E.coli and not S.cerevisiae. As xylose is metabolized by E.coli, it produces acetate which perturbs the growth of E.coli, but acts as the carbon source"

Balancing Life and iGEM
""Time is our most precious resource"" - Unknown
The biggest challenge for iGEM, in our opinion, is the limited amount of time you have to take your project from inception to completion. There are deadlines upon deadlines and if you do not keep on top of all of them, you may just ruin your chances to achieve that gold medal! For our team, and for all the teams we have spoken to, the months leading up to iGEM are very stressful times. Time management is probably one of the most important skills you can have (or will shortly learn) for this competition. Learning to balance your day to day activities while still meeting all the set deadlines is a daunting task but it is not impossible. By learning to balance your time effectively throughout the summer (or however long you have to work on iGEM), you can get through all the deadlines and stresses with little to no physical or mental health repercussions.
Some tips from Team NAIT’s experiences:
Plan and Prioritize – make a list and a set of milestones for your team to achieve every week throughout the summer. These milestones do not have to be set in stone, but know which ones are more important than others and get them done. Ensure everyone on the team knows when these milestones should be completed. Even team members who are not in lab everyday should know when the work they need to do has to be submitted.
Take it one day at a time – Becoming overwhelmed by the amount of work that needs to be done is quite common in the iGEM competition. However, do not let the fear of failure paralyze you and prevent you from starting. There is only so many times you can repeat that concentration calculation! Work on a little bit of the work every day and before you know it, your milestone will have been met.
Know your limitations – You’re competing in the iGEM competition so that means you must be at the top of your class… but unfortunately, no one person can do this competition alone. If your team mate can finish the task at hand twice as fast, perhaps you"

a) Respecting Societal Values: Lots of people think that life is God given. There are three criteria for when we allow human intervention in life: i) necessary, ii) safe, iii) understood consequences.
b) Animal Rights: people feel empathy for animals and kinship with them – we are not just out to be the best species. Experiments on animals must be necessary and reduce harms to humans. Unfettered experimentation does not fit this criteria.
c) What is human? Experiments like growing human organs in pigs make us question what it means to be human. This is a question society may not be ready to address.

Refutation:
Re: what is human: humans are genetic code and that’s it.
Re: criteria for when meddling with life is acceptable:
i) necessary: see argument 1
ii) safe: this was addressed by the first two speakers – there would still be consequences to deter harmful creations, ex: the FDA looks for toxic side effects.
iii) understandable – science never is, and that hasn’t stopped us, because science is necessary.
Re: respecting the natural order: why should we?
Re: cross breeding organisms is more reliable: genetics is just moving a gene from one organism to another, there are only a few possible effects. Often, genetic engineering isn’t actually introducing genes, but knocking them out to study their relationships.
Argument:
1)What is science? There are two kinds of science – methodical science and leaps-and-bounds science, and the latter has lead to many great discoveries (ex: PCR). We need faster scientific progress now, as through leaps-and-bounds. The need for faster science is due in part to population growth – we expanded our food supply once through developing fertilizers and pesticides, but we need to expand its gain by developing better plants. As genetic technologies are becoming increasingly accessible, we also need research to progress quickly to stay a step ahead of people using science for malicious purposes. Moreover, we need science to stay ahead of pest and bacterial evolution, to speed up seasonal flu vaccine production, etc.

METU_HS_Ankara,2018,Team:METU HS Ankara#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," century in the West (Herzog et al., 2001).              Despite its potential, the costs exceed the supply by a fair margin; initial costs are astronomical and maintaining them              are troublesome. Also, the harm it induces on the environment is undeniable; because wide bodies of land are required for              them to work, they inevitably intersect wild life, and its acoustics make it impossible to incorporate it to urban settings;              which ruin the acoustics, endangering species of birds.
Hydro-Energy uses the kinetic energy of water and has the largest capacity among renewable energy sources. (Herzog et al., 2001)              However, despite it does not involve fossil fuels, its effects on the environment aren’t that much better; defeating the purpose.              (Herzog et al., 200) The need to make space for mechanisms involves flooding the water mass, which wrecks the aquatic life,              devastated water quality, reduce dam efficiency because of sedimentation and waterborne diseases along with the need to displace              native residents. (Herzog et al., 2001) Not to mention; the initial costs are colossal. (Herzog et al., 2001)
Energy derived from natural heat within the earth, better known as geothermal energy, is another conventional renewable energy.              (Herzog et al., 2001) It is inexhaustible; only 1% of the heat in the uppermost 10 km's of earth's crust is 500 times all the oil              and gas we have. (Herzog et al., 2001) Yet, this energy is distributed unevenly, rarely concentrated and often too deep to be viable,              making it less than optimal. Also, it's associated with the release of toxic substances like hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, mercury, radon,              and boron, although it's a minor concern. (Herzog et al., 2001)
Solar energy, energy from the sun with the use of solar panels, are seemingly viable since the sunlight falls on earth in one hour              is alleged to meet world’s energy demands for a year. (Aster, 2012) However, its disadvantages make it less than optimal; it not              being available everywhere year-round, it's incredibly astronomical prices, it requiring an AC inverter to be usable in daily life,              not meeting demand in terms of heat, taking up large spaces with low efficiency are to name a few. (Aster, 2012) All of which are major              deal breakers; not many"
DTU-Denmark-2,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#results#background_-_-_TEXT.html," interest (GOI) to be inserted into the MCS is therefore required to hold restriction sites compatible with the expression vector. The insertion of the GOI is achieved by digestion and ligation and this classical cloning method can be quite cumbersome. Furthermore, the integration of the gene of interest in the expression vector by restriction enzymes and ligases can have a low efficiency as well as provide a high number of false-positive transformants (6).
Filamentous Fungi
Fungi are a diverse group of organisms, whose biological activities affect our daily life in many ways. The filamentous fungi are in particular of great importance in production of medicine, in the industry, in agriculture, and in basic biological research. Filamentous fungi produce a diverse array of secondary metabolites, which are of interest in the pharmaceutical sciences as a prolific source of chemical compounds for the development of new drugs. Some of the filamentous fungal species are pathogenic to humans, whereas others have great value in the production of antibiotics such as penicillin. Fungi are therefore of great importance for the industry as well as for our daily life.
Growth of filamentous fungi
Under the right conditions, the vegetative growth of filamentous fungi starts with the germination of a spore. The spore germination leads to formation of hyphae (7). A fungal hyphae is a long tubular modular structure composed of individual cells (8). Hyphae extend only at their tips and are typically divided into individual cellular compartments by the formation of septa as shown in the figure below (9).
Filamentous fungi grow by the polar extension of hyphae and multiply by branching (10). The branched hyphae form a network of interconnected cells called a mycelium (7). The mycelium forms a radially symmetric colony that expands over a large area until growth is limited by for example lack of nutrients (7,11). The fungal mycelium appears to be a formless collection of corresponding vegetative cells. However, the various cells within the mycelium interact to form an ordered network with different hyphae or cells playing distinct roles in the acquirement of nutrients from the environment (7).
Aspergillus nidulans
The filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans is a model organism, and in contrast to most other aspergilla it has a well characterized sexual cycle and a well-developed genetic tools for manipulation (9,12). Furthermore, in A. nidulans the parasexual cycle has been extensively utilized. Parasexual genetics involves examination of recombination in the absence of sexual reproduction"

ESBS-Strasbourg,2010,Team:ESBS-Strasbourg#Project#Strategy_-_-_TEXT.html," the PIF-fused target should also favor the recognition of the ssrA tag.
Baker et al. have shown that proteins with C-terminal LAA- tags are degraded rapidly in the cell, even without presence of SspB. This tag serves as positive control for the functionality of the composed ClpXP and the PhyB-ClpXP fusion protein.
The DAS Tag
Replacing two residues in the ssrA tag weakens ClpX binding. Ser was chosen as an allowed but not preferred C-terminal residue and Asp as the antepenultimate residue because this substitution decreases ClpXP and ClpAP degradation modestly. The ssrA tags with these mutations are referred as DAS tags [2] . Besides, no other proteases than ClpXP degrades DAS-tagged proteins. Therefore we chose the DAS tag  as specific recognition sequence for our system. As the role of the adaptor-protein SspB has been assumed by Pif3/6 in our system, only light-induced activation can lead to binding and efficient degradation of DAS bearing constructs.
The Lambda Tag
The λO- tag is the N-terminal equivalent to the DAS-tag. Degradation of proteins bearing the N-terminal λO- tag normally requires the N-domain of ClpX, which is missing in the PhyB-linker-[ClpX]3 variant.
Baker and colleges used this tag to test an artificial tethering system and demonstrated that it can serve as degradation signal for substrates that are tethered to ClpX.
Light controllable protease
The choice of the host organism
Another important point was the choice of the host organism. At the beginning we considered three different options: Saccharomyces cerevisae that was used by the former iGEM Team of the ESBS, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. The advantage of yeast was that it is a eukaryotic organism which would have been interesting for further applications in eukaryotic cells. At the other site this would impede the control of transcriptional regulation, which one of the initial application ideas of our protease, due to the nucleus’ membrane. The disadvantages are that the ClpP-coding sequence lacks in their genome which would have to be additionally cloned in. Moreover the growth rate of the cells is lower than the one of E.coli which would have slowed the laboratory work. The disadvantages of E.coli as host are the necessary knock-out of the ClpX gene for the control and the risk of interference of host-prote"

Genetic Circuits
Here, the full genetic circuit of The E.ncapsulator system can be seen. In order to benefit future teams wishing to reuse the features found in our project, a modular approach was taken at every level of the system design. In addition, integration modules have been designed and incorporated, providing a means to link the respective modules, without the use of a timer as one would expect.
This page will start by going through the genetic circuit design of the system, module by module.
Modular Genetic Circuits
Click on each genetic circuit to learn more about them individually.
Construction of Circuits
The genetic circuits were created in a logical step-by-step approach following the design of a unique cloning strategy. Smaller constructs were first created, and these built up to form the whole circuit. In order to allow for testing and part characterisation at various stages of the project, a number of intermediate testing constructs were also designed and built.
  About our step-by-step cloning strategy
BioBrick Submissions
This year, Imperial College London have added 29 new parts to the BioBrick registry. In addition we sought to characterise some of these parts, including the thermosensitive BBa_K098995 construct which has now been made functional by us. Detailed information about the characterisation of some of our parts can be found in the Major Results page.

Quantitative indigoidine production assay
1. OD MEASUREMENT by TECAN plate reader
96-well plates are prepared with 100 μl LB-medium/well containing appropriate antibiotics (chloramphenicol and kanamycin for the indigoidine and PPTase contrcuts, respectively) and each well is inoculated with single colonies (in duplicates) from plates positive for the co-tansformation experiments i.e. from plates with blue colonies. Two sets of negative controls are also inoculated on the plate: First, pure medium serving as the baseline for background correction for the OD measurements. Second, transformation controls accounting for potential differences in cell growth due to expression of proteins contained on the plasmids, i.e. the antibitotic resistance gene and IndC. In this set of controls, the plasmid used in co-transformation with the PPTase plasmid contains IndC-constructs carrying a randomly generated sequence instead of the T-domain.  A second 96 well plate was prepared with 180 µl LB-medium/well for the measurement itself. The 96-well plate containing the pre-cultures of the co-transformed colonies was inoculated for 24 hours at 37°C. Subsequently, 20 µl of the pre-culture was transferred to the measurement plate. The absorbance of the bacterial cultures was measured at wavelengths ranging from 400 nm to 800 nm in intervals of 10 nm for each well every 30 min for 30 hours at 30°C in a Tecan infinite M200 plate reader. For the measurement plate, Greiner 96-well flat black plates with a clear lid were used.
2. Data analysis
Detecting the amount of the NRP expressed by the bacterial host strain is desirable. By tagging the NRP with indigoidine, the amount of the fusion peptide can be determined by quantifying the amount of blue pigment present in the cells. As the amount of blue pigment is proportional to the amount of the NRP of"

Figure 1: Preliminary ligation test with T4 and T7 polymerase. The band slightly larger than 200 bp is our desired ligation product.
Our ligation test indicates that the new sticky ends exhibit specific binding. In both reactions, the ligation was incomplete due to the presence of a band at 100 bp. This may be due to non-equal amounts of DNA.
We plan to conduct this same test next week using all possible combinations between the three monomers to verify specific binding. We plan to test both T4 and T7."
Penn,2014,Team:Penn State_-_-_TEXT.html," protein synthesis can be lifted.  Traditional methods in E. coli rely on the preference for certain codons across the entire genome, yet this is not the only possible approach.  In this project, novel criteria for codon optimization were employed to design and create variants of a reporter gene that was then characterized in vivo. Results show that the new criteria for codon optimization, for example the statistical correlation between a degenerate codon and its presence in highly translated parts of the genome, are feasible for use in future projects. This leads to new theories about the mechanics of translation, and will allow researchers to optimize genes at the codon level with greater fidelity.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Practices#DualUse_-_-_TEXT.html," anywhere in the biotechnological environment, “should be aware of: the organization or organizations overseeing (ones) work, the appropriate Risk Group for the organisms that (one is) working with, and any select agents that might be involved. Further consider: any potentials for dual use, and especially if there are any biosafety or biosecurity concerns that are not addressed by current administrative controls”. ( Terry Johnson, 2013 ). Interestingly, the security page of 2011 contains details about biosecurity risk assessment. The possible misuse of information is pointed out. At the time of this year's project design and conduction neither on the main iGEM page nor on the 2015 page a security page was existent. Nevertheless, the iGEM competition established a safety committee that has members with very deep knowledge about the dual use concern.
Conclusions
Facing this dilemma in our own project, we have not found proper guidelines within the competitions to apply to our concerns. While iGEM provides expert council through its safety committee, we find this not to be sufficient to call for awareness of dual use in all states of research. As proposed in our description of the ethical debate, this is critical for the planning of research. Therefore, we propose the implementation of biosecurity risk assessment in obligational forms. Since the iGEM competition asks us to be “striving to be conscientious members of the synthetic biology community” ( iGEM Safety Page ), we want to complete this safety and security aspects by finding guidelines for the safe distribution of knowledge and the question of dual use research of concern. As it is an international competition aiming to promote the communication between researchers as well as between them and the public, iGEM could be a role model in considering the dual use dilemma.
Proposals for the iGEM community
We propose the implementation of the definitions of biosafety, biosecurity and dual use in the iGEM safety page. This is suggested to increase awareness of biosecurity risks and especially the dual use issue from the very beginning of research progress in iGEM projects.
Further, on advice of Prof. Nixdorff and in hindsight of the proposals of several advisory boards, we propose a general biosecurity risk assessment by implementation of additional questions into obligatory safety forms. This assessment cannot be strictly seperated from biosafety questions, as the security measures need to be adapted to the biosafety risks:
General biosecurity risk assessment
Do you work with any sequences or toxins of plant/animal origin, that might be a threat to health of humanity or environment?
Do you work with any sequences of S3 organisms"

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  For today, colony PCR will be done in order to verify the Yeate construct.  In addition, ampicillin plates will be made in preparation for beginning protein expression in the next few days.  Much of it will be limited to what is possible to work with in the boelter lab..
Resuspension of Oligos:
Resuspension, Dilution, Storage, and Other Tips
After receiving an envelope containing their order of newly synthesized IDT oligonucleotides, many researchers find themselves asking the question “Now what should I do with these oligos?” At this point, several important decisions must be made regarding oligonucleotide resuspension, dilution, and storage, which may vary depending on the intended application for each oligo. Here, we provide recommendations for preparing oligos to use in experiments and guidelines for proper storage.
Resuspension
Centrifugation and Resuspension. Most oligonucleotides synthesized and shipped from IDT are delivered dried down and often appear as a white flakey substance in the bottom of the tube. Dried DNA is quite stable and, typically, is easy to resuspend in an aqueous solution. The first step a researcher should take upon receipt of their oligos is to briefly centrifuge the tubes before opening them. This ensures that any dried DNA that may have become dislodged during shipping is brought down to the bottom of the tube. Next, the oligos should be resuspended in TE buffer (IDTE: 10 mM Tris, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Tris (tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) acts as a buffer, helping to maintain a constant pH for the solution. EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) prevents nuclease digestion of the DNA. At higher concentrations, EDTA can inhibit enzymatic reactions, such as PCR, by chelating metals ions like Mg2"

With respect to the boundary conditions, they are null since we are considering an opened-space. Attending to the implementation and simulation of this method, dt must be small enough to avoid instability.
The Idea
When one stares at moths, they apparently move with erratic flight paths. It is possibly because of predator avoiding reasons.
In this frame, sex pheromones influence in moth behavior is also considered. Since these are pheromones released by females in order to attract an individual of the opposite sex, it makes sense that males respond to gradients of sex pheromone concentration, being attracted towards the source. As soon as a flying male randomly comes into conical pheromone-effective sphere of sex pheromone released by a virgin female, the male begins to seek the females in a zigzag way, approaches to the females and finally copulates with her [1].
Approximation
In this project we approximate the resulting moth movement as a vectorial combination of a gradient vector and a random vector. The magnitude of the gradient vector comes from the change in pheromone concentration level among points separated by a differential stretch in space. More precisely, the gradient points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the function and its magnitude is the slope of the graph in that direction. The random vector is restricted in this ‘moth response’ model by a fixed angle, assuming that the turning movement is relatively continuous and for example the moth can’t turn 180 relative degrees at the next instant.
Since the objective of this project consists in avoiding pest damage by reaching the mating disrupting among moths, our synthetic plants are supposed to release enough sexual pheromone so as to saturate moth perception. In this sense the resulting moth vector movement will depend ultimately on the pheromone concentration levels in the field and the moth ability to follow better or worse the gradient of sex pheromone concentration.
At this point, let’s highlight the three main aspects we consider for the characterization of males moth behavior:
Table 1. Male moths behaviour characterization.
In this context, this ensemble of behaviors could be translated in a sum of vectors in which the random vector has a constant module and changeable direction inside a range, whereas the gradient vector module is"

In addition, we were able to show that our fusion proteins actually interacted . This was achieved via a BLItz experiment:
Figure 2: Results of the BLItz experiment. Illustrated are the measured base line, the association and the dissociation of the protein-protein interaction in the BLItz. The addition of the second protein is marked at 60 seconds after measuring the base line. The SH2-cI fusion protein was added at the start without washing (green), after one (purple) and two (yellow) washing steps with NaCl and after a washin step with a high concentrated HCl solution (upper blue). Also BSA was measured with 1 μg/ml (lower blue) and 10 μ/ml (red) protein.
To test the affinity of our DNA-binding domain (DBD) towards its supposed binding site we examined their interaction in vitro using EMSA. The results depict the expected band shift strongly suggesting interaction between DBD and its binding site.
Figure 3: EMSA results. In alternaty application the DNA fragment with the 434 OR1 binding site and the DNA fragment with the lambda binding site were used as DNA sample. +/- = with/without SH2-cI fusion protein.
An in vivo experiment designed by us supports the EMSA results. A construct containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) upstream and a red fluorescent protein (RFP) downstream of the DBD binding site has been used. Since we observed a lower RFP/GFP ratio in the presence of the DBD, the DBD appears to bind to its target site, thereby preventing the polymerase to express RFP.
Figure 4: Tecan results. In the Tecan plate reader the RFP intensity was measured. The E. coli cultures with (red) and without (black) producing the cI repressor were analyzed. Error bars are implemented.
Last but not least we established to show a higher expression rate when using both fusion proteins in contrast to a negative control with only one, indicating the functionality of the bacterial two-hybrid system in general.
Figure 5: Tecan-Results in vivo reporter activity. Two culters of E. coli were measured on their ability to produce RFP through the reporter construct. A culture with one fusion protein SH2-cI expressing is compared with a culture carrying both fusion proteins SH2-cI and HA4-RpoZ. The RFP intensity of the culture with both fusion proteins is significantly higher than in the culture with only one fusion protein.

The successful transformants from yesterday’s Gibson assemblies were cultured, and we ran a digest screen of all Psal minipreps with low yields: the image showed correct bands. Ran a PCR overnight of the Psal F and Psal R primers that just came in to amplify out Psal with its activator (nahR with P constitutive promoter). The SpeI cut site on will be appended by the reverse primer, while the forward primer is just amplifying the region already containing the BioBrick prefix. We also grew 10 ml overnight cultures of pC13P & pC13BA in LB and Chloramphenicol. Overall a productive day.
Characterization of pC13BC and pC13BV was unsuccessful. We began cloning of completed constructs into new vectors for C. heterosporus transformation, as well as cloning of Psal, and grew cultures of PtrpC with ‘’afp1’’. Gel electrophoresis showed that none of  the components of the carotenoid pathway yesterday work. We realized that the forward primer we used is wrong and designed a new one.

We also miniprepped pC13P & pC13BA digested with PstI and EcoRI to run a digest screen. The pC13BF cultures still have not grown, causing us to surmise that the bacteria in the culture are contaminants that somehow acquired antibiotic resistance. Due to our time constraints and the amount of troubleshooting that would be required to successfully construct pC13BF at this point, we decided to abandon submitting pC13BF as a BioBrick. As a result, we prioritized our remaining time to characterize the parts sent to us by Wageningen.

Description
Overview
In ancient Roman myth, Janus is the god of beginnings and transitions, who is depicted as having two faces, respectively to the future and the past.
Our project is focused on another Janus - hydrophobin the protein, who faces the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity. Because of this, a sea of new applications are created.
Firstly, we redesign the structures of two classes of hydrophobins, making expression in E.coli possible.
Secondly, we use its double-sticky-tape-like ability to make two applications. We take this advantage to fix antibodies on a high-flux tumor detection chip. Meanwhile, they are used to catch cutinases for plastic degradation. We even make them into a fusion to test if the enhancement could be better.
Thirdly, we use its amphipathicity to achieve protein separation, where they act as a special purification tag, and the system could be as simple as polymer, detergent and water. With help of this, we could even achieve recovery of cutinases.
Figure 1. The overview of our project
Feel interested about our story? So let's follow Janus and begin our journey from old to new!
 
Background
As is known to us all, for most proteins, hydrophobic residues are buried in the core of proteins stabilizing the folded conformation of the protein. However, as to our Janus - hydrophobin, one part of the surface is consisted nearly entirely of hydrophobic side chains, forming what was called “the hydrophobic patch” [1]. We could then describe the structure of Janus as a ""surfactant"" with one hydrophobic and one hydrophilic part.

Janus are proteins that are produced by filamentous fungi, such as Ascomycetes and Basidiomyc"
