Laccase decomposes substrate ABTS, producing ABTS free radical, absorption coefficient is much larger at 420nm compared to substrate ABTS, measure rate of increase of ABTS free radical in order to calculate laccase activity.
Instrument and reagent:
balance, low temperature centrifuge, UV-visible spectrophotometer, microplate reader, raman quartz cuvette/96 pore plate, and a laboratory water bath at constant temperature.
Procedure of extracting enzyme liquid:
Tissue: lower the temperature using mixture of ice and water, and homogenate the mixture of tissue and the extracted liquid (mass of tissue : mass of liquid as 1 : 5-10; 0.1g tissue and 1mL extracted liquid suggested). Centrifuge at 4 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes, 10000g, draw the supernatant, and place it on ice for further measurement.
Cell: lower the temperature of the mixture of cells and the extracted liquid using mixture of ice and water, then add ultrasonication to destroy the cells of the mixture for 3 minutes, 300w power (number of 104 cells : volume of the extracted liquid as 500-1000 : 1mL; 5 million cells and 1mL extracted liquid suggested)

Formula to calculate laccase activity using sample mass:
Definition of laccase activity: 1 laccase activity is the amount of enzyme needed for every sample (per gram) to oxidize 1nmol substrate ABTS per minute.
laccase activity (nmol/min/g) = ΔA /ε(ABTS mmolar extinction coefficient) / d * V (total volume of reaction) / V (volume of sample in the reaction, 0.025mL) / W (sample mass, g) * V (extracted liquid added, 1mL) / T (reaction time, 3 minutes) = 130 *ΔA / W

Lethbridge,2011,Team:Lethbridge#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," asked by the Calgary iGEM team to to test the viability of their chassis to survive in tailings pond water. If E. coli DH5α cells containing one of their constructs can grow normally in medium prepared with tailings water, we can be confident that the chassis can be applied to tailings pond water in general.
Materials and Methods
50 mL of LB medium was made with tailings water and filtered through MILLEX filter Unit GS MF-Millipore MCE Membrane 0.22 µm in order to sterilize it and appropriate antibiotics were added. The tailings LB was inoculated with E. coli DH5α cells containing BBa_K331009 to an OD600 of 0.1. The flask was incubated at 37˚C with shaking for 7 hours, during which photometric readings were taken every 30. Photometric readings were taken using the Pharmacia Biotech Ultrospec 3000, as the OD600 readings reached 1.0 the solutions was diluted with LB media to keep the OD600 reading between 0.1 and 1.0. The same protocol was used to observe cell growth of E. coli DH5α cells containing BBa_K331009 in 50 mL of LB medium made with MilliQ H2O.
Results
Figure 1. OD600 of E. coli DH5α cells containing BBa_K331009 cultured in LB medium made with tailings water (red) and LB medium made with MilliQ H2O (black).  Performed by our team.
Figure 2. OD600 of E. coli DH5α cells containing BBa_K331009 cultured in LB medium made with tailings water (red and blue) and LB medium made with MilliQ H2O (black).  Performed independently by the 2011 Calgary iGEM Team.
Conclusion
As seen in Figure 1, E. coli DH5α cells were able to grow in LB medium made with tailings water, suggesting that the chassis will survive for use in tailings pond water.

Methods
This procedure is taken from the open wetware page: http://openwetware.org/wiki/Synthetic_Biology:BioBricks/3A_assembly
 
 
Construction Procedure
1.                  Miniprep the two parts and construction plasmid. e.g.
Ø  Prefix part BBa_K137029 comes on a pSB1A2 plasmid with ampicillin resistance
Ø  Suffix part BBa_K115017 comes on a pSB1AT3 plasmid with ampicillin and tetracycline resistance
Ø  Construction vector pSB1C3 is a plasmid backbone with chloramphenicol resistance
2.                  Digest the two parts and destination vector with the following enzymes
·         Prefix part ( BBa_K137029 ) with EcoRI and SpeI
·         Suffix part ( BBa_K115017 ) with XbaI and PstI
·         Construction vector ( pSB1C3 ) with EcoRI and PstI
3.                  Purify the restriction digest.
·         For parts < 200 bp in length, do a Knight:Micropure EZ and Microcon purification (or alternatively an Ethanol precipitation of small DNA fragments ). All other parts and the construction vector can be purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit or Qiagen Minelute PCR Purification Kit (elutes in a smaller volume giving greater concentration of the DNA).
4.                  Ligate the two parts and construction vector together. ( Endy lab protocol )
5.                  Transform the ligation product. (See also Electroporation or another chemical transformation .)
6.                  Analyze the transformation with single colony PCR followed by agarose gel electrophoresis .
·         In rolling, large scale assembly, this step is omitted.
7.                  Miniprep clones that generated a band of the appropriate size.
8.                  Sequence the clone.
9.                  Repeat for all of the parts to form three complete plasmids.
10.              Assemble all three plasmids together to produce cells with all three responses.
 
 
The antibiotic resistance of the different parts helps to ensure that only the construction vector backbone plasmid is selected for, while the ccdB gene prevents unaltered construction vectors from continuing.  These plasmids would be finally assembled together in a single cell."

We had the distinct honor to collaborate with the following teams with surveys along with advice for each other’s projects:
NTHU_Taiwan
We filled out a survey for NTHU_Taiwan, and they filled out our survey as well. Our teams were both in discussion about specific areas of our project. When either of us ran into problems in the lab, they were a great resource for us to go to for advice.
TU_Delft
This year we helped the TU_Delft team by filling out their survey. This year, they were looking to research the influence of iGEM among other things other than science, such as education and policy. They developed a survey about last year’s competition that will be used as the starting point of this year's research.
AHUT_China
We filled out a questionnaire to help Team AHUT_China learn about how much we know about DNA calculation and path planning.
Korea USeoul
This team is interested in hosting an Asia Regional Symposium , and they created a survey to help them better plan the event. We helped them out by participating in this survey.
HUST-China
This team is focusing on a gene expression toolkit for their project this year. They asked for inside advice from fellow iGEMers and we accomplished this by filling out a questionnaire that gives them a better idea on what would be beneficial in a toolkit.

Fig.2    Plasmid map of created BioBrick construct.
5.       Construct testing - molecular biology aspect
a) Restriction digest with prefix and suffix enzymes
Single and double restriction digests were carried out in order to ensure that created BioBrick behaves as expected and yields desired band pattern. Single digests with EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI and PstI cause a single cut within the vector and therefore result in plasmid linearization. As expected, in all cases a single band at 6.6 kB position is visible, which corresponds to the full size of a vector. EcoRI+PstI and XbaI+SpeI result in the release of a BioBrick construct from a vector yielding two fragments (BioBrick fragment: 4580 bp and vector fragment: 2020 bp). Single cuts with BglII and HindIII aim to test insertion of FLAG flanked by multiple cloning sites; single digests result in construct linearization. Double digests with BglII+SpeI and HindIII+XbaI were carried out in order to provide more information whether FLAG+MCS construct was inserted at an expected site.
Fig.3    Restriction digest of created BioBrick with a range of restriction enzymes.
The obtained bands correspond with expected pattern therefore we can assume that FLAG+MCS was inserted at or in proximity to codon 148.
b) Confirming BioBrick Bba_K1352001 construction using DNA sequencing
Our Ag43+FLAG+MCS was sequenced by the DNA Sequencing & Services Unit, Dundee University. Sequencing primers spaced approximately every 600 bp were used to ensure good coverage. Fragments were combined together using Clustal Omega and yield a high confidence reading along the entire sequence. It confirmed the presence of an in-frame FLAG tag sequence flanked by BglII and HindIII restriction sites at codon 148 of Ag43. Our construct sequence was identical to that of the protein product of Bba_K1352000, with the exception of the codon 148 FLAG + multiple cloning site sequence.

NCTU_Formosa,2009,Team:NCTU Formosa#Project#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,". The LuxI protein impels the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to transform into AHL. This becomes another way of regulation.
(6) The Regulation of the RFP
The ultimate purpose is to reveal the red color only under the condition that the time is up or the bacteria invasion is higher than standard value.
First, the promoter in this circuit is a double-regulated promoter, and it can only be activated when the following requirements are fulfilled: (1) The lack of the CIIP22 protein and (2) The linkage to the AHL-LuxR complex.  Hence, we can regulate the device at the appropriate timing. After the function of the memory system is shut down and the AHL-LuxR complex accumulation caused by the cease of tetR translation, the promoter (BBa_K145015) starts to work and produce the RFP.
(7) Counter
The counter is designed to work in the lactose-accession stage only. We insert a part of sequence which encodes the LuxR protein downstream the constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23106 ). Therefore the system is full of LuxR on the go. Besides, the promoter in the Lux operon ( BBa_K145150 ) can only work in the lactose-accession stage under the regulation of the LacI-repressive promoter. We can use both characteristics to prompt the work of the signal output and the cell’s death.

Each row represents the changes in binding energy,  ΔΔG (kcal/mol), compared to the reference sequence upon the substitution to the indicated nucleotide at certain position within the target DNA element. Values are indicated in kcal/mol.
We compared the measured DNA binding affinities of the V36F mutant to the affinities obtained for the  wt-TetR and found that V36F mutant interacts with the TetO as strongly as the wild-type variant.

In Vitro Characterization
Using the MITOMI technique we determined the DNA binding landscape of the TetR E37A  W43S T141A  mutant. To do so, first we designed and generated the library of double stranded DNA sequences that cover all possible single base substitution within the tetO operator sequence. Based on that library we measured the dissociation constants of the mutant to variable tetO-like sequences and determined the specificity of the mutant to the tet operator sequence (expressed as a PWM).
The measured DNA binding affinities of the E37A W43S T141A mutant show that these mutations alter the sequence recognition, while the symmetry and the spacer affinities are conserved.
The enoLOGO we obtained for the E37A W43S T141A mutant:

The four PPTases additionally introduced into the TOP10 cells were all shown to be functional (blue phenotype of the transformants, Fig. 3b ), but lead to the retention of most of the indigoidine within the cells. Colonies of cells transformed with thess constructs, were of convex shape and of distinct, dark blue color. Overall, cells carrying an additional PPTase showed increased indigoidine production compared to the cells relying on the endogenous entD.
T-Domain Exchanges in IndC Yield Functional Indigoidine Synthetases
The main structural characteristic of NRPSs is their modular composition on different hierarchical levels. The indogoidine synthetase indC is a single module NRPS comprised of the three domains, namely AOxA, T and TE. Since the functionality of this NRPS is detectable by the bare eye, it offers a perfect and simple experimental set-up for proof of principle experiments regarding the interchangeability of domains from different NRPS. Out of the three domains in indC, the T-domain is supposed to exhibit the least substrate specificity and was thus chosen for first domain shuffling approaches. For the initial definition of T-domain boundaries of indC, we used Pfam, a web-tool which allows -amongst other functions- for the prediction of NRPS module and domain boundaries ( Pfam.sanger.ac.uk . Following the boundary prediction, we choose a two-pronged domain shuffling approach: First, we transferred native T-domains derived from either different host species and/or NRPS of entirely different function into the indC indigoidine synthetase (Streptomyces lavendulae lavendulae ATCC11924 (blue pigment synthetase bpsA) [6], Brevibacillus parabrevis (Tyrocidine synthesis cluster) [2], Delftia acidovorans SPH-1 (Delftibactin synthesis cluster) [8], Photorhabdus luminescens laumondii TT01 (plu2670 and plu2642, unknown function) [14] and Escherichia coli MG1655 (entF from enterobactin synthesis cluster) [4]). Second, we deviced three methods for the generation of synthetic T-domains based on different NRPS libraries generated by BLAST search against either specific subranges of host organisms or restricting the query sequence to be BLASTed ( BLAST.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ).

Gas Chromatography
Gas Chromatography is a method used for separating and analyzing compounds by injecting ａ sample mixture into a column prepared to be in a suitable stationary phase and passing a gas （carrier gas） in the mobile phase through the column, in order to separate the mixture into its components by making use of the difference in retention capacity against the stationary phase. This method can be applied to a gaseous or vaporizable sample, and is used for identification, purity testing, and quantitative determination.

This last point ultimately enables our device to be assimilated into an IBD patient’s digestive tract, in close proximity to possible sites of disease.  Nevertheless, an E. coli chassis is not perfect: it is difficult to construct an E. coli device that can simultaneously sense two different inputs and dynamically output two different molecules.
Inflammation and Immunosuppression Device specifics
Thus the team divided the two sensors and generators between two E. coli devices: Device 1 detects excessive Th17 inflammatory activity (through NO) and secretes an anti-inflammatory factor (RA) in response, while Device 2 detects excessive Treg-mediated immunosuppression (through 5MT) and produces an inflammatory factor (IL-6) in response.  The primary role of Device 1 is to treat IBD by reducing excessive Th17 inflammatory activity. Device 1 can accomplish this by secreting RA, which inhibits Th17 cell production from naïve CD4+ T cells while at the same time boosting Treg cell production from the same population of naïve CD4+ cells. Device 2 has the opposite role; it produces and exports IL-6, which inhibits Treg cell production from naïve CD4+ cells.  Device 2 serves two roles: (1) to autonomously regulate Treg populations and immunosuppressive response and (2) to prevent Device 1 from overshooting and creating an immunosuppressive state and an increased risk of colon cancer.
Alternative Sensor and Generator Arrangements
Although the team considered allocating the sensors to one device and the generators to a second device as an alternate way to divide the input and output tasks, such a scheme would require, in addition to the I/O system outlined above, a secondary I/O system that would allow the sensor device to communicate to the generator device.  Moreover, such as secondary I/O system would have to be extremely robust, since the gastrointestinal extracellular environment is subject to great amounts of molecular noise.  Finally, the devices in this scheme would have to untangle possible crosstalk between the two sensors and two generators. Ultimately, the team decided this division of labor was inferior to the one detailed above.
System Level Overview
Below is a system level overview of our IBD therapeutic that shows how device 1 and device 2 interact with one another and with inflammation and immunosuppressive responses.  The functions of Device 1 are highlighted in green while the effects of device 2 are highlighted in purple:

Neptune: Accessible microfluidics for all
In our Silver Medal Human Practices page, we outlined our public outreach and industry visits. These experiences drew our team to focus on accessibility in synthetic biology as a theme moving forward with our human practice contributions. For Silver HP, we contributed a set of informational blog posts on the history of intellectual property, and IP in software and in synthetic biology today. We welcome you to read these at our WordPress site.
WORDPRESS BLOG
Moving forward with the development of Neptune, we decided that we would extend our silver medal HP theme of accessibility in synthetic biology. Indeed, we were developing a complete, end-to-end microfluidic development workflow. Having seen how inaccessible and prohibitively costly microfluidics are for researchers, and also having studied the virtues of open source tools for synthetic biology, we decided to integrate accessibility into our implementation of Neptune.
In this page, we cover 3 ways in which we expand on and integrate the theme of accessibility to our final product, Neptune.
we made it a project criteria that Neptune must interface with low cost, open and readily available tools and hardware to create microfluidics
we partnered with the NONA Research Foundation, an organization dedicated to increasing access, collaboration, and building a community around synthetic biology software tools
we offer our team as a point of contact to other iGEM teams that have created software solutions and would like to have these tools protected and stored on NONA
Neptune: Low cost, easy to use, accessible
As we developed Neptune, we were faced with design choices that would have a large impact on how our workflow integrates with the synthetic biology community. In light of our Silver HP discoveries, we decided the most important design choice would be to make our workflow accessible to all: we want a workflow so easy to use that researchers in synthetic biology will be excited to make microfluidic chips. We want a workflow that interfaces with fabrication protocols that are low"

Jacky Cheung is a 3rd year CC student at Columbia   University, and he is currently a pre-medical student   majoring in Computer Science and Biology. Apparently,   according to the Meyer-Briggs personality test, his   personality type is ENFP (A.K.A The Campaigner). He is   not quite sure how he feels about this. He has been   involved in Synthetic Biology research since high   school and this year is his third year participating   in iGEM. His emoji of choice is :p because he enjoys   teasing his friends, but ^.^ and XD are a close second   and third. To relax, he enjoys taking long walks along   the pier and messing with his friends (especially   Hudson). Something he is known for is asking to get   cheesecake or pie at 2 A.M after finishing long coding   assignments because he is dopamine-deprived. He is   named after Hong-Kong pop sensation Jacky Cheung; and   one of his aspirations in life is to top the   aforementioned celebrity on Google after doing a   search of his name.

With the current setup, the syringe plunger would move 468 nm per microstep, which is the wavelength of blue light. At this point, the limitation for our precision becomes the manufacturing accuracy of the mechanical parts.
syringe carrier: The syringe carrier is a 3D printed part, with an indentaion that holds the back of the syringe's plunger and makes it possible to move it bidirectionally. That makes it possible to empty or fill the syringe.
linear ball bearings: The linear ball bearings are glued into holes in the syringe carrier. Thanks to the steel balls inside, they make sure that the syringe carrier does not cant and moves with the least friction possible.
trapezoidal nut: This is the counterpart of the trapezoidal threaded spindle. Usually, for motor applications ball screws that work in the same manner as ball bearings are used. Because of the small speeds needed while operating the printer, we could use a simple trapezoidal nut that is cheaper and smaller.
end stops: Because of the gear reduction the spindle provides, the small motor can cause enormous forces. To prevent the syringe pump from destroying itself when hitting its walls we build in end stops, which are switches that tell the software when the syringe carrier has reached its end position. The motor is then only permitted to move in the other direction. Usually, there are special end stops with a mechanical appliance that keeps them safe when hit by a moving component. Again, due to the low speeds we were able to use simple push buttons that saved us money and space.
rods: Steel rods with good surface quality where the ball bearings can glide on and minimize friction.
cylinder head screws with hexagon socket:These M3x5 cylinder head screws with hexagon socket (DIN ISO 7984) arrest the motor.
cover: This 3D printed part is solely for aesthetic purposes and covers the motor compartment.
3 ml syringe:This is a BD 3ml syringe with Luer-Lok, although all similarily sized syringes should work. This serves as a container for the bioink.
hooks: These 3D printed hooks can be used to hang the pump to the side of your printer.

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for the selective amplification of desired DNA fragments (for example from a plasmid). Primers were designed for the desired target sequences.  The PCR reaction was divided in to three steps which were repeated up to 30 times. Firstly, the DNA template strand was heat-denatured at 95 °C to produce single-stranded DNA. Secondly, the temperature of the reaction batch was lowered to 55 – 60 °C to allow the primers to bind. Thirdly, the temperature was raised to 72 °C. This enabled the DNA polymerase to synthesize the other DNA strand. Special PCR methods that were used include colony and genomic PCR.
Colony PCR
A method to allow for higher throughput of clone screenings. Colonies were picked with a sterile toothpick or pipet tip. Some of the cells were smeared onto the wall of the PCR tube. Subsequently the toothpick was put into a cell culture tube with LB-medium and suitable antibiotic. Colony PCR was performed using OneTaq Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Qiagen) following this temperature scheme:

Purification of PCR products
PCR products were purified using the PCR purification kit by Qiagen.
Dephosphorylation of DNA
Dephosphorylation of digested PCR products via Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (Fermaentas) was done to avoid religation of the insert and enhance ligation rate. Before dephosphorylation was performed, digest solution of restriction enzymes and buffer were purified with PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). Afterwards 1 µg sample DNA was mixed with 10% of 10x SAP Buffer and 1 unit SAP. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Inactivation occurred at 65 °C for 15 min.
DNA Restriction Enzyme Digest
For the preparation of DNA fragments and the restriction analysis of plasmid DNA, DNA was cut using restriction endonucleases. Buffers and DNA concentrations were used according to the manufacturer's suggestions.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.
Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Destructase PACE Cloning I:
Weekly Report 23.07.17 - 30.07.17 PP Destructase PACE consists, as all the other PACE experiments, of three plasmids, namely the accessory plasmid (AP), the selection phage (SP), and the mutagenesis plasmid (MP).
Design of the AP and SP is described in the following lines.
SP
The gene of interest in this PACE run is an anhydrotetracycline destructase named Tet(x) from Bacterioides fragilis.
We aim at destructing Tet(x) and thereby increasing anhydrotetracycline (aTC) concentration and gIII expression.  The sequence was codon optimized for E. coli and a strong, self-created RBS was calculated (Salis Lab). The selection phage is re-assembled because stop-codon creating mutations within tet(x) should be prevented.

Global Aspects
Dioxins are mainly by-products of industrial processes, including waste incineration, but can also result from natural processes, such as volcanic eruptions and forest fires. Some of the processes that create Dioxins include smelting, chlorine bleaching of paper pulp and the manufacture of some herbicides and pesticides. When it comes to the release of dioxins into the environment, uncontrolled waste incinerators (solid waste and hospital waste) are often the worst culprits due to incomplete burning.
Dioxin-based waste is not easily disposed of without contaminating the environment and human populations. Such materials need to be treated as hazardous waste and are most quickly destroyed by high temperature incineration in specialized facilities.
Extensive stores of PCB-based [1]  waste and industrial oils, many with high levels of PCDF's [2] exist throughout the world. The long-term storage and improper disposal of these materials may result in exposure and contamination of the environment as well as human and animal food supplies.
Quantitatively speaking, the annual global dioxin production is approx. 17,200 kg, which corresponds to about 287 kg-TEQ. TEQ stands for “Toxic Equivalent” which weighs the toxicity of the less toxic compounds as fractions of the toxicity of the most toxic dioxin - TCDD. It been previously calculated (2015) that the total annual emission rate of dioxins into the atmosphere, only 9 kg-TEQ (3%) remains in the air. For the rest, 57% is deposited to land areas (163 kg-TEQ), while the remaining 40% is absorbed by ocean waters (115 kg-TEQ or 354 kg/year).
[1] - Polychlorinated biphenyl, a molecule with a structure similar to dioxin.
[2] - Polychlorinated dibenzofuran, another molecule with structure similar to dioxin.
Main sources of dioxin in each continent:
Europe
The continent of Europe is one of the main producers of dioxins worldwide. The emissions are produced both from industrial activities and nonindustrial burning processes. The ambient concentration varies depending on the climate, residential activities, and the degree of development and social awareness of the inhabitants in the respective countries.  Among them, heavily industrialized countries like Germany were the main producers of dioxins until a few years ago (1990s) when stricter legislation and the implementation of more efficient treatment mechanisms led to the decrease of emissions to minimal values. Other industrialized countries like Poland, where less"

Mutant Library
For purposes of sequencing  12 transformations of the mutation library into E. coli BL21 DE3 gold were made and all results showed different codons in various combinations at all mutation sites, respectively a glycine at position 32. That means, all of our mutagenesis PCRs worked.
The samples were pooled and the cleaned up PCR product was transformed into the competent cells already containing the reporter plasmid. They were streaked on M9 plates with the assessed concentrations of antibiotics for selection. After two days of incubation appropriate colonies were picked into microtiter plates containing M9 liquid Medium and respective antibiotics. Thus over 8000 clones were collected. The microtiterplates were incubated and used for inoculation of a second microtiter plate. A final inoculation into black microtiter plates with transparent bottom for screening followed this preculture. Induction with 100 µM IPTG as well as supplementation of 2 mM DMNBS was carried out at the beginning of this final cultivation (see results).

Determine measurement conditions and parameters
Excitation and emission spectra of mRFP1 and sfGFP were obtained from fluorescence scan measurements (figure 1, figure 2). To get green and red fluorescence signals E. coli BL21 DE3 gold was transformed with the reporter plasmid pRXG and synthetase plasmid (wild type tyrosyl-tRNA/synthetase pair). The tRNA/synthetase pair coded by this plasmid (YRS) is the natural synthetase for incorporation of tyrosine, whereas the anticodon of the tRNA is mutated to recognize the amber stop codon. As a result, the linker downstream of mRFP1 is synthesized, harbouring tyrosine at the amber codon site. Following the linker, sfGFP is also expressed an its fluorescence signal is used to determine the correct wavelength for screening.

7. Calculating the Relative Promoter Units (RPU) using the obtained data;
Data Processing
1. After E. coli carrying the right construct was grown to mid-log phase, GFP intensity and OD595 were measured every 30 minutes (up to 120min);
2. GFP intensity are subtracted with the background fluorescence which is the fluorescence of pSB3K3- BBa_E0240 . Curve reflecting GFP expression change was plotted (from 4 measurements from time=0 to time=120); OD595 was converted to OD600, and average values were taken;
3. GFP synthesis rate was then obtained by calculating the slope of the above mentioned curve;
4. Absolute promoter activity of PcelA, PcomFA, and BBa_I20260 were calculated by dividing the GFP synthesis rate with the average OD600 value;
5. Averaged absolute promoter activity was then obtained by averaging the respective 3 sets of absolute promoter activity values;
6. Finally, R.P.U was calculated by dividing the averaged PcelA and PcomFA absolute promoter activity over the averaged BBa_J23101 absolute promoter activity. R.P.U value of PcelA and PcomFA reflect the maximum GFP expression in the presence of σx. Leakage could be analyzed according to the R.P.U value that shows the GFP expression of PcelA and PcomFA promoter in the absence of σx.
Equation of the RPU calculation is shown below:

Our goal is to design a prototype that 1) maximizes the contact area between biofilm and NPs, and 2) can be easily implemented in existing WWTP infrastructure.
Maximize NP-Biofilm Contact Area
Some aquariums already utilize biofilms grown on plastic structures called biocarriers for water purification. Commercial biocarriers use various ridges, blades, and hollow structures to maximize surface area available for biofilm attachment (figure 5-7A). With that in mind, we designed and 3D-printed plastic (polylactic acid, or PLA) prototypes with many radiating blades to maximize the area available for biofilm attachment (figure 5-7B). We used PLA because it was readily available for printing and easy to work with, allowing us to quickly transition from constructing to testing our prototype.
Figure 5-7 Biocarriers enable biofilm attachment. A) An example of commercial biocarriers. B) We 3D-printed our prototype to maximize surface area for biofilm attachment. C) We observed biofilms loosely attached onto our prototype. Prototype: Candice L., Yvonne W. Experiment: Yvonne W.
To test how well biofilms actually adhere and develop on our prototypes, we used BBa_K2229300 liquid cultures, since they produced the most biofilm in previous tests. After an incubation period, we observed biofilm growth and attachment to our prototypes (figure 5-7C).
Maximize Adaptability to Existing Infrastructure
We would like to implement our prototype in secondary sedimentation tanks in existing WWTPs. The water in this step is relatively calm compared to aeration tanks, which will help keep biofilm structures intact. In addition, larger particles in wastewater would already be filtered out, which maximizes NP removal. The director of Boswell’s WWTP told us that most sedimentation tanks use devices called surface skimmers, which constantly rotate around a"

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#Human Practice#igemathome_-_-_TEXT.html," community is key to run a successful distributed computing project. As the project depends on the voluntary support of people it is important to get people enthused about the science behind the project, so they are willing to support the project. Good communication is therefore essential to find support. We therefore used different channels to present and promote our project and iGEM in general to convince people to help us - which in the end turned out to be key to one of our biological main projects!
The Communication Platform iGEM@HOME
The important job after convincing the user to try our software, is to convince them to continuously support us by constantly feeding them with interesting facts on iGEM and offering them ways to influence the project.
Forum: Feedback on Computing and Projects
The first pillar for the communication is an integrated forum software, that serves several purposes: First of all, additional information like status updates or information on the biological projects can be communicated to the community via the 'News' and 'Science' sections of the forum. In addition the users can give elaborate feedback on problems arising from the client site. Finally user forums are an integral component to the BOINC distributed computing community and are widely used to present user achievments such as the number of projects supported, computational time spent to projects, BOINC points rewarded for computing and also to compare the stats of different projects projects . Forum users are provided with a personal profile that displays memberships in BOINC teams, points earned for computing and the possibility to contact other users via private text messages.
Screen Saver: Communication Channel for Synthetic Biology
The second pillar of our communicational concept is a browser page that feeds content to the screensaver implemented into BOINC. We decided to post different types of content: (1) General information about (synthetic) biology, (2) general facts about the iGEM competition, (3) presentations of iGEM team projects, (4) announcements of special events that are open to public organised by iGEM (Human Practices) teams.  We started with a small series of 'Did you know ...?' pages, presented the project of iGEM team Heidelberg 2013 and contacted other iGEM teams to offer the opportunity to present content to a growing community of iGEM supporters. In order to test the capabilities of iGEM@home as a communication channel, we announced our own events via the channel. A final test will be carried out after wiki freeze by announcing an event exclusively via the screensaver (see a short description in the 'Outlook' section at the end of this text).

Fatih_Turkey,2011,Team:Fatih Turkey#LALF_-_-_TEXT.html,". Molecules that bind LPS and neutralize its biological effects or enhance its clearance could have important clinical applications. Limulus anti-LPS factor (LALF) binds LPS tightly, and, in animal models, reduces mortality when administered before or after LPS challenge or bacterial infection. The wedge-shaped molecule has a striking charge distribution and amphipathicity that suggest how it can insert into membranes. The binding site for LPS probably involves an extended amphipathic loop, and it has been proposed that two mammalian LPS-binding proteins will have a similar loop. The amphipathic loop structure may be used in the design of molecules with therapeutic properties against septic shock.
To make it possible, we use Bacillus Subtilis as a host; because it is supposed that this bacterium cannot be affected by LALF. Preventing such possibilities during our experiments will help us to get the best and the clearest results. 
On the other hand, we want to apply our anti-LPS factor on a surface as a coat in order to obtain an anti-gram negative bacterial surface. Normally, B.subtilis has the ability to produce biofilm. This complex media may also include some components and protein that are synthesized by bacteria. We think that after the production of LALF, the protein can pass to biofilm with the help of signal peptides we added. As long as LALF remains in the biofilm, the surface that is covered with that biofilm material will not be infected by gram negatives.
The LPS coat of gram negative bacteria is an important reason of endotoxin and septic shock. LALF binds to that LPS coat and inhibits the growth of bacteria. This ability is very crucial and may be very useful considering the diseases and pandemics that are caused by gram negatives. Our project suggests a possible prevention for such circumstances.
Also, by killing spores of B.subtilis on the biofilm surface with aqueous dissolved oxygen, ascorbic acid, and copper ions, we will try to perform a sterilized coating material which will possess a protective feature against infectious gram negative bacteria.

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters will"

UCLA,2016,Team:UCLA#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"-CT), by the expression of a CdiI immunity protein that interacts directly with the toxin to neutralize its pore-forming capabilities. The CdiBAI cluster is common throughout most CDI+ strains, significantly varying only in CdiA-CT and CdiI sequences.
Our project focuses on the translocation of three different CDI systems from EC93 and Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048 (containing two CDI loci) into one lab strain of E. coli to create a super-soldier organism that is able to selectively inhibit the growth of these strains. A lab strain containing CDI EC93, for instance, would be able to target all bacteria containing the corresponding receptor for CDI EC93, which would in this case be BamA Ecoli. In order to target EC93 itself, however, we aim to switch CdiA-CT EC93 with a toxin from ATCC 13048 so that the immunity protein of EC93 does not prevent growth inhibition. It has previously been shown that CdiA-CT regions are modular, and systematically modularizing the toxin region using appropriate restriction sites is another goal of our project. While the CDI system in EC93 targets the BamAEcoli, the relevant receptors in other species of pathogens and even in other strains of E. coli is unknown. An additional facet to our project would be to find the receptors that each CDI system of ATCC 13048 targets by creating a transposon insertion library. Mutants that display a whole or partial CDI immunity phenotype will be sequenced to determine which genes have undergone transposon insertion, providing insight into which receptors may be targeted by ATCC 13048 CDI systems.

Introduction
After the British Petroleum oil spill that occurred off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico earlier this year, it seemed only natural that our team members take an environmental outlook when it came to brainstorming possible research areas. While researching bacteria capable of oil digestion we found that some varieties are in actual fact pathogenic and so if actually used to clean up oil in the ocean, they may result in harm to the environment or wildlife after completion of their function (degrading oil). Armed with this knowledge, we naturally started to envision a project where we would not just create a solution to the problem of oil spills but also engineer a mechanism that could have potential use in any application of genetic engineering. Apart from bacteria in the degradation of oil we believe that our “bio-safety net” must be implemented into bacteria used in many other applications such as for the killing of cancer cells.

Enterobacteriophage T4 Lysis Device
We found that The Berkeley's 2008 iGEM team has created a biobrick [Part:BBa_K112808, with no promotor] that could possibly be used as a means to attain cell-lysis.
Using genes from enterobacteriophage T4 (endolysin-lysozyme, holin and antiholin).
T4 Holin
inner membrane-bound proteins, creating pores in the membrane and thus permeabilizing the membrane.
T4 Antiholin

St_Andrews,2011,Team:St Andrews#modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," would have been to look at the stability of the system and which rate values the model would have behaved as expected or become oscillatory.
We have a number of theories that have been discussed as to the technicalities encountered in the model. The first of which involved the maximal transcription rate constants’ units and the arabinose-AraC complex association constant. These were initially supposed to be in s-1 however the kmaxprodRNA was considered to be in Ms-1, the k1/2maxprodRNA in M and the arabinose-AraC complex in M-1s-1. In order to find the association constant, it was discussed that second order chemical kinetics be utilised and, by knowing the equilibrium constant [1], the association constant could be calculated.
The second theory was that once we have a suggested value for the association constant, we can provide some mathematical estimation in finding the transcriptional rate constants. This is based on whether the equations (1.1)-(1.3), referred to as the AraC cycle, is much faster than the PG-1 cycle, equations (1.4) and (1.5), or even if both cycles perform at similar speeds. If we assume that both sets are of a relatively comparable speed then all terms on the right hand side of the ODEs should be of a similar magnitude and we could choose the constants to show this is true. However, if the two cycles are of differing speeds then the requirement would be to find the equilibrium of AraC cycle, by allowing the left hand side of each equation equal zero. Via this process, the steady value output for the arabinose-AraC (A1AraC) complex could be obtained and then entered into the AMP cycle, therefore creating two separate systems.

Combination of OprF (<bbpart>BBa_K1172501</bbpart>) and the Riboflavin synthesis gene cluster (<bbpart>BBa_K1172303</bbpart>).  Ladder:Thermo Scientific GeneRuler™ 1 kb DNA Ladder
The test restriction yielded positive results. The length of linear pSB1C3 after digestion is 2070 bp.
A combination of the coding sequences from oprF (1298 bp) and gldA (1104 bp) results in a construct that is approx. 2400 bp long. When oprF is under control of the T7 promoter this length increases by 36 bp.
From looking on the gel, we can tell that the bands in lines 3 - 7 and 8 - 13 are consistent with the anticipated results. The bands at about 4400 bp are due to non digested plasmids, since we apparently used not enough restriction enzyme or waited not long enough.
A combination of the coding sequences from oprF (1298 bp) and the rib-gene-cluster (3597 bp) results in a construct that is approx. 4900 bp long. When oprF is under control of the T7 promoter this length increases by 36 bp.
From looking on the gel, we can tell that the bands in lines 16 / 19 and 20 - 22 are consistent with the anticipated results.

Adenoviren hingegen Integrieren sich nicht in das Genom, sind aber stark immunogen. In Viralen Systemen wurden ein Großteil der virealen Gene entfernt, durch Inserts ersetzt und mit ]StufferDNA“ gefüllt. Wichtige Kriterien bei der Wahl des Virus: Transformationsfähigkeit Targeting Permanente oder temporäre Insertion in das Genom

UChicago,2013,Team:UChicago#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," are 7 plates of each kind of antibiotic marker left over; we put them in the 4ºC fridge. We autoclaved all the media that we made today and yesterday.
We transformed the plasmid with promoter Veg (in the pSB1C3 vector) into TOP10 E. coli competent cells. We got the DNA (part BBa_K143012) from well 23B on the distribution kit. The bacteria have been plated onto a chloramphenicol plate. They have been left to incubate at 37ºC in Nora’s lab (GCIS W519).
Future plans:
Select a few colonies and inoculate overnight in 3 mL cultures (These will eventually be used to make glycerol stocks and for DNA miniprep). Do this later on in the day... ~3 pm onwards.
Store the plate in 4ºC afterwards in case it is needed in the future.
Make liquid LB media (no agar!) with 50 µg/mL chloramphenicol.
Wednesday, July 24, 2013
2 colonies were selected from yesterday's pVeg transformants to be grown in an overnight liquid culture. However, we redid the transformation using a slightly different procedure because there were very few transformants:
Let the cells thaw on ice.
Add your plasmid to the competent cells.
Leave on ice for 10 mins.
Place on the 42ºC heat block for 45 s to heat shock.
Put on ice for 2 minutes.
Add 1 mL SOC media.
Incubate in the 37ºC shaker for 1 hour.
Centrifuge at 8 rpm for 30 seconds. Decant all but ~100 µL supernatant and resuspend.
Plate onto chloramphenicol (or antibiotic of choice) plates and use glass beads to spread out the colonies.
Future plans:
Make DH5a competent cells; our poor transformation results could be due to incompetent cells.
Isolate Pveg (for B. subtilis) promoter from transformants grown overnight
Do DNA miniprep of the transformants
Cut w/ EcoRI and SpeI
Run in 0.9% or 1% agarose gel (make gel w/ large wells, load 50 uL of sample)
If there is a band of right size of Pveg, do a gel extraction
Put at -20ºC
If there is no correct band, set overnight cultures of transformants from the transfromation done by Ivan today (7/24/13)

Executive Summary - An overview of our business plan and our company description.  Start here to learn about everything we accomplished this year!
Technology - Use the technology link to learn more about the science behind our Field Ready Electrochemical Detector (FRED) technology and how it was developed in 2012 by the Calgary Collegiate iGEM team!
Intellectual Property - Since our group is developing a company out of a former iGEM project from 2012, it was critical that we handle our intellectual property careful.  Here we look at intellectual property from the perspective of the iGEM competition, protecting our technology through patents and trade secrets, and having the legal freedom to operate by ensuring we had the support of our mentors and supporters from 2012.
Operations - Managing the day-to-day activities of our company is vital for our success.  We must identify strong industry players to collaborate with, and develop our strengths to bring this product to market.  Additionally we engaged key manufacturing players to learn about the technical and business challenges relating to manufacturing.
Marketing - Here we evaluate the potential of our market, the oil and gas industry.  In addition we outline the size of the general toxin sensing market, and deliver a plan for how we can commercalize our technology and deliver it to the market in a time efficient manner.
Management - A company is never complete without it's team!  Here we demonstrate some of the important connections we have made, and the individuals who have become part of the FREDsense team.
Milestones - To ensure that we achieve success in a timely it is vital that we strategically plan our actions.  Here we demonstrate how the future of the company will be directed.

Midt i solskinnet lå der en gammel herregård med dybe kanaler rundt om, og fra muren og ned til vandet voksede store skræppeblade, der var så høje, at små børn kunne stå oprejste under de største; der var lige så vildsomt derinde, som i den tykkeste skov, og her lå en and på sin rede; hun skulle ruge sine små ællinger ud, men nu var hun næsten ked af det, fordi det varede så længe, og hun sjælden fik visit; de andre ænder holdt mere af at svømme om i kanalerne, end at løbe op og sidde under et skræppeblad for at snadre med hende.  Endelig knagede det ene æg efter det andet: “pip! pip!” sagde det, alle æggeblommerne var blevet levende og stak hovedet ud.  “Rap! rap!” sagde hun, og så rappede de sig alt hvad de kunne, og så til alle sider under de grønne blade, og moderen lod dem se så meget de ville, for det grønne er godt for øjnene.  “Hvor dog verden er stor!” sagde alle ungerne; thi de havde nu rigtignok ganske anderledes plads, end da de lå inde i ægget.

Restriction digest and agarose gel of pSB1C3 (BBa_J04450) using the protocol:
Nano-drop the pSB1C3 (BBa_J04450) from previous mini-prep to know volume of DNA to add.
Single digest the pSB1C3 (BBa_J04450) with EcoR1 restriction enzyme.
Run agarose gel electrophoresis to pSB1C3  (BBa_J04450) to check size (estimated size = 3.1 kb).
RESULTS:
We used the pSB1C3 plasmid provided in kit plate 7 (BBa_J04450) which has a reporter protein (RFP) but we don't want the fluorescence as we are using our own FP, therefore we need to transform the one in the linearized plasmid kit and perform digest and gel.

British_Columbia,2012,Team:British Columbia#ConsortiaDynamics_-_-_TEXT.html,"14 hours was not sufficient to reach a final OD in some cases, but there was growth in many of the wells. It was also suggested that we could just test the relevant amino acid concentration using HPLC. One thing that I was wary about concerning this is that the HPLC would only pick up pure amino acid, and if there was, for instance, a short protein fragment, it could be used for growth, but not show up on the HPLC. Any thoughts?
From our previous experiments concerning the consortia syntrophy, we saw that three cultures inoculated straight from LB into minimal M9 led to a mixed culture OD that reached about 1.3, similar to 0.1 mM (saturating) Met for metA-, and 0.1 mM Trp for TrpA-. We suspect that this is due to syntrophy, but have yet to do the relevant tests to see if 1 in 100 LB actually does supply significant amounts of amino acids.

Manchester,2013,Team:Manchester#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," exogenous fatty acid (0.1% and 0.5% stearic acid fed to the delta 9 desaturase batch, and 0.1% and 0.5% oleic acid fed to the delta 12 desaturase batch), left the cultures growing overnight and then harvested the cells.
To analyse the metabolites extracted from both wild-type DH5-alpha and DH5-alpha expressing our delta 9 desaturase and delta 12 desaturase enzymes, we made use of the MIB’s in-house Orbitrap Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). This technique was chosen because of its high mass accuracy and sensitivity. Upon analysing the most abundant metabolites extracted from our expression strains and comparing this data with the most abundant metabolites extracted from wild-type, it is apparent that a massive increase in linoleic acid (incorporated in phosphatidylethanolamines, PE) has occurred. This is demonstrated in the figure above. The chromatograms produced for the delta 12 desaturase expression strains, along with further characterisation, can be found on the Parts page.
Further analysis
The data obtained from the LC-MS was enormous. 2721 metabolites were detected in the samples, and so we filtered this down to the 43 fatty acids and phospholipids incorporating the compounds we were interested in (oleic acid and linoleic acid). A heat map was generated (seen below) showing the abundances of these 43 phospholipids and fatty acids in the 17 samples we run on the LC-MS. From this heatmap the diversity of detected compounds and and high dynamic range can be seen. For the characterisation of our delta 12 desaturase BioBrick construct, a focus on the individual compounds of high intensity was necessary. An example of this can be seen in the bar chart in the work flow diagram below. Here you can see that, when fed with oleic acid (to a total w/v concentration of 0.1% and 0.5%), the amount of linoleic acid found within this representative phospholipid is much higher in the delta 12 desaturase expression strain than in the wild-type DH5-alpha strain. From this data we can confidently conclude that the delta 12 desaturase is converting the substrate oleic acid into the linoleic acid. Currently, the linoleic is incorporated into a phospholipid, but expression of the tesA gene (biobricked previously) would cleave the compound away to give"

Produce of Geraniol and Farnesol
Geraniol production
Geraniol production device ( BBa_K1653027 )
Geraniol is generated through GPP hydrolysis by geraniol synthase. A MEP pathway has been shown to synthesize IPP and DMAPP efficiently in E. coli. E. coli engineered with Geraniol production device (BBa_K1653027) showed different smell as compared with the counterpart control (pSB1C3) and the original strain JM109. This result was obtained by the double blind test following the questionnaire survey. And then we tried to detect that the geraniol generated by engineered E. coli by GC and GC-MS. Geraniol was not detected. These results may suggest that E. coli with Geraniol production device produces less than the lowest limit detected by GC and GC-MS. And geraniol synthetase was not detect by CBB stain. And recombinant E. coli LB21 needed 3 days to grow. There were few coloy in LB plate. These result may suggest that E. coli couldn't grow with few graniol, because graniol has very stong antimirobial.

Team Newcastle '17 Presents...
Biosensor genetic networks are typically encoded on a single plasmid within a single chassis. However, this configuration means that the biosensor can not be easily modified or re-purposed for new applications.
To alleviate these problems, we propose that biosensor networks are split into three whole-cell modules; a detector, a processor, and a reporter.
With this in mind, we have created the 'Sensynova Biosensor Development Framework'. This framework separates each module into individual cells which communicate via quorum sensing molecules. This separation creates an off-the-shelf set of well-characterised cellular modules that can be mixed to form new biosensor applications and configurations. This approach also enables biosensor variants to be made and tested without the need for long and tedious genetic cloning steps. Mixing different ratios of the modules allow the response characteristics of the sensor to be tuned systematically and easily.
We have also included an optional 'adaptor' module. To learn more about our framework, go to our project description page!

In our new version, we abort this design and change the passageway in the box into small holes. Customer can judge whether there are termites by observing whether the holes are blocked.
Trap
The inspiration of our trap unit is from an existing device. The device works like this: Pine put in the device will attract termites and when climbing into the device, they will eat the Toxin accidently and die in or out of the device.
Kill
We want to kill all termites but our toxin will not be influential for a very long period. Our experiment has shown that is it enough to return. Along the same way, termites goes into their nest and spread Toxin to their family.
Total Design (DRAFT 1.0)
Mechanical Parts
Besides functions, we think more to improve our device. We design a box with a removable cover instead of a pressurized cuboid. By this way, customer will clean our device more easily, and it is convenient to reload wood bricks. We also design a wider ring under the cover, to avoid the slide when device shaking
Instruction Manual
Usage
When using the device, customers should place the Attracting Cover with wood to attract more termites. Once they notice the bottom holes are getting smaller, or stuck by termites’ secretion, the Trap Cover should take the place of the attracting cover and the Kill Function works!
Warning
By writing application scenarios, we have already visualized the intended impact of TERMITE TERMINATOR and present Techno-moral vignettes, focusing on the potential wider impacts of our application. According to these unintended scenes, to reduce future risks, a series of warnings have been added to the Instruction Manual can be proposed.
Online Server
Furthermore, we have designed an application to make a Real-time tracking online system. With this application, it does not matter if our customers have any problem using our device. We have thought of putting 14 functions into this application. The functions are listed as follows.
The app has more usage than providing convenience for customers. By analyzing the data about the frequency of downloading the app and buying the baits, we can know lots of information about termites in a certain district, which will be shared on the internet. So people can learn more about our termites and terminate them more easily. We, iGEMers from ZJU, are termite terminators!

Wiki
We've put a lot of work into our wiki this year. The most important part of course is the content. We used Google Docs to write and work as a team - resolving a total over 600 comments. Adam, our student leader who did the bulk of wiki editing made over 1300 edits - and as a result has gone slightly insane.
Several wikis we looked at were inaccessibly written - often lacking good explanations and having little page structure. This is likely down to the last minute rush before the deadline. We started early and spent a long time perfecting our text, so hopefully you find it all makes sense.
Another problem is that previous wikis are slow to load. They often have large swathes of redudant code and uncompressed images are commonly uploaded at much higher resolutions than needed. We saw some homepages well over 10MB! Our homepage is just 0.7MB, and all our other pages are similarly optimized. We've done this by analysing our site with Google's Pagespeed and Lighthouse auditing tools to find where we could improve. We correctly sized and compressed images, reused files so they can be cached and used SVGs where possible for diagrams.
As SVGs can be embedded more easily into the page, page load times are improved as the browser doesn't have to fetch the images seperately. SVGs also allow for infinite scalability allowing our wiki to take advantage of high resolution screens like Apple's 'Retina Displays'. They're also powerful as they allow text to actually be text rather than pixels - allowing screenreaders to read diagrams, improving the accessibility of our wiki. The worst cases we’ve seen are are wikis that are just huge PNGs - they take forever to load, don’t allow you to select text, are inaccessible to the visually-impaired and lack links and citations embedded in the text.

Impractical rules - “House Rule goes”
In Brazil, unfortunately, Biosafety legislation is still far from perfect. It was designed at a different era with a different scientific context in mind - and Brazilian researchers know this, and often find themselves trying to work despite these regulations rather than with them. And we understand and agree with the necessity of biosafety regulations, we are not here to advocate for completely unregulated science. But the problem that arises with regulation that gets in the way of things is pretty evident in Brazil: if it’s too unreasonable, people won’t follow it. What ends up happening, for example, is that “house rules” override these legislation - there are official regulations by Brazil’s Biosafety Technical Committee (CTNBio, we talked to some of them in our Integrated Practices ), but research institutions are free create (and follow) their own biosafety norms based off of the national standard. The institutional biosafety norms, at least in our case, are very carefully crafted by a team of specialists, and these norms are often nearly identical to the national regulations, so they do a good job at guaranteeing that researches are not at risk. But that still sets a dangerous precedent - although institutionally defining and following safety norms is always a good thing, the official legislation should prevent it from depending on a person’s (or a group of people’s) morals and opinions, that’s the whole point of laws.
So, in Brazil, the scenario is basically two things: Brazilian researchers are met with piles and piles of bureaucracy that they must always be dodging to try to get work done, and Brazilian researchers are at the same time at more risk, because the regulations end up getting bent to the point of losing effectiveness.
For our project, our team adhered to the institutional safety norms for the experiments, and we also defined precautions and norms for ourselves to try to ensure we were working in safe conditions. In our Integrated Human Practices , we talked to specialists about the national regulations regarding the release of GMOs, to try to shape our project to fit these guidelines. But, unfortunately, making the national biosafety regulations better and more effective is a very difficult and long-termed task.
Limited Shipment
During the process of shipping our parts to the registry, we met with another example of outdated, research-limiting regulations. The international regulations for shipping of biological material (mainly, IATA’s Dangerous Goods Regulations) are very strict - but also very thorough. Their strictness is understandable, biosafety is a very important issue, and the shipping of biological materials should be very carefully handled. But no"

Restriction Enzyme Digestion for Verification
To verify whether PstI site in pSB1A3 was successfully mutated to AflII site, we performed restriction enzyme digestion experiments.
Bacterial plasmids are double-stranded circular DNA molecules and uncut plasmid DNA can be in any of three forms - nicked circular, linear, closed supercoiled. When run on an agarose gel one frequently will see these forms as different bands with closed supercoiled form migrates the fastest, linear form migrates the slowest, and nicked circular migrates in between. If the PStI site was successfully mutated to AflII site, we expected to see increased linear form of pSB1A3 when digested with AflII. SpeI-cut pSB1A3 was served as a positive control.

Background
Fungal infections
The most common fungal infections are superficial skin, nails and mucosal infections, which are caused in most cases by fungi of the genus Candida. These infections are usually not life threatening and have such common manifestations as athlete's foot and vulvovaginal candidiasis.
Invasive fungal infections, on the other hand, have unacceptably high mortality rates. Patients with a compromised immune system -such as AIDS patients and post-transplantation patients taking immunosupresants- are at special risk as they don't have the usual barriers that prevent invasive infections in healthy individuals.
According to Brown, et al., (2012), more than 90% of the reported deaths caused by fungi are associated with species from four genera: Cryptococcus, Candida, Aspergillus and Pneumocystis, but epidemiological data for fungal infections is poor, as these infections are often misdiagnosed and there is a lack of accurate data from the developing world.
Endemic dimorphic mycoses
The following map is an adaptation of the information presented in Brown, et al., (2012), where the authors make some comments regarding the quality of that information:
1) The data is extrapolated from a few and geographically localized studies
2) accurate data is lacking from the developing world and the calculations may underestimate the true values of the presented statistics.
Hover your pointer over the colored circles to see the data
Opportunistic invasive mycoses

Stanford-Brown-RISD Best Parts Collection
Chitin is ubiquitous in nature in organisms ranging from fungi to insects - in fact, it’s the second most abundant biopolymer on earth. Methods to take advantage of this fact using synthetic biology are limited - we established a part collection using chitin binding domains as a novel platform to functionalize chitin-containing surfaces, with almost unlimited potential for modifying regions of organisms. We demonstrated the utility through designing novel biological cross-linking glues, fluorescent dyes, and filtration tools. We then used Isothermal Titration Calorimetry, strength testing, and various other quantitative methods to conclusively prove the mechanism of action and the ability of this collection to be used for novel applications. We’ve also filed a patent disclosure and are moving forward with further refinement or our framework. The part numbers range from BBa_K2868011 to BBa_K2868028, but not all parts in that range are included in the collection. Our collection forms an important pipeline for future teams and the global scientific community for a wide array of applications ranging from water purification to bioglue production.

In March we hosted our Synbio Speaker Series, an event where professionals discussed their research pertinent to synthetic biology for university students. We continuously create blog and social media posts to share information and our research. In May, Discovery Day in Health Sciences was held at McMaster University, which constitutes a day filled with workshops where secondary school students are able to explore a wide variety of careers in medicine and health sciences. Two of the workshops led by McMasterU allowed students to apply knowledge of cellular structures to laboratory practice where they stained and visualized the cells. Two other workshops we held reviewed the basic structure of DNA approached in the science curriculum, and further applied this to characteristically analyze DNA by gel electrophoresis. These events allow students to elaborate on concepts presented within class, and apply this knowledge to novel and relevant situations in the working world.
The McMaster iGEM blog was initially created in 2015 with the goal of sharing knowledge and research on synthetic biology in a friendly accessible format with the general public. It is geared toward both students interested in research and the general Hamilton community. This year our blog ran a series of infographics in order to help readers gain a better understanding of our project, as well as learn about the science involved. We aimed to make the series engaging and educational with modern graphics and a wide range of topics including DARPINs, electroporation, and quorum sensing. With a growing audience and supporters like PLOS Synbio on social media platforms,"

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Lab_-_-_TEXT.html,"asmid. This is likely because of the toxicity of the gusA gene in E. coli and since we know that  PCdi_thl is the strongest of our promoters in E. coli it is unsurprising that this was the most problematic plasmid to construct. As a result we did not measure the strength of PCdi_thl in C. difficile, but due to its measured strength in C. difficile as well as its widespread use for overexpression studies in Clostridia we decided to select it alongside PCsp_fdx as a promoter to use in the next stage of our project.
Two asRNA constructs were cloned named ‘asRNA Construct One’ [Bba_K2715007] and ‘asRNA Construct Two’ [Bba_K2715008]. Both of these constructs target both toxin genes TcdA and TcdB with asRNA parts of varying length with asRNA Construct Two having longer regions of homology with 50bp of coding region verses 24bp for asRNA Construct One. These constructs were designed with the promoter results in mind, selecting the suspected two strongest promoters in C. difficile. Both constructs were assessed in terms of their ability to reduce C. difficile culture supernatant cytotoxicity on mammalian ‘Vero’ cells. The rate of toxin production was decreased by 80% and 85% by asRNA Construct One and asRNA Construct Two respectively. The main conclusion to draw from this result is that an asRNA strategy is viable for reducing C. difficile strain toxicity. Another conclusion of note is that having a longer region of homology with the target gene does seem to impact on the effectiveness of suppression significantly since asRNA Construct Two has a 5% greater effect whilst having 26bp extra of homology per toxin gene.
The other approach to suppressing toxin production was via a nucleolytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9). Demonstration of this approach did not progress as far as with asRNA because the cloning stage of this project was more time-consuming. While asRNA demonstrated a C. difficile supernatant with reduced cytotoxicity, our dCas9 approach was only validated in E. coli. However, positive results were obtained and future work should continue to pursue this approach. Six guide RNAs were evaluated in terms of their ability to target dCas9 to the toxin promoter region for toxin A (PtcdA). PtcdA was placed in control of the reporter gene gusA allowing quantification of the effectiveness of each guide RNA. Out of the six guide RNAs tested guide RNA 6 displayed the most consistently promising results with"

This should first of all point out the functionality of the yeast’s natural import mechanism and also be the basis for demonstrating our own modeled PTS*, proving our designed orthogonal import mechanism . Furthermore we also aim to optimize the working conditions for the enzymes inside of the reaction room - the peroxisomes. For example to vary the pH with new membrane proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin. To secure this change, we can also check the current conditions by our designed sensors .
There are several methods to verify the pathway’s enzymes. First of all, violacein and several intermediates (prodeoxyviolacein, deoxyviolacein, proviolacein) are colorful and the production in yeast can be visualized easily. Furthermore we added a His-/Flag-tag to the N-terminus of every protein (see geneious plasmid cards) to confirm their expression via SDS page and western blot. After verifying the presence of the enzymes the next step is to test their functionality. Before performing in vivo experiments in yeast an in vitro assay was implemented. For this the three enzyme pathway leading to PDV was reconstructed, testing VioA, VioB and VioE. To enable the best conditions for the enzymes, the pathway was studied intensively and all needed cofactors were calculated and added to the in vitro reaction (see protocol prodeoxyviolacein in vitro assay ). This included FAD, MgCl2, catalase for decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, and the substrate L-tryptophan. The in vitro reaction was followed by qualitative analysis via HPLC and mass spectrometry.
Optogenetic enhancements
Optogenetics provide a useful tool for controlling cellular processes with high spatial and temporal precision. These include the expression of certain genes as well as the interaction or separation of two proteins. As many of our toolbox’s aspects benefit from precise control, we wanted to include optogenetics as a way of increasing its variability. Our plans included optogenetically controlled protein import, control of compartment size and number, and control of product secretion.
Introduction
Our optogenetic toolbox enhancements can be divided into three subgroups: controllable protein import via Pex5, controllable protein import via Pex7 and controllable gene expression. Each of these sub-projects are of different design which will be illustrated in the following.
Pex5 import with LOV2
LOV2 is an optogenetic protein derived from Avena sativa’s Phototropin 1. In its dark state the J$_{\alpha}$-helix"
Tuebingen,2015,Team:Tuebingen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"2% are on the same level as without galactose. Possibly, the cells are not growing efficiently on galactose, or there is a contamination in the galactose that only affects the cells at higher concentrations, causing reduced growth.
The results for pSUC2-nanoluc cells is depicted in fig. 1B. As expected, the signal decreases with increasing glucose concentrations. This indicates lower expression of the nanoluc after glucose addition. Glucose is known to repress the pSUC2 promoter, so it can be concluded that the promoter construct is reliable.
The values for the pSUC2 promoter were also needed for modelling. As the plate reader measures relative units instead of total units, the values between the measurements vary strongly. To correct for this, the values were z-normalised and then fitted (see figure 2). This was then used for the modelling .
Figure 2: Fitting of the pSUC2 repression, measured by luciferase activity.
pGAL induction over time
S. cerevisiae cells expressing the NanoLuc luciferase under the pGAL1 promoter were grown overnight in SC-URA medium supplemented with 2% raffinose. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in SC-URA with 2% galactose or 2% glucose. Samples were taken immediately after resuspension and after every 30 minutes for the first 2.5 hours and then every hour up to 7.5 hours. Luminescence and optical density (OD600) were measured at each time point.
Figure 3 shows the readout of the luminescence normalised to the measure OD600 to ensure comparability.
Figure 3: Galactose induces pGAL-dependent expression. Cells expressing pGAL-nanoluc were cultured with the indicated sugar and luminescence  was measured at the given timepoints. Luminescence is normalised to OD.
Cells cultured in raffinose medium should show a low, but not repressed, expression of the pGAL1 promoter. As expected, after resuspension in glucose medium, the cells show a repression, which normalises to a stable level over time, as indicated by a decrease in luciferase activity. Cell cultured in galactose medium show an increase in luciferase activity, which is due to induction of the pGAL1 promoter and increased expression of the nanoluc.
The decrease in luciferase activity after 30 minutes is probably due to the harvesting and resuspension. After 2.5"

Click here for more information about the strategy to check if the Carboxysome was assembling correctly.
Dundee 2011 strategy to check if a microcompartment is assembling correctly.
Old BioBrick characterization: ssrA tag
The ssrA tags are peptide signals that are incorporated into proteins in the carboxyl terminal that are recognized by proteases, such as ClpX. Enzymes which in the presence of the ssrA degrade the entire protein. These tags consist in an amino acid sequence that binds to the protein SspB, a protein adapter that improves protease recognition of the degradation tag.  At the end of the tag there is a sequence that can vary and it is the one recognized by the protease ClpX. This final sequence is composed of three amino acids; it can be LAA, DAS or LDD (A: Alanine, D: aspartic acid, L: leucine, S: serine). Besides these two tags sequences, it can have; 2, 4 or 8 amino acids, which can change the rate of degradation of the protein labeled.
Diferent sequences of ssrA-like Tags
During 2011, the Dundee iGEM team worked with Pdu, a bacterial microcompartment (BMC) like the Carboxysome. In their project they attached a ssrA tag to a GFP targeted to Pdu. By observing the fluorescence activity of the GFP despite having the degradation tag, they could prove that their BMC was able to protect the proteins from the protease, and thus, prove that their compartment was functional and well assembled. We wanted to replicate the experiment in order to see if the Carboxysome is also able to protect the GFP with the ssrA tag from degradation and by that affirming their hypothesis of formation of the BMC by protection of the GFP with the degradation tag. Also, we wanted to confirm that this brick, from Parts Registry, is functioning properly by observing degradation of the fusion protein containing the ssrA tag.
Under the concept just mentioned, we wanted to test the theory incorporating to our targeting BioBrick that already have the GFP ( BBa_I746916 ) the ssrA degradation tag: moderately fast ( Bba_M0052 ). This tag was chosen because it is not fastest, so it gives the fusion protein time to enter the BMC before being degraded. Eventually we could test the other degradation tags, by modifying induction rates of our constructs.
Thus, when the RuBisCO large subunit joined with the"

Parts Overview
The Tacoma RAINMakers have built two biological arsenic circuits that use a combination of native E. coli and coral genes to detect arsenic ions in solution. The circuits vary in which reporter they produce, either the chromoprotein spisPink (from S. pistillata) or amilCP (from A.millepora). Each circuit contains an Arsenic regulator known as ArsR. The ArsR protein binds to a promoter with an ArsR binding site (PArsR) and inhibits the transcription of the downstream reporter gene. Only in the presence of a transcription factor, which in our case is arsenic, does the reporter become derepressed and the reporter is expressed. This circuit allows us to control chromoprotein expression using a protein sensitive to, and capable of binding with, arsenic ions.

Part Type: Composite
Description: pSB1C3/PcArsR_PArsR-spisPink is an arsenic detection circuit. It is a two-part circuit made up of a series of promoter-gene sequences. The first part of the circuit, PcArsR, contains an E. coli-derived constitutive promoter (Pc), a Ribosome Binding Site, Arsenic Regulator (ArsR), and a Double Terminator. This sequence creates unregulated expression of ArsR. The second part of the circuit contains an E. coli-derived Arsenic Regulator promoter (PArsR), a Ribosome Binding Site, the spisPink chromoprotein, and a Double Terminator. The PArsR sequence has a binding site for ArsR, which blocks expression of the reporter in the absence of Arsenic ions. When Arsenic ions are present the spisPink chromoproteins are produced.

The team also sought information on the necessary papers for the liberation, as well as all the available information about the BioBricks. That being said, our team proposes to iGEM     organization a way to facilitate the kit's inspection by providing some useful information and forms with the future kits. We've listed below the main information and forms to ease the bureaucratic procedures in Brazil:
Uses and applications' declaration: specifying the origins, the importation’s motive, the contents and what the BioBricks will be used for. It's also necessary to inform the workplace where the products will be used,     the University's name, laboratory and responsible chiefs/technicians.
Responsibility term on the importation vinculum to scientific research: it's the most thorough file, which asks for information on scientific records and fabrication code, that wasn't available to the team.
Non-Consent Term: lists the possible application and uses of the imported product.
Payment confirmation of the BioBricks kit: this document is already given automatically along with the iGEM's joining payment.
All the documents must be identified by iGEM Foundation. We also highlight the need for the signing by the ones responsible for importation.
On the links below, we present samples of the files that can come with the kit on the next years. The problems with biological material importation in our country are frequent, and there are law projects being created to make this process easier. In     Political, we discuss more thoroughly how the Brazilian Congress intends to ease the importation of biological material, which spoils scientific researches all over the country.

The issues with G blocks
During the laboratorial activities conducted by team UFSCar-Brasil, we had many problems related to g blocks synthesis and their arrival. First, we had problems with registry parts, such as genes and promoters, which feature a large quantity of cytosine and guanines; or the use of terminators, which naturally forms hairpins, could not be synthesized.
Although the oligonucleotide supplier provided a tool to solve some of these problems, it did not show reliability referent the possibility of problems occurrence during blocks’ synthesis; since, even after the approval of our blocks by this tool, we were communicated, much time after the order placement, that our parts could not be synthesized.
Moreover, due the limit of bases indicated by the supplier to design gBlocks, we divided our parts into different, but complementary, gBlocks;"
