Achievement
The idea behind the work of the transcriptomics group is to try and detect any changes in the gene expression when E. coli is grown alongside strongyles as opposed to just being grown in a normal lab environment. The aim for this undertaking is to find any and all genes which might be expressed exclusively in the proximity to the worms - giving us a prime opportunity to work some biotech magic and find a way to make a diagnostics tool for the strongyle parasites out of that very bacteria gene.
The way we decided to approach this was by running a full-scale transcriptome sequencing on the entire E. coli genome, both in bacteria grown normally and grown alongside the worms. By doing this, we would be able to quantitatively determine the differences in gene expression.
For this, we created an eight-step pipeline starting from lysing the bacteria to extracting their RNA contents, to refining and finally sequencing the genetic material using Oxford Nanopore’s MinION device - which you plug in to your laptop. That same laptop will then be used to understand what exactly is going on in the bacteria.

DNA preparation out of E.coli bacteria (Mini-prep, Midi-prep)
Goal:Frequently used DNA (and RNA coding DNA) is stored as plasmid in apathogenic and nuclease-down-regulating strands of E.coli bacteria and extracted when needed.
Description: Depending of the required quantity, we use different techniques to extract the DNA from the bacteria:
Miniprep: Lysis of up to 5mL of bacterial culture and isolation of plasmids via column purification and repeated centrifugation.
Suitable for desired concentrations between 50-100ng/uL and volumes of up 30uL; mostly used for DNA that is purposed for in vitro transcription.
Midiprep: Lysis of up to 250 mL of bacterial culture and isolation of Plasmids via vacuum assisted column purification and high speed centrifugation.
High throughput method for concentration requirements of 200-400ng/uL and volumes of up to 500-1000uL.
DNA linearization
Goal: Both for cell-free expression and in vitro transcription, plasmids need to be transformed to a linearized form.
Description To this end, we use high fidelity restriction enzymes (e.g. EcoRI-HF). The choice of restriction enzyme determines the number of cuts in the plasmid: This can be either one cut to simply linearize the entire plasmid, or two cuts to cut out the plasmid backbone without any insert. The success of the digest can be verified via gel electrophoresis.
In vitro transcription
Goal:Obtain specific concentrations of purified target RNA need to be added to the sensor test reaction.
DescriptionThe DNA is obtained by transcribing linearized DNA in vitro with a SP6 RNA-Polymerase (RiboMax®, Promega).
This kit requires adding linearized template DNA, RNA polymerase, nucleotides and water into a microcentrifuge tube and incubating it at 37 °C. The protocol allows for transcribing RNA in the range of double microgram from smallest concentrations of DNA template in less than one hour.
RNA purification
We require high RNA concentrations to minimize the volume we have to add to the cell free expression system – too high dilutions significantly decrease its efficiency.
To ensure RNA yields with maximal concentration and purity of salts/contaminants, we don’t use column purification systems but rather rely on phenol-chloroform extraction. This method efficiently separates organic and inorganic phases to get rid of"

An efficient riboflavin synthesis gene: ribB
1 An Introduction of ribB
1.1 The biosynthesis of riboflavin inside E.coli
Riboflavin,also called vitamin B2, can be synthesized by various kinds of plants and animals. The basic synthesis principal is similar, that one molecular of GTP and two molecular of ribulose 5-phosphate undergo a series of enzymatic reaction[1]. However, the operons vary from bacteria to bacteria. At present, we have made the principal clear in most kind of bacterium and in this project, we chose E.coli in which the riboflavin synthetic genes emerge as nonlinear gene cluster and was distributed into nonhomologous chromosome.
Fig 2-A shows the process of riboflavin synthesis and its relevant genes including RibA (coding GTP cyclohydrolase II), ribB (coding 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase), RibDG (coding a kind of bifunctional riboflavin specificdeaminase/reductase), RibH (coding lumazine synthase) and RibE (coding riboflavin synthase). The distribution of these gene can be seen in Fig 2-B[2].
Fig 2-A The riboflavin biosynthesis inside Escherichia coli[2].
Fig 2-B RibA, ribB, RibDG, RibH and RibE inside the E.coli are not on the same transcription unit but separate to different transcription units which have different promoters.
Genes in yellow are related to the synthesis of riboflavin while the grey are not known to be involved in flavin biosynthesis[2].
1.2 ribB and its function
The synthesis of riboflavin is complicated because there are so many genes involved in this process. Besides, those genes are not focus on a same operon. According to some research, ribB is of vital importance to the synthesis of riboflavin which in charge of coding DHBP synthetase and can catalyze the synthesis of 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate[3]. Researches conducted by Danielle Pedrolli and other researchers show that the FMN riboswitch, which is in the untranslated region of 5' terminal of ribB, can regulate the expression of ribB so that it can inhibit the biosynthesis of riboflavin. Thus, the enzyme translated by ribB becomes a limiter of rib"

This part is for expressing a VirA receptor. A medium strong constitutive promoter is used, so there is enough VirA receptor expressed but not too much so the cell suffers from the expression (VirA is a membrane protein). This version exists in a <partinfo>pSB1C3</partinfo> and a <partinfo>pSB1AT3</partinfo> vector.

This BioBrick contains the new, mutated virG which works in E. coli without the rpoA gene from A. tumefaciens which is expressed constitutively and a kanamycin resistance gene which is under the control of a vir promoter. It is used to screen mutants of virA which are on a different plasmid in a <partinfo>K389010</partinfo>-like part and were created by error-prone PCR. The better the VirA receptor recognizes a substance the more resistant the cell is against kanamycin. This device has to be on a plasmid with different ori than the virA which should be screened (different compatibility classes). We cloned this BioBrick into a plasmid with R6K ori which only replicates in pir+ or pir116 strains (e.g.E. coli EC100D), so we can easily seperate the two plasmids by transforming them into strains without Pir protein (e.g"

They indicate that those at greatest risk of infection are the elderly, those with chronic diseases and/or those undergoing invasive procedures. Furthermore, statistics from Northern Health indicate that, in comparison to the Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Public Health Agency of Canada 2015 infection rates of 0.29 MRSA cases per 1000 pt. days compared to Northern Health infection rates, which were higher at 0.37 per 1000 pt. days in 2015 -2016. This demonstrates the burden MRSA has on Northern communities, a factor heavily propelling our project.

W
hy is gene silencing advantageous? The discovery of penicillin in 1928 marked the start of the antibiotic golden age, the following 40 years marked a rapid increase in research and development of new antibiotics. This intense growth saturated the market and lead to our modern, post-antibiotic era. This current era is characterized by concerning rates of antibiotic resistance and a scientific rut, with a 90% decline in the approval of new antibiotics and development of new classes. The scientific rut is perpetuated by a combination of economic, regulatory and scientific barriers. Researchers and physicians alike are looking beyond antibiotics to find a solution to the current antibiotic crisis. Antibiotics, as we have seen, are no longer the solution but a part of the problem as bacteria are able to adapt rapidly to the harsh antibiotics we try to use against them.
We believe this method is superior over antibiotics because it has the capacity to be monitored and altered as needed within hours, whereas antibiotics can take decades to discover.
The nature of DNA evolution is such that mutations must be in sites that will not change the final protein product or regulatory regions, i.e., ribosome binding sites, promoters, and 5’ UTRs. If a sequence does mutate and is selected in the population, our method lends rapid adaptability to evolutionary pressures. When the treatment stops working, the gene of interest can be sequenced, and based on that sequence, the sRNA can be modified accordingly. Furthermore, sRNA mediated gene silencing has shown very promising results in the literature, with knockdown results approximating 99% (Park et al., 2012).

Additionally, the brightness would be susceptible to variations in the availability of luciferin to cells, which might introduce errors, which this construct is meant to reduce! Therefore we decided to use bacterial luciferase. The substrate regeneration enzymes for this are known and present in a single operon, and allow long-term light production without addition of substrate. This leaves the question of the second channel, for which we need to develop a colour change variant. Vibrio fischeri Y-1 strain has an accessory protein which shifts the emission spectrum into the yellow, but unfortunately the protein is unstable above 18 C and is therefore impractical. Site-directed mutagenesis of the luxAB complex has not resulted in any drastic colour changes in the literature. However a paper published in 2011 by Dachaun Ke & Shiao-Chun Tu (Photochemistry and Photobiology, 2011, 87: 1346–1353) demonstrated that by fusing mOrange, (a fluorescent protein) to the luxA subunit at the N-terminus via a flexible linker, an additional emission ""shoulder"" was produced at 560nm, as well as the normal peak at 490 nm. Theoretically, if this luciferase was expressed inducibly and a normal luciferase expressed constitutively, one could take a ratio between 490 and 560 nm as a readout of your input.
We decided to recreate this luciferase fusion by inserting mOrange2 into BBa_K325909 , with the intention of later incorporating that into a construct. In addition, we were given an extremely generous offer of synthesis from DNA 2.0, and we decided that the best use of this offer would be to make a complete reporter construct containing this emission-shifted luciferase. As with the fluorescent construct, this was designed such that it should function in both E.coli and bacillus. As before, pVEG and pSpank were used (although a more sensitive derivative of pSpank, hyperspank was used). Because it would only be present as a single copy when integrated into bacillus, the construct was codon-optimised for bacillus, and strong bacillus RBSes were added, in order to maximise light output.

Composite part Plan B:
This is the same “Plan B” for E. coli but adapted to Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, since it is a natural probiotic organism. Plan B consists of producing a soluble, mutated, gp80 attached to SP1-NSP4. The production of the mutated alpha chain receptor for IL-6 (gp80) will act as an antagonist protein, due to mutations, it will associate with IL-6 forming the soluble IL-6-alpha receptor gp80 complex but it will not bind with human gp130, thus inhibiting the formation of IL-6-alphaReceptorgp80-gp130 complex which leads to inflammation pathways [4]. The construct is codon optimized for L. rhamnosus GG, it has promoters, RBS and terminators that have been used before for L. rhamnosus. It also contains two restriction sites, between the iGEM prefix and suffix, to ligate the Lactobacillus ORI site.
Plan B : BBa_K2760034
The system is first regulated by a spaCBA promoter, which allows the expression of the nsrR repressor protein (of PyeaR promoter) and then the cassette regulates the expression of expression of mutated gp80 with the PyeaR promoter, after it senses nitrosative stress. Reporter fluorescent proteins iLOV and mCherry will help us corroborate expression of both promoter systems. iLOV will be attached to the pBAD-NsrR system and mCherry to the PyeaR-Mutatedgp80 system. The mutated gp80 has a His-Tag (6 histidines) attached to it for purification purposes. It is also attached to a signal peptide for excretion into the media.
For L. rhamnosus
These series of constructs were codon optimized for L. rhamnosus as a way to test whether this signal peptides for secretion that work on E. coli, via the Sec secretion pathway and SRP pathway. They are expression plasmids that contain L. rhamnosus spaCBA promoter, RBS and loop terminator, they also contain HindIII restriction site between the iGEM prefix and SacI restriction to join with the Lactobacillus ORI, and fluorescent reporter mCherry.

After the expression vectors were introduced into BL21 (DE3) strains.
Functional test of AarC
We test two kinds AarC expression intensity (J23100 & J23114. J23100 is ten times stronger than J23114) BL21 (DE3) and control group (BL21 without any plasmids) in the same condition. After adding additional acetic acid and acetate (2mg/mL) in the culture medium 8 hour, we detect the acetic acid and acetate concentration in the medium with HPLC. Because LB medium composition is very complex, we can’t do quantitative analysis, so we give the raw data (Figure 5-10) here and get some qualitative conclusion. The HPLC method is in protocol.

Our project’s aim is to create a toolbox for manipulating and creating customizable peroxisomes as a first step towards synthetic organelles.
By modifying the import machinery of yeast peroxisomes only selected proteins will be imported into the peroxisomes leaving the researcher in full control over the content of the peroxisomal lumen. Furthermore our toolbox will include a secretion mechanism for the synthesized products, various intra-compartmental sensors, modules for the integration of proteins into the peroxisome membrane, as well as optogenetic control for some of these parts for a more precise spatiotemporal control.
As a proof of concept for the functionality of the toolbox and the customizable compartment two metabolic pathways will be integrated into the altered peroxisome: (i) Violacein biosynthesis and (ii) nootkatone biosynthesis. Violacein, a bisindole formed by condensation of two tryptophan molecules, is a violet pigment and thus easy to quantify in the cell. Nootkatone on the other side is a natural compound found inside the peel of the grapefruit, which gives it its characteristic taste and smell. In addition, nootkatone is a natural mosquito and tick repellent that is already being commercially used and industrially manufactured. Unfortunately, the production costs are extremely high. Furthermore, the production of nootkatone inside yeast is challenging as it is toxic for yeast and thus, the production efficiency is rather low. A successful implementation of the synthetic compartment will show increased yields in the production of these compounds and showcase the potential of this approach for similar future applications.
Cloning strategies and the Yeast Toolbox for Multipart-Assembly
While describing our cloning strategies we mentioned several levels, which stand for different stages of our plasmids. They are further described in the work of J.M. Dueber and colleagues, who designed the well established yeast toolkit we used in this project (Dueber) .  The toolkit offers the possibility to design plasmids with desired antibiotic resistances, promoters as well as terminators from standardized parts. It also provides fluorescence proteins, protein-tags and many more useful components as part plasmids. These part plasmids are distinguished in different part types due to their specific overhangs to ensure their combination in the correct order (e.g. promoter - gene of interest - terminator) all in a versatile one-pot Golden Gate reaction without time-consuming conventional cloning steps.

TU_Munich,2012,Team:TU Munich#Modeling#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html," might not be able to find the best fit or even a biologically reasonable fit.
Another issue with this approach is the fact that it provides no information on the shape of the error function in the neighborhood of the obtained fit. Although it is possible to obtain information about the curvature by computing the hessian of the error function, this can be very computationally intensive if no analytical expression is given and only provides local information.
This poses problems if the error function is very flat. Then in the neighborhood of the set of best fit parameters, a broad range of parameters exist, that produce very similar results. This however drastically reduces the significance of the best fit parameters
What is the benefit of assuming a stochastic distribution of parameters?
Usually biological systems exhibit some sort of stochasticity. If the behavior of a sufficiently large amount of cells is observed, it is justifiable to take only the mean value into consideration and thereby assume a deterministic behavior. On the one hand this means we can describe the system with ordinary and partial differential equations instead of stochastic differential equations, which reduces the computational cost of simulating the system. On the other hand this means that we lose the information we could infer from the variance of our measurements as well as higher order moments.
Assuming that parameter are distributed according to some density allows us, to deduce information from variance of measurements, while still describing the system in a deterministic fashion.
How did Modeling affect our work in the lab?
When planning an experiment, the choice of time intervals and concentrations to use was based on the collaboration between Fabian and the experimenter. Here, previous experiments and literature served as guidance during the decision making.
Bayesian Inference
Derivation
Bayes' Rule allow the expression of the probability of A given B in terms of the probability of A, B and B given A.
We can remove the dependence on the probability of B by applying the law of total probability:
Now as we want to get an expression for the probability of the parameters given our measured data, we plug in parameters for A and data for B we get
As the denominator is constant and only needed to normalize the distribution, we will omit this factor in the future.
Furthermore we will call
P(parameters|data): posterior
P(data|parameters): likelihood
P(parameters): prior
The likelihood tells us how probable it is the systems will produce the data from the experiments given the selected parameters according to our model.
The prior gives the probability of our parameters, independent of our model or our data. As the name already suggests, the prior gives the option to incorporate prior knowledge about the distribution of the parameters.

Monthly beekeepers’ association meeting
We thank Mr. Guillermo Rodríguez for inviting us to the monthly meeting of the Cuauhtemoc's beekeeping society where we had our first approach with the beekeeping community. The society consisted of approximately 33 beekeepers and researchers who gave us a warm welcome, listened to our project, and gave us their opinion on particular details that we had to consider or improve. They were happy that young students of other disciplines were interested in their work and  bees,  we  explained  to  them  the  reason  it  was
important for us to talk with them and why we had chosen to work with bees in our project, something that made them curious.
Until that meeting, our project consisted of the production of antimicrobial peptides in Pichia pastoris for exclusively the inhibition of the pathogen Paenibacillus larvae. We planned on using yeasts due to their high capacity to carry out post-translational modifications, similar to the protein folding mechanisms of bees and their ability to secrete heterologous proteins to the environment, in this case, our antimicrobial peptides. The intention was to apply these yeasts in a solution with hexane extract of the plant Achyrocline satureioides which its efficiency against P. larvae has already been shown previously 2, in presence also of surfactins, the surfactin would have a synergistic effect with the hexane extract. Previous studies on B. subtilis have shown that surfactin, a lipopeptide produced by the bacteria, inhibits the pathogens of honey bees, including P. larvae, A. apis and Nosema ceranae.1 This solution would be applied to bee bread, which we knew, the larvae ingested in their diet.
Through their feedback, we evaluated the risks of using yeasts in our product and the risks of introducing GMOs in what is known as ""harmless honey"". They emphasized that an overdose of yeasts would cause a fermentation of the honey and an alteration in the microbiota of the bees which could be counterproductive since this would cause diseases such as American foulbrood to arrive, they recommended us to be very careful with the dose and consider the addition of"

Of the four inoculations set up last night, only the UV+pACYC184 and GFP+pBR322 looked cloudy this morning. Since we don't have any more plungers, the midiprep couldn't be done. The 50mL conical tubes were spun down for 15minutes at 3900rpm. The liquid was poured out, and they were each resuspended in 25mL of PBS. This was vortexed. Then, for each one, 5mL was poured into each of four 25mL conical tubes. This were then used for mini preps. They were spun down for 15 minutes at 3900rpm, the liquid decanted, and then protocol ""Plasmid DNA Purification Using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit and a Microcentrifuge"" was used. The P1 was added, and then they were all moved into centrifuges. The protocol was followed and the four tubes of each were combined after eluting. Each was eluted with 50uL, so there is a total volume around 190uL. They were then nanodropped. The results were: UV+pACYC184: 87.6ng/uL and GFP+pBR322: 109.2ng/uL.  More of the old UV+pACYC184 and GFP+pBR322 was digested with KpnI and XhoI. (GFP+pBR322: 19.9 uL of plasmid which is 150.7 ng/uL, 3 uL buffer, 1 uL XhoI, 1 uL KpnI, 5.1 uL ddH2O.

Plan for continuing codon optimization project is supported by the advisers. Clay updated notebook online as well as the document diagramming the design process of the project.More RBS calculations run. Problem with RBS library calculator at this point is that using no initial condition (only N's in the  constraints field, followed by Pst1) the calculator does not mutate the Pst1 site that needs to be part of the dRBS, but yields very low TIR. Using a strong initial condition, followed by Pst1, the calculator yields acceptable TIR but mutates Pst1. Inserting Pst1 into these calculations after the fact, and then using the ""evaluate"" function of the calculator shows that TIR drops precipitously. Calculations were run in single RBS forward engineering mode to determine max TIR that can be found using only N's and Pst1. Culture of pFTV harboring cells inoculated.

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," the theory, performed inadequately considering the lack of governmental reform to resolve the environmental crisis. Meanwhile, actors participating in the market economy gained prominence as they were increasingly seen as important contributors to reform. Moreover, one of the central elements of the theory is its positive emphasis on the role of technological innovation to solve environmental problems. As a policy strategy, emerging technologies such as genetic engineering, can help carve out a path towards sustainable outcomes, notwithstanding that certain practices such as genetic modification are being confronted with a form of antipathetic vigilance coming from environmental activists. However, as a discursive theory, it mainly envisions a reformist trajectory for industrial society in which the latter puts these technologies to use and contribute to the greening of production and consumption as a way to render capitalism environmentally sound (Mol and Jänicke 2009).
The success of ecological modernisation depends on the extent to which science, business, governments and moderate environmental advocacy groups can collaborate and continue to do this by reforming institutional configurations so that they can operate at a structural level. The capitalist political economy thus remains fundamentally unaltered but the institutional framework for economic performance takes environmental considerations as an inherent part of its policy actions. This, however, does not mean that the environment becomes the main focus of concern. It is rather about serving the needs and preferences of humans so that society can start developing sustainably without having ecological setbacks hindering progress and modernisation. It is therefore important that the aforementioned collaborating entities of society are motivated by their intentions to serve the public good. As reform is expected from politics, non-governmental actors become also increasingly significant in their connections with governmental action (Dryzek 2005).
Risk Society
While ecological modernisation perceives technology as a predominantly positive, the theory of risk society views technological applications in terms of what it means for the distribution of risk in society. In the era of late modernity, risks tend to be described in relation to the difficulty to detect them while at the same time having a possible effect spanning several generations. This makes it difficult to enforce mechanisms of accountability when the technologies constitute an environmental hazard, either intentionally or unintentionally. As the late-modern society was more and more confronted with the prevalence of ecological crises, or as a potential future threat, environmental hazards and growing uncertainties led to a greater attention to risk as a central policy concept for action. With the unfolding of modernisation itself, attempts have been made to exert control on the perverse ecological effects of industrialisation and rational economic performance measures. Traditional political and scientific institutions were increasingly incapable of providing security and certainty, which in turn, undermined the trust"

These components can be bought from any distributor, allowing  teams from across the world to build their own.
In a real-world environment using generic components would reduce production costs due to lower shipping costs by sourcing them from a nearby manufacturer and there is more competition amongst generic components. As such we can’t give direct purchasing links but you should be able to find them online easily.

In order to realize the production of antibodies in prokaryotic cells, we firstly investigate the whole process of antibody production in mammalian immune system and try to simulate the whole process via the methods and concepts of synthetic biology. Finally, we successfully constructed the desired system. The comparison between the key steps involved in antibody generation and corresponding synthetic methods are shown in the chart below.

Module II: Selection of specific antibodies
Project Design
Module 1
Antibodies Library Diversity & Randomicity
The first module is carried out by a novel method called E coli in vivo recombination system. The theoretical and experimental basis comes from the work of Thomas E. Kuhlman and Edward C. Cox. We managed to modify their system, wishing to utilize it for simulation of antibody recombination.
Firstly, we try to insert a DNA segment called”Landing Pad(LP)” into the specific sites of E coli via Att recombination, the manner in which lambda phage integrates its DNA into E Coli genome. Landing pad sequence consists of the following parts(from 5’ to 3’ in the sequence):
1）25bp-long random sequence
2）15bp-long recognition sequence of restriction enzyme I-scel
3)  antibiotic resistance gene used for antibody selection
4)  15bp-long recognition sequence of restriction enzyme I-scel(corresponding to 2)
5)  25bp-long random sequence (corresponding to 1)
After integrating DNA segment of Landing pad into the genome of E coli, we completed the genetic engineering of the"

It is                         given by our experimental data that \(\theta\) is generally optimal between 0.05 and 0.1. Let                         \(b=\frac{K_a}{K_d}\), we can get the relationship:
$$[A]=C_1exp[-K_a(1-\theta)[M_0]t]+\frac{\theta}{b(1-\theta)}$$
In this way we can get the relationship between the residual concentration of the added antigen                         and the reaction time (4):
$$[A]=C_1exp[mt]+n\tag{4}$$
Thus, from the relationship we can predict the relationship between the residual antigen                         concentration and time, as shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b).
(a) One Concentration
The relationships of multiple concentration
Fig.2 Relationship between residual antigen concentration and time                                     when immobilized antigen
Combined with formula (2) inside the grayscale model content, we can obtain the following                         relationship (5), the relationship between antigen fixed time and gray value. As shown in Fig.                         3.
$$Grayscale value=\frac{\sigma_1exp[mt]+\Psi_1}{\beta_0+C_1exp[mt]}\tag{5}$$
Fig.3 Relationship between antigen fixation time and result gray                                 value
It can be concluded that the reaction can be stopped by 90% or 80% of the reaction, because it is                         uneconomical to continue the reaction. At the same time, for the initial antigen concentration                         change, the initial large reaction starts to be fast, while the initial value is small, the                         reaction rate starts to be small; at the same time, the optimum reaction time for the different                         concentrations of the added antigen is about the same, and has little relationship with the                         concentration. Finally, there is a clear relationship between the fixed time of the antigen and                         the gray value.
Adding antigen concentration and adding antibody concentration ratio relationship
In order to the final result was as expected by making the solubility of the configured                         antigen-antibody immobilization solution. It is necessary for us to optimize the concentration                         ratio for them.
After fixing the antigen. For immobilized antibodies, there is a reaction \(β\) and the pattern                         diagram \(ω_2\):

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Degradation_-_-_TEXT.html,"SELF Conference is a TED-like forum jointly set up by CAS Computer Network Information Center and CAS Science Communication Bureau, inviting elites to share new ideas and discoveries. Its name is the abbreviation respective of Science, Education, Life and Future.
This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

Pasteur_Paris,2017,Team:Pasteur Paris#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,": The Ministry of the Environment (which highlighted our event on its website , the Respire association, the Souffle Foundation, Bike in Paris, the Journal des Grandes Ecoles et des Universités newspaper, the Pasteur Institute and the Paris City Hall.
This event was a great success as 108 people registered and nearly 95 participated in the treasure hunt. Like the rest of our project, the security of the participants was our top priority. To do so, we filed a request to occupy the public space with the Paris City Hall and the Paris police headquarters, since our journey passed through places as famous as Notre Dame de Paris, the Pantheon, the Senate, Boulevard Saint-Michel ... At each step of the treasure hunt, there was also a safety officer that could immediately report to the police if there were any accident.
In addition, this event received compliments from the Mayor of Paris, who said on Twitter: ""Congratulations to the team of the @ iGEM_Pasteur for this educational and fun action on the #Pollution of the air"" and was underlined by several national newspapers: Le Parisien and 20 Minutes.
This innovative event has allowed us to establish a dialogue outside the laboratory. Its playful nature has made it possible to remove the barrier of knowledge and discuss in an original way around our project of synthetic biology. We also sent a questionnaire to all participants after the event: we obtained 43 responses, the results of which are presented below.
As we can see, 93% of the participants thought the Fine Particulate Hunt allowed them to learn about synthetic biology and air pollution, and all the participants appreciated the format of the treasure hunting to discover a scientific topic. We also asked other questions about our device and integrated the answers to the design of our product.
A global questionnaire
How is the air pollution issue perceived and how potential solutions for it are contemplated by citizens? We made a survey about the use of synthetic biology to fight air pollution, for which we received more than 2300 responses worldwide, including 1874 from Europe, 213 from Asia, 97 from America, 71 from Africa, 24 from South America and 9 from Oceania. The aim was to better understand the expectations of people concerning air pollution, and to know if the idea of using synthetic biology as a solution would be well accepted. Our second purpose was also a way to teach people about synthetic biology and air pollution.
Design of survey
We divided the questionnaire into three parts: the first one collected information about the participant's profile; the second part asked the participant about his reaction to air"

Panel Discussion
On 14th October 2016 we hosted a Panel discussion on the issues of gender inequality and lack of diversity in science, to conclude our integrated 'Equality and Diversity' work. This was advertised on a variety of different social media accounts as well as on a webpage created by marketing and communications officer Ben May on the University of Exeter website. We created two way communications with the public through a variety of different media: the panel discussion was shown to a live audience, who participated in questions at the end; it was live broadcasted on Xpression FM (campus radio); it was live streamed on XTV (campus TV/Youtube channel). The discussion involved a panel of student and academic representatives who are both held at high regard by students, and distinctly knowledgable about the issues raised. Consequently, the panel discussion informed the public and opened up the potential for future discussion and debate on the issue. It fittingly concluded the integrated work of the equality and diversity section as the issues discussed throughout the student and academic interviews were further analyse and debated, but is also a great example of a quality public engagement activity. Since it was streamed, there was a live chat on Youtube where people were commenting on issues, but it is also now available to watch on the XTV Online channel for future feedback and engagement. You can find more about this here
Richard Dawkins Interview
We were very fortunate, on the 31st July 2016, to meet Professor Richard Dawkins in Exeter and managed to ask him some questions on his research and how best to engage with the public on topics within science. We filmed the interview, which can be found here : Professor Dawkins was in Exeter as he was speaking at an behavioural ecology conference held at the university. Prof. Dawkins emphasised the importance of research in behavioural ecology as it is
the explanation for why we are all here
and described how he felt about the University of Exeter:
I am very impressed with the University of Exeter, I haven’t been here before, it’s a lovely campus and it does seem to be the most thriving university
Prof. Dawkins went on to talk about his role as the first Charles Simonyi Professor for Public Understanding of Science and how we can best engage with the public on science. He emphasised how we have to be careful about the language we use as talking down to the public and not being clear may hinder their understanding of the topic.

UTDallas,2010,Team:UTDallas#Project ProjectOverview_-_-_TEXT.html," characterize the construct. The XylR protein forms a complex with aromatic compounds, which positively regulates the pu promoter. In this way, E. coli co-transformed with these constructs can express GFP and demonstrate sensing capabilities in the presence of aromatics. We successfully characterized the function of the Michigan 2009 construct and demonstrated that it works as expected.
]
The nitrate/nitrite sensor builds on parts submitted by the Edinburgh 2009 team. This includes a fusion of the nitrate/nitrite-inducible pYeaR promoter and GFP. The pYeaR promoter is positively regulated by the presence of nitrates/nitrites, thus driving the transcription of GFP. This work improves the characterization of these parts by expanding on sensing capabilities using GFP and RFP reporter systems and induction by a variety of nitrate/nitrite compounds.
]
The alkane sensor includes components of the alkane metabolic pathway of Pseudomonas putida OCT. The promoter region pAlkB drives the transcription of the alk gene cluster. AlkS, its transcription factor, is encoded by the alkS gene. We ordered oligonucleotides from Sigma-Aldrich containing the appropriate sticky ends for the fusion of pAlkB to a fluorescent protein part to form a reporter construct. A plasmid containing alkS was kindly provided by Dr. Jan Roelof van der Meer of the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, who helped pioneer luminescent whole-cell biosensors. AlkS binds to n-alkanes to form a complex that positively regulates the pAlkB promoter to drive the expression of fluorescent protein. The two plasmids containing the promoter/fluorescent protein fusion and the AlkS transcription factor were to be co-transformed into DH5a to characterize sensing capabilities. Unfortunately, we were unable to realize the alkane sensor component due to issues with the ligation of the ordered oligonucleotides to the iGEM backbone. We tried various other approaches including ligation after dephosphorylation of the vector and phosphorylation of the insert as well as blunt-end ligations. After a number of trials, pAlkB failed to properly ligate onto the iGEM backbone. We assess that this was due to compatible sticky ends that caused it to repeatedly self-ligate.

The absorbance maximums for the pink and green mutants were also shifted as expected, to 576nm and 609nm respectively (Figure 5). When standardised for protein concentration, the peaks for the pink and green mutants were not as high as for blue or purple (Figure 5), indicating that the chromoprotein colour is not as strong.
Figure 5. Spectrum scan of the extracted protein from the different coloured amilCP mutants. Protein concentration is equal between all samples.
The spectrums were then adjusted mathematically to have the same peak absorbance of 1 (Figure 6). This revealed that the purple and pink mutants have spectrums similar to the wild type, however, the green mutant had a second peak at about 314nm (Figure 6). This is out of the visible spectrum, and likely just due to contamination of the sample by cell membranes. The main peak at 609nm accounts for the green colour, since 609nm is within the red part of the spectrum and so would lead to the sample being seen as green.

Input:
The duration of the activity of the enzyme on the bead could be a problem.
Adjustment:
We looked further into the implementation of a recovery and recycling system, which would increase the perseverance of the enzyme in wastewater. This system should wash the beads and bring them back in the system in a continuous flow.

Description: We investigated the role hospitals play in pharmaceutical pollution and wanted to know if our idea would be feasible more upstream at hospitals.
Input:
Hospitals and elderly homes are not the biggest source of pharmaceuticals. The sum of domestic use of pharmaceuticals come together in municipal wastewater treatment plants.
Hospitals in Sweden are beginning to investigate how to treat their wastewater and search for future solutions.
Adjustment:
We were supported in the idea to find a sustainable solution for the rising problem of pharmaceutical pollution.
We investigated the implementation of our solution upstream of the sewage system but continued to focus on municipal wastewater treatment plants since it is a more centralized approach.

Description: Astrazeneca was one of the first pharmaceutical companies who installed a private wastewater treatment plant. They gave us important insights regarding the properties needed to treat water with a high amount of pharmaceuticals.
Input:
Astrazeneca uses a separated tank for the inflow of activated carbon.
Our concept is very interesting but needs an inflow system for our beads and an element for their recovery.
Adjustment:
We worked on the implementation of a separated tank, where the beads can be kept, washed and brought back into the system over an inflow system.

Gene Cloning
Salmonella typhimurium LT2 has two glucose-specific transporter systems, PTS system and sodium/glucose cotransporter. PTS system contains two subunits IIA encoded by crr and IIBC by ptsG which are assembled to a high-affinity active transporter. The other is a Na+/glucose cotransporter encoded by STM1128 that contributes to facilitated transport with lower glucose affinity. We decided to genetically engineer microbes with these two systems.
In order to express the genes in E. coli for demonstration and in probiotics for proof-of-concept in a real world. We chose promoter CP29 that is a strong constitutive promoter working well in both E. coli and Lactobacillus spp1. The biobrick part, CP29-RBS-aeBlue (BBa_K1033280) was used and to be assembled with the transporter genes.
Problem 1.
– Optimized DNA sequences can’t be synthesized
Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT) contributes to synthetic biology community and is kindly providing free DNA synthesis service for iGEM teams every year. We first designed the genes by optimizing the gene sequence for expression in both E. coli and Lactobacillus spp. and expected to acquire gene synthesis from IDT.
Three weeks passed, IDT has tried hard but not made the synthetic gene successfully. In the end, we knew that it’s probably because the overexpression of glucose transporter genes are somehow toxic to E. coli. Therefore, IDT can’t synthesize the genes which are linked"

We usually discussed projects, rules of iGEM competition and Synthetic Biology with NJAU_China iGEM team, and gave some advice to them both on dry and wet experiments. When we knew NJAU_China iGEM team needed to synthesize a 2.4kb gene, gshF, which would cost over ￥7,000 ($1,200) through gene synthesis company, we provided a protocal which can direct people to synthsize gene with short single DNA oligotides (about 50-60 bp). The method mainly consists of single DNA oligotides designing and synthesizing by company, assembly, PCR amplification, transformation, check, sequencing and point mutaion( sometimes necessary). It takes similiar time length and 1/3-1/2 times less cost than synthesizing through company.

Alberta government researchers.
We were able to get in contact with Dr. Rassol Bahreini, an apiculture research scientist with the Government of Alberta who was able to advise us on our lab procedures in working with bees
Beekeeping community
Through our research we quickly learned that the Albertan beekeeping industry is the largest in Canada. Alberta’s honey is also world renowned, because of its light colour and mild taste. [2] A large part of the success of a the beekeeping community is their organizations. As  Ursula put it, “beekeeping is the poor cousin of farming”. As  a result, the beekeeping community depended on themselves and each other. They do this through various organizations that provide community and advocate for beekeepers. Thus, we got in contact with beekeeping associations. This provided us with the perspective of beekeepers as well as commercial perspectives. Team UAlberta also felt it was important to get in contact with these groups, learn from them, and receive their support.
We first got in contact with was the Calgary Beekeeping Association. This is how we met Elizabeth Goldie, who was instrumental in the idea generation of our project. She also said that personally, she and many others would be thankful for any solution to Nosema. The organization also got us into contact with dozens of beekeepers, provided information regularly about how to care for bees in our lab and in general, and gave us their support.
Next, we got in contact with the Alberta Beekeepers Association. This is a group that advocates for commercial beekeepers in Alberta. We met with a member of their board, Connie Phillips, who we bounced ideas off of about the finalization of our project. She helped us by providing solutions for real world implementation of this project, gave us contacts, and endorsed our project by providing financial aid. We are going to continue to build a relationship with this organization by presenting at 85th Annual Conference and Trade Show for the Alberta Beekeepers association, on November 5th.
Finally we spoke with members of the Canadian Honey Council.
Overall these groups were very helpful by providing contacts, and fielding questions about real world implication.
How we are giving back?
Human practices decided that we wanted to give back to the community that gave so much integral information in the development and formation of our project.
The first major way that we gave back to the community was through our documentary.   The  documentary allowed us to continuously speak to those who would be affected by our project, and learn about them. It  was also important"

Prepare columns
Insert a GenElute Miniprep Binding Column into a provided microcentrifuge tube, if not already assembled. Add 500 μl of the Column Preparation Solution to each miniprep column and centrifuge at ≥12,000*3 g for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Discard the flow-through liquid.
Transfer the cleared lysate from step 3 to the column prepared in step 4 and centrifuge at ≥12,000*3 g for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Discard the flow-through liquid.
Add 750 μl of the diluted Wash Solution to the column. Centrifuge at ≥12,000*3 g for 30 seconds to 1 minute. The column wash step removes residual salt and other contaminants introduced during the column load. Discard the flow-through liquid and centrifuge again at maximum speed for 1 to 2 minutes without any additional Wash Solution to remove excess ethanol.
Transfer the column to a fresh collection tube. Add 100 μl of MilliQ water to the column. Centrifuge at ≥12,000*3 g for 1 minute.

Purification of plasmids for mammalian cells
Materials
EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit from QIAGEN was used to purify plasmids for use in mammalian cells.
Procedure (according to manufactures protocol)
Pick a single colony from a freshly streaked selective plate and inoculate a starter culture of 2–5 ml LB medium containing the appropriate selective antibiotic. Incubate for ~8 h at 37°C with vigorous shaking (~300 rpm).
Dilute the starter culture 1/500 to 1/1000 into selective LB medium. For high-copy plasmids inoculate 100 ml medium, and for low-copy plasmids, inoculate 250 ml medium. Grow at 37°C for 12–16 h with vigorous shaking (~300 rpm).

What are your plans after university?
I am really looking forward to working with research in medical biotechnology. It will be nice to earn some actual money. Alternatively I will start a PhD if I can find anything that I am super excited about.
Why did you join iGEM?
For me it seemed like a valuable opportunity to get some hands-on experience in a life science project. Also I found it a great opportunity to get settled into the laboratory environment which will be useful later. I would like to add that after years of studying its nice to get somewhere and see the product of your own invested time. To have an opportunity to test you own ideas and work with other interested people is truly awesome.

Bielefeld-Germany,2010,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project#References_-_-_TEXT.html," sensor while VirG is the intracellular response regulator ( Wolanin PM et al., 2002 ). The two genes for the sensing system are virA and virG ( Stachel SE and Nester EW, 1986 ) which are constitutively expressed at a basal level. VirA is a histidine kinase. An autophosphorylation occurs at the His-474 residue, after sensing the phenol 3,5-dimethoxyacetophenone,  acetosyringone ( Huang Y et al., 1990  ; Jin SG et al., 1990a ). In the next step in the signal transduction cascade, the phosphorylated VirA leads to the transfer of the phosphate to Asp-52 residue of VirG ( Jin SG et al., 1990a  ; Jin SG et al., 1990b  ; Pazour GJ and Das A, 1990 ). VirG is the response regulator of the two-component system (Brencic A, Winans SC, 2005) and acts as a transcription factor. Hence it binds to the virulence box (vir Box) containing promoters, for example the virB promoter ( Jin SG et al., 1990a  ; Pazour GJ and Das A, 1990 ).
VirA receptor structure
The VirA receptor consists of 829 amino acids and is a transmembrane protein in the inner menbrane of A. tumefaciens ( Melchers LS, 1989 ). VirA spans the inner membrane, with two transmembrane domains, a large periplasmic region, and a large C-terminal cytoplasmic domain ( Banta LM, 1994 ). VirA directly senses the phenolic compounds for vir activation ( Lee YW et al., 1996 ). Therefore the linker domain is essential for induction by phenolic compounds ( Chang CH and Winans SC., 1992 ). The linker region is located in the cytosolic site at position 280 to 414 ( Lee YW et al., 1996 ). This region between the amino acids 283 and 304 was highly conserved in four different strains of Agrobacterium, and therefore likely to serve as the receptor region for the phenolic inducers which are common to all four strains ( Turk SC et al., 1994 ).

SU8 Training for Lilia, Vincent, and Douglas. We made one complete flow wafer.
Work done, initially on four blank wafers:
O2 plasma stripped
SU8 spin-coated + baked. Most wafers had defects (bubbles, or even comets).
UV exposure of flow pattern
The best wafer was post-expose baked. The others were left unpolymerised
Developed in PGMEA. The three non-baked wafers are now stripped and blank again.
Valid wafer verified by optical microscopy and contact profilometry. Some dust contamination, will need to be blow-cleaned before PDMS moulding.
The three other wafers can be cleaned and re-used (SRD, Piranha solution, 02 plasma strip).

Kyoto,2016,Team:Kyoto#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," prepared the membrane fraction from the E. coli lysate by ultracentrifugation, and solubilized them using 7M guanidine-HCl, then purified the target protein using Nickel Sepharose that specifically binds to his-tag (Fig9).
Fig9 Nickel Sepharose purification of His tag proteins after ultracentrifugation of E. coli membrane fraction.
Fig10 His tag proteins from membrane fraction.
Membrane fraction was solubilized and used for Nickel Sepharose purification and precipitates were examined by Western blotting using anti-His tag antibody. The bands corresponding with INPNC-His-scFv (63 kDa) INPNC-His-CBDcex (47 kDa) were observed in their respective lanes, while the bands corresponding with BclA could not be observed. Marker, Negative Control ( BBa_K165002 ), BclA-His-CBDcex (17 kDa), INPNC-His-CBDcex(47 kDa), BclA-His-scFv (33 kDa), INPNC-His-scFv (63 kDa), Positive Control ( BBa_K875004, 43 kDa )
The bands appearing in lane BclA-His-scFv and INPNC-His-scFv at 43 kDa are spillover from the Positive Control.
We concluded that INPNC-His modules can be detected and purified using His tag, even with the passenger protein fused directly downstream. This is a significant enhancement to the INPNC parts submitted by Penn2012, BBa_K811005 . Thus we registered and submitted this new part to the iGEM Registry, BBa_K1933001 . The results shown above also confirm INPNC-His-(passenger protein)'s expression, and suggest they are expressed on the cell surface as expected.
3-2 Secondary Stage: We successfully observed the binding of NoVLP to surface expressed scFv expressing E. coli
1. Sample preparation and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
In 3-1 we established a system of surface expression using INPNC-His module. The essential part of Noro-catcher lies in its binding to the NoV using surface expressed scFv. Thus, we decided to test scFv's ability using NoVLP. We first conducted a Western blotting for NoVLP using anti-NoVLP antibodies (Fig11). The NoVLP and anti-NoVLP antibodies were kindly given to us by Dr. Daisuke Sano"

To do so they have created a series of educational videos which they have translated into many regional languages for people all over the world. In collaboration with them, we contributed by translating their videos into Marathi and Urdu, two widely spoken languages in our country, India. It was a fun and enriching experience! Find the Urdu video here and Marathi video here .
Science Sketch: NYU Abu Dhabi
NYU Abu Dhabi came up with the very creative idea of explaining the concepts and applications of synthetic biology to the world using simple, interactive animated sketches. They aimed at making a collaborative educational playlist with videos from teams all over the world, with the science sketches explaining about their projects and/or the scientific principle behind their project. Towards this collaboration, we made our very own sketch video describing our project and its applications.

Booklet Translation: Washington University
Team Washington this year created an outreach activity booklet with activities meant for schoolchildren. They wanted to be able to share this booklet with the iGEM community so that outreach becomes more accessible to every team. As a contribution to their effort, we helped them translate a part of their booklet into Hindi, a widely used language in our country. The translated part of the booklet can be found here .
Human Practices: IISER Mohali
Collaboration with IISER Mohali was focused on sharing valuable local information pertaining to our project. IISER Mohali gave us information about the farms, type of crops grown, amount of fertilizers used by farmers and common diseases seen in crops. They also informed us about the knowledge of phosphate solubilizing bacteria in the farming circle. They asserted that plant disease is not a problem for farmers but weeds are. Also they informed us that there is no knowledge of phosphate solubilizing bacteria among farmers. The information provided by them helped us shape our project towards the application of plant nutrition, and try to find a solution to curtail the growth of weeds.
Displaying our project on a global platform: ECUST China
Wechat Subscription is a platform available to everyone on which we can publish articles called WeChat Push, and Team ECUST is running a subscription about iGEM. Team ECUST in collaboration with us graciously converted our submitted project description to the standard format required by them and published our description as a WeChat Push article. They even translated our article to Chinese. The English version can be found here and the Chinese version can be found here . In this way, our project reached many people in China.

The final team participants were decided
17.03.12:
Information meeting for the participants
Two of our advisors had a meeting with us to talk about our previous experiences and our expectations.
19.03.12:
The first meeting with only team members
We talked about scheduling and organization. It was important for us to have a common communication platform that is easy to use and works well with several users. We decided that Facebook would work for now, for discussions and announcements, and Google Docs/Drive for documents. For scheduling meetings we decided to use Doodle.
In addition, we also discussed different subjects for our project, talked about the teams expectations and how to help each other.
29.03.12:
iGEM team registration accepted and registration fee paid
31.03.12:
Registration of team members individually
09.04.12:
Team Meeting
We discussed and limited our subjects and problems. We talked about the wiki site and how we would like it to look.
16.04.12:
Team Meeting
Talking and discussing the different topics. We voted for the best topic and began a discussion about how it should be approached.
24.04.12:
Team Meeting
Project organization. The team met to discuss our subjects before meeting with our supervisors.  We tried to limit our subject choices. When our supervisors joined the meeting, we did a round of “meet and greet” between the participants and the supervisors. Afterwards, we did a short presentation for the supervisors of our chosen subjects. We decided that the aim of our next meeting should be to decide on our final subject for the project. The team members all chose an idea they wanted to present for the rest of the team so that we could make our decision."
Imperial,2014,Team:Imperial#EColi_-_-_TEXT.html," function to tune RBS strength output to better preserve the natural stoichiometry.
Finally, in order to allow for even more customizable fine-tuning of the system, the operon was divided and cloned into two separate expression vectors: the AcsAB element was cloned under the control of the inducible pBAD promoter contained within pSB1C3, a high copy plasmid that would contribute to higher expression of Cellulose Synthase. Alternatively, AcsC and AcsD, believed to be expressed at lower levels in G.xylinus, was put under the control of the pLAC promoter and was transferred into a low copy plasmid, pSB3K3 so as to maintain lower levels of expression. This approach provided the following advantages:
Reducing the size of the final expression vector avoids complications during assembly and vector take-up, and it also prevents a large construct from becoming a burden for cell growth and vector propagation.
By expressing the cellulose production machinery from two separate expression vectors, the following levels of control become available to us: the first being the changes in vector copy number, which directly affects gene expression levels throughout induction, and the second being the ability to activate the system using two different inducers. These key features of our system allow for a larger scope for fine-tuning and optimization of cellulose production levels.
Figure 3: pSB-pBAD-AB and pLAC-CD
Figure 4: acsABCD fragments
With this approach, we allow for our system to be implemented in new range of hosts because a larger set of growth conditions, inducer concentrations and growth phases can be tested in order to achieve the required stoichiometry for the system to become functional.
In order to ease synthesis, the operon sequence was split into 4 fragments of similar sizes. We took advantage of the presence of two restriction sites: An NcoI present within the AcsAB sequence, and a PvuII site contained within AcsC. Furthermore, the BioBrick prefix and suffix were included and any additional sites removed elsewhere.
By standard cloning, these fragments could easily be put together to yield the following constructs:

Gene Designer served as a very useful tool for assembling constructs and predicting cloning outcomes before proceeding with the experimental procedure. Find above the plasmid maps of our resulting constructs, and refer to Materials and Methods for a deeper insight into the assembly process.

We assumed 63% of the cancers we detected would be in stage 1 as in the National Lung Screening Trial [18] We then assumed that the detection of the other cancers would be evenly distributed through stages 2-4. This is unrealistic for a mass screening programme, as cancers not picked up in stage 1 would likely be picked up in stage 2. This would decrease the cost per QALY as the probability of cure in stage 2 is higher than the average of stages 2-4 and treatment in stage 2 is cheaper than the average cost of stages 2-4. [19] Therefore our model would underestimate the cost effectiveness of our sensor.
In terms of a screening tool, sensitivity relates to the false negative rate, while specificity relates to the false positive rate.
A 100% sensitive test will always pick up the disease but may also pick up patients that do not have the disease (no false negatives).
A 100% specific test will never pick up healthy patients but may also miss patients that do have the disease (no false positives).

Low Sensitivity

A highly specific test will have lots of false negatives but few false positives. Switch to high sensitivity .
Sensitivity was taken as 100%, as with appropriately set cutoffs our tool would identify everyone with NSCLC. This is likely to prove untrue were our test to be validated with miRNA levels in a large patient cohort - though sensitivity would still be very close to 100%. Therefore, P(False negative) = 0. However, we included it in the calculations anyway, as later we show that even if sensitivity was significantly less than 100% our test would still be cost effective. We assumed as a lower bound that false negatives will not survive - in reality, some will be detected at a later stage and survive - but were we to have included that, it would have resulted in additional QALYs gained not due to our sensor, meaning we chose to exclude them.
The specificity of our test would be 84% when sensitivity is 100%. [20]

Next we considered whether the wildtype lacZ from V. natriegens has a functional alpha subunit. If it exists, the 𝛼-complementation would not work anymore. To check this, we aligned the alpha subunit with the lacZ gene of V. natriegens (Figure 5). You can see that many parts of the subunit are missing, but a few sequences are conserved. To avoid that it can come to a complementation, we wanted to delete the part in our VibriClone. Since it appears that the entire lacZ may be nonfunctional, we decided to bring the amplified lactose operon on this place.
To achieve that we build a cassette consist of the upstream and downstream regions of lacZ and the lactose operon from DH5𝛼. The lactose operon of E. coli has a size of 6326bp. Since that is very large we decided to use smaller homologous flanks. It was shown that the natural co-transformation work well with 1000bp flanks, so we use this size. Otherwise the linear DNA Fragment has a size of ~12000bp. Thus, it is possible for us to introduce the lactose operon by cotransformation as an unselected product with the other described products.
With this kind of genome modification, it is possible for the entire scientific community to immediately recognize a successful transformation with VibriClone. This would save not only through the fast growth rate but also through the method of cloning an incredible amount of working time.
Outlook
After developing the first cloning strain of Vibrio natriegens to fully replace E. coli as the most used cloning host in synthetic biology, we asked ourselves what would be the next step. VibriClone provides a starting point for further improvements for instance in case of special cloning application. When we created this strain we completed a full round of the design build test cycle and as we want to bring engineering into biology we started with the next cycle by designing VibriClone 2.0.
Therefore several different strains should be established in parallel to full fill the demand for more specialized applications. For E. coli several different strains exist, which are utilized for example for different sized constructs (TOP10), for allowing genome engineering tool, such as MAGE (mutS deficient), for in vivo mutagenesis, for toxic gene cloning or for preventing unwanted methylation.
In the beginning of our project we did next generation sequencing for our Vibrio"

Wen Wu
Wen (Wenny) is in the second year of her Master in Biotechnology. She is our team captain and apart from that she keeps herself very busy by helping out in the Sponsor, Wiki and Human Outreach team. In the lab Wenny works on the expression of fungal growth inhibitors in Pseudomonas putida. Next to those official tasks she made it her duty to give motivational speeches from time to time. Wenny struggles with a severe genetically based alcohol intolerance and total unawareness if irony and sarcasm. Additionally, Wenny thinks she is taller than all twelve-year olds but statistically speaking, she is taller than a few twelve year olds.
How will we remember Wen:
“Pink fluffy unicorns, dancing on rainbows.”
Bob van Sluijs
Bob, Bobo or Robert (he isn’t quite sure if he likes that one, though) just finished his Bachelor in Biotechnology and will start his Master in Biotechnology this fall. Within the team he works on the modeling of the kill-switch and he is one of our two PR-persons. With Bobo around it never gets boring. He entertains the team with anecdotes about his time as a diving instructor in Australia or awkward situations during dates. If you meet Bobo at the Jamboree ask him for a funny story, he will not disappoint.
How will we remember Bob:

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Tag-Optimization_-_-_TEXT.html," indigoidine production in relation to the cell growth can be conducted.   Background correction i. e. the contribution of the culture medium to the OD measurement is achieved by subtracting the mean of pure culture medium replicates from all OD values measured ( Fig. 14 ).
Figure 13: Multiplot Illustrating the Quantitative Indigoidine Assay Based on OD Measurement The diagrams were generated based on data from absorption spectrum measurements of E. coli liquid cultures expressing a functional indigoidine synthetase (a) and a nonfunctional indigoidine synthetase (b). The absorption spectrum measurement was performed at 30 °C every 30 minutes over 30 hours in a Tecan infinite M200 plate reader. The plots shown show representative results to illustrate the principle of the indigoidine assay. a) Absorption spectrum of an E. coli liquid culture producing the blue pigment indigoidine. Each color refers to a measurement at a certain timepoint - starting from t = 0 (dark blue) to t = 30 hours. Note that the graphs develop a local maximum at around 600 nm over time, which corresponds to the absorption maximum of indigoidine. b) Absorption spectrum of an E. coli liquid culture expressing a nonfunctional indigoidine synthetase (a part of the indigoidine synthetase gene has been replaced by a randomly generated sequence). This absorption spectrum was used as a negative control. Note, that the graphs are stricly monoton in every measurement. c) The dot graph shows the ratio of the absorbance at 590 nm and 800 nm of a liquid culture producing indigoidine. The red graph was generated by linear regression of the OD590/OD800 graphs of negative controls as described in b). The OD590/OD800 ratio of the liquid culture producing indigoidine (black dots) differs from the linear behaviour of the negative control due to the production of indigoidine, which disproportionally increases the absorption at 590 nm. The OD590/OD800 ratio of an E. coli negative color (red graph) shows to be constant. Therefore, a constant factor has been determined, allowing to calculate the OD590 by multiplying the OD800 of a liquid culture with that constant factor (see Quantitative Indigoidine Production Assay - 2. Data Analysis). d) The graph shows the amount of indigoidine in an E. coli liquid culture expressing a functional indigoidine synthetase.

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

ShanghaiTech,2018,Team:ShanghaiTech#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," Kyoto, it was unavailable for us to learn what they had used as control group to test the inhibitory effect of their version. Hence we were unable to visualize the difference between two versions of pT181.
As an alternative, we tested the inhibitory effect of these two pT181 by picking five InterLab plasmids with different strength as control group. Under the same cultivation environment and using same promoters and RBS, the expression efficiency of our optimized pT181 is extreamly higher than that of the Kyoto pT181. (Lack of detailed explanations)
This is how InterLab data is used in our comparison experiment. The general applicability and simplicity of our operation mode should be continued.
Meanwhile, the expression quantity of the InterLab plasmids can be used as a measurement criterion to compare the performance of our repressive part to other repressive parts.
We strongly recommend future iGEM teams to use bacteria from InterLab as a standardized control group measuring the performance of their parts, especially repressive parts. With the plasmid fluorescence strength chart as a medium for different labs testing their parts, a globalized performance classification system can be formed.

UC_Chile,2012,Team:UC Chile2#Cyanolux#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"cent behavior in various prokariotic organisms such as Vibrio fischeri and Photorabdus luminescens 12 . In V. fischeri, the operon is composed of 8 genes: LuxA and LuxB encode for the monomers of a heterodimeric luciferase; LuxC, LuxD and LuxE code for fatty acid reductases enzymes and LuxR and LuxI are responsible for the regulation of the whole operon 13 .
Lastly LuxG is believed to act as a FMNH2 dependent FADH reductase, although luminescence is barely affected in its absence 14 . The n-decanal ( n= 9 to 14) substrate oxidization to n-decanoic acid by the LuxAB heterodimer is coupled with the reduction of FMNH to FMNH2 and the releasing of oxygen and light.
The carboxylic group of the product is then reduced to aldehyde by CDE proteins allowing the reaction to start over 15 .
LuxAB genes have been widely used as reporters dependent on the addition of n-decanal to the culture media 16 and in 2010, the Cambridge iGEM team engineered LuxABCDEG to an E. coli-optimized biobrick format, uncoupling it from the LuxR and LuxI regulation.
As a team we decided to work with this operon for a number of reasons, first of all, the luminescence produced by this pathway is much more visually appealing than other systems from the registry (i.e XFPs), moreover, the light production doesn´t depend on a single peptide but on a whole pathway involving several genes, which makes it much more tunable, for instance, decoupling in time the substrate recovery from the luciferase reaction itself.
Experimental Strategy
We have devised different strategies to achieve bioluminescence controlled under circadian rhythms. Here we describe the strategies used for building the constructs to reach our goals.
Splitting the Lux operon and choosing promoters
We decided that we would separate LuxAB (the luciferase part of the operon) and LuxCDEG (the substrate producing enzymes LuxCDE with LuxG the FMNH2/FMN reducing enzyme) to allow phase-dependent expression of the parts. Using specific promoters of Synechocystis PCC. 6803 we can have fine-tunning of the production of bioluminescence. Recent work on global gene expression in Synechocystis aided on finding adecuate promoters 7 , 8 . (Images at right from"

BGU_ISRAEL,2016,Team:BGU ISRAEL#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," non-toxic compounds that can be used by the bacterium for energy in the TCA cycle.                                 This way, the degradation process does not release any pollutants or toxins to the environment other than the                                  carbon dioxide and water bacteria produce in their own metabolic processes.
In order to ensure the safety of our product, we integrated into our design the self-destruct mechanism developed                                 by the 2013 Ben Gurion University iGEM team . With this mechanism, not only the expression of our genes will be dependent                                 on an IPTG inducer, but it will also force our E. coli to be fully dependent on an unnatural amino acid (UAA).                                 Without supplying it to the bacteria medium, or in case of release to the environment (which will only happen by                                 accident since we do not intend to release our bacteria), our E. coli bacteria will not survive. Our second bacterium, P. putida, which is design to consume TPA (one of the PET degradation products), would not be able to consume                                 PET as it is dependent on LC-Cutinase (the enzyme which breaks the initial bond in the PET polymer into TPA and EG),                                 since LC-Cutinase is expressed and secreted from E. coli. Therefore, the genetic modification done on this                                  bacterium will be useless, since it is responsible for degrading TPA, which is a commodity chemical that usually                                  does not exist abundantly in nature.

To avoid instability, we need to fulfill the condition \(\frac{D\times\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}\leqslant \frac{1}{2}\).
Modeling the impact of furnitures
Since pheromones will diffuse in a room containing furniture, we had to take into account that they could impact on diffusion.  We will integrate it to our program thanks to the computation of the effective diffusion coefficient \(D_eff\) [2] . The computation will be realized thanks to a modified Maxwell-Garnett equation.
This equation is generally used to solve problems of transport in composite materials.  Here, we will use it to compute the effective diffusion coefficient in a case where the environment is composed of square inclusions inside the general environment (here the furnitures included inside the room).
Usually the Maxwell-Garnett equation (if the diffusion is studied) is described as follow:
\begin{equation} \frac{D_eff - D_m}{D_eff + 2\times D_m} = \phi(\frac{D_i - D_m}{D_i + 2\times D_m}) \end{equation}
With \(D_m\) being the diffusion coefficient of the environment, \(D_i\) being the diffusion coefficient inside inclusions and \(\phi = \frac{V^d_i}{V^d_m}\) with \(V_i\) the volume of inclusions and \(V_m\) the volume of the environment.  Because of our 2D environment, we will compute areas instead of volumes. They will be compute with the length of the furniture (for the area of the inclusions) and the length of the entire world (for the area of the environment).  From this equation, and with an environment in 2D, we can set \(D_eff\) as follows:
\begin{equation} D_eff = D_m \times (1 + \frac{2 \times \phi \times (D_i - D_m)}{D_i + D_m - \phi \times (D_i - D_m)}) \end{equation}
But, here, inclusions (furniture) can't be crossed by pheromones. After applying a correction to the equation in order to take account of this impenetrability, the equation describing \(D"

Uppsala,2014,Team:Uppsala#ProjectTest SensingTest_-_-_TEXT.html," YenR, it was coupled to three different constitutive promoters from the Anderson promoter library with three different strengths.
Result
For characterisation we created the constructs yenbox_WT-B0034-GFP ( BBa_K1381008 ) and yenbox_J23113-B0034-GFP ( BBa_K1381009 ), where the yenbox fused with a promoter was coupled to the green fluorescent protein (GFP). These constructs were then cloned into the backbones pSB1C3 and pSB3C17 and transformed into competent E. coli cells already containing one of the YenR constructs J23110-B0034-YenR ( BBa_K1381005 ), J23102-B0034-YenR ( BBa_K1381006 ) or J23101-B0034-YenR ( BBa_K1381007 ) on the backbone pSB1K3. The double transformed cells were then streaked on plates containing both the antibiotic Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol and left it overnight to grow. Cells containing only the constructs yenbox_promoter-B0032-GFP were also streaked and left to grow.
The following day, overnight cultures were prepared and left for 16 h to grow into stationary phase. After that, 10 µL of the overnight culture was put into 500 µL of PBS solution and left for one hour for stabilization. The green fluorescence production was then measured using a flow cytometer. The results of the test is shown below.
Graph 1 above, shows the induction relative to the base level of expression. In graph 1.A. we can observe the induction but cannot predict to what extent. This is because these cells are transformed with two high copy plasmids containing the same ori (origin of replication). The consequence will be that the cells will confuse the two plasmids with each other and have no control of in what amount the two respective plasmids are present. It will only ensure that it is 100-300 plasmids present in total, regardless of which plasmid it is. This is why we also cloned the yenbox containing constructs into a low copy plasmid with a different ori than the high copy ones.
In graph 1.B., it can be seen that the amount of YenR that is produced is correlated, as expected, to the rate of the induction. When coupled to the strongest of the three promoters, J23102 ( BBa_J23102 ), the production is increased up to five folds.
In graph 1.C., we did not observe any induction  This"
DTU-Denmark,2014,Team:DTU-Denmark#Methods#Timeline_-_-_TEXT.html," add the ligand DFHBI-1T in known concentrations with excess RNA and measure the fluorescence signal. To determine the degradation rate of Spinach we wanted to grow the cells to exponential phase, halt transcription with rifampicin and measure the decline of fluorescent signal from the cells.
Finally we needed to create strains that expressed Spinach2.1 from various promoters, which we could then measure.
Proof of Concept
The Spinach2 RNA-aptamer has previously only been tested with T7-phage promoters and strong rRNA promoters. These promoters have a far greater activity than most of the promoters used in synthetic biology systems, e.g. the Anderson promoter library. Therefore we needed to do a proof of concept, proving that the fluorescence generated by Spinach2 expressed from an Anderson promoter was detectable. This proof of concept would also allow us to verify that our newly designed Spinach2.1 was working as well as Spinach2. Spinach2 and Spinach2.1 were synthesised as gBlocks from IDT. We planned to express Spinach from a fairly powerful promoter from the Anderson library and insert the construct into the iGEM registry standard plasmid backbone, pSB1C3 . The high copy number of this plasmid would ensure a high number of genes in the cell which in combination with the strong promoter would generate a high concentration of RNA in the cell. We chose the promoter BBa_J23101 and ligated this with Spinach and pSB1C3 and transformed the product into DH5α. After verifying that the construct was correct, by restriction analysis , the new strain was grown O/N at 37 degrees Celsius and the signal was measured with a fluorometer and observed fluorescence was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy . When fluorescence was confirmed from Spinach2 as well as Spinach2.1 we wanted to make a study to compare the fluorescence signal of our new version versus the original Spinach2 aptamer. We therefore did in vitro transcription of both sequences. The transcripts were then mixed with DFHBI-1T and fluorescence was measured using a fluorometer .
Strain Construction
Encouraged by our results in proof of concept we began constructing strains with 15 of the 20 Anderson promoters. Spinach was amplified from gBlocks using PCR and each BioBrick plasmid containing an Anderson promoter in pSB1C3 was cut with SpeI and PstI. The Spinach gene was ligated with each of the cut plasmids. After the ligated plasmids had been transformed into DH5α, they were purified with Zy"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#unnatural base pair#uptake_-_-_TEXT.html," weak functionality of this variant. The TAT-signal peptide variant, which showed bad growth characteristics and no substantial function, seems to be located within the cell envelope nonetheless. Given that peptides containing the TAT signal peptide are usually folded within the cytoplasm and then secreted via the twin-arginine translocation pathway, this could be a possible explanation for the non-existent function of the TAT variant. All other variants that also showed a detectable function are successfully integrated into the membrane. The variants without a signal peptide are also located within the membrane, which is not surprising, given that the integration of membrane proteins does not necessarily require a signal peptide (Facey and Kuhn, 2004) . PtNTT2(66-575) seems to be better integrated into the membrane than any other variant. The native PtNTT2, and PtNTT2(31-575) are integrated in a similar scale, but a little bit weaker compared to PtNTT2(66-575). These results are consistent with the results of the verification of the function of PtNTT2, since all variants that showed a relative beneficial effect and also the highest AMP concentrations in the supernatant do integrate the transporter into the membrane. For the TAT signal peptide variant, it is most likely that the transporter is integrated incorrectly, leading to a correct subcellular localization while lacking the correct function.
Isolation of PtNTT2 from the Inner Membrane
For further analysis of PtNTT2 the isolation of the transporter from the cell was attempted. This task proved to be challenging, given that PtNTT2 comprises ten transmembrane domains and is therefore highly hydrophobic. For that reason, several different methods and procedures were tested to achieve the best results.    The first two attempts were based on the isolation of the periplasmic protein fraction through cold osmotic shock and fast cell lysis followed by analysis via SDS PAGE. Unsurprisingly, both methods did not lead to the desired results, since no bands for PtNTT2 could be observed. Figure 20 shows the SDS PAGE of the samples prepared using the fast cell lysis for SDS PAGE.
Figure 20: SDS-PAGE of the GFP-fusion constructs of PtNTT2
The cells were prepared using the fast cell lysis for SDS PAGE protocol. E. coli BL21(DE3) and E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PtNTT2 were used as negative controls. Unsurprisingly, no thick band can be observed around 90.3 kDa"

The plates are incubated at 37°C for 16-24 h.
If the samples contained Vitamin B12, the cells grow in a red zone around the filter paper. The size is proportional to the Vitamin 12 concentration and the reduction of triphenyltetrazoliumchloride causes the red staining.
To analyze the B12 concentration in the samples, the diameter of the red zone is measured and compared to the calibrations.

Toulouse_France,2016,Team:Toulouse France#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"coes in the cave? Or maybe, we could be satisfied with the survival to transmit this work as long as possible to the future generations? Humans have used art to fight oblivion and leave a trace of their passages on earth. Therefore, Art is an important part of our humanity. It is a proof of our intelligence and our necessity of expression. It is through the power and intelligence of men that we can organize the formless and chaos of the real world in a style, an expression. Thus, Nietzsche promotes art as the purest of spiritual entertainment. Although it is not directly useful, art can be engaged, be a witness and memory. Some works also have a decorative goal. They exist for their beauty, even though beauty is subjective. For the artist, art is also used to escape and to express themselves. Generally, art is a means of timeless communication. Thus, the Lascaux cave is a work of art, it deserves to exist, to be maintained and protected. It carries a message and a memory of the Paleolithic man.
Some philosophers of aesthetics, defined art as ""sensitive knowledge"": an autonomous knowledge which is opposed to knowledge through concepts. In this case, art is not for art, it has no goals but is a means of knowledge, and is necessarily a role in men’s evolution; it goes beyond the individual. It belongs to no one and is not the object of desire: it is there for contemplation of a generation, and then transmitted to the next.
These frescoes show the representation that men had of their world 18,000 years ago. Notwithstanding, wildlife depicted on walls of the cave does not match the species hunted and consumed at the time. It includes mainly horses, buffalos and goats, and rare and often dangerous animals, such as bears, rhinos and big felines. A single reindeer engraved was found when it seems that it was very consumed at the time. This art does not represent the time of the hunting scenes as one might imagine. Still, the frescoes are extremely realistic in terms of morphology and attitudes of animals. For many prehistorians, the cave is actually a sanctuary, a sort of religious monument. Other theories circulated on the significance of the frescoes compared with the celestial constellations, shamanic worship, magic destruction of these terrifying animals, etc. Anyway, these frescoes carry the message of men 18,000 years ago, and they show us how they lived and what they believed in. They carry a page of humanity. Is it not necessary to keep this message alive as long as possible?

Introduced silent mutation into FlhC
Retinal
Transformed pSB1A2-J13002(TetR repressed generator), pSB1A2-K274210 (CrtEBIY under constitutive promoter), pSB1AK3-B0015 into E.coli MG1655
Modelling
Discussed Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations in relation to the system we would like to model.
Tied to identify a differential equation describing the system. The following physics books have been used:
The theory of polymer dynamics, M. DOI, S. F. Edwards, oxford science publications, 4. edition 1992.
Physics of continuous matter, B. Lautrup, IOP publishing, 2005.
Started implementing our model.

Using the club recruiting chance in our school, we advertised our project to the students who are interested in biology and nature science. We introduced synthetic biology to them about the concept, the significance and the future of synthetic biology with the E.coli cartoon designed by OUC-China, giving them a better perspective about the charm of synthetic biology. They learnt more about the blood donation and our project. Another purpose of this activity was to discover the potential members who want to take part in iGEM next year.
We also taught some students the simple biological technology, and held a competition of drawing picture on the agar plate, which caused a great repercussions. Many of them are very interested and wanted to join our team next year.
Here we would like to show some pictures as following that the students drew in the compitition of agar plate drawing. They are very fantastic，hope you like them and enjoy!
Summary for Human Practice
In summary, our project was born and perfected from the volunteer activity of unpaid blood donation. We are developing a biosensor to shorten the HCV window period for the blood detection. We broadened the effects of Synthetic Biology among the young students. And we solved the blood supply shortage to some extent."
