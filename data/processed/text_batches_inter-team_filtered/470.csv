Q1
To see Fig.1.3, avoidance degree of Full-time House maker and part-time jobber is higher than others, and that of college student and High school student is lower.
This result suggests that Full-time House maker and part-time jobber tend to have concerns about food labeling because they have more opportunities to purchase foods than other occupations.
It may be because “students are less conscious of food”, ”students put a higher value on other heads such as price rather than food safety ” or ”students apply to GM foods”
About “students apply to GM foods”, contemporary students have had a debate on GM foods at least once in high school or junior high school. So they may tend to have positive opinions because they probably have more knowledge and opinions on GM foods than people
Q2
The phrases “Cloning”, ”GM foods” and ”DNA” are highly chosen by people.

Policy and Practices
Strategy - Inspiring Instead of Lecturing
The 2014 DTU iGEM team is a group of students with very different personalities and backgrounds, but one of the main factors that makes our team such a strong, dynamic unit is a great mutual interest in synthetic biology and the opportunities in this exciting field. Our curiosity and individual involvement in the field made each of us join the iGEM team of this year and thereby brought us together. As a team and as individuals we have a natural urge to spread our interest and enthusiasm, and we are eager to inspire other people to get involved in the same fascinating area. In order to do so, during the project period, we arranged different initiatives for outreach, focusing on the iGEM competition in general as well as project-specific subjects.
Communication Strategy
In order to coordinate our outreach initiatives and thus make the work more efficient and coherent, we started out by defining a general strategy for our Policies and Practices work. We believe that inspiration is an essential step towards getting people interested and involved in the world of synthetic biology - therefore we have emphasised the importance of inspiration as a necessary supplement to education. Thus, our focus has been to inspire people with help from great iGEM and other synthetic biology examples as well as the great future potential of synthetic biology rather than lecturing them. We believe that people are more likely to search for advanced information on a topic if they feel inspired. Our Policy and Practices initiatives do therefore not primarily focus on passing on hardcore theory or technical knowledge to other people, but on a more abstract and inspirational level.
Target Group - Young Students, the Professors of Tomorrow
To optimise the outcome of our outreach initiatives we have specified a reachable target group among the Danish population on whom we would have our focus. Based on our strategy, we intended to define a group of people, who already had an"

What we did
Short description of our work, our results and our supporters
The creation of certain constructs was necessary for our two systems for cell selection by means of apoptosis: “Cut’N’Survive” and “Jump-Or-Die”. We searched for sources of the DNA sequences we needed and found several supporters which are listed below.
Most genes and promoters were amplificated via PCR with overhang-primers with the BioBrick prefix or suffix. If the sequence contained a EcoR1-, Pst1-, Xba1-, Spe1- or Not1- restriction site, we used mutagenesis primers and fusioned both DNA parts by fusion PCR. All PCRs worked out, even the fusion PCRs.
The length of the PCR products were tested by agarose gel electrophoresis. We tried to sequence our PCR products, but obtained poor results and resorted to sequencing the plasmids.
In parallel, we made competent cells and multiplied ccdB (death gene)-vectors with different antibiotic resistances. All components were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes. The samples were cleaned with a PCR clean up kit or dephosphorylated to reduce false ligations.
We ligated our constructs and several interim stages with the 3A-assembly according to our schedule. The ligations were transformed to E.coli DH5α strains and selected by antibiotics. Afterwards, some colonies were picked and we tested the insertion of the construct by colony PCR.
If the colony PCR resulted in bands of the right size, we extracted the plasmids from overnight cultures and sequenced the samples with forward and reverse BioBrick primers.
Unfortunately, not all BioBricks were cloned succesfully. However, we were able to produce 4 BioBricks, one of which represents a full construct while the other three are intermediates. The system wasn't completed on time, so we weren´t able to test them in eukarytic cell lines.
The protocols we used are listed here: Protocols

Meetups
Our team participated in several meetups, both in person and digitally. As a first-year team, we were able to gain invaluable insight on our project and helpful advice. We met with University College London, Lambert High School, and the Peshawar team via Google Hangouts and had very interesting conversations. We also met up with the ULV/CV/LC, a local team at our lab as well as attending the southern California meetup at UCLA.
UCL When we digitally communicated with UCL, we had the great pleasure of meeting Amandeep who graciously gave us advice for our project. She helped us solve some of our crucial problems and helped us troubleshoot a few complications we ran into.
Lambert The Lambert team in Georgia is another high school team that we met up with. The Lambert team is a veteran high school team and gave us advice as to how we could get supplies and machines.
Peshawar We talked with Sarah from the Peshawar team via google hangouts in the beginning of August. We were able to help them by explaining our projected timeline and our work process.
UCLA UCLA was the host of the 2016 iGEM SoCal meetup where we met with several other teams such as UCSD, ULV/LC/CV, and a representative of the Marburg Team in Germany. There we got critical feedback of our project and were able to come up with creative new fundraising ideas.
UCL/LC/CV The Laverne, La Canada, and Crescenta Valley team is a joint College and High School team that is close to us. We met at the UCLA meetup and since then have continued to communicate with them. We have created plans to reach out to other high schools in the area so that can learn about synthetic biology."
BIT,2015,Team:BIT-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,".  From this result BNU-China concluded that the differences exist between the bands of controlled plasmid and the experimental ones, whereas it seemed that these differences had nothing to do with the objective product. Hence, it came out as another failure.
Relevant agent formula:
protein lysis buffer
Tris-HCl (pH=8.0)      85 mL
Sucrose             25.67 g
β-mercaptoethanol   15 mL
membrane solution buffer
protein lysis buffer : urea solution (8M) = 4 : 1 (volume ratio ))
Therefore, it was a pity that BNU_China failed to detect those two proteins, but they were able to give some opinions to us about protein detection through their experience: 1. Changing the expression strain for overexpressing of NhaA and NhaB according to the citation [1], the details are in Table. 2.
2. Make western blots if possible.
The experiments gave us lots of information about membrane proteins. What’s more, the experience helps us two teams communicate frequently and therefore develop a tight relationship eventually.

TJU is our old friend in the iGEM stage; we had collaborated with them in experiment, modeling in past two years.
P170 is a kind of acid-induced promoter, and can be bound by rcfB protein activated by lactic acid. To verify the relationship between concentration of lactic acid and promoter, P170 was linked with RFP gene, and strength of fluorescence was measured. Fig.8 shows the circuit with promoter P170.
Fig.8 Genetic regulation circuit of promoter P170
We firstly made assumption of the circuit:
(1) mRNA and combination of mRNA-rib had reached steady state
(2) all enzymes activities were not affected by acid concentration and could be regarded as constant
(3) concentration of rcfB protein was assumed unchanged.
The reaction processes are described as:
Here we list the parameter names and descriptions:
Basing on reaction processes above, equations are constructed as followed: Concentration of induced RcfB and combination of RcfB and lactic acid are written as:
Where KLa and K are constants and n is hill coefficient.
Promoter P170 can be activated in two ways. The first pathway is to bind to the dimerization of lactic acid and RcfB. The other pathway basing on our assumption is that a proportion  of P170 can be activated"

In addition, they provided               us with useful information about Safety Form and Part submission as well as experimental verification of design. What’s more, we exchanged our ideas about Human Practice in the areas of education and public engagement.
A Video about Biosafety Level By communicating with BGIC-Union, we decided to cooperate with them to produce a video about biosafety level. In order to contact and discuss the issue at any time, two groups formed a WeChat group. After               looking for a lot of information and revisions, we set up a transcript of text and pictures and translated the English version. Then, Our members used their rest time to record and make the video.
Speeches in Donghai Primary School Attached to Shenzhen Foreign Languages School and Shenzhen Baihe Foreign Language School On October 25, 2017, we made a speech together with BGIC-Union in Donghai Primary School Attached to Shenzhen                 Foreign Languages School. Together, we gave a brief introduction about synthetic biology as well as cancer and its therapy. We also held a biology knowledge contest and found that the students there knew more about biology than we expected!                 On October 27, 2017, BGIC-Union and our team gave out a lecture in Shenzhen Baihe Foreign Languages School. In the lecture, we introduced iGEM and our project to the students.
Collaboration with SUSTech-China
On July 10, 2017, we held a diminutive meet up in Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) with their team. At that time, we were informed that our previous project about treating Trichophyton rubrum infection by defensins had               a low feasibility. We then got the chance to discuss the project with Prof. Hongmin Zhang, an instructor of SUSTech_China, and asked for some questions about expressing a mutated defensins in bacteria. Prof. Zhang gave us some valuable suggestions               and pointed out that it was time-consuming.
We also exchanged the ideas about our cancer project deeply and one of their members offered some help on our modeling.
Collaboration with SZU-China
On April 29, 2017, to promote our project and have a throughout discussion with other iGEM teams, we attended iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting held by Shenzhen University (SZU_China). Six undergraduate teams and two high school teams attended             the meet-up.
At the meet-up, each team described the background and core theory of their project and raised valuable questions for other"

Policy & Practices
Discussion
iGEM projects involve significant questions beyond the bench, for example ethics, safety or property rights. We discussed how we can approach these problems and took following actions as our Policy & Practices activities then summarized the achievements.
Ethics
Problem
The results of our survey on genetic engineering suggest that the level of knowledge about genetic engineering is generally very low and that with the very limited knowledge many people have negative perception about genetic engineering, especially on the ethical aspect.
Actions We Took
Workshop:
Participants created BioArt using E. coli ink.
High School Visit:
To educate students about the utility, safety and ethical acceptability of genetic engineering.
Open House:
Poster presentation and oral presentation on iGEM and GM to high school students and their parents.
Achievement
Through these activities, we were successfully able to educate people in general that genetic engineering and synthetic biology are fun and close to our everyday life.
Safety
Problems
It can pose potential danger to people and the ecosystem if they take in genetically modified E. coli.
As a result of genetic engineering, mutation might come about and unsafe characters might appear.
People who are conducting the experiment can be in danger.
Actions we took
Cast on autoclave or grind the cells to sterilize.
& 3. All experiments were carried out following the established protocols attentively in the restraining area.
Other
Problem
We might unintentionally infringe the intellectual property right.
If genetic engineering becomes so easy and simple that everyone can conduct it, those who are not educated technically and ethically will also conduct genetic engineering with malicious intensions.
Genetic engineering may trigger monopoly of intellectual property, hampering the sound advancement of science.

1. Validated Part / Validated Contribution
We proved that the function of each constructed basic parts have function.                                          We also tested the total solution to prove that our design will have higher energy efficiency as well as the ability of carbon utilization.                                          The fuction of pH alert system has also been measured and confirmed .
2. Collaboration
The project of USETC-China is to degrade straw into four bio-products, one is xylose,                                          which is an important source of our E. coli carbon utilization.                                          Therefore, we collaborate to each other to build the complete system of straw degration and carbon utilization.

To ensure our venom protein folds properly, we have a periplasmic signal attached to both the venom/fibrin protein as well as the thiol isomerase. Foreign proteins don't fold well within the rough cytoplasm, so we sent our proteins to the periplasmic space which is a more ideal situation for our venom. With addition to the DsbC, the enzymatic activity of the venom should be significantly higher which in turn should accelerate our clotting. By having our proteins in the periplasmic space, we only need to puncture the outer membrane in order to lyse the cell. This function also allows us to release our construct without introducing E.coli inside the body.   As a side note, we decided to use E.Coli as our chassis because it is easier to use than other chassis such as yeast, and we have experience of working with it before. We have looked into using other chassis such as plant cells, but based on the convenience of E.Coli, we went with that.

The design of our first construct induced a rapid production of clotting proteins and in order to supplement it, we have designed a construct that would stabilize the clot and sterilize the wound. In order to stabilize the clot, we added Human Factor XIIIa (propeptide removed) which is the enzyme responsible for the polymerization of fibrin monomers, by keeping the promoters and binding sites the same strength we ensure that all of the fibrin-venom strands bind at the wound site and form a permanent plug that will not be easily re-opened. Having Factor XIIIa will accelerate the rate of polymerization which further ensures that the venom-fibrin strands will stay localized.

A restriction digest of the NPT plasmid was once again performed, cutting with both (E/P) and (X/P) as before, this time using more DNA. An overnight culture of a single potentially successful NPT colony was made, to perform a restrictin digest to see if NPT was present - this would be done over the weekend. Finally, a transformation of the single mutagenesis KAPA PCR of PstI was performed, to hopefully yield more colonies.
Week 17 (August 20 - August 24)
This week, we carried forth with the second and third mutagenesis sites of the CAR gene. Our new plasmid with our first PstI site was PCR amplified with the Kapa system and our EcorI mutagenesis primers to carry out the second mutation, to remove the EcorI illegal cut site from our gene. After the PCR was complete, we ran our product on a gel to see if the amplification worked. Bands indicated success. Following this verification, we mixed our two seemingly successful PCR tubes with 1 uL of DpnI, and left them to incubate for one hour. The PCR product was then transformed into highly competent E.coli cells, and the plates were left overnight in the 37 degree incubator. Unfortunately a mistake prevented colonies from growing, but the process was repeated and our second attempt yielded many colonies. We made overnight cultures of 8 of these colonies, with 4 from each plate, with Kan as the antibiotic for selective growth. The next day, a miniprep was performed on each overnight culture to isolate the CAR+PET plasmids that had hopefully undergone their second mutation, of their single EcorI site. Once the plasmid isolation was complete, we performed a restriction digest using EcorI to cut, in order to verify that the illegal cut site had been removed and the plasmid could no longer be digested with this enzyme. We immediately proceeded with the third mutagenesis, which would this time be performed on the second (and last) PstI site. Using our new plasmid now with two illegal cut sites removed, we performed an amplification PCR, using our PstI(2) primers and the Kapa system. After running this on a gel, we determined bands of success, as shown below. We then once again treated our PCR amplified tubes with DpnI for one hour, and then transformed into highly competent E.coli"

The milk to our coffee
Working together is especially important in a scientific context - when it comes to iGEM it is indispensable. This year collaborations with three teams came about, the first being Team Düsseldorf, which take part in iGEM for the first time, and the others being Team Freiburg and Team Lethbridge.
Take a look at our collaborations!
Düsseldorf
One partner we frequently collaborated with was the fellow iGEM team Düsseldorf . They are the very first team from the Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf so naturally they had a lot of questions on how to get started in iGEM.
We were asked if we could help them on getting started and so we invited them to Bielefeld to answer their questions and aside from that, cake. Topics we discussed were Gibson assembly, Biobrick assembly, Sponsoring and many more. We met again at the German iGEM meet up in Marburg and stayed in touch. This lead to our participation in Düsseldorfs postcard initiative to spread knowledge on synthetic biology where we submitted our own design.
They also invited us to the NRW- day where we"

Through the mission hospital, Donnchadh organised to meet the witchdoctor with a group a medics and a translator. The witchdoctor explained how  her powers work and her role in society. She spoke about the herbal treatment she advises to the sick people who visit her.
Donnchadh spoke to her about synthetic biology and our DNA detection project. The witchdoctor thought the project was a great idea and noted the importance of science and education for the Malawian people. She also mentioned that she recommends visiting a medical professional to people that she will not be able to help.
Appointment with the local Witchdoctor.
An Adaptive Future
The feedback from the locals and lab technicians regarding synthetic biology and our project was extremely positive. The implementation of our      DNA test kits at Nkhoma Mission Hospital is real possibility and welcomed by all.
‘My Malawian experience was fantastic, the people are so friendly and supportive of our work. I definitely see a role for our DNA detection system      in resource poor hospitals not only in this hospital but hospitals all over Africa. Nkhoma a major hospital in Malawi but our project could be used      in many other hospitals with poorer resourced labs as well. Now the next step the Giant Jamboree!’
Primary school students after attending Donnchadh's talk on synthetic biology.
Our Synthetic Biology Community Immersion Project
In the recent years, Cork has been identified as a global hub for synthetic biology and biotechnology. This is       evident by the fact that 11 of the top 15 pharmaceutical companies in the world have a branch in Cork. IndieBio , formerly known as SynBio Axlr8r,       is the world’s first synthetic biology accelerator programme  and is one of the upcoming players in Cork’s synthetic biology community.       This programme provides world class mentorship, state of the art labspace and seed funding of $50,000 to multiple synthetic biology       startups each summer since May 2014. While we embarked on our iGEM journey at the UCC labs we took this opportunity to meet and get to       know the nine biotech startups from around the world.
Forma Labs , Ireland’s first and only biomaker space was established in Cork this year.  Despite formally being opened on the       3rd of September 2015 our team was involved since the very beginning. Our team was delighted to get involved and become pioneers in this       upcoming community of synbio lovers! This movement is a great benefit for all involved and is a"
NCTU_Formosa,2013,Team:NCTU Formosa#project_-_-_TEXT.html,". In the end, the sRNAs regulate gene expression by forestalling translation. Since this regulated-system has already been employed in vivo, it is necessary to design an artificial sRNA that targets specifically to a desired genes, so that we can prevent the sRNA from affecting other undesired genes.
Unlike the regulated-system popular used in iGEM projects (e.g. Ptet & tetR, Plux & LuxR, etc.), sRNA regulated-system seems more efficient. Because the inhibition works under RNA level, which means the energy wasted in E. coli is less than other system (producing proteins to regulate).
Figure 8 depicts how the small RNA chaperone, Hfq, associates with the small RNA and represses a target mRNA.12
Mechanism
How do small RNAs regulate gene expression?  Figure 9 shows the mechanism of repressing one target mRNA. The small RNA has three stem-loop double stranded RNA structures,  and the loop which is closest to the 3’ terminus is complementary  to the sequence preceding the initiation codon of the target mRNA. Base pairing between small RNA and the target mRNA prevents the ribosome  from binding to the initiation codon, so the translation would be repressed.13,14
Design
The following is the process of our idea in designing the sRNA.
We have designed two artificial sRNAs, each modified from different paper. The sRNA-1 is based on afsRNA ARlacZ1, which is created by Hongmarn Park and his colleagues.15 SibC is a small RNA sequence which is already found in E.coli. Hongmarn Park and his colleagues changed few base pairs of SibC to make ARlacZ1, purposed to make the secondary structure more stable. After that, they tried to change 9 different locations of the target-recognition sequence to test the effect on gene silencing. Our design is to modify from the RNA sequence which has the best efficiency : ARlacZ7. In accordance with afsRNA ARlacZ7, we changed the target-recognition sequence to finally complete our sRNA-1.
The other sRNA sequence we produced is called sRNA-2. It is employed in this project selected from a library of artificial sRNA that was constructed by fusing a randomized antisense domain of Spot42, the scaffold that is known for recruiting the RNA chaperons. The sRNA we picked contains a consensus sequence, 5’-CCCUC-3’, which can base pair with the SD sequence due to complementary binding. This s"

From 2010.igem.org
Thursday 22nd July - Back to work!
So we learned a lot from our trip to Newcastle. It's definitely kicked us back into work seeing how well into their project the other UK teams were. We began the day meeting at the IC for 10am. Tom worked on buttons, while Nii and Narmada worked on the Wiki and Steve, Matt and Caz did some gene ordering, lab work and ethics.
Andy popped us a brief visit to see how everything was going. We worked over lunch, as there was quite a bit to catch up on from our time away.

Module 1: Phyto-Route
Chemotaxis is the movement of bacteria based on attraction or repulsion of chemicals. Roots secrete a variety of compounds that E. coli are not attracted to naturally. Accordingly, we engineered a chemoreceptor into our chassis that can sense malate, a common root exudate, so that it can swim towards the root. Additionally, E. coli are actively taken up by plant roots, which will allow targeted IAA delivery into roots by our system.

I. INTRODUCTION
E.coli is a motile strain of bacteria, which is to say it can swim. It is able to do so by rotating its flagellum, which is a rotating tentacle like structure on the outside of cell.
Chemotaxis is the movement up concentration gradient of chemoattractants (i.e. malate in our project) and away from poisons. E.coli is too small to detect any concentration gradient between the two ends of itself, and so they must randomly head in any direction and then compare the new chemoattractant concentration at new point to the previous 3-4s point. Its motion is described by ‘runs’ and ‘tumbles’, runs refer to a smooth, straight line movement for a number of seconds, while tumble referring to reorientation of bacteria [1]. Chemoattractant increases transiently raise the probability of ‘tumble’ (or bias), and then a sensory adaptation process returns the bias to baseline, enabling the cell to detect and respond to further concentration changes.  The response to a small step change in chemoattractant concentration in a spatially uniform environment increase the response time occurs over a 2s to 4s time span [2].

Dundee,2015,Team:Dundee#Lab Book#Chromate Detector_-_-_TEXT.html," experiments with added chromate substances.
Week Beginning 14/09
Summary
During this week the samples from the previous plate reader were retrieved and prepared for blotting against both GFP, and the 6His-Tag of ChrB and ChrBopt.
Day 1 - 14/09: Western blot of plate reader samples MG1655 + pSB1C3-pChr-GFP + pUniprom-ChrB, and MG1655 + pSB1C3-pChr-GFP + pUniprom-ChrBopt.
Aim of experiment: To identify whether or not there is any detectable difference in both, the level of GFP, and the level of ChrB or ChrBopt, before and after induction with IPTG.
Protocols Used: SDS-PAGE + Western blot
Results: Insert blot image here.
Next Steps: Repeat the assays of the previous weeks by subcloning ChrB, ChrBopt, and ChrB (Bielefeld) into vectors with different expression levels and see how it influences the level of GFP expression. Then add different chromate salts and also probe the system with other substances, e.g. other heavy-metal salts.

DESCRIPTION
  Do you know how to solve energy crisis utilizing biological methods? Have you ever heard about how to construct a enzymatic biofuel cell (EBFC)? Nothing is too strange in the nature. There are many special properties of bacteria in nature such as producing electricity, being attracted by magnet. Please read this page.
Overview
Energy crisis will be a serious threat to human survival with sharp decreasing of fossil fuels. While renewable energy is a great solution for the problem. According to previous studies, we focused on the enzymatic biofuel cell (EBFC) after comparation. It has many advantages on operation and function over the ordinary biofuel cell[1,2]:
1) High efficiency of energy conversion.
2) Characteristics fitted the biosensor.
3) Green alternative energy.
In the EBFC, we found two high-efficiency oxidases, glucose oxidase and laccase, which could be used in anode region and cathode region respectively. At the same time, we learned that laccase was also involved in the degradation of wide range industrial pollutants. Thus, those wastewater could be used to produce electricity by linking laccase to the cathode in our EBFC. For the purpose of visualizing the location and concentration of laccase, we combined RFP with laccase. After that, we designed a way of enriching laccase on the cathode--using magnetosomes(Figure 1)!
Figure 1.The flow diagram of our project. First, we fused RFP with laccase to make it visible. Then we wanted to construct a high-efficiency enzymatic biofuel cell (EBFC) by enriching laccase, and lacasse was connected to magnteosome via an anchor protein encoded by a mamW gene.
Background: why we chose EBFC
Along with the development of times and population growth, energy consumption is increasing rapidly. Up to now, the thermal power is the main source. According to BP Energy Outlook 2035 , we can find that the world's fossil fuel reserves are declining [3] , and the largest shift of shares give us an insight into the most likely shape of the future energy landscape!

Rice University iGEM Team
This year, we collaborated with Rice University's iGEM team on an app that would display information such as structure and function of a molecule once the user 'imaged' a moving crystal. The purpose of this project was to make a way for people to get a better understanding about molecules such as hemoglobin, as well as provide insight as to how the structures are determined.
Through the collaboration, we acted as guides for the development of the game, assisting in the preliminary planning stages, finding relevant tutorials and game engines, and acting as a reference for when they were unable to implement features. The collaboration initially began through email correspondence, but was later done through a shared Google Document where they would be able to post questions and we would be able to reply with relevant links and explanations."

Dr. Samuel Yu is currently the Associate Director in the Health, Safety and Environment Office of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Prof. Yu is also an Adjunct Associate Professor of School of Public Health and Primary Care, Faculty of Medicine, Chinese University of Hong Kong.
Ms. Christine Chiu is currently the Senior Specialist in the Health, Safety and Environment Office of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).
Prof. Tom Richard is a faculty of Agricultural and Biological Engineering in Penn State University. He is also a director of Penn State Institutes for Energy and Environment.
Dr. Samuel Yu, Ms. Christine Chiu and Prof. Tom Richard have all worked as judges for human practice in previous years. Interviewing them helped us broaden our perspective of human practice and also our understanding of the purpose and impact of human practice in iGEM. We hope that by incorporating the content of the interview in our Human Practice Handbook future iGEM teams can have deeper understanding of objectives of Human Practice and develop better projects.
Interview with Human Practice Judges from Within Our Institution
To find out more about Human Practice from the judges’ point of view, we contacted the past human practice judges in our institution and scheduled an interview with them. We started the interview off by asking how they would define human practice. Dr. Samuel Yu and Ms. Christine Chiu defined human practice as everything beyond the technical aspects and also as a “promotion of iGEM and synthetic biology using different tools”.
During the interview Dr. Samuel Yu and Ms. Christine Chiu mentioned several times that they are looking for a novel and creative project. They also emphasized that the process of how you get to the product of human practice project is important. Also, they chose governors and young students as the most important target audience. Moreover, we discussed about some worthwhile areas to be explored in human practice and the prospect of"

Protein Solubilization Toolkit
Single parts together make difference
Process and application
The second module of this project corresponds to the overexpression of chaperones during cellular growth, which characterizes an important tool to solubilize proteins, in a way that together with the process described in the first module it will present     a favorable situation to correctly express the limonene synthase by the promoter PuspA.
Figure 1: Project module II comprising protein solubilization tollkit as conceived.
Heat-shock proteins
Under a situation of stress, different classes of chaperones/Hsps (heat-shock protein) perform complementary roles in proteic folding. Some of them, for example small Hsp, sHsp and Hsp70, acts keeping the proper protein folding and avoiding aggregation.     In this way, they keep the protein in a proper state for the action of refolding, which is done by other chaperones. When denatured or incorrect folded proteins form aggregates, they are solubilized by Hsp100/Clp, followed by refolding or degradation     by proteases (ARSENE et al., 2000). Hsps are highly conserved between species, therefore, in this project; we seek the overexpression of Hsps from Escherichia coli, which will be described next.
ClpB
The bound of ClpB to a protein stimulates is ATPase activity. The ATP and external proteins hydrolysis undo denatured protein clumps. With this, new hydrophobic sites are exposed which contribute to the bound and action of chaperones responsible for     solubilization and refolding. ClpB exists in two isoforms, long ClpB (alpha) [ClpB93] and short ClpB (beta) [ClpB79], which is started by an internal initiation codon GUG at position 149 (GOTTESMAN et al., 1990). The coordinated expression of both     forms showed necessary"
Nevada,2011,Team:Nevada#Project#Cyano_-_-_TEXT.html," model cyanobacterial system. As such it, it has numerous resources available to the investigator including facile and established transformation protocols and a completely sequenced genome. The work being done on this project will set the foundation for basic research into microbial community interactions and also applied research with real world industrial relevance.
Goals and Specific Tasks for Cyanobacteria
The goal of this project is to engineer the cyanobacterium strain Synechocystis PCC6803 to produce and secrete hexose sugars that can be utilized by a biofuel producing E. coli strain. To achieve this goal the Cyanobacteria team has been assigned following two tasks:
1) Engineer Synechocystis to overproduce the hexose
2) Engineer Synechocystis to secrete hexose sugar to the medium
Engineer Synechocystis to overproduce hexose sugars
Cyanobacteria use photosynthesis to provide energy and carbon skeletons for anabolic processes. During the day excess fixed carbon can be converted to the polysaccharide, glycogen and stored for later use.  To engineer Synechocystis to overproduce hexose sugars, we will divert carbon away from the glycogen biosynthetic pathway and towards hexose sugar production. To achieve this goal we will create a null mutation in the gene encoding ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP). AGP specifically converts glucose to ADP-glucose which is the monomeric precursor to glycogen. Synechocystis AGP knockout mutants have been reported to no longer produce glycogen, but instead accumulate high levels of sucrose (Miao et al (2003) FEMS Letters 218: 71-77). Fortunately, sucrose can easily be converted to the hexose sugars, glucose and fructose, in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme invertase (INV). Therefore, we will introduce and overexpress the INV gene in the AGP mutant background.
AGP K.O./INV Construct Design
We will simultaneously create the AGP mutant and the INV overexpressing line by inserting the INV expression construct into the coding region of the Synechocystis AGP gene. This will be accomplished by creating an AGP gene replacement construct in which the INV overexpression gene cassette and a kanamycin resistance gene cassette are inserted into the coding region of a subcloned AGP gene. This dysfunctional AGP construct will then be transformed into Synechocystis and through homologous recombination, replace the native AGP gene.

Can we relate light incidence to ATP production?
Introduction
We really want to thank the team iGEM Kent 2015 for this modeling born from the collaboration between the two groups.
Proteorhodopsin is a light-powered proton pump. This protein has the property to use light energy to generate an outward proton flux that can subsequently power cellular processes, such as ATP synthesis. After having experimentally assessed that our engineered E. coli was able to produce more ATP thanks to the proteorhodopsin, we decided to quantify this effect by modeling the amount of ATP that can be produced in function of the proteorhodopsin’s activation.
How many ATP molecules?
Membrane as an electric circuitElectric circuit analogy for the membrane [2]
What is the number of ATP molecules that can be produced per second as a function of light irradiance that hits the bacterial membrane?
Once a photon is absorbed by proteorhodopsin (PR), PR must complete its photocycle before it can absorb another photon [1] . At high light irradiance, this leads to saturation. For this we choose to exploit the Michaelis-Menten kinetics, where V_max is the maximum rate of the system and the Michaelis-Menten constant, Km, is the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is $\frac{1}{2}V\max$.
Walter et al. demonstrated that the system is analogous to a circuit (figure 1), in this circuit representation; the proteorhodopsin (PR) acts like a battery with internal resistance. [2] [3]
The current through the system is inversely related to the PR resistor and is dependent on light irradiance.
$R_{PR=}\left( \frac{V_{\max }*I}{K_{m}+I} \right)^{-1}$
Walter et al. determined that $V_{\max}$ is fixed by the boundary condition that $R_{PR≈}\frac{R_{\"

Applications of T-ECO
Figure: Schematic ""workflow"" of the application of T-ECO. By converting donor blood of type A or B to O via the activity of our enzymes (e.g. EABase) the relatively quick creation of emergeny donor blood is possible. This emergency donor blood of type O can then be transfused to patients in order to save lifes.
Blood transfusion and donation of organs are an essential feature in medicine today and used in everyday live. Usually, only blood type specific transfusions can be accomplished, as blood types A and B have specific sugar antigens on their surface leading to the activation of antibodies recognizing and destroying unknown red blood cells. Especially, this is a problem regarding the blood type O. In emergency situations time is often limited and patients can not be tested for their blood groups. Therefore, blood type O is used first to prevent hemagglutination which outlines the need of blood type O. Also, the blood shelf life is limited to about a month, increasing the need of fresh blood.
The aim of our project was to develop a system converting  blood types A and B to the universal usable blood type O (see Figure). This would change medicine dramatically, as patients could accept the freshly converted blood type independent of their own.
Of special interest is the blood group Bombay. These patients have a rare mutation that make them unable to receive even blood group O.
To achieve this aim, several approaches are possible. Since large amounts of blood group O are needed a large scale approach had to be chosen. To convert large amounts of blood while keeping the costs of the system low, we are planning to design a column based method. The resin"
Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," Kaebnick’s work allowed us to think about synthetic biology as a broad enabling technologically with many applications, rather than a technology for a particular purpose [8].

Due to the many possibilities with synthetic biology for innovation analogous to developments in other technologies such as self driving cars and the internet, the best approach to emerging technology policy making is with transparent group policy making with broad public input [7].
The questions and insights we gained from Dr. Kaebnick’s work are relevant to our project because it shows that we need to clearly articulate the values and viewpoints of hydroponic farmers, users, and consumers. While it may be difficult to reconcile these viewpoints, it is our obligation and our desire to facilitate discussion between people from all backgrounds. This is our impetus for much of our outreach, as well as our collaboration with Stony Brook to produce a survey assessing the underlying attitudes of synthetic biology in various locations in the U.S. Our ultimate aim is to understand perceptions and knowledge of synthetic biology. A true understanding of another’s opinion and basis results in deeper, more productive conversation.
END USERS
We developed our design through the guidance of our end users. We received feedback from over 40 interviews with hydroponic growers, suppliers, plant biologists, and oxidative stress researchers. This information allowed us to develop a robust system that addressed the most pressing issues hydroponic growers had. See Practices for more information about our integrated feedback. As we spoke with them, we realized that a common theme was that growers had a common problem: they faced incredibly high operating costs with low profit margins. Furthermore, many were shuttering their doors due to crop underperformance or even total failure. We needed a way to address this issue - and OxyPonics does just that by boosting crop performance and yield while keeping capital costs to a minimum.
SAFETY AND RISK ASSESSMENT
We recognize that there is public concern about the danger of introducing mutant bacteria to consumer produce. However, we assert that Oxyponics is a legitimate and safe additive to any deep water hydroponic farm hoping to increase crop size and yield.
Our team believes there is little to no risk to adding genetically engineered E. coli to the hydroponic setup for two reasons. First, the bacteria is enclosed in dialysis tubing that allows water and molecules to flow freely, but not the bacteria themselves. Thus, there is no danger of the bacteria leaving the hydroponic facility or being ingested by any consumer. Second, all produce is processed and sanitized before being sold"

Part BBa_K2663005: Aga2 and (Glycine3Ser)4 Linker
We decided to improve part BBa_K416004 designed by the 2010 NYU iGEM team. This composite part contained the Aga2 yeast surface display protein linked at the C-terminus to a flexible (Gly3Ser)4 linker. It can be used to attach to Aga1 on the surface of Saccharomyces cerevisiae EBY100. The original part was assembled by combining Aga2 with the (Gly3Ser)4 linker using RFC 10 which can create out-of-frame fusions. Since Aga2, the linker, and the wanted protein must all be encoded as one transcript and combined amino acid sequence, maintaining the open reading frame is crucial.
To fix these errors, our team redesigned the part by fixing the out of frame design and attached a yeGFP to the linker (designated as BBa_K2663005 ). Since Aga1 is controlled by the Gal1 promoter in EBY100, we found it to be convenient to also control the Aga2 construct with the Gal1 promoter. For the convenience of future use, we have submitted the full part with a Gal1 promoter attached ( BBa_K2663006 ) to the registry. Any terminator can be used with the part."

Yizhi CAI from Johns Hopkins visiting our team
 
  Yizhi CAI, the instructor for Johns Hopkins iGEM Team and one of the organizers for iGEM, visited our team in late May.23rd. He introduced his Yeast Genome 2.0 Project to us and then discussed some related issues and problems of regional jamboree. In turn, we’ve briefly introduced our team and team project to him. The visit certainly broadened our view of synthetic biology, of other iGEM teams and of the competition itself as well. And more importantly, the visit brought us much closer to iGEM and built the bridge between ZJU and Johns Hopkins.
Haoqian ZHANG from Peking University visiting our team
 
  Haoqian ZHANG, the instructor for this year’s Peking iGEM Team and a former iGEMer, came to visit our team in early May.7th. He first gave a lecture introducing synthetic biology to synthetic biology club members in ZJU, as part of the College of Life Sciences Festival activity. He then introduced Peking iGEM team and projects, and held a wonderful discussion with us. We learned a lot not only from his introductions, but from himself as well. The visit has no doubt built a close relationship between Peking University and ZJU iGEM teams.
iGEM 2011 China Meet-up in USTC
  The iGEM2011 China Meetup was held at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) from July 29th to July 31th. Seven members of ZJU-China, Ye LI, Keyue MA, Ruoxi PI, Chenlin XU, Yakun XI, Yu XIA and Luyi TIAN participated in this event. During the conference, we introduced our ‘Rainbofilm’ project as well as our experiment progress. We also discussed experiments and team organizing experiences with members
from many other China iGEM teams. Haoqian ZHANG from Peking_R iGEM team kindly helped us with problems we met during our experiments.

As a result of this we spent the first month brainstorming ideas and learning the theory behind what we were about to do. Our PI taught us the basic techniques involved and discussed cloning strategies with us. Our initial lab work consisted of learning the techniques that we were going to apply to our project.
General Support
Sara White, Senior Biology Technician at our school taught us necessary microbiological techniques and the ways of working in sterile environment - everything from autoclaving media and waste to different plating techniques. She contributed greatly to the success of the project. Our PI taught us molecular biology techniques  - anything from using Gilson pipettes to making and running the gels and programming PCR thermocycler.
Project support and advice
We discussed all aspects of our project with out PI. Methods specific to working with Synechocystis PCC6803 were discussed with Paulina Bartasun and John Rowland of Imperial College, who also gave us the E. coli glycerol stock from which we miniprepped the pDF-lac plasmid to use in our transformations. Imperial iGEM team checked through our cloning strategies and advised us early on to try and go standard assembly rather than 3A assembly.
Fundraising help and advice
We did all the fundraising on our own, although we are extremely grateful to Mrs S. Fletcher, the Head of our school for helping fund our project when we fell short of our target.
Lab support
All the work we carried out in our school lab. In order to do this we needed to notify the Health and Safety Executive of the Contained Use of Premises for GMO work, for which we needed expert consultants. We are thankful to Kirsten Jensen and Karen Polizzi of the Imperial College for reading through our risk assessments and safety policy and acting as the points of contact for HSE.   We are also grateful to the Senior Management Team of our school for allowing us to do some lab work over the summer while the refurbishment of the building was taking place. At times, working with the construction crew around us was interesting, not the least when the fire alarm was set of in the middle of our minipreps.

The COSMIC project from Sanger institute allowed us to determine which genes to bring to the therapeutic plasmid in the non-small cell lung cancer case. This project sums up all detected mutations for each type of cancer in function of their appearance frequency. So, from their data, the loss of apoptotic capacity of tumor cells for lung cancer can be due to the functional loss of proteins from the following genes :
These different genes play a predominant role in the application of the apoptotic process and are the most susceptible to be mutated in the lung cancer case. They compose the therapeutic plasmid .
Back to top
The objective
The objective of this study is to check if a wild type version of a tumor suppressor gene inside the tumor cell, for which the own version is mutated, induce or not the apoptotic phenomenon.
Experimental approach
Cancer cell line and reported gene
Cancer cell lines, which have a mutation of tumor suppressor gene has been selected from our database. We also possess a wild type version of the TP53 gene. Then we choose the prostatic cancer p53 mutated DU-145 in the goals to test if bringing the wild type version of the p53 protein (p53wt) in the DU-145 cell line allows to induce the apoptotic process.
Cell culture protocol :
Take out  ampoule from liquid nitrogen
Place the ampoule in 37°C water bath for 5 minutes
In a 50 ml Falcon tube, put 9 ml of 10% MEM + 1 ml of ampoule
Harvest 5 min at 1200 rpm
Discard the supernatant without touching pellet cells (DMSO elimination)
Resuspend pellet in 1 ml of media
Put the suspension in a new T25 containing 5 ml of media
Incubate at 37°C
Do not forget to change the media the day after to eliminate all DMSO traces
One week later, cells are at 100% confluence

Science Popularization Campaign
With the authoritative scientific knowledge about cancer, we started publicity and education for the public. Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, a very famous historic site with the huge traffic, is the place where we launched our campaign. From June to September, we have organized a total of six events with huge social impact.
We promote science popularization through forms like exhibition boards and brochures. The content covers cancer common sense (such as cancer causes, cancer treatment methods, etc.), synthetic biology introduction and the project of our team. Our activities took various forms, including introduction and games about scientific knowledge.
Brochures & Exhibition Boards
Larger Influence & Further Vision
Nanjing Daily, a local newspaper with many readers, reported our work on popularizing scientific knowledge to the general public. Broad social responses were spurred by this report, and our work has been recognized and appreciated by the public. We also promoted scientific knowledge through WeChat official account, a popular online social media in China. The online popularization has attracted readers numbered in hundreds and has contributed to a wide range of social impacts.
Our WeChat Official Account & Nanjing Daily Report
In the future, we want to expand our activity to the whole society, eliminate pseudoscience and spread authoritative scientific knowledge to the general public. In order to achieve this, we must cooperate with government. We have got connect with some relevant government officers and further work is being negotiated.

Regarding our intention to raise the specificity of cell killing, different possible designs were conceivable. These are accompanied by the introduction of certain genes or their elimination through a knockout. Focusing on the controlled CAR expression, an AND gate with a clear defined allocation of inputs and output had to be generated.
The first possible system was a knockout of HIF1A or HIF1B and its reintroduction via lentiviral transduction under the control of either CRE or CTLA4 promoter. Considering the law of mass action, a knockout of HIF1B would have a kinetic disadvantage over a knockout of HIF1A because HIF1B is accumulated permanently and independently from external conditions (Pescador et al., 2005) while HIF1A is only accumulated under hypoxia. Therefore only a knockout of HIF1A was considered a possible candidate for an AND gate.
The second or third possibility would be a knockout of either TDAG8 or VEGFR-2. Both can be described by the same model as both receptors are activated by one input and trigger activation of the associated promoter afterwards.
Unfortunately, experimental data only exist for HEK cells which are not representative for T cells (Ausländer et al., 2014; Nguyen et al., 2012). Therefore, the different AND gate designs were modeled with the same rate"

A) Did you know the term Synthetic Biology (as an evolution of the concept of Genetic Engineering)?
1. I know it and i know about its applications.
2. I have some ideas, but not so clear.
3. I never heard about it.
B) Given the possibility to engineer an organism to perform a given function in a controlled way, which perspectives can be profiled, in your opinion?
1. I have great expectations for applications in Human health.
2. I think that this kind of research will never come out of laboratories.
3. I think it may profile scenarios of genetic pollution.
4. I have no idea.
C) “Everything you can imagine, Nature has already created”, quoting A. Einstein. You think that:
1. Researchers are arrogant when they think of improving nature.
2. It is important that science could take advantage of theoretical knowledge for applicative uses.
3. The efforts of research could never overcome the efficiency of natural systems.
4. I have no interest in these implications.
D) In which field you think that Synthetic Biology may have better applications?
1. Environmental (e.g. Bioremediation, Biosensors)
2. Biomedical (e.g. New Therapies, Diagnostics)
3. Food and Agriculture (e.g. Product improvement, Toxicology)
4. Energetic (e.g. Renewable resources, Improved biomass)
Single categories: the answers!
Conclusions: Thank to our survey we can conclude that in our academic world, people of different categories know about Synthetic Biology and its applications, though a lot of people only have some unclear ideas about this discipline. Most of them have great expectations for its applications in Human health and they think that it is important that science could take advantage of theoretical knowledge for applicative uses. For the people of our University Synthetic Biology may have better applications in the Environmental field (e.g. Bioremediation, Biosensors) and in the Biomedical field (e.g. New Therapies, Diagnostics). We hope that our iGEM experience could help researchers and students focus on this growing research field.

The weak promoter was constructed by filling in the 4-bp overhangs  of the NheI site to the 5’ side of the -10 region (see Fig. 8) This displaces the -10 region and transcriptional start 4 bp to the right. Panel B.  RFP fluorescence from cultures grown to stationary phase in the presence of different IPTG concentrations . The response of cells expressing the weak LacI cassette is indicated in black. The response of cells expressing the strong LacI cassette is indicated in red.
Methods: Fresh colonies containing either the strong lacI plasmid or the weak LacI plasmid were inoculated into 5 mL cultures containing chloramphenicol and IPTG at the following exponential series of mM concentrations: 0, 0.001, 0.002, 0.004, 0.008, 0.016, 0.032, 0.064, 0.128. Cultures were grown to stationary phase in a shaking incubator for 20 hours at 37 C. Colour development resulting from RFP expression was measured by fluorescence as follows: Cells were first diluted 10-fold with TE buffer (10mM Tris, 1mM EDTA pH 8.0) in a final volume of 3 mL (the cuvette volume). Measurements were made using a Perkin Elmer luminescence spectrophotometer (LS 50 B), using parameters that were optimized for the highest value (Weak LacI Plasmid; 0.128 mM IPTG) with the help of Justin Fedor (Alberta iGEM alumnist 2009) These parameters are: 1. excitation wavelength (582 nm), 2. emission wavelength (603 nm), 3. filter cutoff (515 nm), 4. Slit widths lex= 10nm, lem= 10nm)
Testing colour control spatially
For the longer-range goal of producing a spectrum on an agar plate, one colour would have to fade out as another colour intensifies. We therefore chose an old and popular method for producing spatial gradients of small molecules that entailed placing a high concentration in a well positioned at the centre of the plate and letting it diffuse over time. If the chemical were IPTG we would expect strong colour at the plate’s centre that faded gradually toward the circumference as the IPTG concentration dropped. Below we"

BCCS-Bristol 2010 Biobrick
1. First Experience with BBa_k381001
Objective:
1. Test operation in liquid LB at 37 ° C and to KNO3 50 mM.
Methodology:
1. We used six falcon tubes of 25 mL. Three tubes were used for inoculation of the colonies from 06/09/11 and 12/09/11.
2. Two positive controls were prepared and one negative control for each test.
3. To positive control tubes we added 10 ml of liquid LB, 9.7 uL of chloramphenicol (33μg/mL) and 50mM of KNO3.
4. To negative control tube we added the same amount of LB and Chloramphenicol specified in the previous line, except KNO3.
5. Each tube was inoculated with the colonies; three of them with the conlonies from 06/09/11 and the rest with colonies from 12/09/11.
6. Tubes were incubated at 37 ° C for 48 hours.
After 48 hours we noticed that all the tubes for both tests showed no
change, including positive and negative controls. Our experiment was
based on BCCS-Bristol experiment. While reviewing the experiments of
Edinburgh in 2009, who designed the promoter used in the BioBrick
BCCS-Bristol, we realized that the promoter express better in minimal
essential media than in LB, but we do not rule out that we could have
made a mistake in the experience preparation prevented us from
showing the right results, which is why we decided to do the experiment
again.
2. Second Experience
Objectives:
1. Test the BioBrick operation to different substrates and temperatures, using KNO3  40 mM:
a. Substrates:
LB
Minimal essential medium
Saline solution
b. Temperatures:
8°C
23°C

As can be seen, the PCR amplification with primers 005, 006, 007 and 008 resulting in Linker-Tn5, Tn5, Tn5-Linker (respective sizes: 1508, 1452 and 1505 bp) were successful. In contradiction with the previous results, the new PCR machine did result in thicker and brighter bands DNA and is therefore considered more efficient for this PCR reaction. From this experiment it can be concluded that the standard PCR conditions work sufficient for this purpose.

Further, the 3D-printer is operating under ambient conditions, which safes money in the fabrication process.                     Due to the material properties, a special issue is the degradation of the biopolymer in dependence of time. A degradation of the material can mainly be circumvented by using the cell-free peptides, which prevents the consumption of the peptides by the cells. However, oxygen and mechanic stress are main issues, which have to be tackled. Oxygen can be excluded by instant packing of the material, whereas the mechanic durability of this material is still unknown.

Some cartilage fish such as sharks, rat sharks, etc. have antibodies called Ig-NAR in vivo, which                         consist of only two heavy chains but each has multiple constant domains (Fig. 1A). There is also                         a heavy chain antibody naturally deleted light chain, only two heavy chains, each heavy chain                         has three domains, including a variable domain, so this antibody (natural) has a heavy chain                         variable region Fragments (Fig. 1B), and found that such antibodies are abundant in some                         camelids, such as llamas, glamas, alpacas, llamas, and the like. Comparing hcIgG and Ig-NAR, it                         is not difficult to find that both antibodies use the variable region domain of the heavy chain                         N-terminus to specifically bind antigen, and the crystal structure of this part presents a flat                         shape resembling a football (Fig.2), approximately 2.5 nm in diameter and 4.2 nm in height.                         Antibodies of this size at the nanometer level are called Nanobodies (Nanobody, Nb), and now                         Nanobodies are commonly referred to as immunoglobulins of this hcIgG heavy chain variable region                         domain in camelids.[1]

In vivo catalysis
Because nanobodies can be expressed in prokaryotic expression and have strong stability, we used                         nanobodies instead of traditional antibodies for experiments. However, since the anisotropy of                         the nano-antibody molecules is not obvious, the ability to cause changes in the arrangement of                         liquid crystal molecules is limited. Therefore, we need to perform long-chain modification on                         Nanobodies to increase their ability to respond to liquid crystals.
Fig.3 Nanobody recognition beta 2 microglobulin
Here we use a two-plasmid system: insert the Formylglycine-Generating Enzyme(FGE) gene into one                         plasmid; insert the Nanobody gene and the aldehyde-based precursor tag into the other                         plasmid.
Fig.4 FGE specifically recognizes amino acid sequences and catalyzes                                     the process of specific sites
At the same time, FGE can specifically recognize this tag, which in turn catalyzes the oxidation                         of cysteine to the aldehyde group. Thus co-expression of these two plasmids"

This is the second year that the ESBS-Strasbourg participates in the iGEM  competition. Our team consists of 12 students coming from different  scientific backgrounds prior to the ESBS. This will help us to deal with the  difficulties coming up during this interdisciplinary project. Our shared  education at the ESBS however enables us to communicate more easily with each  other. An overview of the people involved and our competences can be found on  the team page.
iGEM - INTERNATIONAL GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MACHINES
iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machines) is a competition  organized by MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) in Boston, USA,  since 2004 and has become one of the largest international competitions in the  field of science. This year 128 teams of undergraduate students compete against  each other, and for the second time ESBS-Strasbourg team is joining this  competition.
Synthetic biology is a new area of biological research that combines science and engineering. Synthetic biology encompasses a variety of  different approaches, methodologies and disciplines. We can define the synthetic  biology as the design and (re)construction of new biological  functions and systems not found in nature.
Similar to the construction of a car,  Synthetic Biology uses simple gene building blocks for the construction of new complex systems with distinct functions.  These gene building blocks are collected in a database by iGEM and can  be used by all participants of the competition. So far, the collection contains  more than 13,000 gene building blocks , due to the continuous development of  new parts over the last years. This summer all teams work on self-developed  projects which will then be presented in the beginning of November at the  “Jamboree” in Boston. Several prizes in different categories will be awarded.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#testfh_-_-_TEXT.html," på landet! Midt i solskinnet lå der en gammel herregård med dybe kanaler rundt om, og fra muren og ned til vandet voksede store skræppeblade, der var så høje, at små børn kunne stå oprejste under de største; der var lige så vildsomt derinde, som i den tykkeste skov, og her lå en and på sin rede; hun skulle ruge sine små ællinger ud, men nu var hun næsten ked af det, fordi det varede så længe, og hun sjælden fik visit; de andre ænder holdt mere af at svømme om i kanalerne, end at løbe op og sidde under et skræppeblad for at snadre med hende.  Endelig knagede det ene æg efter det andet: “pip! pip!” sagde det, alle æggeblommerne var blevet levende og stak hovedet ud.  “Rap! rap!” sagde hun, og så rappede de sig alt hvad de kunne, og så til alle sider under de grønne blade, og moderen lod dem se så meget de ville, for det grønne er godt for øjnene.  “Hvor dog verden er stor!” sagde alle ungerne; thi de havde nu rigtignok ganske anderledes plads, end da de lå inde i ægget."
Purdue,2014,Team:Purdue#Policy and Practices#Scaling It Up_-_-_TEXT.html," packaged in provides few nutrients so many live cells die or undergo sporulation. This can then be seen as a way to further reduce costs, making our product more available to those it would benefit the most.
Granulation
Donnellan et. al. reported that from a 1 liter culture they were able to recover 250 mg of B. subtilis. Given the 12 L culture we will be able to purify 3 grams of spores which will be mixed with 13.6 Kg of calcium lignosulphonate giving a final concentration of .02% spores. Calcium lignosulphonate is a common binding agent which will dissolve in water, releasing the Minecrobe spores which will then activate in the soil, begin to reproduce, and produce siderophores. The spore-calcium lignosulphonate mixture will be compressed and extruded into granules using a roll compactor. The resulting granules will then be divided into three 10 lb. bags for shipping.  Dry granulation was chosen for several distinct benefits that it offered to packaging and transporting the Minecrobe. By mixing the spores with a binding agent we overcame two distinct problems with transportation. Firstly by packaging the spores in a water sensitive binding agent they are prevented from activating prematurely. Any water that is able to penetrate the shipping bag will be absorbed by the binding agent and prevented from activating the spores. Only a catastrophic failure of the shipping bag would allow the spores to become active, and that would render the product useless in this form as with any other. The second problem that is avoided by using a binding agent is the accidental inhalation of spores. The original design was to package and ship the spores without any additives, the problem being that inhalation of B. subtilis spores may resulting possible lung irritation and may require hospitalization for the severely immunocompromised.
Packaging and Shipping
For shipping the granulated spores, 5 L of space are needed to fit  10 lbs. of granules. The density of calcium lignosulphonate is 800-965 kg/m^3, which was rounded to 1000 kg/m^ 3 for the purposes of calculation given the decreased packing efficiency of granules compared to powder. 10 lb (4.5 Kg) of granules require .0045 m^3 of volume, or 4.5 L. Rounding up to a more common 5 liter bag size gives room for variances in the density of the granules and a more easily obtainable bag"

Syringe Pumps
Designing the XY-Stage
In order for TERRA to select for specific locations to dispense fluids, we needed a method of either moving the output tube or the vessel, such as a 96-well plate. We ultimately decided to move the vessel, as that would minimize the length of and amount of unusable volume in the output tube. This XY-stage needed to have the following functions and features: the ability for translational motion; a homing system; a control system; a manufacturing method; material; and motors.
The following morphological chart illustrates our potential means of accomplishing each function or feature and the chosen options are written in green.

Translational Motion: We chose to use a system of timing belts and pulleys as it is more accurate and creates less backlash than threaded rods. The timing belts and pulleys are also more cost effective, as they are as accurate as higher-end threaded rods, which would be necessary for smooth translational motion. The pulleys are also easier to mount and integrate into the design of the XY-stage than threaded rods.
Homing: Our team chose to utilize contact switches in order to home our system as they were the easiest to integrate into the existing design of TERRA and were low-cost. We had briefly considered manual, user-controlled homing, but realized that it would result in a great amount of human error, as the user would need to approximate the distance from the nozzle to the well A1. Optical sensors and ultrasonic sensors would result in accurate locations, but would increase the cost of TERRA and would provide unnecessary feedback.
Control: We decided to use the Arduino Mega to control our XY-stage and syringe pumps, as the addition of Arduino shields allowed for more motors to be connected per microprocessor. Our team also considered the use of a Raspberry Pi, but it contained more functions than needed for our project with fewer ports.

Ruiling CAI
I will definitely arrive at the lab before 9 tomorcolumn! (Never)
Ruiling is a junior majoring in biology at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Devoted to iGEM for two years, she has got lots of training from lab work to project design. Besides, she really treasures the precious and memorable experience of working with all her teammates and instructors. About them, the future is still very long. To be short, she is the leader of the team this year.
“Deadline gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall have no breakfast, play no games, watch no films. I shall wear no ccolumnns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the alarm of the clock. I am the watcher for the schedule. I am the fire that burns against the laziness, the light that brings the energy, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the team of UCAS. I pledge my life and honor to the Deadline’s Watch, for this ddl and all the ddls to come.”
Apart from iGEM she is also a singer and a geek design aficionado. To her, the beat and melody have the magic power"

16/07 - 20/07:
Team biotin: This week, we focused on the pastoris cloning. We prepared the pGAP vector (amplification, purification and digestion), mRFP1, BFP and scygonadin parts and we cloned all three. We tried to amplify and purify pPIC but unfortunately it was necessary to try again because the Midiprep didn’t succeed.
Team coli: this week, we made or own competent cells using BL21 DE3 and tuner strains
Team pastoris: this week, we did In-fusion cloning in the pGAP but this time with the cerberus mSA2. After transformation, culture and miniprep, we checked clones by digestion. The cloning was a success.
23/07 - 27/07:
Team biotin: this week, before another midiprep, we checked the pPIC but we still had a mapping problem. After many verifications, it was clearly not correct but we found another source for this plasmid and it seemed OK. We amplified it by midiprep.
Team coli: this week, we did the first production assay for Sirius and we were very happy because we obtained a red culture medium.
Team pastoris: this week, the pichia team helped the other teams because it was ahead of the planning and had to wait for yeast growth.
30/07 - 03/08:
Team biotin: this week, we worked on pETDuet-BirA to clone our functionalizing proteins (mRFP1 and BFP). We amplified the pETDuet-BirA and after Midiprep and digestion, we cloned mRFP1 and BFP with the In-fusion kit. After digestion, we sent clones to sequencing and started production assay in E. coli BL21 DE3.
Team coli: we did the first Sirius purification after production in E. coli BL21 DE3. To do this, we used an IMAC column and dialysis. In order to prove the CBM3 fixation to cellulose, we prepared the regenerated amorphous cellulose.
Team callulose: We intensified the cellulose production to be able to give 5g of dried cellulose to the Bordeaux iGEM team at the end of the month.

brief introduction
This part includes viewing datas by category, searching datas, bookmarks and help. Six members devided into three groups worked on it, and two of the groups were working on part category-formed-interface, which simplifys the long spreadsheet into keyword-showing tables.
7.18～7.19
Category:Analyzing the target website, members determined to provide four kinds of showing type:parts by type;parts by function; parts by chassis and devices by type.  Then members collected informations and codes ,in order to show a user friendly interface.
SE:Members discussed about the searching methods and searchstring. At first a picker was chosen for user to select the searching part(part name, discription and so on), and the searching method was fuzzy search --it means if you type ""BBa_"" and select ""part name"", the program will give you a result of all the biobricks whose part name includes ""BBa_"". The example is shown as image1.
At this time, the database was the first one we got (given by another iGEM team). For its complex database structure , the keyword needed to be searched in all 13 tables.
7.20～7.21
Category:After discussion, testing various styles, members decided to use folder form. Besides, every secondary part was devided into two section:description and list. Description was the introduction of the secondary title(eg. promoter), when the table was touchand list was the collection of all the biobrick in this category. The initial design is shown as image2.
SE:The interface was totally changed in these days. The picker was changed by several input fields, including part name, category, direction and length. And more options could be added if user needed. The sketch map was shown below(image3).

Week 11: July 8 - July 12
This week, we did miniprep on sequence verified BBa_J04500 . We also ran PCR products of the first Kapa HiFi PCR of TALE A and TALE B primers on gel, no bands visible. Subsequent higher temperature gradient Kapa HiFi PCR produced bands around 2500bp and lots of non specific bands (figure 11). Gel extraction had very low yields (<20ng/uL) and poor purity, and repeated extractions produced similar results.
Figure 11.Gradient Kapa Hifi PCR products of BBa_J04500 + TALE A and BBa_J04500 + TALE B .
We have received 5 primers for TALE B target sequences and did a Kapa HiFi PCR. Gel of PCR product produced expected results with bands ~600bp (figure 12).
Figure 12.Gradient Kapa Hifi PCR products of TALE target sequences.
A Kapa HiFi PCR of K coil primers was performed and showed expected results but also had lots of primer dimers. Subsequent gel extractions had poor purity and yields (figure 13).
Figure 13.Gradient Kapa Hifi PCR products of K coil.
Week 12: July 15 - July 19
This week we completed ligation, transformation, overnight culture, and miniprep of 5 TALE target sequences (figures 14 and 15). The verification digest gel had strong bands at ~2000bp and weak bands at ~550bp, and plasmids were sent for sequence verification (figures 16 and 17).

The results of the BBa_J04500 + TALE A and BBa_J04500 + TALE B sequencing were back. However, we realized that TALEs have a Kozak sequence at the beginning, which increases the distance between the promoter and the start codon of the gene. Therefore, a primer (TALseqF) was designed  to"

Occurrence
The amount of natural occurring nickel in comparison to other heavy metals is quite low even if it is an element of the Earth’s crust. Therefore, small amounts of it are found in food, water, soil and air. Nickel concentration in drinking water is normally less than 0.02 mg/L, although through releases from taps and fittings the nickel may accumulate to concentrations up to 1 mg/L. In special cases of release from natural or industrial nickel deposits in the ground, there may be higher concentrations in drinking-water. Through unintended release the concentration can be higher than the guideline value of 0.07 mg/L (WHO: Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality,"

Overall Project Description
We are working to optimize the wastewater treatment process. Currently we are addressing some of the difficulties faced by the working microbial community in the bioreactor. These include: the buildup of biofilm, the destruction of the ""working class"" bacteria by phage, antibiotic discharge into the wastewater, and nitrate production. We will be building our machine in the bioreactor bacterium N. multiformis and optimizing it to address the aforementioned obstacles.
Project: Antibiotic Breakdown
Project Background:
In the current sewage treatment processes antibiotics present a serious problem to the downstream environment. Many of these and other similar chemical compounds, because they are not regulated or easily degraded, are being released into the environment at a growing rate. We identified the most commonly prescribed antibiotics and chose to address the breakdown of such antibiotics. We identified amoxicillin based and erythromycin based antibiotics among the most prevalent. The enzymes beta-lactamase and erethryomycin esterase B were identified as candidates for the breakdown of our antibiotics. We used the EreB gene from the iGEM parts database, and amplified the Bla gene from the iGEM plasmid pSB1A3.

Project: Biofilm Annihilation
Project Background:
Biofilm production by bacteria is a major concern in activated sludge processors (ASPs). The buildup of these bacteria in these processors inhibits the helpful bacteria from being able to effectively break down several components. Of main concern are the biofilms of bacteria such as Nocardia spp., Thiothrix spp., Sphaerotilus natans, and several others. In order to solve this issue we cloned the genes for Alpha Amylase and DispersinB, both which break down the polysaccharide matrix of biofilms, as well as the gene for AiiA, a quorum-sensor blocker, into Nitrosospira multiformis, one of the helpful bacteria in the activated sludge processors. Attached to these genes"
TJU,2015,Team:TJU#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," keep constant with the buffer function of KHPO4 together with KH2PO4. Suppose that Shewanella can absorb lactate brought by E.coli timely, thus, pH can remain stable, which is around 7.2 based on our hypothesis. Further, we assume that transmembrane transfer belongs to codiffusion where the concentration difference of H+ and acid groups can drive the whole process. Therefore, the transmembrane transfer is only related to the intra membrane concentration of H+ and acid groups.
Equation Establishment
Firstly, we establish the equation of ldh amount changing with time. The following equations represent the ldh production rate in E.coli without the plasmid insertion and with the plasmid introduction, respectively.
 
(2)
 
(3)
Next, we construct the lactate production rate equation:
 
(4)
Finally, the lactate transmembrane transfer equations has been figured out. It shows that lactate will be transferred to the outside at the time it produced. We represent the intra membrane with c and extra membrane with e.
 
 
The transmembrane transfer rate:
 
(5)
When lactate production is combined with its transfer, we can get the following equation:
 
(6)
Simulation Results
Figure 1. The relations between amount of ldh and lactate with time passed, respectively.
From the simulation results, we can clearly see that the E. coli with Ldh have a significantly increased in number and lactic acid production of lactate dehydrogenase, which is consist with our experimental results.
2  Models for monocultures of Shewanella in MFC
Shewanella Growth Model Based on Carbon Balance
At the very beginning, we construct a fermentation kinetic model based on the Monod Equation to draw a picture of carbon balance between biomass increase and base consumption during S.oneidensis MR-1 growth. Before generation our modeling, we simplify the center process of carbon metabolism in Shewanella via making assumptions as follows:
① Lactate is the preferable carbon source for Shewanella. Lactate can transform into pyruvate by dehydrogenation, which then converts mostly into acetyl coenzyme. Subsequently, acetyl coenzyme can either be oxidized into CO2 and release energy by TCA Circle or transform into acetate.
② When there are too much lactate, the producing rate of acetyl coenzyme will be greater than the consuming rate of that in TCA circle. The excessive acetyl coenzyme will convert into acetate and release to the outside. Inversely"

The part was validated by running PCR on the gene fragment using primers BBa_K2495019 and BBa_K2495020 . These primers amplified a region of approximately 1000 bp. Appropriate bands were seen in Lane 3, which indicated that the part was successfully ligated and transformed. This transformed part was used later in our LAMP assays, and the results of our part in use can be seen here .
CheB chemotaxis coding sequence (protein glutamate methylesterase) ( BBa_C0024 )
This part was designed by MIT SBC 2004 and is a protein involved in the E. coli chemotaxis pathway. 2017 Team NYU Abu Dhabi ran an in silico characterization of this protein and found that it was extremely stable as a free enzyme in an explicit solvent solution mimicking the KCl concentrations of E. coli.
In Silico Validation
The MD simulations were run using GROMACS with the CHARMM36 forcefield. We ran an energy minimization for 500 ps using the steepest descent minimization algorithm with a stopping condition of maximum force less than 1000 kJ/mol/nm. We found that the energy was minimized in this time frame as shown by the steady convergence of the potential energy (Figure 1).
The minimized structure was solvated with water >12 A away from the protein surface. Potassium and chlorine atoms were added to neutralize the system and mimic experimental conditions of approximately 30 mM concentrations. We equilibrated in two phases, first under an NVT ensemble and then under an NPT ensemble. Both were found to equilibrate within 150 ps as shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. These adjusted the volume to 1 bar and temperature to 300K with restraints on the solutes.
The last frame of the NPT equilibration was extracted to start NVT simulations. A short animation of the protein run for 1 ns is attached. RMSD and radius of gyration analyses were run in order to determine the stability of the protein. The RMSD plot (Figure 4) shows the RMSD of the backbone does not fluctuate dramatically over the 1 ns run, indicating that the structure is stable. The 0.05 nm difference in backbone RMSD over the whole run indicate that the structure at 1 ns is slightly different from the initial structure, due to the energy minimization.

Microscopy Division
Looks like we will have to make image analysis in Python for a beginning. We still see the noise on captured images.
Week 9 (14 August - 20 August)
Biology Division
Obtained algae growth curve. Next is algae ethanol tolerance test. Still adjusting new media for co-culture.
Microscopy Division
Last week we ordered a new laser and quality of the image changed drastically. Laser that we were using in the lab was inappropriate for Digital Holography as we have figured that out.
Week 10 (21 August - 27 August)
Biology Division
Finally, we start transforming algae! In parallel, we run algae-bacteria depedence tests to find relationship between them.
Microscopy Division
Image recostruction software is almost ready. We are thinking about the design of DIHM and seeking for inspiration around the campus. Teflon mold was made for us this week which we will use to cast PDMS.
Week 11 (28 August - 3 September)
Biology Division
We have run initial transformation screening adn identified individual colonies containing assembled constructs.
Microscopy Division
We find difficult to attach PDMS chamber to a glass slide. We met with plasma researcher in your university to discuss plasma bonding options. Whereas, UI for image capturing and analysis is rapidly developed.
Week 12 (4 September - 10 September)
Biology Division
Ordered BioBrick for E.coli that increases it's motility. Transformation did not proceed correctly.
Microscopy Division
We abandoned idea of using PDMS as a material for imaging chamber. Aluminium case for our microscope is ready. We hope to get all parts by next week.
Week 13 (11 September - 17 September)
Biology Division
It look like we will not be able to fix problem with algae transformation. It was ambitious task which was not possible to be done in such short period of time for us, but we still have the microscope.
Microscopy Division
Solution for imaging chamber was found by using acryl sheets and laser cutting. Desktop does not want to communicate with Raspberry Pi, but we will reconcile them.
Week 14 (18 September - 24 September)
Biology Division
Offered sacrifice sample of algae and bacteria to Microscopy Division. Analysing data from growth tests for algae and bacteria.
Microscopy Division
We have imaged Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and E.coli separately and together. We figured out that millichamber we have manufactured are too thick for your laser. Instead, we are using glass slide and coverslip. UI"

Community Communication
After hearing the community's concern about Biotechnology, we held two lectures to clear their prejudice. Meanwhile, we printed 80 booklets to expand publicity.
In China, the question about the safety of transgenic technology remains unknown. Though the question is really hard to confirm, many Chinese have stereotypes of biotechnology. We hosted two lectures about the correctness of Biotechnology, introducing the development Synthetic Biology, the stereotype phenomenon and the great biological applications that have been great contributions.
Then we printed 80 booklets which listed the argument on transgenic and the great biological applications.
What deserves to be mentioned is that most participants of our human practice is from College of Information Technology and we had a wonderful communication through the human practice. They asked us many questions and we also got some inspirations from them. What impressed us most is that a student from department of computer told us that the circuit switching and packet switching in computer network when transmitting information. We got a great inspiration from his words after we asked him for details about the two terms. Then we thought that circuit switching is that transmitting all information through a certain line but the packet switching is that dividing the information into pieces and transmitting different pieces through different lines. Both of the two methods have merits and demerits. Then we thought that why we could not combine both of them and then we designed our experiments that transmitting all information through two certain lines respectively in order to reduce the noises and uncertainty. And the experiments confirmed our views in some degree.
So you can see that we had a very successful human practice and we applied what we got from human practice into our experiments successfully. It helped with our project greatly and met the requirement of gold medal undoubtedly."

Today we received extremely bad news.  We had ordered 3 DNA constructs for synthesis by Mr. Gene on 19th August who had said that 98% of sequences of this length would have a turn-around time of 14 business days. We had become increasingly alarmed as time had gone on without the order being completed.  We received our first contact from them at this time, informing us that the company was having problem with one of our constructs - luxAB.  They said they had split the sequence into three parts and had to start from scratch, and that it might be 3 weeks until we got the sequence.  This would take us until just before the Jamboree.
We moped for a bit and then came up with a plan, we asked them to send the completed sequences as soon as possible. We decided we would attempt to fuse them to the Xenorhabdus luminescens luxAB submitted by last year's Edinburgh team.
But there was good news as shown by the image on the right.  We had believed that a number of our colour changes had failed due to sequencing results. But when we assayed our plates we found that some colonies had the desired phenotype. The plate on the right shows two distinct colour types.
Tuesday 5th October
We spent much of today moving out of the lab, we also analysed the results of the plate reader experiment.  Luciferin can be visualised by its fluorescence under UV light as shown on the right.

Our term proper began today so we were mostly busy but Paul came into the lab.

Edinburgh,2012,Team:Edinburgh#Project#Citrobacter-Freundii#2-Growth-in-sea-salts_-_-_TEXT.html," salts can be seen in Figure 1.
Figure 1 - C. freundii growth in M9 minimal medium + varying concentrations of sea salts
These results show that C. freundii does not grow well in minimal medium + sea salts, as the OD keeps decreasing as the concentration of sea salts increases.
1.3 A graph showing the OD readings taken from bottles of LB + varying concentrations of sea salts incubated with C. freundii overnight can be seen in Figure 2.
Figure 2 - C. freundii growth in LB + varying concentrations of sea salts
These results show that C. freundii can happily grow in LB + sea salts even when the salt concentration is higher than that of most seawaters. Concentrations of 10-20g/l seem to be more optimal but an OD above 1.8 is maintained throughout. This suggests that our novel chassis would indeed be able to be grown without having to waste freshwater on it.
1.4 Figure 3 shows the OD readings taken every 30 minutes from flasks containing either LB or LB + sea salts inoculated with either E. coli or C. freundii.
Figure 3 - C. freundii and E. coli growth over time in either LB or LB with sea salts
These results show that C. freundii can grow with and without sea salts at a similar rate to E. coli, so there would be no hindrance in using C. freundii for synthetic biology (and any biology) work over E. coli in sea salt medium.
Conclusions
We extensively characterized the ability of Citrobacter freundii to grow in the presence of various concentrations of sea salts, both on plates and in liquid media
We turned a failure (M9 liquid media) into a success
We assessed the growth rate of Citrobacter freundii and E. coli in 40g/l sea salt concentration media

Carafa Scoring System
Scoring System 2 is based on the model created by d'Aubenton Carafa.[1] The score of terminator consists of two parts, the free energy of stemloop and the score of 15 nt poly T tail. The free energy of stemloop is calculated using Loop Dependent Energy Rules[2]. The minimization of the free energy also determined the secondary structure of the stemloop. T tail score is calculated by the formula given by d’ Aubenton Carafa.
Detailed Calculation of Score
1. Some definitions[2]
i. Closing Base Pair
For an RNA sequence, we number it from 5’ to 3’ . If i < j and nucleotides ri and rj form a base pair,we denote it by i.j. We call base ri’ or base pair i’.j’ is accessible from i.j if i < i’ ( < j’ ) < j and if there is no other base pair k.l so that i < k < i’ ( < j’ ) < l < j. We denote the collection of base and base pair accessible from i.j by L(i,j). Then i.j is the closing base pair. Here “L” means loop.
ii.  n-loop
If the loop contain n – 1 base pairs, we denote it by n-loop. (Because there is a closing base pair, so we denote it by n-loop even though the closing base pair is not included in the loop.)
Here we can divide loops which may be formed in the terminator secondary structure into two kinds.
1-loop : Hairpin loop(size of loop shouldn’t be smaller than 3)
2-loop : Interior Loop(right strand size and left strand size are both bigger than 0.)
Buldge(Size of one strand is bigger than 0 and that of another strand is 0.)
Stack(size of the loop is 0.)
