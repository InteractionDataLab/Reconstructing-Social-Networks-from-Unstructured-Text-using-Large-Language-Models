BGU_Israel,2015,Team:BGU Israel#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," numerous genetic changes in cancer cells and responds by activating a synthetic machine that executes a cell suicide program or enables color-based ""tagging"" of the cells for tumor detection, ensuring complete surgical removal. The novelty of the system relies on its high specificity, achieved by conditional activation based on a number of genetic changes that take place specifically in cancer cells. Because such changes vary depending on the person or type of tumors, a modular system of such will enable personalized care for each patient.
About Us
Our team includes eight students of different academic backgrounds (Biotechnology Engineering, Biology, Medicine, Neuroscience and Cognition, Economics & Political Science). The team is supervised by Prof. Smadar Cohen, Dr. Emil Ruvinov and Dr. Efrat Forti from the department of Biotechnology Engineering.
2.   Company Description
        Products and services
        Boomerang is developing a novel cancer therapy based on an advanced methods is genetic engineering. Using the Crispr-Cas9 system, our drug is designed to work only under the presence of two cancer-specific signals, making it an extremely specific therapy. In addition, our treatment was designed to be personalized for each patient, based and its specific tumor signature.
        Background to its development
        Although being one of the most researched and funded fields in medicine, cancer is still one of the greatest challenges facing medicine today. We recognised three weak points in current treatments, that prevent them from eliminate cancer: Low specificity, low efficiency and low personalization. We therefore tried to develop a treatment that will be both specific, efficient and personalized in hope to revolutionize cancer management.
        Benefits and Features
        Our product's main benefit is its high specificity for cancer cells. In contrast to other treatments that recognize cancer cells based on only one cellular change that known to be unique for cancer (for example - cell division in chemotherapy, specific protein in targeted therapy), our treatment is the first to recognize and work on tumours only in the presence of two cancer-specific cellular changes,  making it extremely specific and free of toxicity and adverse effects.                 Although cancer is not a single disease but a huge group of different diseases characterized by different genetic changes, the same exact treatments are addressed today for thousands of patients, not considering the differences between patients.  Another important benefit of our treatment is the ability to design it easily and cheaply to recognise and kill every tumor type based on its unique genetic profile. The two signals that activate our drug are promoters – the 'switches' that turn on and off genes. Each cancer have its unique cocktail of promoters activity that allows it to create"

Week 1: May 1-2
Our first week consisted mainly of formal introductions and various brainstorming sessions regarding the direction of the 2014 project. The options were narrowed down to a biofilm based water filtration system and a rapid, multi-diagnostic test. Experts in the field of bioremediation, molecular biology, and medicine were consulted in order to gain more insight on the prospects of both project ideas. Ultimately, the rapid multi-diagnostic was voted over the water filtration system and we began preliminary planning.
Week 2: May 5-9
We attended a series of workshops tailored towards those who are researching various aspects of molecular biology. We learned the basics of genetic engineering and lab protocol in preparation for future research. These workshops were especially helpful for our team members who had no prior experience working in a lab.
Week 3: May 12-16
The techniques we learned during the workshops were applied within our own lab; we made stocks of competent E. coli., poured anti-bacterial agar, performed plasmid mini-prep, ran gels, etc.. The team decided upon an in-vivo diagnostic system that could detect pathogens through homologous recombination. Literature research was conducted on the subject of how to enhance the natural transformation of E. coli.
In regards to E. coli., it was discovered that E. coli. was closely related to H. influenzae, a species of bacteria well known for it's high frequencies of natural transformation (competency). H. influenzae uses a Type-IV pilus structure to uptake DNA, so the team researched"

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioSensor Chromoproteins_-_-_TEXT.html," radiation in the atmosphere than are in our lab environment, we used UV-opaque and UV-transparent glass to cover the top and bottom row of the grid. The center row was left exposed to the elements as a control. These were then mounted onto the payload of the Stanford High Altitude Balloon Team’s balloon (Details in Figures 32, 33, and 34) and were readied for launch!
Figure 31
Figure 32
Figure 33
Figure 34
A GoPro was mounted on the payload as well in order to catch inflight data. In the image to the right, taken at 10000 feet from the surface, the chromoproteins can be seen starting to change their color from blue to purple (Figure 35). A tracking device placed on the balloon allowed for the payload to be recovered once the balloon had burst. The image below was taken of the fusion proteins immediately after payload recovery (Figure 36). As can be seen, the once-blue fusion proteins are now purple. This purple color was persistent for six hours before eventually returning back to blue which is unlike previous heat tests in that usually the blue color comes back rather quickly.
Figure 35
Figure 36
This could have occurred for a variety of reasons. The simplest explanation is that the exposure time to heat stress was much longer in the field test than in the lab. Usually our heat test experiments last anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes of constant heat exposure. As a result, it might be easier for the chromoproteins to regain their structure afterwards. Because all three of the levels of UV-exposure that were tested had the same degree of color change, it seems unlikely that the exposure to UV was responsible for the prolonged color change we witnessed. However, it is possible that even the UV-resistant glasses we used were not enough to block out trace amounts of UV and that these trace amounts of UV destabilized the structure of the chromoproteins in such a way that the prolonged color change occurred.  Below is a video capturing the flight (Video 3).

PCR test to see if all of our 27 E. coli primers are working. Most seem pretty good.
Successfully extracted our first 17 E. coli genes for biobricking from all the E. coli PCR reactions that yielded a single product band. Nanodrop results confirm DNA extracted. The PCR reactions with multiple product bands were rerun on a gel and the gene product of interest was excised on our new transilluminator.
Inserted our 17 successfully extracted genes of interest into plasmid pSB1C3. Lengthy, tricky process. Will be running gel to confirm we've made well-formed biobricks. Then, on to transformation!
10 Remaining unisolated E. coli genes ran in gel, but it was thoroughly incomprehensible. WIll try again.

Glasgow,2017,Team:Glasgow#ANDGate_-_-_TEXT.html," primer.
Primer design included the insertion of the weak strength ribosome binding site (RBS) B0032 upstream of the start codon of the two T7 RNAP fragments (green) highlighted sequence above. The addition of these RBS emulated the effect of BioBrick assembly by inclusion of the TACTAG assembly scar between the B0032 and RNAP fragment sequences (orange). Both fragment reverse primers were designed to result in the parts ending with double TAA stop codons, in the case of the N-term part this meant the insertion of the two stops, while the C-terminal part primer added one in addition to the natural TAA (red). The C-terminal F-primer also included a new start codon (purple). Forward primers included BioBrick prefixes and reverse primers included the BioBrick suffixes respectively, highlighted in yellow. All primers included a 6-bp sequence of DNA (blue) to allow efficient restriction digest of the outermost restriction enzymes, according to NEB instructions.   The T7 RNAP fragments were amplified by a colony PCR of E. coli BL21<DE3>, a strain of E. coli that has the T7 RNAP integrated into its chromosome. A single colony of BL21<DE3> was picked from a streaked agar plate, then resuspended into 200 μl of TE buffer. 1 μl of this colony template was used in 50 μl NEB Phusion polymerase reactions, following their protocol, except with an extended (10 min) initial 95°C denaturation step to release genomic DNA from the colony template.
Split GFPmut3b (E0040)
We designed a PCR reaction to generate a C-terminal GFP2 part which would work alongside the existing N-terminal GFP1 part K1789003 by NUDT_CHINA 2015. Primer3 was used to design roughly 60°C Tm primers to amplify the coding sequence of the 83 aa C-terminal fragment, as shown in Table 3.

Colours denote features: blue text = flanking DNA; yellow highlight = Biobrick prefix (F) or suffix (R); purple = new start codon; unformatted text = annealing section of primer.

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Project#Transformation_-_-_TEXT.html," pulled an all-nighter to get the DNA ready. We would have missed our intercity bus if it wasn’t for Rosario who drove us to the bus station, all squished together in the “pizza mobile” with the trunk  full with our medium bottles and lab equipment. After five hours on the bus, we fell into bed to get some rest, because we had a very long day ahead of us.
We arrived at the Reski lab early in the morning to meet with Dr. Gertrud Wiedemann, who instructed us throughout the day and gave us many tips how to proceed with the moss. Because of the incubation times and because it was our first try, it took us ten hours without a break until we had two boxes stacked with 6 well plates. We quickly went to get some beers and chips and met with the Freiburg iGEM team for a really nice barbecue. When we finally left, public transport wasn’t running anymore, so we didn’t miss the chance to take a midnight sightseeing tour through Freiburg, where Volker showed us around.
Ten days later, Johanna and Andi visited the Freiburg lab to transfer the then regenerated protoplasts onto agar plates and soon after, we came back for our second and final round of transformation. At our first try, we didn’t get enough moss protoplasts, so we worked through two batches and therefore had to prepare another batch of driselase. Our handling had improved, yet it still took twelve hours and again, there was no time left for a break. After we said good bye, we celebrated with a couple of beers and some yummy flammkuchen at the UC uni café of Freiburg. We had learned so much and got much closer to our goal. A big successful step for our team!

Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," the number of ions bound per ligand (n). Ka describes the affinity of a ligand for its substrate, and we used it to quantitatively characterize the interaction between our peptide and copper [21]. All binding parameters for the test were within the specifications determined by the manufacturer. We used 10 mM, 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer for testing because it does not cause metal ion interference, and has a stable pKa over a wide temperature and pH range. Experiments were conducted at pH 5.5 to prevent copper precipitation, and pre-made copper stock solutions of known concentration were used.
Peptides were prepared for ITC by dissolving lyophilized protein (powder) in MES buffer, and ITC experiments were run at 25°C and set to deliver 20, 0.5 – 1 µL injections of Cu at 150 second intervals. The metal solution in the syringe was titrated into the peptide solution in the cell, and interactions were measured. Raw data were corrected by subtracting the heats of dilution, and collected data were fit with a one-site binding model using the Origin-7™ software.
2.7 Prototype and Phen Green Assay for Bulk Adsorption
To test the peptides, strips of pure mycelium from the species Ganoderma lucidum were incubated in purified CBD-2xHHTC protein (suspended in 6 mL of 10 mM pH 5.5 MES buffer, with a fusion protein concentration of 0.45 mM) that had been cleaved with DTT on a flatbed shaker for 72 hours. These pieces were then cut into uniform 1 cm2 squares (assuming chitin assumes an approximately regular distribution, as this is difficult to control for and testing with RFP-CBD led us to believe this was the case). As a control, we also incubated untreated mycelium in 10 mM pH 5.5 MES buffer for the same time period. We then prepared a Cu stock solution in MES, and the Cu concentration in our starting solution was 325 (+/-25) µM. Three environments/types of trials were run: one with the treated mycelium filter, one with untreated mycelium, and one with just the Cu solution and no mycelial material. These took place in 6 mL of the Cu stock solution in sterile 15 mL falcon tubes on a flatbed shaker. All experiments were run in triplicate, for a total of 9 trials. Two hundred μL samples"

Vagineering : A New Non Hormonal Contraception
Abtract
Modern hormonal contraceptive methods have been revolutionary for women in developed countries; however, they still exhibit a variety of challenges. Developing countries lack consistent access, hormonal contraceptives can produce harmful environmental effects, and some women are unable use them due to health problems. The Vagineering project looks to solve these issues with a novel, non-hormonal method. Our team aims to engineer Lactobacillus jensenii, a bacterium from the vaginal flora, to produce two proteins to prevent unintentional pregnancy: antisperm antibodies that inhibit sperm motility and anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) that produce spermicidal effects. The goal is to create a lasting contraceptive using only bacteria, which can later be reversed by engineering the strain with a kill-switch. Additionally, our studies of this strain have produced a toolbox that will help other teams to further engineer this less-characterized bacterium.

Léa Meneu and Léo Carillo, two students from the iGEM 2018 Montpellier team are pursuing their master’s degree at Sorbonne Université in Paris. So we invited them to help us introduce synthetic biology and the iGEM experience to high school students. To do so, practical sessions were organized. Several meetings between our teams were set to prepare the slides and purchase the equipments. Teaching students was a very nice opportunity to learn how to explain our project with simple words.

1. Christopher Chang
 
In May, we were very lucky to meet with Christopher Chang from UC-Berkeley and discussed our project with him. He showed us amazing ways to mimic hydrogenase using chemical methods and gave us important suggestions about the background knowledge. After the discussion, we took him to tour around the campus.
 
 
2. Xinghua Xia
 
On the afternoon of July 19th, we interviewed with Prof. Zou from state key laboratory of biochemistry in NJU who is an expert in hydrogen production. He introduced to us new methods for hydrogen production such as biomimetic catalysts for hydrogen production. We also got inspired about some chemistry problems in our project. First, the function of S2- in CdS is to change the energy state of Cd. The S2- that we added in our experiment is different from Cys. Thus we should add the control experiment: no S in the solution, add S2-, add Cys. He also advised us to test the size of bandgap for utilization of visible light. Second, he suggested that we should consider the interactions between S2- and protein PbrR. Third, there are two ways for transmembrane electron transduction. Last but not least, we should consider the choice and optimization of reductants. The interview with him was indeed inspiring because Prof. Zou showed us a broader way to think about problems.

As a physicist and material scientist, he applied the technology of crystallography to catalyzing the hydrogen production by water electrolysis, and this work was published on Nature in 2001 and simultaneously commented by Science to mark its profound significance.
 
The biggest question Professors proposed is the reason why we choose E.coli instead of photosynthetic organisms such as algae. Next, Professor Zou’s laboratory has cast light on bio-hydrogen, as Xiong Wei from Zhejiang University would also join the lab after graduation. He planned to perform experiments on hydrogen produced by algae thus Professor Zou would love to establish cooperation with us.

At the end of the competition, we got samples from Melbourne and Macquarie iGEM teams in Australia, from Valencia iGEM team, from Barcelona iGEM team from INSA-Lyon iGEM team, but also from Namibia, Croatia, Algeria, from Cochin and Clos Montmartre in Paris and from Grignon and Suresnes in France.
Also, we are looking into some human gut strains for their quercetin degradation ability.
Indeed, wine is know for its cardiovascular protect effect. And we figured out that the compound enabling this effect is actually phenol compound.
On top of that, quercetin and anthocyanin seems to be the most powerful wine antioxydant, and mostly explain this cardiovascular protector effect .
The epithelium from the gut is not able to digest the flavonoid and to cleave it into phenol compound. That's why it is higly probable that the microbiome is responsible for its degradation.
If we were able to isolate some bacteria from human feces on quercetin plate, we may have some very interesting results.
The problem is that we need an authorization to work with human sample. We sent a request for it but it may take a lot of time, with the hope of a quick answer.

In the same way, It would also be very interesting to work with herbivorous animals, as they eat a lot of flavonoids, responsible for many plants color.
So we can expect that some microbes isolated from these animals' gut could also degrade theses flavonoids into phenolic compounds.
But once again we need some authorizations to work on animals samples.
Week 17th - 25th July
We discovered Church's article, describing the isolation of antibiotic degrading bacteria from soil samples. It appears that the goal was very similar to ours, the only difference remaining in the nature of the molecule.
As they wanted to isolate bacteria that can grow on antibiotics as a unique carbon source, their main concern was carbon contamination from the soil sample.
To avoid this contamination they inoculated the samples in a SCS (single carbon source) liquid medium."

Unfortunately, we didn’t succeed to isolate an inducible pIV* in time. But we have managed to optimise methods and protocols that can be quite useful to reach this goal. We just needed some more time because, as the first team of our university, we had to discover the difficulties to lead such an ambitious project, such as looking for sponsors, establishing efficient communications, etc.
Despite this disappointment, we obtained an intermediate phenotype that can still be improved and used. We think our project has some more potential to be exploited and we count on further UCLouvain teams to take over from us.

We popularized science in several high schools as well as in three of the biggest universities in the country. To educate people we went out in the busy streets of Sofia and showed people 3D models of cell organelles as well as structures of DNA and various proteins. That provoked interest in many of them and they were fascinated by synthetic biology and our innovative project.
Our public engagement drew the attention of major Bulgarian media (BiT, Nova TV, BTV, Boomberg, BNR, newspapers and online newsfeeds) which gave us the opportunity to educate publicly from the TV screens about the benefits from and the science that goes with genetically modified organisms. As a result of those broadcasts a lot of people contacted us and we organized meetings in several cafés where we answered all of their questions.

大腸菌においても活性酸素に対する防御機構が存在しています。大腸菌には2通りの活性酸素への応答があります。一つはOxyR応答、もう一つはSoxRS応答です。
OxyR応答で、OxyRの遺伝子産物は転写調節因子として働いています。これは通常状態では不活化であり機能しませんが、活性酸素に応答して活性化し特定のDNA配列に結合するようになります。この特定のDNA配列はプロモーター領域に含まれます。OxyRの遺伝子産物が結合するとそのプロモーターの転写が促進あるいは抑制されてプロモーターの下流のタンパク質の発現が調節されます。このようなOxyRの遺伝子産物が結合する領域をもつプロモーターの下流にある遺伝子は活性酸素に対する防御遺伝子であり、活性酸素を分解するような活性酸素を減らす能力を持ちます。これらの遺伝子の中で、私たちはEcoRⅠ、XbaⅠ、SpeⅠ、PstⅠによって切断されない遺伝子配列を持つahpC,dps.oxyR,sufA,yaiAのプロモーターに注目しました。これらの遺伝子のプロモーターをBiobrickサイトに記載されているpSB6A"

I am really interested in synthetic biology, modeling of biological systems, education, directed evolution and protein engineering. I would like especially to know more about extremophilic protein, which is why I am doing an internship in the institute of physico-chemical biology (IBPC, Paris) in a bioinformatics laboratory to study molecular modeling of extremophilic protein. I love interdisciplinarity and I think iGEM is a fantastic opportunity to learn a lot about synthetic biology and sciences in an innovative way.

1st year PhD student at FdV doctoral school of Paris Descartes University
I’m a  PhD student working on synthetic biology. My interest for this field started 3 years ago when i did the first year of the AIV master program and participated to the iGEM Paris team in 2010. I have to say that this experience of research influenced me a lot during the past two years. Last year I decided to share my"

Sheng was 2016 overseas tutor of NEU-CHINA team. Besides, he is an expert on colorectal cancer and has some knowledge of most bowel diseases.
He made the following Suggestions for our project design:
Ⅰ. Looking for the right chassis, E. coli Nissle can be used as chassis
Ⅱ. Select the nitric oxide as inflammatory bowel disease of nonspecific inflammation signal molecules
III. Sustained and stable output is required for anti-inflammatory devices.
2. Doctor consultation
After choosing interleukin-10 as the output of engineering bacteria and conducting experiments for a period of time, in order to find out the feasibility of our scheme, we went to consult with professor Zheng Changqing, a first-line expert in intestinal diseases. He is the director of the department of internal medicine of Shengjing hospital affiliated to China Medical University and the director of the second department of gastroenterology.
Dr. Zheng Changqing introduced the treatment of IBD from the aspects of patients' disease, current clinical treatment methods, and common drugs.
Ⅰ. Doctors say using bacteria to secrete TNF an immune inhibitor is an effective way.
Ⅱ. Compared to mammalian cells, bacteria are more easy to operate and mass culture. They have more potential. However, the issue of safety should be carefully considered and bioprotective measures should be taken to avoid biological leakage.
III. Common anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used in patients with mild to moderate symptoms, and immunosuppressive agents are more commonly used in patients with Crohn's disease.
Ⅳ. We know that IBD and diet and the changes of intestinal bacteria strains. During the communication, we also learned that the prevalence of IBD in China has skyrocketed in recent years, and currently the number of effective drugs is limited. Expensive biologics are not covered, and patients rely on ordinary anti-inflammatory drugs. It will be very meaningful if our therapy can be applied effectively in clinical practice. Inspired by professor Zheng, in the future, we will combine engineered bacteria to release immunosuppressive and TNF monoclonal antibodies.
3 mobile games
Based on our treatment plan for inflammatory bowel disease, our team designed a simple game. In the game, players play engineered bacteria that travel through the fire-filled gut, collecting nitric oxide emitted by inflammation and releasing the drug interleukin 10 to destroy the flame to help the gut recover.

And we inserted additional gene, eCFP: Cyan Fluorescent protein (BBa_E0020), upstream of Ag43 gene as indicator of expression of “Aggregation Module” (Fig. 7).
Furthermore, we executed codon optimization of Ag43 by JCat [7] and replaced 6 recognition sites of PstI which originally exists in wild-type Ag43 sequence with sequences suitable for BioBrick assembly. By this optimization, we would be able to improve the translational frequency of Ag43 and accelerate the time required for aggregation.
To aggregate cells each other, L-arabinose was added into LB liquid medium with appropriate antibiotics for induction of the function of “Aggregation Module”, and cultured in glass test tubes. The plastic tube was not suitable for producing large cluster of E. coli cells, since a strong affinity of E. coli expressing Ag 43 was observed onto the surface of inside of plastic test tube as shown in image 8.
Image 8  Picture of cultivation in plastic tubes for 12 hrs and 16 hrs. Plasmid structure is pBAD-RBS-Ag43-dT-pSB1C3
Meanwhile, we tested the same observation using 300 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 ml LB liquid medium and cultivated at 34C (See protocol page for experimental procedure).
We found that optimum temperature required for efficient aggregation by “Aggregation Module” is 34~37C. We didn’t observe aggregation at 30C even after 24 hr-culture.  Reciprocal shaking of culture flask seemed to be better than rotation.
After culturing the aggregated E. coli, the clusters were harvested on nylon mesh by continuous strokes of injector (Fig. 9)(Image10).

We succeeded in filtering them by nylon mesh which has 250 um pore size then we have gained E. coli cake (Image11). And as our experimental fact, we filtered them by 200 um pore size mesh too. This result shows that we would be able to gain target product by this devise if we cultivated E. coli which has ability to produce target product.

Application scenarios
Using aptamers as recognition elements for our COMBs enables the COMBs to sense virtually all biomarkers for which aptamers have been generated. These targets include toxins, whole cells, viruses and proteins. To give an overview of the huge impact our membrane sensors might have on society, we sketch three scenarios where our COMBs may be applied. For these scenarios, we have reached out to many stakeholders to gain a clear image of what the problems are that society currently faces and how our membrane sensors can play a role in solving these problems.

Intestinal use
The bacteria which make up our life-sustaining microbiota in our guts secrete small molecules to convince the immune system not to attack them. This communication can be seen as one-way-traffic, but the possibility of making it bilateral is interesting, to say the least. See how our device can assist in enabling us to communicate with our gut bacteria.
Q Fever
From 2007-2009, the largest Q Fever outbreak ever recorded took place in The Netherlands. Over 4.000 people became infected with the Q Fever causing pathogen Coxiella Burnetii. Q Fever still remains very hard to diagnose, making prevention easier to accomplish than cure. See how our device can help in detecting Q Fever.
Countering pesticide overuse
Agricultural developments enabled civilization to expand to the industrial society we know today. These developments, however, have not always been harmless. The overuse of pesticides as a prevention to protect our crops is an example of a harmful practice. In an ideal world, pesticides would only be present"

About this Page
Competent programming skills are quickly becoming a necessity for working in biology. Because most of our team members had never had exposure to a programming environment, we decided to use the obstacles presented in our iGEM experiments as cause for learning the Perl programming language and produced some simple scripts that could do routine iGEM labors for us. Here are some examples:
Biobricking Primers
This script allows the user to input a DNA sequence and outputs the primers necessary for biobricking that sequence via PCR. The script calculates Tm but does not (yet) consider primer dimers.
Finally got the CGI working - click below or go here for the source code
Overlap Oligo Maker
Some very fast and efficient DNA assembly methods require parts to overlap on the ends of their sequences. This script will take two DNA sequences and output the oligos (and their Tms) one would need to PCR constructs with overlapping ends.
I'm a CGI machine! Here is the source code. or click below for an interactive version.
Manipulation of Protein Structures
In order to more fully understand certain parts of our system and to use the ridiculously amazing CAVE system at Cornell Med School, we decided to explore the 3D structures of the proteins involved in our system. Because the mechanism of Cre recombination is difficult to understand, we dove into the structures available on the Protein DataBase (PDB) and explored details of the mechanism. We were able to locate the active sites of the protein, isolate the catalytic residues, locate the vanadium cofactors and, in all, gain a better understanding of the protein's function. Check out some pictures below!

Hello everyone! I’m Yakun Tang and I’m a year 3 student in Biological Science department of XJTLU. This is the first time I participate in iGEM. So for me, this project is like a gate which leads to a magic biology world. During the participation of this project, I learn much more knowledge than that from books, and many skills such as literature reviewing skills and experimental skills are quickly improved. More importantly, I meet and know our teammates who are all very capable and full of enthusiasm and I learn a lot from them. My work in our iGEM team is dealing with finanicial affairs as well as conducting some experiments. Both of these two need patience and carefulness, but as a smart girl^0^, I will try my best!

Hello, everyone! I’m Harrison Shen studying in XJTLU, majored in biological sciences, for 4 years and there is one year left for my graduation. How time flies! It is a great pleasure to work as a team during our project. Considered taking the advantage of my computer skills, I am responsible for team poster, brief video production and wiki page beautification. The iGEM is a worldwide competition and joining this not only broadens my horizons and improves my knowledge but also meets new friends and strengthens our friendship. Engaging in synthetic biology, all we need is to come up with more imaginative ideas to create human-friendly designs for our lives. Just do it! I believe future world will be dominated by biotechnology.

In order to address these individuals, we also included some of the more technically interesting elements. The feedback and positive response was very heartwarming and helped remind us that synthetic biology has something of interest for all.

Activity 3: Game for Grades 3-6 Schoolchildren
People: The final component of our educational suite was to address the youngest demographic that we thought would be able to enjoy the beauty of synthetic biology, namely elementary school students.
Design and Dialogue: We initially wanted to make several handouts for K-3 that would be very basic and explain core principles of biology; however, it became quickly apparent that a text-based solution would not be ideal for students at this age because they were not ready for that particular mode of learning. After talking to several school teachers, we realized that a strategy-based game be a better way to get students excited about science.
One of the key aspects, first introduced in life science classes for elementary school students. Is understanding basic cell anatomy as well as cellular organelles with their associated functions. Some curricula also include the basic equations of cellular respiration and photosynthesis.
Each player is given their own cytoplasm starting board to begin, making them the creator of their own cell. The game proceeds by collecting the fundamental macromolecules (nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates) that are used for organelle synthesis. The students learn about the importance of the central dogma, which emphasizes that DNA serves as the genetic code for protein. Students become aware of the functions of the following organelles: nucleus, ribosomes, mitochondria (generates energy that can be traded for carbohydrates or lipids, Golgi apparatus (assists with macromolecule transportation), smooth ER (lipid production), and vacuole (which serves as a macromolecule “bank”). Students learn about the role of ATP in such processes and the process of expending energy in organelle synthesis; they also learn about the role of lipids in the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane and its role in defending the cell from unknown substances. Event cards teach students how viruses, bacteria, or other pathogens impact the cell.

M, CheZ and T stand for the concentration of CheZ mRNA, the concentration of protein CheZ and the concentration of theophylline, respectively. The constants α, β, γ, ξ and δ are all positive, and respectively denote the CheZ-promoter transcription rate, the CheZ-mRNA translation rate and the mRNA, CheZ and theophylline degradation-plus-dilution-rates. ζ(Text) is the theophylline transport rate per unit CheZ concentration. It is a function of the number of theophylline receptors and the external theophylline concentration. The functions ϕ(T) and Θ(T) denote the theophylline-governed regulation at the transcription and translation levels respectively (Equation 2 below [2]). KΦ is the equilibrium constant at transcriptional level and KΘ is the equilibrium constant at translation level [2].
Varying the parameter ζ(Text) of the above model could help us understand how the number of receptors and external theophylline concentration affect the intracellular concentration of theothylline and hence the expression level of CheZ. The results are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 below. In addition, the response curve of CheZ against the theophylline concentration with different theophylline transport rate was illustrated in Figure 4.
Figure 2. Expression of CheZ vs. time.The expression of CheZ increases with an increasing transport rate. With a higher theophylline transport rate bacteria will produce more CheZ and therefore display a higher level of directed movement. (Modelling by Imperial College London iGEM team 2011).
Figure 3. Intracellular theophylline vs. time. The intracellular theophylline level increases with transport rate. This means that we can enhance CheZ expression by increasing the number of theophylline chemoreceptors. (Modelling by Imperial College London iGEM team 2011).
Figure 4. Response curve of CheZ vs. intracellular theophylline. The CheZ response curve shows that the transport rate can be used to tune the CheZ response, the threshold intracellular concentration of theophylline required to trigger CheZ response increases with transport rate.

Fudan,2017,Team:Fudan#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"23 (compared to cells without SynTFs) (Figure 5A) . We found that the RE repeats inserted after pSV40 3’ end can influence the basal expression of SynPros even without co-transfecting corresponding SynTFs. Above 7 SynTFs-SynPros we constructed and tested, 2 of them didn’t work. (1) It probably was due to the RE of SynPro(S)-42-10 couldn’t been recognized by SynZF-42-10 (Figure S2A,B,C) . Thus, the expression after co-transducing SynTF(S)-42-10 was higher than the solo-expression of some SynPros. (2) RE of SynPro(S)-54-8 might be antagonized by unknown proteins inside cells. Thus, the expression without or with SynTF were both low. We test our guess by co-transfecting different SynTFs with SynPro(S)42-10 and SynPro(S)-54-8 (Figure S2B) .
The zinc finger is a highly structured motif. In tandem with multiple zinc finger motif, the recognition precision can be enhanced as its extensive usage in genome editing(10). We applied this strategy to construct tunable SynTF-SynPro pairs. With more RE repeats, our SynTF has stronger inhibiting activity (Figure 5B) .
To construct Stripe, two pairs of SynTF-SynPro are needed. The interaction between the pairs is not allowed. We did orthogonality experiments to check that. We confirmed that all of the 5 pairs were truly orthogonal (Figure 5C) , as you could see the grids on the diagonal were always the darkest. Three DBDs that are commonly used in previous works performed well in our hands. However, the expression level of the RE loaded SynPros were relatively low compared to SynPro(S)-ZF serials. As the blue rectangle in the lower right corner of the orthogonality may show the SynPro(S)-ZF has high basic expression with unpaired SynTFs, but could be silenced to the similar fold of commonly used DBDs corresponding SynPros. The SynPro(S)-ZF was likely won’t be a target by other unpaired DBD, hence the purple appeared on the bottom rows.
In summary, we successfully constructed a SynTF-SynPro repertoire whose expression features could be finely tuned by either using different DBDs with REs or changing the number of RE repeats. Meanwhile, among all the orthogonal SynTF-SynPro pairs we constructed and test, our favorite ones were SynTF(S)-PIP-S"

SCU-WestChina,2017,Team:SCU-WestChina#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," dotted lines represent the enzymes which can accelerate the spontaneous                     reaction processes. Urate oxidase (uricase, EC 1.7.3.4) is an enzyme with copper bonds that catalyzes                     the oxidative opening of the purine ring of uric acid to form 5-hydroxyisourate. HIU hydrolase (3.5.2.17)                     catalyzes the second reaction of the pathway, hydrolyzing 5-hydroxyisourate (HIU), a product of uricase                     in the first step to form 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline (OHCU). OHCU is catalyzed by                     OHCU decarboxylase (4.1.1.97).
YgfU is a high-capacity transporter for uric acid in Escherichia coli, which is homologous to nucleobase transporters of                     the ubiquitous family NCS2. We plan to overexpress the protein to achieve greater efficiency of uric                     acid utilization.
We found detailed information about these metabolic enzymes and the transporter from the BRENDA database (Table 1)[1,2,3,4], and we                     plan to use the constitutive promoter family Anderson Promoter in iGEM database to express them. As for                     the non-regulated expression pathway, if we want to promote the speed of the reaction to the maximum,                     the relative expression quantity of the enzymes must be considered. The rate-limiting step determines                     the whole speed of the pathway. Based on that, the extra protein expression of other enzymes may cause                     systematic burden in our bacteria. To design a better pathway, we did the modeling of our urate metabolic                     pathway according to the known Km and Kcat parameters published before, so as to determine the proper                     promoters upstream of different genes in order to optimize the expression with lowest energy consumed.                     We got the best ratio of PucL and 4.1.1.97. However, the detailed parameters of PucM are still unknown                     because they are hard to measure according to previous studies. As a result, we decide to try different                     promoters on PucM to construct the optimum pathway. (For 3.5.2.17, we used the sequence from soybean                     at the first time because its kinetic parameters have been reported. But the protein can’t be expressed                     in our constitutive promoter gene expression structure.

Two PCR's were run, using the MelA-biobrick intermediate created last week (minus one PstI site) as the template:
Primer C and Primer F
Primer A and Primer B
These two will remove the second PstI site.
After running the gel, the correct products were excised and purified using the QuiGen gel purification kit. The  products were then used for a further PCR run (overnight) using primers A and F.
If the correct products were removed, then this final run should produce the MelA BioBrick.

Introduction
Dynamic instability of microtubule during its lifetime is very interesting and worth researching. When a cancer patient is cured by taxol treatment fortunately, it should be owed to taxol's interaction with microtubule in dynamic growth process. So it's significant to explore principles of this process. We established a series of math works to clarify mechanisms of microtubule dilution system. Then we got data from wet parts of our project. Our model predicts observed data and phenomenon. In conclusion, we have presented a model that utilizes basic kinetics and it has been proved by experimental observations. We can use it to predict results in other conditions for guidance.
What we have done to analyze the dynamic process can be divided into three steps.
Fig.1 Our process
First we proved that taxol has a significant influence on microtubule growth by using the data which are provided from wet parts. Then we presented two differential equations model. One is an original differential equation model that can predict taxol’s influence on amount of microtubule. The other is a partial differential equation model expounding analytic solution. Since it’s hard to understand if someone lacks of necessary math skills, we build a program in MATLAB@ to visualize the kinetics in microtubule disaggregation.
Modeling theory
Microtubule is made up of 13 protofilaments. Now there is a widely accepted feature about the microtubule that microtubule has highly complicated dynamic instability. Under vitro cultures conditions, on the one hand, subunits will polymerize automatically to form fine structure when subunits condition is above the critical concentration; on the other hand, the microtubule will depolymerize into subunits when subunits condition is under the critical concentration. Apart from that, the single microtubule will always in the stage of aggregation and disaggregation.
Tubulin is made up of two tubulin monomers which are nearly the same as each other. These two tubulin monomers are named α tubulin monomer and β tubulin monomer. Microtubule"

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food.

BIT,2014,Team:BIT-China#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"cers, how much each inducer you should add, and how long you should wait until you add next inducer. In a word, the complexity of these aspects will greatly increase the difficulty of unlocking it.
Q4: What’s the advantage of your method comparing with others?
A: Referring to the existing methods, whether to strengthen the regulation or to save the bacteria in safes, the bacteria are all protected from outside, which will waste lots of money and energy. And once the bacteria are lost, they can hardly be got back again, even though they are marked. But our method works inside of the bacteria that can prevent the multiplication of them when they are outside. As a result, the nature of the protection of bacteria can be changed from passiveness by people to activeness by the bacteria themselves, which can not only protect the bacteria effectively but save the unnecessary money in regulation.
Q5: As we all known, Different proteins are degraded in different lengths of time. How can you ensure the time between two added substance can open the gate but not lock it down? Just like, when we add 2, the protein 1 has already been degraded.
A:  We can add a tail which can control how long the protein can exist. By this way, we can ensure our project’s function.
Q6: Would the lock losing its function via the gene of the Min system mutated?
A: If the gene of the Min system mutate, other useful genes would change. So I think it makes no sense.
Q7: Did all of you participate in the experiment and master the experimental skills ?
A: Of course! We are a team with the strongest spirit of unity and cooperation. All of us work together to face any possible difficulties both in experiment and life. Thus everyone have a good command of our works.
Q8: The molecules like arac, IPTG and aTC would degrade, resulting in the disappearing of the inducible proteins. Consequently, the E. co lock may close again. How to deal with it?
A: We designed memorial circuits to express the needed inducible proteins continuously, avoiding the open lock turn to close again.
Q9: How we know the proper concentration of arac, IPTG ,aTC and AHL, and the corresponding cellular state?
A: We optimize the concentration repeatedly and use modeling to simulate the cellular state.
Q10: Do you have any problem in ligasing genes？What’s kind of means you apply to ligase genes?
We do have difficulties in assembling biobricks.We have tried many ways to solve this problem including 3A"
Harvard,2009,Team:Harvard#Daily_-_-_TEXT.html,"2003).  In firefly luciferase this sequence is at the extreme C terminus, residues 548-550 (Gould et al, 1989). Leskein found that removal of the peroxisomal targeting signal resulted in better cell growth, which implies that peroxisomal targeting causes problems with cell growth. Also, use of the modified luciferase allows adequate luciferin uptake at pH 5 as opposed to pH 3 (Leskein et al, 2003). In that paper they had the luciferase under the control of a copper-inducible promoter. Modified luciferase was found to have 2 orders higher expression levels than wild type luciferase. This modification eliminates the need for centrifugation and resuspension of cells. They simply removed the peroxisomal targeting codons.    Positive control.

Calculation and validation of CBD cipA-BMP2  expression
The mathematical model for the expression of CBD  cipA-BMP2 is:
Eq 7.
The stability of the system can be analyzed with the  Jacobian matrix associated to the system of differential equations:
JACOBIAN
Because the two igenvalues (λ1= -0.226 y λ2 = -0.05) are negative, the equilibrium point is a  stable node.
 
Time step selection and phase plane
A reasonable error less than 0.01 for both mRNA and  protein concentrations was obtained with a time step Dt=0.1/8. Therefore, this Dt was considered to evaluate a phase plane plot  which indicates the equilibrium points of the mathematical model. To determine  the maximum concentrations of CBD cipA-BMP2 mRNA and CBD cipA-BMP2 protein, a  saturating concentration of IPTG (IPTG=0.1 mM) was evaluated. This is a  monostable system where the equilibrium point at the steady state (Figure 2) is  2.21 nM and 172.69nM for CBD cipA-BMP2 mRNA and CBD cipA-BMP2 protein  respectively.

Our team contacted Dr. Guus Bakkeren, a research scientist from Agriculture and Agri-food Canada (AAFC), a department within the Government of Canada responsible for regulating agriculture production, for his advice. We wanted his guidance as he worked with Agrobacterium in his graduate studies, and his current specialization is in plant-microbe interactions. While supportive of our project, Dr. Bakkeren brought up concerns with the potential of “high transferability spreading” of aGROW. Specifically, his concerns were that Rhizobia, a beneficial nitrogen-fixing bacteria and a close relative of Agrobacterium, could obtain the plasmid through conjugation. Additionally, he brought up the issue of potential off-target effects with the CRISPR gene editing.

The TU-Munich iGEM team 2013
Figure 1: Group picture
This year's iGEM team is a quite interdisciplinary group consisting of students and advisors from the subjects Biochemistry, Molecular Biotechnology, Engineering and Mathematics. The team-forming was initiated by three students and two instructors who already participated in last year´s iGEM team and who were looking for enthusiastic fellow campaigners to participate in iGEM 2013. The result was a team, consisting of 10 students and 3 instructors, willing to participate in a great contribution to the competition. To bridge the gap between old and new team members, we visited several folk festivals (luckily we're quite blessed with them in the greater Munich area) and had dinners together. The result was a dynamic group with fruitful relationships between the group members. Thus we have a very enjoyable working atmosphere and hopefully an equally successful participation in the iGEM competition.
We are very lucky and deeply grateful having the chance to work in the laboratory of Prof. Dr. Arne Skerra, who holds the Chair of Biological Chemistry at the Technical University of Munich. The team had full access to all laboratory equipment that was needed to realize our PhyscoFilter project. Without the help and support of Prof. Dr. Arne Skerra and his Team the project in its present form would not have been possible.

We tested the biobricked plasmids using new sequencing primers and saw the correct prefix but no suffix. We ordered new primers to start swapping the entire reporter gene expression from the positive control to our light plasmids. Prepped the swapped pTet for sequencing.
Weeks Seventeen and Eighteen- September 29th- October 12th
Sept 29-Oct 5
Caroline is unable to continue the biobricking process. Constructs contained illegal restriction enzyme sites and thus will not be allowed to be sent in to the registry.
The team worked on the poster of our iGEM summer project for Washington University’s Undergraduate Research Symposium.
Ben started cloning for biobricking over again with a new protocol CPEC based on Andrew’s protocol. We did these in conjunction with modified versions of ligation and found the correct sequencing pcr bands with only the CPEC versions. Discarded the positive control biobricking. Sent in the hybrid and normal promoter for sequencing.
Oct 6-12
Poster for Undergraduate Research Symposium at Washington University is finished and printed on Oct 7th.
Ben sequence verified his biobrick products and shipped the product to iGEM registry on Oct 8th, 2014. It arrived at iGEM registry on the 9th.
Ben also ran two experiments: the first to test the newly cloned reporter protein mechanism, which worked finally, and the second to test the light induction. Currently analyzing the data to figure out how to best present the information.
Poster presentation for Undergraduate Research Symposium is on Oct 11th , 2014.

We performed a series of experiments to validate the expression of our constructs as well as the functionality of our system. The results are presented in the following sections.
Characterization of the natural LldR promoter
Overview
Figure 1. The mechanism of repression of the lldR-promoter by LldR is thought to rely on DNA looping, which prevents the RNA Polymerase from transcription. The repression is removed in the presence of lactate.
For the sensing of Lactate inside our system we have a constitutive expression of the L-lactate dehydrogenase regulator, LldR . LldR is a protein which binds to two operator sites , operator1 (O1) and operator2 (O2), that flank the natural LldR promoter. This interaction forms a DNA loop, which does not allow the polymerase to transcribe the respective gene. Once Lactate is added to this system, it sequesters LldR, which can then no longer repress the promoter. Thus the gene of interest can be expressed [Aguilera 2008] .
An improvement to our system, which was shown by the modeling to be important for enhanced sensitivity to low levels of lactate, is the addition of the L-lactate permease, LldP , a protein which is known to insert into the membrane and increase the import rate of lactate into the cell [ Aguilera et al, 2008 ].
We characterized the natural version of the lldR-promoter regarding its response to a large concentration range of L-lactate in a microtiter plate reader"

After that the reaction can proceed as shown above or  with the enzyme Polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase or PhaC the intermediate can be used to make  PHB.  Castor can be ligated together with either of the other two constructs to create a useful  pathway for one of our products.
Method
The amino acid sequences used for the enzymes were converted back into nucleotide  sequences and then optimized for use in plants, or more specifically Physcomitrella patens.  The  sequences were then optimized into ~500 base pair gBlocks final constructs were then built using Gibson Assembly or CBAR.  Then the constructs were  ligated into our vectors; which were Ti-plasmids.   TM which were synthesized.  The
The entire pathway was broken into two distinct pieces, each of which gives us  one of our two final desired products.  The first half of both constructs brings us to 3-(R)- hydroxybutyryl-CoA and is referred to as Castor.  This can then be converted into either butanol  or PHB depending on the following enzyme(s) in the pathway.  The first construct consists of the  preliminary pathway and an additional four enzymes in a construct referred to as Pollux which  converts 3-(R)-hydroxybutyryl-CoA into butanol.  The other is a single enzyme after the first  half that gives us PHB.  The construct containing the single enzyme is named after the enzyme:  PhaC.
Results
Pending...
After transfection with Agrobacterium of the Castor and PhaC constructs into Nicotiana, the  transiently transformed leaf segments were excised and stained. The leaf segments and control leaf  cuttings were examined with spinning disk confocal microscopy for the presence of Polyhydroxybutyrate  (PHB) granules. The preliminary staining results were inconclusive.
Expected Results:
Given ideal staining and PHB production in the cell cytoplasm, we expect to see granules of PHB  within the cells. These are expected to be well deﬁned against the background ﬂuorescence of the  stomata, tricomes, and cell walls. It is also expected that GC-MS should be able to detect the PHB from  the leaf cuttings.

Considerations for future experiments: Alternative methods of lysis could be used, such as sonication.  However we do not have access to the necessary facilities for sonication, but in the future we would seek to partner with a university in the area that does.  A second alternative and more feasible alternative is more repeated freeze-thaw steps.
Skim Milk Plates: The protocol can be found on our ‘Experiments’ page.
Non-Biobrick: The plates containing the supernatant of the lysis showed some zones of clearing. However this appeared to be due to colonies that grew on the plates as the lysis was not wholly successful. The plates with the plated cell culture showed zones of clearing around colonies with the KerUS plasmid.  No zones of clearing were seen around colonies of DH5α without the keratinase-producing plasmids.  However, for the non-lysed cells, the plates were kept on a slightly uneven angle so some spreading of the cultures can be seen. This seems to imply the production and secretion of keratinaseUS.
Old Biobrick (before synthesis realization): No zones of clearing were seen around any of the supernatants or any of the cultures.  This could be due to the fact that the earlier non-biobrick cell lysis was conducted in a different lab with using liquid nitrogen, but in our school lab we could only use a longer incubation on ice.  Or because the restriction digest and ligation of the part into psb1C3 was unsuccessful.
Considerations for future experiments: We were only able to conduct a limited amount of replicates and in the future would certainly like to repeat this assay to obtain more conclusive results.
Semi-quantitative Hair Degradation Assay:
The protocol can be found on our ‘Experiments’ page.
Non-Biobrick: No significant change in the mass of the hair was observed.  However some discoloration of the falcon tubes used can be seen.  The discoloration appears to be leaching of the dye in the cap.  We have not been able to find more information of the dye used in the plastic cap but if any of the materials are protein based it could be a result of enzyme activity.  It is important to note that the discoloration is only observed in tubes with KerUS cultures, and not in the control DH5α cultures.
The lack of visible hair degradation could be due to"

Ensuring Safety
Safety was a significant concern in the design of our project. We wanted to make sure not only that we were safe when working on our project, but that the final system that we designed would be safe to use in the field. We worked to ensure this in a number of ways, which can be outlined below:
Laboratory Personal Safety
Figure 1. Showing off our PPE
All of the students working on the Calgary 2013 team received all of the necessary training as outlined in the University of Calgary’s safety policy. In brief, this included a Biosafety course as well as Workplace Hazardous Materials Information Systems (WHMIS) training. In addition, students took a course introducing them to the necessary laboratory skills where they learned how to perform required techniques both safely and efficiently.
The project that we undertook posed little risk to the students, the only organism used in our project was a commonly used lab-strain of Escherichia coli, which is designated as a biosafety level 1 organism. All necessary chemicals and reagents were handled with care and Material Safety Data Sheets were consulted when dealing with new compounds. Finally, students working in the lab were also supervised at all times by senior lab members, advisors or our lab manager.
Safety in the Design
In addition to the safety of ourselves, the safe design of our system was also a major concern. As our final system will be implemented directly in a feedlot setting, it is very important that we design it not only to be extremely easy and quick to use, but also so that it will be completely safe for the person using it as well as the environment it will be used in"

Entrepreneurship consulting for iGEM projects is highly significant (p = 0.0) with a positive correlation of .644, all other variables held constant. This suggests the iGEM teams that built startups were either highly influenced or attained success partially because of consulting with business/entrepreneurship advisors. Furthermore, it is apparent that founding teams in the interviews had entrepreneurship consulting, either from their mentors or from accelerators and incubators. Therefore, it can be concluded that having an entrepreneurship mentor can highly influence its founding.
4. Access to Resources and Product Development
Regressing the variables concerning enough resources, enough time and enough advising provided no significant results at the 10% level (p ≤ .10). Although potentially significant, the survey data did not provide a reliable relationship between founding business and these variables. However, taking data from the qualitative interviews, the founding teams in general did not have enough funding/resources for startup creation during iGEM and therefore either 1) received money and resources from accelerators/incubators or 2) took out bank loans 3) gained sponsorship from other companies and universities. Furthermore, some non-founding teams did have decent funding but did not use it for business founding. So while funding, time and resources do not show a reliable relationship from the quantitative data, the qualitative data shows ambitious teams sought out and secured the resources they needed, enabling them to found a business.

This is my second year involved with iGEM. I expect this year to be as enjoyable as the last and even more successful. My participation in iGEM has exposed me to concepts and experiences that I could not have received elsewhere in my undergrad experience. My interests include brain machine interfacing, computational intelligence, haptic teleoperation, and of course, synthetic biology. I am now pursuing my Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Florida. iGEM has proven to be a fascinating and rewarding experience and I am looking forward to the competition.

Modelling
We have produced this informative model influenced by experimental data that provides knowledge into the scalability of our filtration system and incorporates it within a user-friendly interface on our wiki to inform the future implementation of our research. The model can guide future-users on the most efficient flowrate and volume of metal binding reactor (MBR) to use for their purpose.
This model can be used to resolve the issue of knowing when the metal binding reactor needs to be changed as it informs when the pili on the E. coli in the metal binding reactor are too saturated to still be efficient. This can be used in conjunction with the 'backwash' method suggested by representatives at South West Water. For the 'backwash' method we would require two or more filters in series such that one can be taken offline without leading to a complete shutdown. Then we would pass water through the offline filter to be tested. The model can then help inform how often the water should be tested and can be rescaled for more accuracy based on these results.
User Interface
We have designed and developed a user interface for the model to make it easily accessible to future users. Once the users values are inputted and the ""run model"" button is clicked, the outputs for their specific inputs will be produced along with a graph of output concentration against time to provide a visual representation.
This model outputs a graph of the concentration of ions which make it through the filter over time. The red line is the concentration of ions which the user will allow to pass through the filter. The point where the plot crosses the red line is the point at which the filter needs to be changed because it can no longer sufficiently reduce the concentration of ions in the water.

Aim of the synthetic biology
It convinces first to interest in finality of this science. What are we trying to do? Are we looking to reach a perfection state? When we are working for the improvement of a living organism, in addition to technical difficulties, we have to ask if what are we doing is desirable. Without the egocentric drifts we can easily imagine, we could try to correct our weaknesses, handicap, diseases. Dorothée Benoit Browaeys put in advance that the context can change a « tare » in asset: « there are diseases which give you certain advantages. So to take up the titer of Alain Gras’ book on the fragility of the power, we could speak of the power of fragility ».
However, potentials advantages seem sometimes negligible compared to the handicap: it is for example the case when we are affected by the HIV. And the engendered disease will not be controled, in Willy Rozenbaum opinion, « if we are not using synthetic biology ». More generally, this last one does not imagine « how we could do without it if we want to go towards an improvement of the human condition». The perfection myth seems not to worry him, because he affirms that we are still very vulnerable and far to be perfect.

Modification of the living representation
Searching to synthesize and modify fundamentally organisms push to wonder about the definition itself of the living. Craig Venter affirms that « we pass from the capacity to read our genetic code to the capacity to write it». But understanding and generating life mechanism can demistify it; and the fact to create living machines, in a precise goal, risk to give us a determinist vision of the living. Thierry Magnin wonders « in a context where life is assemble with bricks, what is doing the real difference between vegetal machinery, animal machinery and human machinery? ». After all, we can consider the difference between the three does not come from interactions between « bricks » which compose them.  « How can I recognize a certain dignity of Living if all is built by blocs » ?
Synthetic biology can reveal a game aspect, which can alter the respect that we carry to living organism : to quote one more time Thierry Magnin, « The things with I am used to play, I often have difficulties to respect it». We can create « pieces » of living organisms without of their context, stock, reproduce, transmit and"

Harvard_BioDesign,2015,Team:Harvard BioDesign#Platform_-_-_TEXT.html,"-250 Coomassie protocol  and compared at the molecular weight of Type 1 Pili’s structural subunit protein, fimA, which is most abundant. We hypothesized that the pili overproducing fimE would show a strong band at this weight compared to the null fimB strain. The resulting gel is below:
A band is present at the expected weight in the purified pili of the fimE overproducer. We tried testing the purification with and without formic acid acid denaturation. The fimA band is stronger in the formic acid treated sample which indicates that the pili are insoluble and need to be broken up for detection
Indeed, we see a dark band at 16.5 kD, the molecular weight of fimA, but only for the fimE overproducing strain, not for our negative control. This shows our pili purification method gives a clear signal to detect pili production, and can be used to characterize our modified Type 1 Pili and by future teams using our system. With functional assays and positive and negative controls, we felt confident that we had the tools necessary to begin engineering control over pili expression.
Construct Design
Our type I pili-expression system is distributed across two plasmids                 wherein the pili genes on each are expressed under different, inducible promoters.                 The fimH gene was amplified from the E. coli K12 genome and placed under the control                  of a rhamnose-inducible ( Bba_K902065 ) promoter with a strong ribosome binding site ( B0034 ).                  The remaining  type I pili structural and transport genes from the fim operon were amplified from                  E. coli K12 and placed under an arabinose inducible ( BBa_I13453 ) promoter with the native ribosomal                  binding sites. Gibson assembly was used to place the parts into pSB1C3, illegal cut sites were                  eliminated to make the parts RFC10 compatible, and each circuit was transferred into low copy number                  expression plasmid ( fim operon expression backbone, BBa_J61002 fimH expression backbone, ).
The system was arranged on two plasmids so that we could modulate the amount of adhesive fimH component with respect to the other pili structural genes. Additionally, we found that it was easier to customize fimH on a smaller plasmid backbone since it eliminated cloning issues encountered when the entire fim operon was located on a single plasmid. Finally, we selected pAra ( BBa_I13453 ) because it is a titr"

Penn,2012,Team:Penn State#Projects_-_-_TEXT.html," the binding between Amino Acids. However, they cannot read the codon code themselves, and require the help of tRNA (transfer RNA). Each tRNA codes for a single codon, or a set of similar codons. Each type of tRNA can only carry a single amino acid at a time, and can only ever carry that given Amino Acid. Each tRNA has bases that are a complement to the codon that they code for. The tRNA molecules carry Amino Acids to the ribosome where the Amino Acids are bound together to form a protein.
We have mentioned how there can be a number of codons that can code for the same Amino Acid, and subsequently, a number of tRNA molecules that can carry a given Amino Acid. In nature, and in many organism, only a select few of these tRNA and codon combinations are used instead of all possibilities for the same amino acid. This is called codon bias.
Our goal for this project is to see which codons are preferred, or biased. We also want to investigate if this bias can change over time or in different circumstances or stresses. For this we will be using the standard lab stain of E. coli, DH10B.

Project 2: Multidirectional Promoters
Project Overview
Before we can make a protein, we need an mRNA to carry the information about the order of the amino acids. But before we can make mRNA we need to know where the genes are in the DNA of a cell. Before RNA polymerase can make a copy it needs to bind to the DNA. This is assisted by a variety of factors, other proteins, that look for a specific sequence in the DNA. This sequence is called a promoter because it promotes the transcription of the DNA into RNA by the RNA polymerase. These sequences are generally upstream, or ahead, of a gene's coding sequence.
However, not all promoters cause RNA polymerase to transcribe downstream in the expected ""forward direction"". Some promoters can cause RNA polymerase to go in the opposite direction from what is expected, or go in both directions. This is what we are trying to find out; do different promoters go in different directions, and what is the directional preference of different promoters.

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," water bath sonicator, trying a four-step process and trying different sonication energies; the four involved removing the top phase of a previously sonicated sample after letting it settle for 48 hours and then sonicating that top phase before centrifuging it. We measured the particle size in the sample after each sonication experiment and found that the four-step process yielded the smallest particle sizes ranging from 70 nm to 400 nm. However, PHB concentration in the sample became minute at this point and therefore the relative success of different extraction methods would be difficult to determine at such small concentrations of PHB. Furthermore, we also had to mimic the concentration of PHB we would expect from the secretion system.
Therefore we decided to conduct our electrocoagulation experiments with both the sample containing microscale PHB, which would be representative of the concentrations we expected from the secretion system and the nanoscale PHB which we obtained from the four-step sonication process.
We used an electrocoagulation setup similar to the one used in (""Make Water - Collaborative Water Purification"", 2017) using iron and steel electrodes. We first tested whether electrocoagulation worked with PHB in a suspension of water. Therefore, we set up the separate electric cells with microscale PHB in suspension in water and nanoscale PHB in suspension in water. In both cases we found significant amounts of PHB settling within 3 hours of running the cell. We also noticed that once we stopping passing electricity through the cell, a layer of brown powder was deposited over the layer of PHB. We hypothesized this was probably iron(III) hydroxide
Next, we went on to test a 1:1 mixture of microscale PHB suspension and synthetic feces supernatant. However, this time we found that the settlement was a brown sludge with no discernable layer of PHB. This is was probably due to the high amounts of salts present in the supernatant; the iron ions released by the anode were most likely binding to other anions present within the sample as opposed to the PHB granules. We went on to wash the sludge with dilute sulphuric acid with the hopes of dissolving out the metal salts, but this was also unsuccessful in separating PHB from the sludge. Since electrocoagulation did not seem selective for PHB within our supernatant, we began searching for other methods to separate PHB.

Once these sequences have been confirmed to be in the entry vector, a larger scale Golden Gate reaction will take place where the entry vectors will be ligated with a reporter and other parts necessary for a successful Golden Gate plasmid. This plasmid will then be tested in E. coli while the confirmation of G. oxydans modification is doable.

(Link) The regulations of GMOs in Africa are based on the consumer's perceptions, rather than on health and food safety.

Manipulation of living organisms raises questions in the public. One of the central questions which has led to public debate is whether scientists pretend to be God by constructing GMOs.
The agricultural industry has benefited from selective breeding throught centuries, and although this has led to discussions as well, it is a standard procedure which is well-known in the society.
Whether selective breeding to some extent is equal to the manipulation of living organisms is difficult to determine. One might claim that both methods entails modification of genetic material. However, there is no doubt that genetically engineering is a complex field, which includes careful considerations concerning safety and regulations among others.

BASIC PARTS
BASIC PARTS USED
The basic parts were created on the iGEM standard registry for biological parts, and were designed from the coding sequences of six genes used for copper binding and precipitation."
Fudan,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," lab coats, gloves whenever in the lab. There’re also two kinds of gloves in the contaminated and uncontaminated areas which could not be mixed. Short pants and open-toe shoes are banned.
Safety labs
We had the key to the laboratory kept strictly. Any duplication without permission is prohibited. The last person who left the lab should make sure that electricity, air conditioners, water have been turned off.
Equipment
We have well-designed fume hood, explosion-proof equipment and eyewashers to deal with different unexpected situation. We also had a cabinet for Hazardous reagents whose key is kept only by our PI.
Procotols
We have protocols for every experiment which mainly followed by biochemical company or adopted by many researchers.
Disposal
There are different bins for chemical pollutant and normal waste separately. Furthermore, our school carried out a regulation which is having specialists to treat the waste uniformly.
Biological hazard
All reagents and cultures are kept in a sealed containers. Plates containing E.coli are sealed with parafilm before storage at 4℃. Once plates and wells are not required, we destroyed them by autoclaving.
HP SAFETY
We Fudan-CHINA also care much about safety during human practice.
In our public engagement, we did several interesting experiments with kindergarten kids. ( See More ) To avoid cultured bacteria from the environment making threats to those children’s health, we seal the plates with parafilm and sterilize with ethyl alcohol before handing out. We also urge them to wash hands after class.
We helped a high school build a team to attend next year’s IGEM. ( See More ) We spent several days teaching them lab safety and how to deal with unexpected situation.
To get a further understanding and discussion about safety, we also made a phone interview with Health planning Commission about laws and regulations related to safety. ( See More )
Shipment safety
Our DNA parts are absolutely safe because they contain safe expression control units and express harmless protein like GFP. All of our parts are safely kept in PCR tubes as Parts registry requires.

WLC-Milwaukee,2017,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," is a source of bacteria which can cause serious diseases.
Water can be contaminated with untreated waste in a variety of ways. Storms can cause sewers to overflow, allowing untreated matter to run off into rivers. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that last year, “109.4 million gallons of untreated wastewater spilled into local waterways and Lake Michigan in overflows of combined sanitary and storm sewers during two heavy rain storms,” [4]. Heavy rainfall can also cause runoff in fields fertilized with manure. Pollution can also come from wild animals [2]. Because flooding and the instincts of wild animals cannot be controlled, this makes water contamination an especially important issue.
Water contaminated with fecal matter contains a high level of bacteria. Since not every single type of bacteria can be monitored effectively, it is helpful to use an indicator. In the United States, water tests must be verified. This confirms drinking water is safe from a microbiological standpoint, ensuring that the water was treated correctly, that the water maintains its status of treatment as it is distributed, and that recreational water is safe [6]. The presence of E. coli is usually indicative of the presence of other pathogenic bacteria that are found in fecal matter [2].
Pathogenic bacteria can cause a number of diseases, some of which result in death. One common side effect of polluted water is diarrhea. According to the head of the World Health Organization’s health department, 500,000 deaths are caused by diarrhea from contaminated water every year [3]. More serious diseases include Cholera, Dysentery, Typhoid, Hepatitis A, Bacterial Gastroenteritis, and Polio [2, 3]. Some different diseases can be caused by contaminated water in tropical areas, such as Intestinal Worms, Schistosomiasis, and Trachoma [3]. There are vaccines available for some of these diseases, but being aware of the cleanliness of the water people are drinking is a better prevention measure.

Integrated Human Practices
Despite the unequivocal evidence for climate change, a recent poll commissioned by the Ontario Science Center (Canada, 2017) found that 47% of the public (up from 40% last year) agreed that “the science behind global warming is still unclear.” A quote by the chief executive officer of the Ontario Science Center summarizes the problem that arises from this statistic: ""If you think that climate change is one of the main issues that we face as a society, and almost half of us think that the science is still unclear when there's a pretty broad scientific consensus about it, this affects the chances that we have to act in a unified way about it."" While our team was taken aback by the statistic, we were not entirely surprised considering there are many prominent public figures such as politicians and celebrities who deny climate changing is occurring. How, as a society, we move forward to address complex scientific issues is going to become increasingly more important in the future. On a more positive note, despite 31% of respondents agreeing that “because scientific ideas are fluid and subject to change they can’t be trusted,” 79% agreed that they are comfortable “knowing that scientific answers may not be definitive”, and 82% said they “would like to know more about science and how it affects our world”. Our project by no means is the only answer to stopping or slowing climate change, but it will help reduce the environmental impact and waste of the paper and pulp industries, once we engineer E. coli to degrade cellulose into glucose. With the knowledge that the public wants to learn about science and with the understanding that in order to address climate change everyone needs to be on board, we developed our integrated human practices strategy. There are four ways in which we integrated human practices into our experimental design: talking with experts, discussing safety, researching other Canadian biofuel companies, and presenting our project to various audiences. In addition, we developed an extensive outreach program to establish an open communication platform between the public and scientists (click here to view our engagement activities) We hope to foster curiosity, answer questions and concerns, and get more people talking about science!

At this point, the anti-repressor is expressed and binds to the repressor preventing its activity. This leads to an increase in the expression of GFP as illustrated by the red curve.
Figure 7: The graphs illustrated are a simulation of the expected results from Construct 2 and Construct 3. The expected results from Construct 2 would be a baseline expression of GFP, as the promoter would continually be repressed. With Construct 3, there would be a baseline expression of GFP until the pBAD is induced. At this point, the anti-repressor is expressed and binds to the repressor preventing its activity. This leads to an increase in the expression of GFP as illustrated by the red curve.

BostonU_HW,2017,Team:BostonU HW#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," evaluated to withstand an internal pressure of up to 5 PSI[1].  To calculate the pressure in a given primitive the following three equations need to be used.
\[10h < w \Rightarrow R_{fluid} \approx 12\mu L/wh^{3}\]
\[2h > w \Rightarrow R_{fluid} \approx 32\mu L/wh^{3}\]
\[\Delta P=R_{fluid}Q\]
Equations a-c are used to describe the relationship of pressure within a channel of a given length (L), width (w), and height (h).  Equations a and b are utilized to determine which formula would provide a better approximation for fluid resistance based on the height and width of the channel. After determining an approximate value of fluid resistance, PSI can be calculated using equation c. Equation c is analogous to Ohm’s law but is used for fluid dynamics. The PSI value is directly proportional to both the fluid resistance and the flow rate (Q). These calculations were written as a C++ file which can be compiled and executed.

Mixing Efficiency
The mixing of two fluids is something that can often be qualitatively observed, however in order to properly perform an experiment certain amounts of mixing must be achieved. In order to evaluate the degree of which fluids are being mixed in a mixer primitive a mixer efficiency test is needed to be performed.  This quantitative test is broken down into a two-part process:
Image Processing
After running fluid through your mixer, pictures need to be taken at the regions prior to entering the primitive and after it exits the primitive. In order to obtain RGB data from these images, image processing software such as ImageJ need to be implemented. Using ImageJ a 1-pixel wide box is created that spans the length of the channel.  The two important pieces of data that need to be obtained using this box are the average RGB value over that area, and all RGB values over the length of the 1-pixel wide box. After collecting this data, you can move on to calculate the mixing efficiency.
Using the RGB Profile Plot plugin on ImageJ we can acquire the RGB values for each pixel in our box. In a well-mixed output the plot will reflect similar RGB values and the opposing ends of the output channel.
Using the RGB Measure plugin on ImageJ we can acquire the average RGB values over the total area of the box.
Efficiency Calculation
The efficiency of the mixing itself can be measured using the following equation[2]:
\[\gamma = 1-2\left [ \frac{\"
Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," they have on the import. Therefore, we are using the superfolded-GFP protein, another fluorescent marker, which is in our case fused to the peroxisomal import sequence PT1, and a version of Pex11 that is fused to the fluorescent marker Venus. Both markers emit light in the green light spectrum, were as mRuby2 emits light in the red part of the spectrum, giving us a strong contrast and an easy way of differentiating between the two under the fluorescent microscope.
To physically create our constructs, we researched the DNA sequences of bacteriorhodopsin , Pex3 and PEX26 via UniProt and pre-designed our fusion constructs with the software tool „Geneious“. We ordered the synthesis of three separate parts ( Pex3 , PEX26 and Pex3 -BacR) from IDT. To ease out the process of assembling our plasmids, we used the „ Dueber Toolbox "", containing various parts such as promoters and terminators, to tailor the plasmids specific to your needs. Finally, to combine all the selected parts, we used the „Golden Gate” assembly method.
Secretion
For the peroxisome secretion in S. cerevisiae we designed fusion proteins of the v-SNARE Snc1 with different peroxisomal membrane anchors. We tested the constructs using a GUS Assay. The assays were performed using transformants of the strain BY4742.
Experimental Design
We will adapt the system of  Sagt and colleagues  to secrete the content of our modified compartments (Sagt et al, 2009) .
For the application of this system in S. cerevisiae we use a truncated version of the v-SNARE Snc1 to decorate our compartments (Figure 3.1) (Gerst et al, 1997) .
Figure 3.1 A diagram of the general domain structure of Snc1. V is a variable domain which is not important for the binding to the t-SNARE. TM is the transmembrane domain. H1 and H2 are the a-helical segments, forming the SNAREpin with the t-SNARE (Gerst et al, 1997)
To decorate the compartments with the SNARE we use a peroxisomal transmembrane protein . In our case we use the proteins Pex15 or PEX26, which were further investigated in another sub project, and fuse Snc1 to the N-terminus. We expressed these constructs of membrane anchor and Snc1 constitutively under control of"
