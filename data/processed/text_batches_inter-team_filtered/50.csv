Professor Li is an excellent scientist, and we would like to follow his path and make our contribution to the scientific research.
2.Law & Regulation
Law & Regulation about gene science and technology
For this project, we modified some genes using techniques of synthetic biology and constructed a recombinant plasmid. The Bifidobacterium transformed with this plasmid can settle in the tumor regions, and secret the apoptin protein, and kill tumor cells. This could potentially be developed into a novel therapy method for the treatment of tumors. To a certain extent, gene modification is gene therapy, and our project is about gene therapy to tumor cells, imperceptibly we may put ourselves in the center storm of ethical and juristical issues. Therefore, to have a deeper perspective about the ethical and juristical issues in China, as well as to better understand the potential biosafety issues of our project, we discussed some questions with two experts in law, Ms. Fang Ruan, a judge from the People's Court of Jinjiang, China, and Professor Zhipeng He, Jilin University School of Law. They shared with us their insights and a great critical thinking of moral and ethical issues. Thanks for their generous help and assistance; we get a complete result in the Human Practice.

Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," concentrations of phage to specific wells, and using a plate reader we measured the absorbance during 23 hours.
Figure 6 - Table showing the number of bacteria cells in each well. Each well had a certain number of phage added so that the concentration of phage was 2.5x10^-9 PFU. The wells labeled LB are the blanks for background, and the wells labelled T4 are only T4 phage and contain no bacteria in order to observe the absorbance of only the phage over time.
Figure 7 - Graph demonstrating the bacterial growth over time when the same number of phage was introduced to varying concentrations of bacteria. In the graph we can see that the highest concentration of bacteria grew relatively slowly in comparison to the other concentrations, and this is likely because the phage had an abundance of bacteria to infect and more bacteria were dying.
Figure 8 - Graph showing the bacterial growth curve when varying concentrations of phage were introduced. The bacteria concentrations that were introduced to the most phage grew slightly slower than the other samples. This shows that the phage may be successfully infecting the bacteria.
The results demonstrate the growth curve of the bacteria, and while the bacteria are still growing, they grow at a slower rate than they would be without the phage present. In addition, the maximum amount of bacteria decreases when phage are present. The starting OD is higher in the graph than in the legend, and this is due to the bacteria reproducing during the time period between when the original dilutions were measured and when the sample was measured after the phage were added. Our phage assay demonstrates that it is likely the phage are infecting the bacteria, as a higher concentration of phage resulted in decreased bacterial growth. Furthermore, increased numbers in bacteria result in decreased growth, and it can be interpreted that this is as a result of the phage having an abundance of bacteria to infect. This increases the rate at which the bacteria are infected and results in a less extreme growth curve.
ELASTIN-LIKE POLYMER SYNTHESIS
Our team completed elastin-like polymer (ELP) synthesis because the repeating amino acid sequence is very long and difficult to order in one large sequence. Therefore we ordered the sequence in smaller pieces and completed extension PCR to overlap and add on another piece of the ELP. In the future, we hope to experiment and test the properties of the ELP. We successfully extended the ELP by connecting the first, second and third parts. The procedure of this experiment will be elaborated on in the design page.

A second simulation ran one version of the model to a ratio of 2:1 (figure 11), which can again be compared to the previously mentioned control (figure 10). The starting ratio was 1.5 and the code can be found on our Github. Within this model, the circuit was altered at the translation step of GP0.4, which is one potential module of the circuit which we have hypothesised can be altered in order to change the ratio of our system in the lab. Indeed the model shows that the system does converge to the desired ratio at a time period of around 180 minutes. Although this is slower than previous examples, we believe this is because the starting ratio is further from the final expected ratio and hence the system takes longer to reach its final value.
Figure 12: Plot of the population ratio over time for a stochastic simulation of predefined ratio 5:3 with a natural ratio of 2:1.
Next we ran a model wherein the growth rate of population B was twice that of population A to investigate whether our circuit could “hold up” in such conditions (figure 12). The artificial ratio of the populations implemented by our circuit was set at 3:5 and the natural growth of the populations was set so that one was double the other to give a ratio of 2:1. In this way we set the system so that the desired ratio was set to reverse the natural balance of the system. From the results it can be seen that the ratio begins to converge to the desired steady-state ratio in an underdamped manner. We theorised that if the simulation was run again for longer the ratio would eventually stabilise at the set 3:5 ratio.

Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"RNA to dCas9 binding, we used two different dCas9 proteins derived from streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus aureus bacteria. The pyogenes dCas9 was fused via a tri-alanine linker to a lambda repressor that binds the pOL-62 promoter region 35 base pairs upstream of the RFP initiation site. The aureus dCas9 was fused via a tri-alanine linker to the alpha-subunit of RNA polymerase, which in turn recruits polymerase for transcription. The two sgRNA sequences are produced separately and bind selectively to the dCas9 molecules and target DNA, thus bringing together the entire complex and activating RFP.
Fig. 2 - Molecular model of Cerberus Detection for DNA.
We are not pulling the idea directly from a single paper, but instead combining literature about the function of dCas9s, the prokaryotic two-hybrid system developed by Dr. Ann Hochschild at Harvard, and the previous successful research executed by Peking iGEM 2015 using a similar two hybrid dCas9 system to join a split luciferase. Additionally, after finalizing the concept we sat down with Dr. Stanley Qi, a CRISPR scientist at Stanford, to confirm idea feasibility and get guidance on how to best execute the sgRNA design.
Although in our original design both fusion proteins utilized pyogenes dCas9s, Dr. Qi recommended switching one of them out for aureus dCas9. Without this change, even though we would produce two different sgRNA strands that had distinct 20 bp variable regions (highlighted in orange and red) to bind the target DNA, due to random chance 50% of the time both pyogenes would be bound to the same type of sgRNA and therefore not be able to simultaneously bind the target DNA (Figure 3).
Fig. 3 -If streptococcus pyogenes dCas9 were used for both fusion proteins, system efficiency would be decreased due to non-specific sgRNA-dCas9 binding. Replacing one fusion protein with a pyogenes derived dCas9 it solves this problem.
Using scientific research, iterative design, and expert consultation, we arrived at the Cerberus Detection for DNA system via the biodesign process (see Human Practices for more info).

The DNA detection system requires two fusion proteins, sgRNA, a modified RFP reporter, and target DNA. Due to the origin of replication limits described in the SynORI 2017 iGEM project last year, it is necessary to"

Safety Q&A | Human Practice
Background
The ideas of electronic circuit based design have long been a part of the fundamental research since the very beginning of synthetic biology. However, as the scale of designs becomes larger and larger, researchers start to find it difficult to adapt those ideas of circuits to the biological system, in which two main properties bottleneck the realization of these ideas.
First, biological reactions are considerably much slower, when compared with circuits, thus less possible to analogize the electronic components.
Second, synthetic biology fails to get the concept ‘wire’ introduced, due to the liquid environment of biological reaction, which decrease both the quality and the quantity of signals.
In this passage, we, with the consideration of the basic analysis method in information science, try to propose some new perspectives on the combination of synthetic biology and electronics.
Bottom-up Method
In modern electronics, people rarely focus on the detail of a particular component when designing systems, for these single components have already been well-characterized and standardized. All that requires is innovating rather than just repeating. When it comes to biology, we are surprised to find that some basic parts, such as AND gate, register and toggle switch, have been applied to genetic machines. While, there is still a far way to go.
Reaction  rate
Usually, the reactions of protein expressing cost a period on the scale of hours, which is disappointing when thinking in an electronic way. Fortunately, the rate of protein-protein interaction (PPI) is relatively fast, which makes us feel optimistic. The potential of these ‘high-speed’ reactions is to be explored.
On the other side, a low rate does make a difference in some aspects, especially in those need delay. Capacitors is widely used in sequential circuits like oscillator and trigger in order to realize delay, correspondingly, the low rate in biological reaction shows its preeminence in forming delay, thus easy to establish a inertia system.
Independent  signals
To overcome the interference of signals in liquid and simulate the function of wires in circuits, we put forward some solutions. Different populations of bacteria communicate under a variety of signal molecules, each independent with others. Whereas, it’s not as easy when the amount of signals increases, for that molecules should maintain orthogonality.
In our further research, we try to"

This communication inspired us to do more research on probiotics. For example, consider the possibility of creating the probiotics in some other form, such as yoghurt or cheese, than a pharmaceutical product.
We took one step further and met PKU patients ourselves. Some of our team members participated in an annual summer camp for PKU patients, which is organised by ’Dalia’ association. There we had a chance to meet affected people of different age and discuss the difficulties they are facing. Also, we had an opportunity to introduce our ideas to the potential users.
Our project was taken very seriously and enthusiastically by the patients, which provided us with determination to continue our work. Moreover, discussion with people made it clear to us that they prefer taking pills as probiotics to food products containing it. A survey, which was carried out as a part of a collaboration with Oxford iGEM team, also showed that a vast majority of people would rather take probiotics as a pill rather than in the form of a food product. Taking these results into account, we rejected the idea of creating food products and decided to focus on a pill.
Our team stayed in touch with association ‘Dalia’ through all the project and beyond.
Organisation of Synthetic Biology
In order to establish a strong tradition of Lithuania iGEM team and to spread the knowledge about perspectives of synthetic biology we set up an association ‘Organisation of Synthetic Biology’ (‘Sintetinės Biologijos Organizacija’) – ‘SinBiO’. ’SinBiO’ is a nonprofit organisation with its own regulation and governing bodies. It unites students who are interested in synthetic biology and are eager to contribute to raising awareness about it and possibilities it provides. Today the main goal of organisation is to support Vilnius iGEM team and events it holds, including visiting schools, ‘Café Scientifique’ discussions and many others.
We are thankful to previous Vilnius iGEM team members and Aurelija Olendraitė for support and consultations on starting ’SinBiO’.
If you want to know more about organisation, check our website.

Week12(9.13-9.19)
Figure 17. Tryptophon production of rbs30 mutation stains
In this week, we started to evolve Bl21 with mutation part and another bitter defender part(rbs32). Mutation part and Bitter defender part (rbs30) were transferred into E.coli Bl21. Colonies were picked up from agar plate to culture in LB. Seed culture was added to 1.5mL M9YE media(initial OD was 0.02) in 24-well plate with 50mg/L ampicillin, 24mg/L chloromycetin, 24mg/L IPTG and 80mg/L tetracycline as the first round mutation. After 270 minutes, the first round products were as seed culture added to another new 1.5mL M9YE media like above, but with higher tetracycline concentration as the second round mutation. After the third round mutation, the culture were coated on LB agar plate, picked up 24 single colonies to culture in 24-well plate for 48h and detected tryptophon production by HPLC. Result was shown in figure 17. With the help of mutation part, we also got mutation mixture with different tryptophon yield range from 0-2.028mg/L. The yield was obviously improved.
Week13(9.20-9.27)

We got high productivity stains during three rounds mutation, and we picked up the highest yield of rbs30 and rbs32 to culture in LB. Seed culture was added to 1.5mL M9YE media(initial OD was 0.02) in 24-well plate with 50mg/L ampicillin and cultured for 48h to detect tryptophon concentration. The result was shown in figure 18. The control Bl21 almost did not contain trptophon and the other two controls rbs30 and rbs32 with shown low productivity. Obviously, the two mutation strains had higher productivity. The yield of rbs30-16 was 2.4 times higher than control rbs30 and rbs32-3 was 2.7 times higher than control rbs32. That proved our mutation strategy successfully accelerates evolution to produce more tryptophon.

Q：Does your institution teach an iGEM or synthetic biology course? When did you start this course?
A：As CCU_Taiwan formed the very first iGEM Team of National Chung Cheng University, things start to move, to change, gradually. Because of the formation of CCU_Taiwan, our school designed a whole new interdisciplinary course in 2017 summer. What’s more, two interdisciplinary projects were launched in the 2017 new school semester!
Q：When did you start your brain storming?
A：We started our brain storming from Oct of 2016, and we filter our ideas through the below thinking model: What problem do we encounter by our side? -> Is this problem already solved? -> If not, it is because no one has done it or it is too difficult to solve? -> Can we solve this problem? -> Project determine!
Q：When did you start in the lab?
A：Our experiment training took place in Feb of 2017. And the actual project lab work started from Aug of 2017.
Q：When did you start working on your project?
A：Right after the project was determined in April, we started seeking the method to finish it. During this period, we managed to learn a lot of thing that is required (such as joining Taiwan MIT mini bootcamp to know more about entrepreneurship). We finished our gene design at July, and decided what software we had to build. We started rushing for our project in summer."

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.
Results

SCUT-China,2015,Team:SCUT-China#hospitalInterview_-_-_TEXT.html," more negative concerns and doubts, but we still don’t give up and try our best to achieve our dream, because your project is not only your own research but also the one that connects the people in need, surroundings and even the world who care about your project. It may really ease patients’ pain, relief the burdens of medical staff, and make a little difference to the world.
That is enough for us to be excited and encouraged.
A.Interview Reports (With Medical Staff)
(We are at Cardiology Unit2 )
a.Interview Summary of Doctors
According to our findings, medical staff in basic hospitals of small towns are not familiar with synthetic biology, let alone gene therapy, because of lack of higher medical education and research.
However, after we came to the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, a super major hospital in Guangzhou and had dialogues with Dr. Guo, a young and outstanding woman, twice, we realized that there was a long way to go to put our innovative idea and method into clinical research. She thinks our project has a significant meaning and can be a challenging project to try. She really hopes that we can make some differences to the current cardiovascular therapies.
To tell the details, she says that although modern medicine has a variety of methods and a large armory of drugs for the treatment of myocardial ischemia, there still remains some technical bottlenecks that are difficult to break. For instance, for patients with multiple coronary stegnotic lesions or disease in multiple vessels, percutaneous coronary intervention or surgical coronary revascularization procedures cannot cure the disease and often end with repeated procedures. Although the intervention is minimally invasive compared with the surgery, it has many limitations and cannot replace the surgical operation. It actually depends on placing a stent on the stegnotic position like the surgery. The surgery is more risky and it also cannot cure the disease. Its effect usually keeps at most 10 years, which has only 60% possibilities. Patients have to take more medicines after the stents don’t work. While if we use lentiviral vectors as a tool to deliver the packaged target gene into the cardiovascular tissues cells may provide a relatively permanent mechanism to regulate NO-sGC-cGMP pathway so that it may cure the disease to a certain extend. More significant, it can be considered as a prototype of gene therapy. And it provides a new idea based on synthetic biology for researchers who are trying to break the difficulty, a proud hope for those who are struggling mightily, stubbornly doing battle with the disease even the fate every day.
She suggests that"

I got GFP glowing colony in Normal RBS control plate. In the Medium RBS control I didn't get any GFP glowing colony. Hence I did a IPTG plate today with the rest of the electro transformed sample. I also cultured the Normal RBS control for miniprep tomorrow so that atleast the Positive control for negative cascade can be done perfectly.

Our collaboration focused on a small group of representatives from the DIYbio group at the London Hackspace. To share our work and experience with a wider public audience, we chose to host an exhibition reflecting on the collaboration. To attract a wider audience, we teamed up with our long-term advisor Howard Boland from C-LAB to host the event.
Aim
Reflect on our collaboration with London Biohackers (workshops + creating of “public” BioBrick)
Show citizen science within biology and molecular biology
A Synthetic Biology primer
Deliberate 'Access to Tools of Synthetic Biology' for “the Public”
Gain momentum and interest for a future ""London Community Lab""
Planning
We planned our exhibition as three components: DIYBio Europe, Citizen Science and Synthetic Biology.
Around the corridor, we created a timeline of our collaboration with the London Hackspace and other DIYbio groups. Attendees revisited our shared experience, starting at the initiation of the projects, traveling through the workshops and onto other DIYbio projects, including lemon & soil fuel cell at MadLab, the Manchester DIYbio group.
In the main area, a running gel of the “public BioBrick” was the centrepiece and the evening opened with a dramatic performance as we began running the gel.
On one side of the room, an area explored Citizen Science, including DIYbio and London Hackspace. We planned to include a print of the diybio codes, 'New Word,"

Besides this, a division of the lab into different areas is crucial. We designated separate areas for documentation, which of course did not happen on the benches, for lab-work, where we also worked with genetically modified bacteria and an ethidiumbromide-area where we could perform gel-electrophoresis and gel-analysis.

Cork_Ireland,2015,Team:Cork Ireland#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," our survey that there is a need for more rapid testing of certain    diseases which can be done cheaply and simply. He found that running machinery in these countries can be expensive so a    low cost alternative such as Basehunter is favourable.
In our talks with an experienced biomedical scientist, Dr. Brigid Lucey, we found that a niche exists even in developed labs    for a rapid diagnostic for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). As TB is slow growing, it is difficult to culture. For this reason,    lab results are often delayed even weeks for a confirmation of results. Basehunter could provide a simple and rapid method    to identify TB in samples. For this reason we designed a TB detector and began to verify    that it functions as well as the other detectors. In this way, our Human practices investigations highlighted a real world problem    that we sought to address.
Demonstrate a functional prototype of your project:
We demonstrated a functional prototype of our project in our own lab. We then collaborated with both TCD and UCL to see if the    prototype would be functional in another laboratory setting. Find our design here.
Help any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
In July we met with the Trinity College Dublin iGEM team who are taking part in iGEM for the first time. We provided feedback on their project work and told them what to expect at the Jamboree. We were in contact with the team in its early days before the team members were selected and stressed the need for a diverse team from many backgrounds. This was something we learned at iGEM last year and knew it was important to relay this advice. We also suggested that the team should not focus entirely on lab work and that engaging with the community throughout their project is encouraged.
Over the course of working on the projects, we kept in contact with the team and aided them in their efforts to create a Youtube Channel “iGEM Academy” with videos of common lab protocols by providing a video tutorial of our “Detector Reaction” for use with our Basehunter parts.

Figure 2: A. The SopII proteorhodopsin has not been activated. Note that CheA is active by default, continuosly autophosphorylating itself, and cycling back to it's unphosphorylated state by transfering the phosphoryl group to CheY. High levels of CheY-p will induce tumbling motion in the flagella. Also, note that CheZ continuously dephosphorylates CheY. B. SopII is hit with a photon, causing conformational change of the entire complex. The inactivation of CheA halts production of CheY-p, and CheZ rapidly dephosphorylates the remaining CheY-p, resulting in a reduced frequency of tumbling.

Retinal Generator
Retinal requirements of light-sensing proteins
Proteorhodopsins belong to a larger group of proteins called retinylidene proteins consisting of proteins called an opsins with a retinoid cromophore such as retinal attached as a prosthetic group[ 11 ]. In our system retinal is responsible for the initial light-activation, as it undergoes photoizomerization when it is struck by a photon[ 12 ]. It is this change in conformation of the retinal molecule that is relayed through the entire protein complex to regulate chemotaxis [ 12 ]. Thus either an external supply of retinal or an internal supply, generated by means of genes coding for enzymes in the retinal biosynthesis pathway are required, if we wish to see phototactic behaviour in our cells [ 10 ].
Light-sensitive pigments can be found in a large variety of organisms from archaea and bacteria to both uni- and multicellular eukaryotes [ 11 ], [ 13 ], [ 14 ]. Many plants and microbes have complete retinal biosynthesis pathways in their genomes [ 15 ]. In these organisms rhodopsins play an essential role, not only for photosensing but also directly in energy production [ 11 ],[ 13 ],[ 14 ]. In fact in some organisms rhodopsins are used to create proton motive force directly by pumping protons out into the extracellular space using light energy to drive the process [ 14 ]. Humans and other animals on the other hand often only have enzymes coding for the final steps of the pathway, more on which later. They rely on a supply of retinal precursors"

Complying with the iGEM paradigm of protein domains, we fused the DNA sequences of our different parts in silico, and ordered most of our fusion-proteins as single DNA fragments.
Ideally, when using our BioBrick device to detect snake venom in a clinical setting, the output signal should be sufficiently strong to give a definite result within a short amount of time. In order to make the output signal of our test easy to analyse without unnecessary equipment, we chose to incorporate a reporter molecule that could be analysed without the use of expensive equipment. Using chromoproteins, it would in theory be possible to visually analyse whether or not a person has been bitten by a specific type of snake.
AmilCP is a chromoprotein isolated from Acropora millepora, a coral native to the indo-pacific ocean. The chromoprotein absorbs light at 588 nm, giving it a purple-blue colour [12].
The Uppsala iGEM team has been working with a collection of different chromoproteins since 2011. From their continuous collection of chromoprotein BioBricks, amilCP was chosen from Uppsalas collection, as it has a high molar extinction coefficient and can absorb light at wavelengths that are far away from the red blood cells from the blood we are testing on. Furthermore, our team used amilCP as a reporter during the BioBrick Tutorial , and had thereby gained experience with expressing this particular BioBrick from a very early starting point.
We aimed to improve the amilCP part from the distribution kit by adding a 6x his-tag to the C-terminal end of the chromoprotein. By doing this, it would theoretically be possible to purify both the amilCP part, and composite parts based on the his-tagged amilCP, using affinity chromatography. The designed part of amilCP with his-tag was submitted to the parts registry as BBa_K2355002.
Avidin can form non-covalent bonds to biotin with an unusually low association constant ( Ka=1015 M-1 ) [13], which is a much higher affinity compared to normal protein-ligand interactions that have association constant of ~ 1011 M−1. This high affinity has been utilised for years for different chromatography purposes.
We intend to"
NCTU_Formosa,2009,Team:NCTU Formosa#Project#Design test_-_-_TEXT.html," When switched on, the promoter starts translating and directly lead to the appearance of the green color. Moreover, the promoter would indirectly lead to the appearance of the red color. The timer and the counter share the same mechanism to output the signal.
(4)  Memory System
The basic idea of this memory system was first developed by KULeuven during the 2008 iGEM competition. It is composed of two conjugated sequences. (See more details here )
By the work of these sequences, the inducer (lactose) is distinguished and memorized, and then drives the whole device.  When the inducer is removed, however, the function of whole device can be switched to a contrary one.  ( It can only be switched on once and can never go back. )
We use the lactose to control the initiation and closure of the system. However, it’s contradictory that the system should initiate the counter only in the final stage but not in the second stage; even the functions in these two stages are both shut down. Hence, we can save the input signal into the memory system to solve the problem. The memory system can remember the input signal even when external conditions have changed.
In the memory system, we connect two sequences of tetR and CIIP22 proteins downstream the promoter which is repressed by the CI434 protein. During the lactose-accession stage, the translation of tetR and CIIP22 is repressed, and meanwhile promote the other sequence to produce the CI434 protein. It means that the repression of two conjugated sequences reverses. Thereafter, no matter what surrounding becomes, the product of this memory system doesn’t change.
(5)  LuxR Operon
Acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) is a kind of auto-inducer. It serves as the communicative signal in the bacterial self-illumination mechanism
The LuxR protein is a membrane receptor which distinguishes AHL compound liberated by bacteria and passes down the signals. When external bacteria aggregate, the concentration of AHL will rise to the boundary level and cause the production of AHL-LuxR complex. This complex then becomes a translated factor and starts the translation of the Lux operon.
Based on the Lux auto-inducer mechanism, we can insert the target sequences into the Lux operon. By doing so, we can regulate any device we want. In addition, we inserted a sequence of LuxI protein downstream of the Lux operon. The LuxI protein impels the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to transform into AHL. This becomes another way of"

Analytics
Protocols for the analytical methods we used are listed in the next chapter.
DNA and proteins are very small and cannot be seen by the naked eye. To control the success and the results of the upstream and downstream processes, analytical methods are necessary that give reliable results to make DNA or proteins in any way visible for you. The analytical methods we used in our project can be found in this section.

Tsinghua-A,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#fluid model#regulation of killing ability_-_-_TEXT.html," describe how killing effect of one warrior change as time.
1. Results under original parameter sets
    As stated above, RFP intensity is used to indicate the killing effect of the warrior. From this original parameter set and result, we can see that since the maximal expression rate of RFP of two warriors (Indicating the amount of LacI) have large difference, the maximal killing effects are different largely. In the real situation, this means that warrior I has higher amount of LacI and thus less CmR so it has less resistance to chloramphenicol and slower growth rate.
    The first step we can do to regulate maximal killing effect is to increase/decrease the maximal expression rate of warrior I/II. In the experiment, this can be achieved by changing the RBS after Prhl in warrior. For example, we can increase the maximal expression level of RFP inside warrior II to increase the killing ability of warrior I.
2. Increasing the maximal expression rate of RFP inside warrior II
    From this, Even the maximal expression intensity of AHL promoter of two warriors are the same, we will think warrior II still have much higher killing ability than that of warrior I. This is because its killing effect is high at the beginning and warrior I may be killed at a very fast speed at the beginning. Sometimes we may not only want to regulate their maximal killing effect, but also want to regulate their killing effect in real time. (You can imagine that in a war, warrior II accumulates strength at a very fast speed and kills warrior I immediately, though their maximal strength is the same. What you want to do here is actually equivalent to regulating their speed of accumulating strength.)
    Therefore, what could we do? Intuitively, we may think that if warrior II expresses less LuxI so that 3OC6HSL accumulates slower, the speed of accumulating strength is slower.These can both be demonstrated by our model.
3. Decreasing the expression rate of LuxI inside warrior II
    By doing this, we can regulate the accumulating strength speed of warrior successfully! In the experiment, this can be achieved by changing the constant promoter or RBS of LuxI in warrior II.
    In conclusion, the core is that we can regulate the maximal killing effect by regulating the amount of LacI (In this model, RFP)and the speed of accumulating strength by regulating amount of AHL-production enzyme inside cell. All these can be regulated by thechange the promoter/RBS of the protein or adding LVA tag after the protein experimentally.

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Degradation_-_-_TEXT.html," metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

To further validate whether AI-2 Consumer Devices can actually increase AI-2 environmental AI-2 concentration, we measured the AI-2 concentration in the culture after 3 h induction of IPTG. As illustrated in Fig. 5, in the culture medium of AI-2 Supplier pLuxS and pLuxSMtn, AI-2 concentration was both increased significantly than control group. The result shows that, as expected, AI-2 concentration in the culture of AI-2 Supplier pLuxSMtn is much more than AI-2 Supplier pLuxS.

Design of modular QS elements: AI-2 Consumer
There are mainly three steps involved in the processing of AI-2 from the extracellular environment. (i) uptake, primarily through the LsrACDB transporter, (ii) LsrK-mediated phosphorylation of AI-2 (to AI-2P), which blocks export back to the extracellular milieu so that accumulated AI-2P binds the regulatory protein LsrR, derepressing the Lsr transporter as well as enzymes, LsrF and LsrG, and (iii) degradation of AI-2P through the two step process from isomerase LsrG followed with cleaving and thiolation by LsrF. In our project, we cloned lsrACDB, lsrK, lsrFG into the plasmid pTrcHisB to enable overexpression of all proteins associated with these AI-2 processing steps in E. coli. Six AI-2 Supplier Devices, pLsrACDB, pLsrK, pLsrFG, pLsrACDBFG, pLsrACDBK, pLsrACDBFGK were successfully constructed using homologous recombination method.
During the construction, all intermediate constructs and final plasmids were immediately verified by restriction enzyme digestion verification and/or sequencing. As you can see from Fig. "

At this time the inclusion body act as the repressor that stop the production of cutinase and also will be the activator of reporter gen (Amil CP). This activity shown by the picture above. The model expression of inclusion body was modeled using Hill Function.
The assumption of the model:
We do not include the factor of cell division of bacteria
Cutinase
Inclusion Body inducer
Reporter gen (Amil CP) expression
Ethylene Glycole amount (as a product of PET degradation)
PET degradation
Parameters
Figure 1 shown the graph of cutinase production, inclussion body production and blue protein expression. Figure 2 shown the the close up graph and Figure 3 shown the PET degradation and ethylene glicol product profil by the time of gene expression. Inclussion bodies are reflactile aggreates of protease-resistant misfolded protein that often occur in recombinant bacteria upon gratutious overexpression of cloned genes. In biotechnology, the formation of Ibs represents a main obstacle for protein production since even favouring high protein yields. Aggregation of recombinant proteins is probably due to limiting amount of chaperones when recombinant gene expression is directed at high leves. When the ammount of protein production is maximal, we assume that inclusion body will be release. Inclussion body could drive the expression of Tet represor and AmilCp as shown in figure 1. When the inclussion body could be degraded by the cell, the PibPab promoter will be off and there are no TetR and amilCP expression. In that condition we assume that the the cutinase expression will be increassing until reach some value that could release the inclusion body, than the expression will be represed. In figure 2, we could observe the osilation graph. From the figure 3, we could see that by the time of PET degradation the ethylene glicol product that could be released is increase.

This can be inferred from the fact that the millers activity of the OBP2A sample lies lower than the negative controls from within the experiment.

Restriction Enzyme Digestion
The aim of this experiment was to investigate the effects of methylation on digestion of genomic DNA with different restriction enzyme concentrations.
We performed a genome prep assay on 2 different strains of E.Coli - a Dam positive strain (TOP10) and a Dam negative strain (GM2163). The DNA of the Dam positive strain is naturally methylated, whilst the DNA of the Dam negative strain was unmethylated. This allowed comparisons to be drawn between the amount of cleavage by restriction enzymes.
A restriction digest was performed using our 2 restriction enzymes (DpnII and TaqI) each at varying concentrations. The results can be seen below:
DpnII Restriction Digest
Here we can see clearly the differences between the Dam positive and negative strains.
The Dam-ve strains are fully cleaved at all different concentrations of restriction enzyme. This produces the 'smear' that can be seen, as the DNA fragments are all of varying, but short lengths. This smear is not present in the control without the restriction enzymes. Good contrast can be seen against the Dam+ve genome, of which increasing amounts of cleavage can be seen with increasing restriction enzyme concentration. At 0.2ul restriction enzyme, the cleavage is minimal, and the gel profile is similar to the negative control. At 1.0ul restriction enzyme, there is significantly more cleavage, and the fragments are beginning to form the 'smear' effect seen in the Dam -ve strain.
TaqI Restriction Digest
Again, there are clear differences between the Dam positive and negative strains.
The Dam-ve strains again show the same 'smear' pattern as above, meaning they are fully cleaved at all different concentrations of restriction enzyme. This smear is not present in the control without the restriction enzymes. The results of the Dam+ve strain show clear differences against the Dam-ve, although the differences at different restriction enzyme concentrations are not so clear. This is perhaps because of the different recognition sequence of TaqI to the DpnII. As DpnII cuts at the same recognition site (GATC) as the site methylated by the Dam, every sequencee encountered by the enzyme will be methylated. However, with the TaqI, the recognition sequence is different, and therefore the activity will only be blocked when there is overlap with the Dam's recognition sequence"

Overview
Globally 35 million people have died to HIV while 36.7 million continue to live with the disease today (WHO). Of these millions, sub-Saharan Africa has been disproportionally affected with the United States also significantly affected (1.1 million) (CDC) compared to other modernized countries. Although Antiretroviral drugs can effectively treat the disease, the sad truth is that for Sub-Saharan Africa testing for HIV is often not a very easy prospect. In fact, testing for HIV in sub-Saharan Africa is limited by a variety of socioeconomic factors. These factors not only include the direct cost associated with HIV testing but also the stigmatization of HIV and HIV testing within the social groups of individuals in Africa. These barriers to testing necessarily make the treatment of HIV and the resulting spread of the disease far more difficult to manage. As such the goal of a point of care rapid diagnostics test that is accurate, cheap, and convenient is critical to combat the spread of the virus.
Needless to say, however, is the economic toll this has taken on the region. As one of the most impoverished regions of the world, economic growth is among one of the top priorities for the area. South Africa, the most economically developed country in the region, has experienced an increasing prevalence of HIV: an ever-increasing burden on a still growing economy (1). As HIV prevalence grows, so too does the prevalence of AIDS and thus AIDS-related death and illnesses. The direct cost can be associated with the amount of money sunk into testing, antiretroviral, and the campaigns against the disease. However, for the majority of these, the cost is covered by NGOs. The true cost associated with the disease is the loss of productive years and life across all afflicted individuals.
This loss of life and productivity is only the surface of what the disease truly"

Hey, my name is Chen Mechel, I’m 17 years old. I’m the head of the project and a part of the modeling team. This project is an incredible opportunity for me to experience in the fascinating field of synthetic biology. Furthermore it gives me the opportunity to take part of an international competition. My favorite quotation: ""Life is 10 percent what you make it, and 90 percent how you take it."" Irving Berlin
Hey, i’m Tomer, I’m 17 and the head of the modeling team, I enjoy working with my friends on our project and learning new stuff in many fields through it.
My favorite scientist is albert einstein (who else?) and i really hope that someday I will make a change which is even 0.1% of what he did. Apart from that I like hiking, reading and listening to music (favorite band- Pink Floyd) and rather be a giant rodent then a tiny elephant because if people are afraid of small rodents, then a giant one will be invincible…
Hey, my name is Naseeb Saida, I am 17 years old , I am  the head of the cloning team of our project. I enjoy working in the lab and using advanced technology.  I don’t like to design primers with computer programs. I look forward to see the other teams' project and to learn more things from smart students in the competition. I am happy to work on this project because I am learning new things in each day and I think that working with team is the best way to improve my knowledge. I am working with amazing students, and I am interested in taking part of an intentional competition.

Bee Culture Magazine
They say that those who read live a thousand lives before they die, but imagine that by reading, the ones who live a thousand lives are not only humans but also honeybees. For our Human Practices, we want to raise awareness for bees and how we can help these remarkable organisms to fight for their lives.
iGEM Tec Chihuahua has proposed a solution to a real beekeeping problem using synthetic biology, but we also know that not everyone can understand how it works without knowing previously what this new science branch involves. Having said that, it is very important for us to let people know about synthetic biology and the benefits that it could bring to Apis mellifera and to life in general.
For this reason, we looked for a prestigious beekeeping magazine to make diffusion of synthetic biology in more countries. Due to this, we found that the Bee Culture was a very important magazine in the United States and other English-speaking countries. That’s  why  we  decided  to  write  an  article  and  share  it  with  the  ones  who  are interested in the
beekeeping sector so they also could know that there exists a new way to redesign biological systems which could be channelled in favor of any living organism.
We firmly believe that synthetic biology needs to be spread, but not only in our community. We wanted to reach people strictly related with this field, so we wrote to the Bee Culture Magazine an article proposal, which they liked and will be published in November’s magazine edition.
Bee Culture is the American beekeeping magazine which has news and expert tips for beginning, sideline and commercial beekeepers. The scope of the magazine is given by the monthly subscriptions, which are available to all English-speaking countries. The magazine could be found in a printed edition, smartphones, tablets, and web edition.
Besides the article, we know that synthetic biology is a completely new topic for beekeepers, nevertheless we think that science should be part of everyone’s lives. That's why we put our contact at the end of the article, so iGEM Tec-Chihuahua 2018 could solve questions that could emerge in beekeepers or public in general.
Since our article will be published after the Giant Jamboree takes place, we asked Bee Culture’s editor, Kim Flott"

We aimed to introduce a red-light-dependent gene expression network and the band-detect network into the Artificial Cooperation System. (Fig. 4-3-1) These two systems were integrated and linked together by applying OmpR.  OmpR usually works as a regulative factor of red-light sensing system, and we utilized this to regulate the band-detect network.  OmpR is a transcriptional regulator, which activates the expression of cI and LacIM1 in this system

Toronto,2017,Team:Toronto#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"LOV-mCherry was submitted as BBa_K2469003. In the absence of blue light, LacILOV (which is constitutively expressed) will bind to the Ptrc-2 promoter and inhibit transcription. No fluorescence at 610nm will be observed.
Figure 4. YFP/mCherry Switch part  BBa_K2469004
To test the activity of the basic switch mechanism, samples were grown in either dark or light conditions using our hardware devices, with the following expectations:
In the dark: LacILOV is bound to the Ptrc-2 promoters. Since mCherry and cI:LVA are both controlled by Ptrc-2, no mCherry or cI:LVA is transcribed. Therefore no fluorescence is measured at 610nm for mCherry. Additionally, since no cI:LVA is produced, YFP is transcribed and fluorescence is measured at 528 nm.
Figure 5. Animated model for the switch in the dark.
In the light: LacILOV unbinds from the Ptrc-2 promoter and mCherry and cI:LVA are both expressed. mCherry reporter fluorescence is measured at 610nm. Since cI:LVA is expressed, the BBa_R0051 promoter is repressed and prevents downstream expression of YFP.
Figure 6. Animated model for the switch in the light.
In order to optimize the design of our switch, we modelled the interactions of each component using ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Through Quasi steady-state assumption, we combined and simplified the model down to four equations. We then simulated the model through the MATLAB tool, Simbiology. In order to validate the accuracy of our models, we compared our predicted results for LacILOV-mCherry (BBa_K2469003) to the data from our aforementioned characterization assay of LacILOV and calculated the fit.
Figure 7. Fitting the mCherry reporter assay results from wet lab to our predicted ODE model
Similar to the activity of the LacILOV mCherry construct, the assays for assessing reporter construct use the same hardware devices for delivery of light and dark conditions. The fluorescence output of mCherry and YFP were measured. It is expected that mCherry expression would increase and YFP would decrease in light conditions.

Victoria Tunnel - 18/09/2018
To strengthen the idea behind our concept we organised a trip to the Victoria Tunnel to get first hand experience. We wanted to talk to the guides and see if what we were actually proposing could work. We learnt that there had already been attempts to farm in the tunnel, in the 1920s locals tried to farm mushrooms. Unfortunately, their efforts were unsuccessful. This does not mean that we could not grow in them now, it is clear from talking to previous stakeholders at GrowUp Urban Farms and Growing Underground that we now have access to technology fit for the job. The tour took us through the Tunnel's rich history from 1842 when it was built, through the Victorian era, into the Second World War, and then to the present. The visit highlighted the scale of the Tunnel and helped to strengthen our concept.
Food Nation - 20/09/2018
We met with Nicola Cowell from Food Newcastle , a partnership of businesses, organisations and individuals with an interest or remit around various aspects of good food. The goal of the company is to create a healthier food culture in Newcastle whilst helping to protect the planet. We wanted to talk with them as they aim to make Newcastle a sustainable food city by building networks, connecting people and promoting sustainable food initiatives. We felt our Human Practices would work well within this framework. We discussed the issues that Newcastle currently faces with regards to food, such as, rising obesity, food poverty and health inequalities. Nicola told us about 6 key issues Food Newcastle is trying to address: Diet-related ill health and access to food; Good food for all – tackling food poverty; Building community food knowledge, skills, resources and projects; Strengthen the local sustainable food economy; Transforming catering and food procurement; Environmental sustainability – reducing waste and the ecological footprint of the food system. After outlining our project we both agreed that there were many aspects of our project that would fit into the model responsible for addressing these issues.
In summary, we asked our stakeholders about their values and the overwhelming response was a commitment to sustainable agriculture: GrowUp Urban Farms and Growing Underground wanted to reduce the carbon footprint of the agriculture industry, GrowModule365 wanted to increase accessibility to fresh produce"

The second part will be composed of pDusk system and toxin, this will lead to the cell death when the bacteria won’t be exposed to light.        This second part will be more difficult to characterized indeed all steps before characterization of the plasmid as plasmid amplification will have to be under light.
Toxins
In order to have the most efficient kill-switch, we decided to test several toxins in our system. We have choosen three toxins; holin/endolysin, ccdB and HokD.       Holin ( BBa_K1616007 ) and endolysin ( BBa_K1616006 ) are toxins; after a period of late-gene expression, holin, an inner permeabilizing protein creates holes in the membrane in order to permeabilize it and then endolysin, a muralytic enzyme traverses the holes created by holin and degraded the cell wall.       This complex induces cell lysis of bacteria (Young & Bläsi, 1995). The HokD protein ( BBa_K1616008 ) is a toxin when overexpressed kills the cells from the inside by interfering with a vital function in the cell membrane.       Then, ccdB ( BBa_K1616012 ) comes from the ccd system in  Escherichia coli F plasmid and acts as a gyrase poison.
The pDawn & pDusk system, have been optimized and constructed in the way that the toxins sequences we introduce in our construction are in fact the reverse sequences.      In this way; for holin/endolysin we have taken the reverse sequence of the previous iGEM BioBrick BBa_K124003 .

VVD constructions
This construction involving a photorecepteur dimerization upon light illumination could be of great interest in some proteins interaction researches.        Indeed, our team decided to use this construction in a playful and entertaining system: the Bio-Console, but we also thought of  more ""serious"" applications and uses of this tool.
The VVD construction could be used in order to induce forced and controlled proteins interaction:
For example, coupled to the knockout of normal protein expression, it would initiate the establishment of a metabolic pathway at a specific time T (in the absence of the original signal).
This process would allow  in particular,the design of some diseases models."

She tells us that feces contains too many bacteria, blood is supposed to be sterile but is not common practice and thus economically not so attractive. Urine samples are often used with pet animals. Milk would be most suited as this is has little bacteria, only skin bacteria and the pathogens causing mastitis.
Engeline also told us about extended-spectrum lactamases that can break down a lot of types β-lactam antibiotics and thus can make a large group of antibiotics inactive. A lot of β-lactamases can be passed on from animals to humans

Summary
Interview summary
When asked about the most occurring/challenging bacterial infection in cattle, Bouwe Frank pointed us towards mastitis. This is in an infection of the udder. The problem with mastitis is that it can be caused by various bacteria. If you are interested in detecting antibiotic resistances in the case of mastitis, you will thus first have to establish which pathogen you are dealing with.
How the current process goes, is that a sample of a sick animal is sent to the GD Animal Health. They cultivate the sample to see what bacteria causes the disease. Often, an educated guess considering the pathogen can be made. If the test is positive, the animal can get a suitable treatment. If not, the test is repeated under different conditions. These tests are not based on detecting antibiotic resistances, because this takes more time and money.
Bouwe Frank referred us to the GD animal health to get a better insight in the current diagnostics process through the veterinarian laboratory. A valuable person to contact is Ynte Schukken, who is connected to the GD animal Health and professor at the Groningen University.

Cells that did not have arabinose were expected to not emit any luminescence and cells with full luciferase were also loaded on the chip as a positive control
Method
22.07.14:
Cells were loaded into the MITOMI chip and grown overnight at room temperature
We used cells containing following plasmid:
pYNZC (from Waldor's Lab) grown overnight in LB + arabinose
pYNZC (from Waldor's Lab) grown overnight in LB (without arabinose)
pRluc (from Waldor's Lab) as positive control = full luciferase
Medium composition: 15ml LB solution with chloramphenicol and 4*670ul = 2680 ul arabinose 100mM (following Waldor's Lab  paper )
Compartments were as follows:
 
1st loading: with ara (M2 + M4 closed), 5 min
2nd loading: without ara (M2 + M3 closed), 5 min
-Wash with lysis buffer 5 min
-Wash with medium 5 min
3rd loading: positive control (full luciferase) (M1 + M4 closed)
The only difference between cells with arabinose and without arabinose is that they were cultured overnight with or without arabinose (before chip). Once the cells were loaded into the chip, they were all supplied with arabinose.
23.07.14:
The chip was scanned before starting the experiment in the morning, (Fig 1)
A scan of lysis buffer and medium flowing in the chip was also made to check if these solutions gave a fluorescent signal. (Fig 2 and 3).
Medium was also used as a control. (Fig 4)
Clz was added and incubated for 10 minutes with closed sandwiches and 2 scans were taken at interval of 5 minutes (Fig 5 and 6).
A third one was also taken with the lamp turned off, this scan did not produce a decent picture.
Once the scans post clz addition were taken, we flowed glucose in the chip. The expected response to glucose is a fading of luminescence.
First glucose was flown for 5 min with M3 closed, meaning that only “without ara” and “medium” (negative control rows) compartments were supplied with glucose.
Incubation of 5 min with closed sandwiches followed this addition. (Fig 7)

Module Integration - Thermoinduction
Overview
When sufficient protective coating has been made, the temperature of the system is raised to 42°C.  This activates the thermosensitive promoter, consequently triggering Module 3.
Rationale
After encapsulation, it becomes more difficult for normal chemical induction to penetrate the outer protective coating.  To tackle this problem, heat induction is used.  Heat induction is, in addition, a commonly used and highly reproducible induction method in industrial scale manufacturing processes.
The thermosensitive cI promoter is chosen as it is widely cited in literature for efficient thermoinduction of systems [1], and has been proven to work well in commonly available plasmids. BBa_K098995 , in particular, is the only construct for the thermosensitive cI system in the registry and has already been characterised previously.
The system
The lambda promoter ( R0051 ) is strongly repressed at 28 degrees by the cI repressor( K098997 ).  Therefore, at 28 degrees, the thermoinducible system has no activity.
However, this cI repressor is unique in that it is temperature-sensitive, and will readily lose its functional structure as the temperature increases.  Therefore, when the temperature is raised to 42°C, the lambda promoter is no longer repressed and can trigger Module 3.
  About the thermoinduction system
Characterisation of existing biobrick
The thermoinducible construct ( BBa_K098995 ), an existing biobrick, is characterised by ligating it to GFP.  The cells are grown at the low temperature of 28°C where the promoter is inactive. The temperature is then shifted up to 42°C.  The GFP fluorescence is monitored throughout as an indicator of promoter activity.
The GFP fluorescence is shown to be at baseline when cells are grown at 28°C.  However, when the cells undergo a temperature shift to 42°C, there is an almost immediate increase in GFP fluorescence.
This shows that the activity of the lambda promoter does increase when the temperature is shifted up, so the thermoind"

LEUVEN MEETUP - 10/07/2017
The KU Leuven team invited us to the iGEM symposium they have organised. The symposium was the 7th of Octobre in         Leuven in their university. The goal of this meeting was to meet teams, we were 5 teams to be present (München, Aachen,         Amterdam, Leuven and us) but also to practice for the oral presentation and for the poster.
We first had the pleasure to have a lecture in medical devices from one of their professor which was really interesting and         we learned many things about what we could do with medical devices and how we can employ them.
After the first lecture we started the teams presentations, it was fascinating to hear all teams and learn from them,         give them opinions, advice for Boston.
After teams presentation we had the last lecture from their PI about the life as a scientist. It was an amazing         lecture, we were all emotionally touched and it remind us the real work as a scientist to be in contact with the society         all the time and feel what we do, do it with passion and nothing else.
We finished the symposium with the poster presentation. Each team had to talk about their project briefly, and comment         the other posters.
The symposium they organised was a really nice adventure, in which we learned and shared many things, we went back         home with new friends, a lot of advice and comments about how to improve our poster presentation and our oral presentation.         We gave them back advice too.
It was a very great and helpful experience. We also had the time to visit the city of Leuven, which is a very cute city.
We want to thanks the Leuven team for inviting us to their symposium and for receiving us to their place to spend the night!

Design of Formaldehyde-Degrading Machine with Escherichia Coli
Our project is aiming to eliminate formaldehyde in the real world, such as newly decorated houses, cars, furniture factory, etc. Basing on previous experiment results, we designed a Formaldehyde-Degrading Machine, including air pump and strainer, air diffusion device, formaldehyde-detecting and degrading device, and no-return exhaust device, etc. Our ultimate goal is to design a formaldehyde purification device. This equipment can not only alarm the excess formaldehyde but also directly biodegraded formaldehyde by the constructed bacteria, which can effectively to solve the problem aroused by formaldehyde excess. The working principle and design ideas are as follows.
To be simple, the procedure of eliminating formaldehyde is as follows:
1. Pump air into the strainer (Figure 1a), and cast off harmful bacteria and other granules simultaneously.
2. Add LB media into the container.
3. Render the resulting gas to diffuse across small pores (Figure 1b), in the purpose of maximum blending, into media containing engineered Escherichia coli.
4. Detect and degrade formaldehyde in detecting device (Figure 1c). When the concentration of formaldehyde excess, the RFP can be expressed, and the level of degradation can be manifested by the intensity of absorbance qualitatively and then by the intensity of fluorescence quantitatively, which can also be seen by the transparent solution.
5. Purified air is exhausted across the non-return valve (Figure 1d).

We started to grow more cells to make E. coli lysates of the three different strains.  We also made more media, YTPG and LB.  Adam recut the mini-prepped backbone and ran it through a gel because of the previous unsuccessful ligation.
Week 16
10/6 We redid the ligation for the gBlock into BBBB and then transformed and plated it.  The colony from plate R3 from 10/4/14 was miniprepped and sent in for sequencing.  We gel extracted BBBB and the Spinach Aptamer and prepped for a ligation.
10/7 Adam checked the plate from Monday for colonies and since there were some present, they were miniprepped and sent in for sequencing.  Mitch and Tiffany prepared for another round of ligation and transformation.
10/8 We ligated the RBS into the Spinach Aptamer.
10/9 We sent in the Spinach Aptamer as a part to the iGEM registry.
Week 17
10/12 We inoculated the RBS and gBlock.
10/13 The inoculated cultures from the previous day showed no growth.  In the morning, the RBS+gblock construct was miniprepped using the Omega solution 1 and Epoch for all other solutions.  The sequencing reactions for the biobrick construct were prepared.  The concentration of these were around 20ng/ul.  In the afternoon the fluorophore was resuspended in DMSO and diluted with water to the desired concentration.
10/14 Cell free protein synthesis was done with the three strains of E. coli (BL21, DH5a, and K12), along with S. rimosus, P. fluorescens, and two environmental strains, enterobacteria and comamonas.
10/15 The results for CFPS returned, unfortunately there were only kinetic results from spaces A-C and 1-8 which were BL21 and DH5a and two of the 3 K12 samples.  Graphs are in the CFPS tab under “Projects”.

Effect of ACC deaminase engineered endophytes on plant growth in drought and high salinity conditions
An illustration of our engineered endophytes fighting drought and salt stresses in the roots of a model plant!
Due to impending climate change related variation in rainfall, increased drought and soil salinities are predicted to become serious problems that lead to reduced crop yields from osmotic stress. In environments with high salinity and dry soil, plants respond by producing more ethylene, which engages regulatory pathways leading to premature senescence. Beneficial microbial endophytes are thought to increase the stress tolerance of plants in part by modulating signals from the ethylene pathway. For example, endophytes inside the roots of plants are known to secrete the enzyme ACC deaminase (ACCD), which converts 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC), the precursor to ethylene, into α-ketobutyrate and ammonia. The degradation of ACC reduces the formation of ethylene, thereby delaying the onset of senescence.
We seek to import efficient ACCD genes into endophytic bacteria that lack this pathway. Optimized ACCD genes from bacteria and fungi will be inserted into endophytic bacteria taken from grass roots. Brachypodium distachyon, a model grass species, will be inoculated with these bacteria to compare growth to a control plant. Another focus is to identify as many transformable endophytes as possible. This will be done by collecting root samples of common grasses, harvesting bacteria, sequencing for identification, and screening for ACCD activity. ACCD genes from numerous sources will be either amplified from culture or synthesized, then assembled and inserted into endophytic grassroots bacteria. Then these bacteria will be tested on B. distachyon to show increased growth. If such engineered endophytes confer additional stress tolerance onto B. distachyon, this technique may be a useful approach to boost crop yields, especially in developing countries and other areas where irrigation practices are difficult. Engineering of endophytes provides a way to promote plant growth without actually engineering"
Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Indigoidine_-_-_TEXT.html," pRB15-18. Desired bands would be expected at 1.3 kbp for positive clones. For positive controls amplicons were expected at ~2 kbp for pRB3 and at ~1.5 kbp for pKH4. 100 V, 0.8 % Agarose, TAE
The positive controls gave the expected bands. All picked clones also gave an expected band at 1.3 kbp which leads to the conclusion that they carry the indC-only plasmid pRB21. Because every third clone was a picked white colony we could also conclude, that not all transformants carry an intact PPtase plasmid.
T-domain exchange with different domain borders
We thought of a different way to set the T-Domain borders. Starting from the Pfam-predicted domain borders we made pairwise alignments to find amino acid sequences up- and downstream the predicted borders, that are identical in both the native and the brought in sequence. In the case of the exchange of indC and bpsA those new borders would be around 10 amino acids more on each side. We designed primers for this strategy.

1. A reliable source of data
To deal with the data problem, we derived data of experimentally-determined essential genes from CEG database[1].  CEG(Cluster of Essential Gene) is a database which contains clusters orthologous essential genes. A notable feature of CEG is it deposits essential genes in orthologous groups rather than as single gene. There are seven tables in CEG database, and we used five of them selectively according to demand. Including ceg_core, which contains the information of each essential gene; ceg_base, which contains information of each gene cluster. And other three tables are reference, annotation and nucleic acid sequences.
We know upgrading is a key influence factor of the Product Life Cycle, and this is also our key consideration. The data of MCCAP will be constantly improving with updating of CEG, and reference species of it has increased from 16 to 29.
2. Determining the minimal gene set
The first and most important step of building a minimal artificial cell is determining the minimal gene set (minimal genome). Our method of solving this key task is the half retaining strategy. It is quite simple but effective. The implementer of the half-retaining strategy, MCCAP, achieves good results.
However, what exactly is the half retaining strategy?
Our half retaining strategy is basically one kind of Comparative Genomics Approach but it is further improved by starting with essential gene data determined by inactivation experiments. Firstly, we classify genes with the same function in different species into one category, named gene cluster. Secondly, we calculate the size of each gene cluster. Size means the number of species which contain the genes in this cluster. Finally, we put genes, whose size is no less than the half number (HN) together as the minimal gene set. For example, when there are 15 species, HN will be 8 according to our definition. So, if the size of a gene cluster is equal or more than 8, it will be added to the minimal gene set. In practice, we optimize the retaining ratio from the nominal half number to obtain more stable result.
And what is difference between"
SHSBNU_China,2018,Team:SHSBNU China#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"Also, we do further experiments to prove that the connection of Spycatcher and Spytag could largely improve the enzyme activity. We find that, comparing the mixture of the Spycatcher-CotA + inactive biofilm,  Spycatcher-CotA + CsgA-Spytag, CsgA-Spytag + CotA(wild type), and inactive biofilm + CotA(wild type), there is a striking difference of enzyme activity between the mixture our engineered parts and others. This result indicates that our part, Spcatcher-CotA + CsgA-Spytag, could undoubtedly raise the effectiveness of CotA.
III. Hardware
To maximize the CotA-biofilm contact area, our design is to apply the biofilm onto tiny beads, as shown in our applied design section. Most of the industrial biofilm carriers are made of ABS or traditional plastic materials; whereas most of them are not biological degradable, and some of them contain tiny toxic substances. Our project use polyhydroxyalkanoates(PHA) as our biofilm carriers. PHA is a eco-friendly material, and it could be produced by crops and kitchen waste. After PHA is discarded into the wild, this material could be degraded by soil within a few month, and the byproducts contain no biohazard substance(Bluepha, 2018). Moreover, an outstanding characteristic of PHA is that it could supply nutrition for the adhering bacterias. In this way, the duration and expectancy of bacterias could be dramatically improved.
To test the adhesivity of PHA beads, we soak them into the bacteria solution
Our team also design a water-filter. This water-filter, as shown in the blueprint, could contain the beads in the central cavity. The inlet and outlet of the filter is connected with the water pump, manometer, which could adjust the flow rate and hydraulic pressure and reach an optimal processing efficiency as we discover in the modeling section.
In summary, we have shown that both of our approaches, using either CotA laccase or biofilm as well as the hardware design, are successful at treating waste water.

Fluid Functionality
Summary
During the process of developing the MARS repository there were many questions that we found ourselves asking consistently:
Why is this chip not working?
Is this what this chip should be doing right now?
What part of this chip is failing?
The common theme underlying these questions was our inability to explain why our microfluidics chips were not functioning correctly. When we had performed a literature review there were no papers published regarding a standardized method of evaluating microfluidic chips. With that problem in mind the team went on to create an evaluation system known as Fluid Functionality.
Fluid Functionality is based around analyzing the functionality of each primitive in a microfluidic chip (refer to Microfluidics 101 on our Wiki for more information regarding primitives.)  These primitives can be thought of as the individual electrical components that are a part of a larger circuit. If one and/or more primitive malfunctions the entire system will not work. However, how do we go about analyzing each primitive? Primitive analysis can be broken up into two parts:
Qualitative: Observations that provide any indication of failure.
Quantitative: Calculations that show whether your primitive failed or not.
By inter-relating the qualitative failures we have observed with a corresponding quantitative analysis method we can explain why a microfluidic chip is not working. If, for example, a primitive has a qualitative failure and fails its quantitative test, then there is something wrong with the primitive's dimensions. But if a primitive has a qualitative failure and passes its quantitative test, then there is some other source of error such as poor assembly.      At this time these relationships are not fully defined. More work in the future can yield a better relationship between which qualitative failure pairs with quantitative test. Fluid Functionality can primarily be utilized as a modeling framework.
iGEM has done an excellent job of defining modeling projects related to wet lab experiments, however since MARS is a hardware project this was our team’s approach of modeling our work. The sections below describe the qualitative and quantitative analyses we have developed.
Qualitative Failure Modes
Leak (Initial)
This qualitative failure is characterized by liquid leaking out of a channel and/or primitive into the space between the PDMS and flow layer. An initial leak"

The bigger the molecule the larger risk of immunogenicityImmunogenicityIf a organism or substance i immunogenic it means that it is able to provoke an response from the human immune system.. If the immune system develops immunization against the peptide aptamer it will not have any function.      Today, most often mammalian cells are used for production of mAbs, primarily because of their ability to perform post-translational modifications (PTM). Especially N-glycosylation is an important step, resulting in avoidance of the human immune system, i.e. minimizing the risk of immunogenicity. E. coli does not have these specifications yet back in 2002 researches found an N-linked glycosylation system in the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni and demonstrated that a functional N-linked glycosylation pathway could be transferred into E. coli too. Reference: Wacker M et al. N-linked glycosylation in Campylobacter jejuni and its functional transfer into E. coli. Science. 2002 Nov 29;298(5599):1790-3. [PubMed]
Another important aspetc is the peptide aptamers half-life. To be able to should function as treatment for chronic and autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis and disseminated sclerosis, the half-life should be adjustable. Read more about the half-life of our peptide aptamer in The Alternative .
Specificity and quality control are some of the most controversial topics regarding the use of antibodies. How can one demonstrate that a given antibody have specificity for a antigen and not anything ells. That would require the researcher to out think any possible substance that the antibody hypothetically could bind and test it - i.e. it is not possible. Yet our peptide aptamer has just as high specificity as antibodies (see table 1, The Alternative ). Other comparisons are schematized in Table 1 underneath this section.

Molecular dynamics calculation:
$$g(r)=\frac{1}{\rho 4\pi r^2}\frac{\sum_{i=1}^r\sum_{j=1}^N \Delta N(r\to r+\delta r)}{N\times                         T}$$
Where \(N\) is the number of molecules and \(T\) is the calculated time (steps), \(\Delta N\) is                         the number of molecules between \(r\) and \(r+\delta r\).
The radial distribution function can be computed via computer simulation methods. Because the                         peak of the radial distribution function appears at 0.5nm, so the spacing of 5CB molecules is                         around 0.5nm.
2. Calculate the range of β2-M that can perturb 5CB
We assume 5CB molecule as a ellipse (\(a\)=1nm, \(b\)=0.1nm), we got the tilt angles of three                         molecules by Matlab.
Fig.14 The tilt angles are 43°, 64°, 90° respectively.
\(\therefore\)Maximum radius of β2-M that can perturb 5CB (Fig. 10):
\(R_1=[2\times\sin (64^\circ )+1]\mathrm{nm}=\)2.8nm
3. Verification
In the liquid crystal experiment, the droplets dropped on the slide have a radius of about 2                         mm.
$$\therefore S=\pi R^2=4\pi\times 10^{12}\mathrm{nm^2}$$
The molecular weight of β2-M is 11800, the volume of the droplet is 10μL.
The area disturbed by each protein molecule is:
$$r=2.8\mathrm{nm}$$
$$S_0=\pi r^2=7.84\pi\mathrm{nm^2}$$
When the picture is just full colorful, the number of molecules contained in the droplet                         is:
$$N=\frac{S}{S_0}=5.1\times 10^{11}$$
$$m=\frac{11800\times 5.1\times 10^{11}}{6.02\times 10^{23}}=10^{-8}\mathrm{g}$$

DNA Degradation
To utilize the catechol-2,3-dioxygenase , encoded by the xylE gene, and any other proteins we plan incorporate into our system, there are two approaches that can be taken to move it out of the lab setting and into the real world.  The first approach is to compartmentalize the protein allowing for it to be isolated from the cell and applied independent of the organism. This method is addressed by using the lumazine synthase microcompartment .  The second approach is to keep our organism separated from the environment.  To do so, we can bring the tailings water to the cells at a place that would be similar to a refining or water treatment plant to prevent their spreading.
In 2007, UC Berkeley submitted a BioBrick containing an  inducible BamHI gene.  When expressed, this gene will produce the restriction endonuclease.  This enzyme will then ""chew up"" the genomic material of the cell.  The 2007 UC Berkeley team characterized the gene and demonstrated that when it is expressed does not affect the function of already translated protein.  They did this by showing that red florescent protein (RFP) remains functional after the expression of this “suicide gene”.  When a bacterial cell replicates, it must first replicate its genome.  If we express the “suicide gene” it will essentially render the cell into a sack of functioning proteins.  By degrading the DNA of the organism, we reduce the risk of genetic propagation since there is no template to replicate from.  A public concern regarding applying a genetically engineered system into the real world is the risk it may have of escaping into the environment. A treatment plant would act as a mediator between the organism and the environment.  Of course aseptic techniques would be followed.  The “suicide gene” can be used as an additional safety precaution .  If an organism somehow found its way into the environment (however unlikely this may be), it would not be able to propagate since it lacks DNA.  Therefore, this would allow for better regulation of the microorganism.

DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,", science departments are usually limited in their ability to house unfamiliar organisms. Lastly and important, the iGEM rules prohibit organisms from Risk Group 3 and 4 to ensure safety.
We tackled this concern by deciding on a non-pathogenic chassis (Risk Group 1) and choose methods and protocols using non life-threatening substances, minimizing potential risks. As these were well established, they were ideal for our proof-of-concept of experiments. In line with the educational agenda, this ensured a safe laboratory environment for our Outreach Initiatives such as the high school students, elite student interaction and the BioBrick workshop. Moreover, a mandatory safety introduction encouraged safe and proper execution of experiments.
 
Safety in the lab
When working with GMO it is important to have proper clearance what to do. The Technical University of Denmark has  special _ permissions from the Danish authorities covering a broad range of GMO projects including the iGEM project. Before entering the lab, our iGEM team had an introduction to the  safety rules in the lab . Importantly, our safety advisor presented how to work with GMO in the lab. In order to ensure a safe workflow in the lab, we identified the most prominent risks that was present in our designed experiments. As an inspiration, we will list a few of our identified risk factors in relation to the lab:
Chemicals
Floueouracil was used in production of minimal media plates for our experiment. It is toxic when ingested, inhaled or in a contact with skin.
Ethidium bromide was used for pre-staining gels for gel electrophoresis analysis. Ethidium bromide (EtBr) is lethal when inhaled and suspected to be mutagenic.
Genetic material
Antibiotic resistance genes are a necessity in the lab. We utilized a wide range in our experiments: Neomycin, Erythromycin, Ampicillin, Chloramphenicol, Kanamycin, and Zeocin.
The toxic gene mazF is considered to be toxic for mammal cells, but has low-risk when integrated into a plasmid in laboratory conditions. 
Importantly,  involved  chemicals should be handled appropriately. They should be used in designated areas: at separate benches for gels, where gloves should be worn. The used chemicals in our project were found in our laboratory building"

1.) Finding a topic
After establishing who is interested in being a member of this year’s Team, everyone went out to find possible supervisors and projects. Prof. Rolf Daniel     together with Dr. Elzbieta Brzuszkiewicz and Dr. Silja Brady, whom some of us know from the first microbiology lab course, have a project for us:
2.) Project Proposal
We would create a cellulosome like multi enzyme scaffold as well as several linker regions with which
enzymes of interest could be fused. This way, if for example a company wants to degrade different
materials in a solution or wants a specific enzyme complex they would then list the needed enzymes
and order them from us. We would then transform the enzymes before / after the linker regions, the
enzymes would be assembled in the cell on the scaffold and then exported by the model organism.
As the scaffold itself could be easily tagged, i.e. by a strep tag, we could then purify the multi enz
yme complex and deliver it to the company. As there are enzymes for thousands of different reactions, the applicability would be broad. As Dr.     Brzuszkiewicz and Dr. Brady weren't sure whe
ther something like this has already been done, we will still have to do some research into the topic itself.
2.) Deciding which topic to choose
As we currently have a grand total of one project, the question is whether we wait for other topics,
as not all lecturers have answered yet or, if there are no objections, go ahead with the project of
Prof. Daniel. For this, please sent me a mail with your thoughts until Sunday, as we need to decide fast.
3.) Distribution of tasks
Everybody should look into Prof. Daniels topic, to see whether something similar has been done and
what the current status on this research area is. In the coming days Verena will invite you to the
iGEM 2015 Dropbox folder, in which you can upload interesting papers.

What topic(s) are you going to discuss?
How are you going to introduce the topic(s)?
Do you want a plenary discussion, discussion in smaller groups, or a mixture?
Are you going to guide the discussions and if so, how? It is important to consider this question carefully. Having a moderator per discussion group can help deepening the level of the discussion, since this person can keep asking ‘why’ questions if the discussion stays superficial.
How long will each discussion round take?
Would you like participants to prepare something beforehand?
Example: setting up iGEM EurAsian meetup bioethics workshop.
Based on our considerations, we answered the questions in the following ways.
Ambiance We wanted to create an open discussion where there was time to progress from superficial opinions to the values that underlie them. To achieve this, it is important that:
The groups are small.
There is enough time per topic.
The groups are guided by an impartial person who keeps asking: “why?”, so that participants are forced to explain what underlies their initial statement.
Furthermore, we stressed that in a discussion:
All views are allowed to exist and be shared.
Eliminate judgments in your head.
Sharing more is better, improvise, ‘cheat the rules’ (for creativity).
All ideas created here are from the whole group, ownership cannot be claimed.
Topics
We decided to cover two topics in rounds of 30 minutes, and to leave the final half an hour open for participants to reflect on their own projects. We covered the two topics Bioluminesent trees and gene drives, because they were both topics that iGEM teams had worked on in the past ( Cambridge 2010, Minnesota 2016 ) and that could have implications that were not limited to a single country or continent.
Topic introduction
We introduced both topics with short movies. The first movie on bioluminescent trees ( van Ekelen, 2013 ) presented a future scenario where bio luminescent trees have been planted in parks, and reflects on the implications this could have. This movie presented a possible opinion, which made starting the discussion a bit easier. The second movie on gene drives ( Empinado, 2015 ), was far less opinionated, which allowed the discussion to move into more diverse directions. After the short movies we asked the bioethics experts present to give a short reflection on what they saw and what questions they would start to ask. We then let the groups start their own discussions.
Groups
We decided on groups of five or six participants with a moderator each, so that there would be enough time to"
MIT,2018,Team:MIT#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," we both discussed our biofilm assay protocols and came to the realization that we had very different techniques to quantify biofilm formation. While we were using Colony Forming Units (CFUs) to quantify biofilm, they were using crystal violet staining. We therefore decided to share our protocols and agreed to give guidance to each other while carrying out these protocols. We think our collaboration with WPI was particularly impactful for our project as we used both biofilm assays to characterize the formation of S. mutans biofilm and then compared them to see which one was more efficient across different metrics.
We concluded that CFUs seemed more accurate and more quantifiable, where the staining method was a lot more easier and cheaper to carry out. We realized that to determine if there was a reduction in biofilm growth or not, a staining procedure was probably sufficient enough. We made a biofilm assay protocol manual, with both methods explained. We hope that future iGEM teams can use this manual and determine which technique works better for their project."
