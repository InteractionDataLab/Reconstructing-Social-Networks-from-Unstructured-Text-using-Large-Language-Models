Extracellular Polymeric Substance Matrix
Overview
All wet lab experiments are hosted at the University of Lethbridge Chemistry and Biochemistry department. The lab itself is a Containment Level One which “requires no special design features beyond those suitable for a well-designed and functional laboratory. Containment is achieved through the use of practices normally employed in a basic microbiology laboratory.” - Public Health Agency of Canada
(http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/permits/inspection/index-eng.php)
Other precautions are taken to further provide a safe work environment for team members. Prior to any lab work students are required to come in lab-appropriate attire meaning long pants and closed toed shoes and tied-back long hair. Further equipment is given to the student for extra protection such as lab coats, safety glasses, and gloves. All labs at the University of Lethbridge is equip with fire extinguishers, emergency showers, eye wash stations, and first aid kits in case of dire situations. WHMIS training is provided to all students before any wet lab experiments, and advisor supervision is provided at all times to further ensure safety.
To address biosafety, the University of Lethbridge has a Risk and Safety Services committee tasked with ensuring a safe work environment is upheld by all labs within the institution. The goal of the committee is to “... educate, mentor, foster and grow an environment to all members of the University of Lethbridge community where each accepts an individual and shared responsibility in growing a culture that is rich in the assessment , management and control of risk and safety.” - U of L Risk and Safety Services.
(http://www.uleth.ca/risk-and-safety-services/)
The Risk and Safety committee is aware of Lethbridge High School iGEM and of our project. They support our work as long as we follow the Laboratory Safety Guidelines outlined by Health Canada: Public Health Agency of Canada.

In terms of organisms, we worked with Bees (Apis mellifera) and Mites (Varroa destructor), and a non-pathogenic strain of E. coli known as DH5alpha. According to the World Health organization this strain is rated as a"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Model#Cost Analysis_-_-_TEXT.html," model more accurate, especially for the lower miRNA concentrations we decreased kopen to 105, the lowest possible value in our range.
Another way to improve the lower miRNA concentrations was increasing the decay rate of just the miRNA. We had assumed it decayed at the same rate as the other RNAs in our system. Increasing just the miRNA decay rate had similar effect to decreasing kopen.
With our initial parameters our model was a poor representation of our system. Once we updated our parameters, it was able to represent our results relatively well.
Stochastic model
The Oxford iGEM team kindly ran stochastic simulations of system for us. They ran both intrinsic and extrinsic simulations and provided us with the final uncertainties.
Intrinsic Simulation
Intrinsic stochastic models find the uncertainty caused by the changes in reaction rate due to the fact reactants collide randomly. This is more accurate than mass action kinetics for low reactant concentrations.
For our stochastic simulation, each time step a reaction rate was determined randomly using the Poisson distribution. As this is random, multiple stochastic simulations have to be run for a large enough sample size. A time step of 0.01 seconds was used.
The intrinsic simulations gave an uncertainty of only 0.0096%. This validated our use of mass action kinetics to model our system. As the intrinsic uncertainty is negligible we could assume rate of reaction was proportional to concentration of the reactants, i.e. the law of mass action.
While we later updated the parameters with our experimental data, the concentration of reactants did not decrease to invalidate this result.
Extrinsic Simulation
Extrinsic stochastic models find the uncertainty cause by the uncertainty of our parameters. The extrinsic uncertainty is by far the more significant of the two uncertainties in our model.
The extrinsic simulation assumes our parameters were normally distributed and runs multiple simulations randomly choosing parameter values.
The specific conclusions of our extrinsic simulations, such as the test being complete in 37 minutes in 90% of cases, are unfortunately no longer useful after our experimental results showed some of our starting parameters were significantly off. However, the extrinsic simulation demonstrated that biggest weakness with our model was our parameter's uncertainties.
Cost model
There's two parts to our cost modeling; the cost analysis which works out the cost of the test, and the much more impressive screening cost-effectiveness model that works out the value of rolling out a screening programme.
Our screening programme's cost per quality year of life gained would be just be £8300 at the current lowest threshold for lung cancer screening, and taking into account cancer recurrence. Treatments under £20,000 per quality year"

Der modulare Aufbau der neuen biologischen Systeme ist das Kernstück der Synthetischen Biologie und des iGEM Wettbewerbs. Die biologischen Systeme werden aus einzelnen genetischen Bausteinen, den sogenannten BioBricks. aufgebaut. Ähnlich wie LEGO Steine können die genetischen Bausteine miteinander zu neuen Kombinationen verknüpft werden. Für den iGEM Wettbewerb können die Studententeams aus der Registry of Standard Biological Parts, vergleichbar mit einer großen Kiste unterschiedlichster LEGO Steine, verschiedene BioBricks auswählen. Der Kreativität der Studenten sind dabei fast keine Grenzen gesetzt. Die Studententeams haben ein halbes Jahr Zeit, um mit Hilfe bestehender oder selbst entworfener BioBricks innovative Forschungsprojekte aus dem Themengebiet der Synthetischen Biologie umzusetzen.  Die Wettbewerbsbeiträge sind ganz unterschiedlicher Natur. Während sich die einen mit Umweltfragen auseinandersetzen, bauen die anderen hochsensible Biosensoren, andere wiederum beschäftigen sich mit tiefgreifenden medizinischen Problemen. Anfang November präsentieren die einzelnen Teams ihre Ergebnisse auf dem großen Finale am Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. Die [Universität] stellt erneut ein iGEM-Team. Dieses Jahr setzt es sich mit [kurze Beschreibung des eigenen Projekts]. Wer mehr über das ambitionierte Projekt erfahren möchte, kann sich am 25. August 2012 zwischen [Anfangszeit] und [Endzeit] Uhr am Informationsstand am [Ort des Informationsstandes] informieren. Neben dem persönlichen Austausch, gibt es umfangreiches Informationsmaterial und [Platz für spezielle Angebote vor Ort].
Der deutschlandweite iGEM Aktionstag findet in ausgewählten Städten Deutschlands statt. Die jeweiligen Teams informieren über Synthetische Biologie, iGEM und die Projekte der jeweiligen ortsansässigen Teams.

Ghost Sensor
In order to detect large molecules such as protein, we use bacterial ghost technique to make tunnels through inner and outer membrane while at the same time keep periplasmic space intact.
In the second part, we want to detect and destroy a small molecule called atrazine, which is an herbicide that can cause flu-like symptoms when it contaminates drinking water.

New LegoRoboBrick, called MU (Movement Utility)
We will introduce another new LegoRoboBrick called MU which stands for Movement Utility. MU will be used to move 96 well plates and Petri Dishes to different pre-specified locations.
Single-Master-Multiple-Slave synchronization
We will need to extend our Master and Slave Synchronization Model to allow for 2 or 3 Slaves. We can define more messages, and will need to figure out a smart way to allow 2-way messaging between a Master and multiple Slaves
Support User Defined LegoRoboBricks
Version 2.0 is designed with User Collaboration in mind. With the single-master-multiple-slave synchronization, we will support user defined LegoRoboBricks. Users are encouraged to extend the functionality of their ‘bots’ by creating and sharing new LegoRoboBricks.
Support pipetting between individual tubes and 96-well plates
It is tedious to pipette restriction enzymes, ligase, DNA, water, and  buffer from individual tubes into a 96-well plate, so V2.0 would allow  for this possibility by allowing for specific tube holders in the chassis.
Support pipetting between two 96-well plates
Ideally an experimenter will be able to transfer DNA, etc. between  96-well plates.  If Plate A has Restriction Enzyme A, Plate B has  Restriction Enzyme B, Plate C has restriction enzyme buffer, Plate D has  water, and Plate E has DNA, all five components could be easily  transfered to a new plate to perform a high throughput restriction digest.
Support pipetting of 12 tips simultaneously
Currently there are only 4 pipette tips used in V1.0, so adding more  tips to make 12 total would allow for pipetting entire rows between  96-well plates and speed up the entire pipetting process.

Target of evaluation
In the part of system analysis, we have talked about the influence of promoter strengths and plasmid copy numbers to initial steady states and expression level of gene elements after sensing nicotine. The goal of our project is to detect nicotine and transform nicotine to more valuable chemicals, so it is necessary to evaluate the performance of sensing system like threshold and timeliness. Besides, because part of nicotine is degraded to 6-Hydroxynicotine which is out of the pathway of 3-Succinoyl-Pyridine metabolism, we need to calculate the rate of nicotine transformed to the target product. Parameter sweep provides us appropriate parameter intervals for system design, so effectiveness analysis is based on these parameter settings (s2 = 0.5, s1 = 0.5, plamid1 copy number =10, plasmid2 copy number = 10). We mainly focus on the threshold of sensor, time point suitable for fluorescence measurement, the recycle rate and the relationship between nicotine input, promoter1 strength and these three properties.
Threshold of sensing system
The usage of sensing system is to detect the existence and concentration of nicotine in the medium, so it has its own detection limit. Besides, in consideration of the complexity of the system, its sensitivity to nicotine input may vary a lot with different concentration of nicotine input. The combination of parameters is another important factor in the discussion of threshold and sensitivity because both low nicotine input and low expression of Vppa leads to inadequate 6-Hydroxynicotine to release the hdnoR repression of GFP signal.
Figure 1 GFP with s1, nicotine input
Figure 2 GFP heat-map
The nicotine input we set is within the interval of [1e-5,1] M and the strength of promoter in is within [0,1]. To get the full vision of GFP change along the time span, the simulation runs for 200000 s. From figure 1 and figure 2, we find that the maximal GFP concentration ranges from 0 to about 2000 nM with the increase of nicotine input. However, the strength"
Nagahama,2015,Team:Nagahama#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," malicious mis-uses.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available? Does your project currently include any design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design any new features to minimize risks? (For example: auxotrophic chassis, physical containment, etc.) Such features are not required for an iGEM project, but many teams choose to explore them.
In our project, we have used E. coli JM109 strain, a derivative of E. coli K-12 strain encoding auxotrophy, which cannot grow in natural field. In future use, other organisms that produce more antibacterial fragrances naturally and have more tolerance to the fragrances, will be engineered to produce more antibacterial fragrances. The engineered organisms will be used under supplication of required nutrition, so they cannot grow outside the Flavorater. The Flavorater have the risk that the engineered organisms grow in food. We must need to separate them from food area by packing or separating with membrane filters that the engineered organisms cannot pass through. Only fragrances should be dispersed into food area. This approach will decrease the risk of food contamination by engineered organisms. We have introduced the marA into E. coli to make the host more tolerant to antibacterial fragrances. The marA also enhanced the engineered E. coli more resistant to antibiotics as a side-effect. When we use other organisms that originally have more tolerance to the antibacterial fragrances, the marA need not be transformed to the engineered organisms, resulting no change of resistance against antibiotics."

Introduction
About 150 species of prokaryotes (well studied examples are cyanobacteria and halophilic archaea) in aquatic habitats have been shown to contain gas vesicles. These gas vesicles provide cells with bouyancy, there function is either to positioning the bacterium (in water) in order to get the right amount of oxygen or the right amount of light. Gas vesicles are made exclusively of proteins and contain gas. When gas vesicles are present in a cell, the overall density of that cell is lowered and the cell becomes bouyant.
We want to utilize this bouyancy for an application like for example separation of specific molecules or specific cells.
Gas vesicles are hollow proteinous organelles made of gvpA and gvpC (in cyanobacteria) and are permeable to gases and fills by diffusion. It is impermeable to water because of its hydrophobic inside. GvpA is a small 70AA long protein which forms a linear crystalline array"

After confirmation by sequencing, the reconstructed plasmid pET23b/INP-N-GFP-MC was transformed into E. coli BL21 DE3. pET23b plasmid without any exogenous gene was used as the control.
Mercury Selectivity Detection with the E. coli GFP-MC Sensor
For mercury detection, the E. coli BL21 DE3 containing the recombinant plasmid was cultured in LB medium until OD600 = 1.3. All cells were harvested and washed twice with 0.85% NaCl. Finally, cells were re-suspended in 0.85% NaCl. Solutions of Hg2+ and Cu2+ (1–10 μL) of different concentrations were mixed with the bacteria. The reaction system was added to a final volume of 1 mL and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. For fluorescence determination, 300 μL liquid from each sample was tested using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, USA). The excitation wavelength was 488 nm, and the emission wavelengths were in the range of 500 to 600 nm. Emission and excitation of the slit was 5 nm.
SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis of the Displayed Fusion Protein
The cells were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 mg/L) with overnight shaking at 37°C. After 1/100 dilution in LB medium, the cultures were grown until OD600 = 1.3. E. coli BL21 cells expressing INP-N-GFP-MC fusion were harvested, according to the cell fractionation method described by Yang et al. Samples of total cell lysate, soluble fraction, and membrane fraction were mixed with a loading buffer and boiled for 10 min. Samples were analyzed on SDS-PAGE using 12% (w/v) acrylamide and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Pre-stained molecular weight markers were used to estimate protein molecular weights. Western blot analysis was performed according to the method described by Wei et al. The first antibody was His-tag and the second antibody was goat anti mouse.

That fact can hamper the entire planning and research process. It is sometimes tiresome to gather all necessary information – if they exist at all. A well-defined description that contains all relevant information and that all participants have to stick to would improve the usability of the Parts Registry greatly. Users of the Registry could focus more intensely on the research itself. Therefore, the standard facilitates the working process and might boost the acceptability and usage of the Registry.
Since this standard can only be successful if all users of the Parts Registry consider it helpful, our team conducted an online survey and invited all of this year’s iGEM teams to participate. To the very end more than 55 teams – more than 25% of all teams – took part in our survey. Our initial assumptions were supported and our team decided to formulate a Request For Comment (RFC).
Please read on to find more detailed information on our survey, the unique Bavarian collaboration medal, the participants, the results and the RFC.
The Survey: Integrating community opinions...
The presented survey aims to verify whether there exists a need for better BioBrick part descriptions (question 4 ), whether it is believed that standardization of part descriptions could help to improve the situation (questions 5) and if the iGEM community is interested in testing a template for standardized part descriptions as presented by our team (question 6). The last two questions (question 7 and 8) were intended to collect useful ideas how to improve our first blueprint of a standardized BioBrick part description template.
The survey can be found under: iGEM TU Munich's survey on standardization of BioBrick part descriptions
Outline data of the survey:
Start of the survey: 14th September 2012
End of the survey: 20th September 2012
Number of participants: 147 people participated in the survey; thereof 78,9% (116 participants) completed the survey
Number of involved teams: 55
Distribution channels: The survey was sent to all contact addresses of iGEM Teams from this year, posted on iGEM 2012's Community Page and posted on our as well on the iGEM Headquarters twitter account .

BioBrick extraction for testing promoters and RBS in B.subtillis
The primers for inducible B.subtillis promoters have been ordered. Meanwhile, we would like to be able to compare the RBS and promoter strengths in E.coli and B.subtillis, using GFP fluorescence to quantify gene expression.
We attempted to isolate 4 BioBricks: I13522 (GFP under constitutive promoter), E0040 (GFP only), R0040 (a promoter), & B0034 (an E.coli RBS). So far, only the former two, extracted from 2007 wells, grew after transformation. Single-colony PCR was used to test the transformants.

Team Introduction
Coming from all around the world, 15 members of CIEI-China gathered together out of their passion towards synthetic biology. During this marvelous journey, we have encountered massive challenges, and with the help of our instructors, Ms. Zhang and Ms. Qu, we conquered all of the difficulties, and improved ourselves unbelievably. We hope that our efforts in designing and producing this new type of salt-resistance yeast will eventually turn into practical application in protecting our environment from the bad effects of food waste, save more energy and finally improve our life qualities.

Qi He
I’m Qi He, a year-11 student in Hun School Of Princeton. school. When I was taking biology in year-10, the knowledge of this subject amazed me. One of the topics that impressed me the most was the fact that gene is passed from generations to generations, which inspired me so much. As a member of the human practice group, my job was to interview as much as organizations which are related to our project. As a designer, I would like to use my art skill to design a symbol to show the spirit of our team.

2015 InterLab Study
Introduction
The 2015 UCLA iGEM Team is proud to participate in the Second International InterLab Measurement Study in synthetic biology. As members of the synthetic biology community, we are committed to providing robust data for development of novel characterization methods in the rapidly growing biological design fields of synthetic biology. The purpose of the 2015 InterLab study is to ""measure and characterize fluorescence data for three specific genetic devices"" expressing GFPmut3b (SwissProt: P42212) from active iGEM teams participating around the world. By collecting fluorescence data from multiple teams in absolute units, variability in measurement and consistency of data collected from instrumentation following a uniform procedure can be determined within a high degree of accuracy.  This notebook will record all protocols, daily experiments, basic parameters and images, as well as the raw data used to prepare the Interlab Worksheet, Protocol, and Wiki page for submission at the 2015 Giant Jamboree.
Experimental Design
Three separate genetic ""devices"" were constructed using IDT gBlocks Gene Fragments synthesis, in addition to positive control BBa_I20270 (Constitutive Family Promoter J23151 inserted upstream of the promoter MeasKit) and negative control BBa_R0040 (pTetR - empty control plasmid). All gBlocks were designed on Benching to simulate the sequence of the BioBricks standard assembly product, for uniformity in measurement with teams that opted for RFC10 standard assembly. All devices were subcloned in the standard pSB1C3 (chloramphenicol resistance marker) backbone and transformed into BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli . As such, E. coli BL21(DE3) laboratory strains were used as the chassis for fluorescent measurement. Details as to the location of the registry pieces used to construct the devices are below:

2.3 Detection of the target
2.3.1 Transformation test
The final detector being extracted, the probe had to be activated before detection.
Activation corresponds to a quadruple digestion of the probe: BmtI, BglII, Nb.bspQI and Nt.btsI successively. This step is essential to open a single-strand window in the detector probe, which is then able to welcome the target (see figure 4). If there is any non digested plasmid, it will be transformed and considered as false positive, reducing the specificity of the analysis.
Detector was digested 4 times and cleaned up (PureLink Quick PCR Purification Kit by Thermo Fisher Scientific) to remove the top strand of the probe. Efficiency of our detector was check with pure target.
Figure 15: Plates with colonies of DH5a transformed with detector plasmid+target.  A-1= mass ratio detector:target 1:0, 4 colonies. B-1= ratio 1:1, 100 colonies. C-1= ratio 1:2, 200 colonies. A-2, B-2, C-2 are zooms of A-1, B-1 and C-1 plates.
Results lead to conclude that the detector is efficient. The number of colonies for plate without target (A) is 4, while more than 100 colonies are present when the target is added in excess (C), meaning the detector succeeded to bind the target, with a low number of false positive.
About those false positive colonies, the main hypothesis is that BmtI and BglII did not digest all the detector (J04450+probe). Maybe a use of high-fidelity (HF) enzymes would be profitable because they have the advantage to be exempt from star activities, giving freedom to let them digest longer.
2.3.2 Confirmation by sequencing
Since bacterial transformation does not display full indications of what really happened, sequencing was done to verify the binding of the single strain target to the detector. Two colonies of each previous plate (figure 15) were picked up and cultivated, to extract DNA, which is then sequenced thanks to a unique forward primer (VF2 - see figure 9) that binds close to the insertion site of the target.

Tp901.1
The construction containing Tp901.1 is available on GenBank there , accession number KC529324.
Description
The site-specific recombination system of temperate lactococcal bacteriophage TP901-1 integrase mediates site-specific recombination system. Originally from temperate lactoccocal bacteriophage TP901-1, this is a serine-type integrase able to invert, integrate or excise a DNA fragment according to the position and orientation of its specific recognition sites, attB and attP. This process is directional and definitive because of the transformation of attB and attP into attL and attR during recombination.
The 180° switch permits to design a lot of regulation tools, such as logical gates that can be found on our wiki .

The inaugural year of Cardiff iGEM has been an excellent learning experience. There is no doubt that next year we will be in a much stronger position to succeed in all aspects of the our project. We have already set the wheels in motion for a Cardiff_Wales iGEM 2017.
Therefore what did we specifically learn from this years iGEM project?
We would likely use the different pSB1C3 antibiotic resistance variants instead of the three distinct plasmids we chose to use (pSB1C3, pET16B, pCOLA-DUET). This would improve the control of copy number and help maintain uniform expression of our constructs. We were unaware of the different pSB1C3 variants due to our focus on cloning biobricks into the registry-compliant chloramphenicol resistant pSB1C3.
A number of our primers did not work as predicted and meant that we often couldn't inspect our transformed cultures without using direct sequencing. Next time we will set more time and resources to checking all our primers work appropriately, although within the time-scale of a ten-week project this can be challenging as by the time you realise there is a problem, the project has significantly progressed.

Identification of LigA
The gel bands of SDS-PAGE for His-tag purified LigA were analysed by MALDI-TOF MS and the comparison with the Swiss-Prot database clearly identified the purified protein as LigA (Figure 18, Table 2). As it is reported in literature the majority of LigA usually occurs in its adenylated form after extraction from E. coli. An indication for this is the double band on the right edge of Figure 18. The proteins in both gel bands were identified as LigA from E. coli suggesting that gel band 3 is the adenylated form and gel band 4 is the deadenylated form.

The cleared lysate from <partinfo>BBa_K525710</partinfo> overexpressing E. coli KRX cells was loaded on a HisTrap™ FF crude column (1 mL), the protein was eluted with 100 mM imidazole and collected in 1 mL fractions.

Based on the studies of Dacheng et al., we were able to propose the construction of our programmable and guide system activated by light named LAsCE (Light-activated SplitCas9 Efector) represented in figure 2.

Ligation of the C-terminal domain of cas 9 with the CRY2 protein and the N-terminal domain of the CIB1 protein. When the light stimulates the cells, the proteins CRY2 and CIB1 will join allowing the junction of the domains of split Cas9.
We used two software to find targets and design the gRNAs. We were capable to create a list of possibilities for the kill switch. Using the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and CHOPCHOP (CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN web tool for genome editing), we model the sequences in figure 3 . The sequences were chosen to B. subtilis due to the issues we had to work with L. lactis. We decided to build and test the system first in an easier chassis to handle with, and then move it to L. lactis.

Hauptpunkte der Podiumsdiskussion:
Das Internet ist die Hauptquelle, um Informationen über Synthetische Biologie zu erhalten, aber Medien haben einen starken Einfluss den Fokus auf dieses Thema zu lenken. Häufig haben Artikel provokative Überschriften.
Synthetische Biologie ist in der Gesellschaft noch nicht sehr bekannt, daher wollen Leute auch nicht mehr Informationen, aber Leute mit direkten Kontakt (z.B. Bauern) erhalten gute Unterstützung.
In Deutschland gibt es noch kein Bedürfnis nach genetisch verändertem Getreide. Firmen, wie die KWS, akzeptieren diese Ansicht.
Genetisch veränderte Medikamente sind akzeptierter als genetisch verändertes Getreide, weil keiner in Europa hungern muss, aber Medikamente eine wichtigere Rolle spielen.
Ein Label ""mit Gentechnik"" auf Produkte sollte nur in die Praxis umgesetzt werden, wenn...
.... Leute diese Kennzeichnung wirklich wollen.
.... die Produkte reelle Risiken darstellen, ansonsten würde eine weitere Kennzeichnung in einen Zertifikatsdschungel führen.
Es sollte nicht nur eine Kennzeichnung geben, um die Produkte zu brandmarken, sondern wirklich eine Gefahr bestehen, wenn dieses Symbol angewendet wird.
Produkte sollten dann aber auch mit einem Label ""mit Pestiziden"" gekennzeichnet werden, weil diese gefährlicher sind.
Es ist nicht jedem möglich, toxische Gene zu bestellen, weil die DNA-Synthese-Firmen ihre Kunden kontrollieren.

With the minimized structure, the system of solvent and ions around the protein are equilibrated to become orientated about the protein solute at the same temperature, by an isothermal-isochoric ensemble[17]. Pressure is then applied using an isobaric-isochoric ensemble, thereby ensuring that the system reaches a proper density[18].  Our energy minimized structure shows a decrease from -6.75E+05, to a maximum energy plateau for the system of -1.05 E+06 after 1238 ps of minimization time. The temperature of the system quickly reaches the target value of 300 K remaining stable, with an average temperature of 299.82 K, the equivalent of 27 °C over the 100 ps equilibration. Over the course of the 100 ps equilibration stage, both the pressure and density of the system averages 0 bar and 1015.19 Kg m-3.  This is close to the experimental value of 0 bar and 1000 Kg m-3 and the equivalent of Earth’s atmospheric pressure at sea level and the density of water. The pressure fluctuations are consistent with the applied isothermal-isobaric ensemble and is suggestive of compatible molecular dynamics conditions for simulations of βHACdH"

We were then able to move into heat testing of all 12 DNA2.0 chromoproteins with FLAG lumino his-tags. We pipetted 3 µl of extracted protein into each well and then let dry and added another 3 µl as seen in Figure 22. Once this was dry we placed it into the oven that was preheated at 20 °C. We then began raising the temperature a degree C at a time until all 12 chromoproteins had lost their color Figure 16. This process took an hour and the temperature was raised from 20 °C to 60 °C over this time period. The chromoprotein and the temperature it lost its color at is: PrancerPurple (55 °C), CupidPink (47 °C), TinselPurple (48 °C), VixenPurple (50 °C), MaccabeePurple (55 °C), SeraphinaPink (47 °C), LeorOrange (57 °C), ScroogeOrange (56 °C), BlitzenBlue (60 °C), DreidelTeal (Not colored in this experiment so no color changed observed), DonnerMagenta (55 °C), VirginiaViolet (53 °C). The chromoproteins were then taken out of the oven and rehydrated with 3 µl of milliQ water and they regained color Figure 23. We then added a second set of wells with chromoproteins by again pipetting 3 µl into a well, letting it dry and adding another 3 µl to the well. We tested the previously tested chromoproteins against the newly pipetted chromoproteins to see if the temperature change would occur at a different temperature once a chromoprotein has already been heated. We placed these chromoproteins into a 40 °C oven and raised the temperature by a degree C over 6 minutes up to 60 °C. The chromoproteins all lost their color again and lost their color at the same temperature as before and compared to the already once heat tested chromoproteins. We then again rehydrated all 12 chromoproteins with 3 µL of milliQ water and the color came back. This test shows a reversible color change for all 12"

A Functional Proof of Concept for the Baltimore BioCrew's BioBrick Device
Based upon our rigorous research efforts, our proof of concept is based upon the meticulous construction of our BioBricks, one of which being the BioBrick for the lipase gene (BBa_K2187001). This BioBrick serves to replace MHETASE, a distinguishing enzyme which gives Ideonella sakaiensis it’s renowned plastic-degrading properties. The other enzyme that fulfills and progresses this property is called PETASE, which we substituted with the Chlorogenate Esterase gene (BBa_K2187001).
With the 2 known plastic-degrading enzymes of Ideonella sakaiensis being substituted with our BioBricks, which serve identical functions, our team believes that this is enough to prove that our genetic modification will work.
We know that Lipase and Chlorogenate Esterase will serve to replace the 2 genes that are unable to physically acquire, so with this is mind, we used the predetermined Prefix/Suffix, Promoter, RBS, and Terminator to build our BioBricks off of. Once we had the forward and reverse primers included into our gene sequence, we had the complete set of nucleotides with all fulfilled requirements; with this, we used these BioBricks and transformed them into E. coli cells through a plasmid. The antibiotic resistance segregated our transformed cells, and with this, our E. coli cells should be capable of expressing the said enzymes that instigate the decomposition of PET and MHET plastics.
From transforming our E. coli cells to express our MHETASE and PETASE substitutes, we are hopeful that our results are in accordance with our hypothesis."

In addition, the growth rate curve of toxin 136 shows that the performance of antitoxin is not as good as others, thus we only focus on toxin 134,1204 and 6429. The maximums of growth rate is slightly affected by the toxin of aTc, but it will do not change the discussion above.

(The upper figure illustrates the construction of the second set of membrane scaffold. We cloned the BLF1- and BLF2-scaffold genes into pCDFDuet-1 vector to obtain optimal expression.)
This activity can be detected by commercial β-lactamase testing strips, which are widely used strips in China initially designed to detect the residence of β-lactamase in drinking milk. One mechanism of these strips are based on immune colloidal gold and we chose it because of its high sensitivity, robustness and relatively low cost.

Detect thrombin using membrane scaffold FA and FB
We expressed the first set of membrane scaffolds with split EGFP fragments FA and FB fused to the periplasmic end. Then we tested the function of our membrane scaffolds by adding two sets of aptamers with different linker length. The concentration of thrombin in the solution was adjusted to 0.2nM. 29-mer aptamer and 15-mer aptamer efficiently induced dimerization of membrane scaffolds (Figure C, D versus A) and led to green fluorescence emission under confocal microscopy.
(Fluorescence with or without aptamers. BL21 competent cells were co-transformed with FA, FB and protein E. When the OD-600 value reached 0.4, 0.4% was added to induce the expression of protein E. 2h later cells were harvested and washed two times with PBS. 5µL of bacteria were resuspended in 200 µL PBS, and a final concentration of 0.2nM thrombin was added to the solution. Different aptamers were also included in this point. The reaction system was incubated with shaking in room temperature for 30 min and then green fluorescence was viewed under confocal microscopy. Only very weak green fluorescence was visible when no aptamers were added to the reaction system (A).

Tried PCR using new forward primer #2, reverse primer #1, and cage with his-tag template. Saw no product whatsoever, just like last time using forward primer #2. Thus, we should probably scrap this primer and not use it for further experiments.
Meeting Notes: Sri suggested that for all PCRs with extensions, we should first use a low melting temp (55-60C) for the first 5 cycles. Then alternate between 72 and 98C for about 20 cycles. The 72C time will function as both the annealing and extension time. He also recommended that we dilute the template DNA, as a concentration that is too high can affect annealing temperature. He said the dNTP and primer concentrations should be kept the same as the normal Q5 protocol. He said we should start with 1 ng per reaction and do 10-fold dilutions to optimize the template concentration.
We will try another gradient PCR for the first 5 rounds, followed by a two-step reaction. According to NEB, the annealing/extension time may be kept the same as the usual 20-30 seconds per kb. The reaction will be started today and ran on a gel tomorrow.

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," of their large-scale impact on various ecosystems.  The bacteriocins in Bacto-Aid are incorporated between the silk proteins and are in theory unable to move, but they will have contact with the blood vessels. We do not have any research on whether or not they could detach and travel with the blood stream and cause an unwanted effect (i.e. immuneresponses) in the human body, e.g. cross the blood-brain barrier or affect the hormonal balance.
Besides the possible biological damage to patients, there are also possible economical and social damages. Social injustice could potentially be increased since Bacto-Aid and bacteriocins most likely will be more expensive than traditional antibiotics at first. The production price of bacteriocins are lower than the production price of traditional antibiotics, but the sales price will probably be higher due to cost and demand. The pharmaceutical companies that produce the bacteriocins also have to pay for FDA approval and the clinical trials, and these costs have to be earned back when the sales begin. This could potentially lead to a greater distance between the high and low economic classes of the society. It is also likely that the access will be limited at first until the production has been effected enough for the cost to decrease.
Bacteriocins as therapeutics is not thoroughly researched yet and like all new pharmaceutical drugs being tested there is a lack of knowledge about the long term consequences. The biggest problem seems to be that we do not have much research on the effect in vivo. Some research in the use of bacteriocins in vivo in mouse models shows promising results with antimicrobial effect and no harm of the animal. This seems to be promising news for Bacto-Aid INGHAM, Aaron, et al. The bacteriocin piscicolin 126 retains antilisterial activity in vivo.

Evry_Paris-Saclay,2018,Team:Evry Paris-Saclay#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," STRUCTURAL AND MECHANISTIC DETAILS OF phAimR AND spAimR
Analyzing peptide recognition and structural transitions
Once the structures of the AimR homologs are obtained, they can be interrogated to elucidate the molecular details of their function. This has been done in great detail in the very recently published articles (September 17th and October 15th 2018) detailing the experimental structure of spAimR (discussed here) and phAimR [2, 3]. Therefore, we decided to discuss the strategies used in this paper to elucidate the molecular details of gene regulation by AimR and propose software tools that can fill in the gaps left by the paper.
The first step is to open the protein structures in a molecular visualization tool for inspection. In this work, we found that Chimera works well and used it for all of our work but other tools exist [8]. Once the protein structures are opened, the protein structure can be interrogated in various ways to obtain more information. Firstly, since DNA is negatively charged, transcription factors tend to have positively charged patches to mediate interactions with the DNA. The electrostatic surface potential of a protein can be visualized in any molecular visualization tool and gives a clue as to where the DNA binding site can be found. Using this method, the authors have identified which amino acids are involved in DNA binding, which were experimentally confirmed afterwards  [3]. Another powerful tool for understanding the structure is simple visual inspection of the structure. By doing this, the authors saw that the interaction between the AimR monomers was mediated by a C-terminal capping helix that was interacting with its counterpart on the other monomer and that it was mainly mediated by Van Der Waals interactions [3]. Next, the structure without the peptide (apo-spAimR) was compared with the structure containing the peptide. The authors simply cocrystallized the peptide and its ligand, but this is not available for predicted AimR homologs. Instead, the predicted AimR homolog can be docked with its cognate peptide using a variety of peptide docking tools (for a review: see [12]). Once the peptide is docked, visual inspection can help the modeller decide which amino acids are involved in peptide binding and what the basis of this interaction is. The authors of the paper used this to visualize that the peptide is bound by an extensive network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts with a number of AimR amino acids, which were experimentally confirmed to be necessary for peptide binding. Incidentally, the most important amino"

Tianjin,2017,Team:Tianjin#Safty_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM16_Washington, we constructed this biosensor. To characterize this biosensor, strains of S. cerevisiae BY4742 containing the plasmid with an initial OD600 of 0.1 were grown for 24 hours in SC-URA medium at 30 degrees Celsius, and then were induced with copper sulfate. Samples in different copper concentration were tested with the fluorescent spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-2700) after 1, 6, 12, and 24 hours. This protocol was based on the experience used by Waterloo and Washington iGEM teams and amended by our team.

Fig. 4-2. The fluorescence intensity of CUP1p-yEmRFP biosensor with different Cu concentration induced
Figure 4-2 showed the relationship between fluorescence intensity with induction time and Cu concentration. With 0.1 mM CuSO4 induced, the fluorescence intensity is 2 times over a control with no induction at 1 hour. As time went on, the fluorescence intensity slightly reduced. Moreover, as the Cu concentration increased, the fluorescence intensity decreased, and when the concentration reached 1 mM, the intensity was close to the control group. This might be due to the higher copper ion concentration influences the transcription, expression and even growth of yeast.
This result will be useful for teams who will use the parts (BBa_K2165004) & (BBa_K2407012) to build an effective Cu-induced biosensor in budding yeast. We noticed that this result is a little different with works done by Waterloo team. It may be due to the differences between Cu ion’s concentration and yeast species. However, we both verified the possibility of building a biosensor based on CUP1 promoter in yeast.
This result was provided for modeling of this biosensor and try to find a proper function to accurately describe the response procedure. Click here to see more information.
PARTS IMPROVEMENT
The Cu-induced promoter CUP1 promoter is a previous BioBrick used by iGEM16_Washington, iGEM16_Waterloo, and other iGEM teams. However, the detailed characterization like what we did this year hasn't been shown on iGEM parts page. Moreover, this part hasn’t be improved by any means or in any way. Under this situation, we plan to work on this promoter to improve its sensitivity and response peak, reduce the leakage expression, and create new parts for future work.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," efficiency of solar panels is still relatively low. With our MLAs the efficiency of the solar panels will be increased, which make our product useful for them. There are several different types of relationships we can have with the customers. First of all, it is possible to have a buyer-supplier relationship. It is, for example, also possible to have a licensor/licensee relation. Then our company gives permission to an external party to manufacturer the MLAs by themselves. This could be a solar panel manufacturer, but also a manufacturer of traditional MLAs that is willing to change its production method to a more environmental friendly method.
Cost Structure
The most important expenses of our company are probably manufacturing costs. After all, the production of the MLAs will be a substantial part of the total costs. These expenses consist of among other things costs for raw materials, depreciation costs, etc. Furthermore, especially in the beginning, R&D costs will be relatively large. It is expected that the distribution costs also will be significantly since it is important to transport the MLAs carefully. Since the company is a Business to Business company, the costs of marketing are expected to be relatively small. When our company beside a manufacturer also becomes a licensor, the legal costs will be significant as well.
Revenue Streams
Our primary route to market could be direct selling. The direct sales business model means that we will directly sell our product to the manufacturers of solar panels. Another interesting business model is the subscription model that aims to secure the customer on a long term contract, so that they are using our product well into the future. This model is especially interesting when we have one or a very limited number of customers. It will guarantee revenues for a long period of time and at the same time it could guarantee them to have a unique selling point for a long period of time.
When we become a licensor, we can have different types of leasing revenues as well. For example, it is possible to agree with the customer that they will pay a fixed amount of money per time period. It is also possible that they will pay a price per produced MLA or per sold solar panel.
Finally, we could apply for grants. For example, many governments support environmentally friendly energy projects and also the TU Delft has multiple grants.

Solar panel manufacturers
To develop a successful product, it is important to know what the needs of your customers are. Therefore, we have interviewed 4 solar panel manufacturers, respectively three German companies and one Dutch company. To do this, we have developed a standardized questionnaire, that you can find here .

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi.

However the presence of sinR is needed to aggregate with another protein called slrR to perform other regulatory functions. In our case the inhibition of cell motility genes is regulated by this aggregation. So knocking out the sinR would also result in the impossibility to repress cell motility, which is required for good biofilm formation. So instead of making a sinR knock-out, the sinR antirepressor slrR was overexpressed constitutively. This was done by making the biobrick BBa_K1597004, which consists of the slrR gene with strong promoter BBa_K090504 and a strong RBS BBa_K780001 in front of it as seen in figure 3c.
a) Biofilm operons eps, bslA and tapA-sipW-tasA get repressed by abrB and Spo0A. b) Biofilm operons eps, bslA and tapA-sipW-tasA get derepressed, by abrB repressor knock out. c) Biofilm operons eps, bslA and tapA-sipW-tasA get derepressed as sinR is repressed by slrR. d) Biofilm operons eps, bslA and tapA-sipW-tasA get derepressed by abrB knock out and by repressing sinR with slrR.
thrC locus and our integration vector
Since the tasA and bslA genes were already in the amyE locus, another site for our biobrick with the slrR gene had to be found. abrB doesn’t need an integration vector because it is a knockout of a gene which is in the genome of the B. subtilis.We selected the thrC locus for the overexpression of the slrR gene. The BBa_K823023 integration vector from Munich 2012 was modified by replacing their amyE locus with a thrC locus from pdg1664. Also the chloramphenicol resistance gene was replaced by an erythromycin resistance gene which also came from pdg1664. The integration vector we created is called BBa_K1597001. Via this integration vector we were able to put the slrR biobrick BBa_K1597004 in the thrC locus.

Aachen,2017,Team:Aachen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," these ions in our integrated HP section. Potassium contamination is discussed in the section about the Werra while details about       problems with sulphate can be found in the interviews at the municipal and chemical wastewater treatment plants.
Following the input we got from these cooperations we decided to identify possible channels for alteration to increase the accumulation of potassium and sulphate.
AtAKT1
We identified AtAKT1 as a promising gene to increase the potassium accumulation. AtAKT1 is a potassium channel originally from Arabidopsis thaliana root tissue. It mediates potassium       uptake over a wide range of potassium concentration in the extracellular room [52–55]. While there are multiple other families of transporters involved in potassium uptake, AtAKT1       specifically is a high affinity transporter in the plasma membrane [56–58]. Since sodium has a negative effect on the efficiency of AtAKT1 [59], we did not combine a sodium accumulating       mutant with this channel, but rather created a separate mutant called NAKT. Therefore, we integrated the channel in the plasma membrane of a mutant with ENA1 and NHA already knocked out. We did       this, because the genes not only mediate efflux of sodium but also transport potassium back into the extracellular room.
Compared to the system we created to accumulate sodium inside a cell, the AtAKT1 system does not struggle with the toxicity of the accumulated ions, since potassium is a nutrient and       indispensable for many physiologic functions and does not inhibit metabolism [8]. We were able to accumulate potassium in this mutant. Details can be found on our results page .
Fig.11: 2D topological structure (left) and function (right) of AtAKT1. AtAKT1 uses ATP to actively import potassium into the cytosol. CYCLN and ANKY are intracellular regulation domains.
AtSultr1;2
Since we want to increase the uptake of sulfate into the vacuoles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we decided to integrate the AtSultr1;2-gen. The gene encodes for a high-affinity sulfate transporter that naturally occurs in Arabidopsis thaliana and is expressed at epidermis and cortex of its roots [60].
AtSultr1;2 belongs to a family of sulfate transporters and due to studies with mutants the AtSultr1;2 seems to be the most important one. The mutant having a AtSultr1;1-knockout showed up a phenotype similar to the wildtype while the AtSultr"

We sought to both improve and characterize this part for future utilization in our filtration device by adding a modified lac promoter to allow for constitutive expression rather than IPTG induction within the biological system, and thus make it more applicable in the environment. We also improved the characterization of their part by testing its application for biological precipitation of iron and cadmium in addition to their copper testing to add to the functionality of the part.

Mercury Ion Test Results (I)
Zones of Inhibition Test For Mercury Resistance.
In this assay, Escherichia coli K12 expressing three different constructs were spread on agar plates to compare levels of mercury resistance. Each agar plate contained a filter disk spotted with 10µL of 0.1M HgCl2 in the middle allowing the mercury ions to diffuse throughout the media. The E. coli strain containing the modified mer operon showed comparable results to the positive control with the original pDU1358, as they both grew very closely to the filter disc. pBBRBB::GFP negative control showed growth significantly further away from the mercury disc due to its inability to detoxify mercury ions.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," lower perception threshold (Rogerset al.2016). We choose not to implement it in our design because of its more complicated mechanism that requires the implementation of more genes. Intriguingly, it works by first converting
3HPA
to acrylate via a pathway of three heterologous enzymes. The acrylate is then sensed by a transcription factor, similarly to how our sensors described above work. They also report its successful implementation and application in increasing the
3HPA
titer up to 23-fold. It is conceivable that with a little more effort our system could yield comparable results. Off cause, we have the additional benefit of having a much shorter iteration interval.
Figure 8: Biosensors for malonyl-CoA and 3-hydroxypropionate
The malonyl-CoA Sensor FapR is a dimeric protein which binds to the fapO operator, thereby inhibiting expression of the reporter gene. When malonyl-CoA is bound, the regulator dissociates from the DNA and gene expression can occur. The Sensor for 3-hydroxypropionate works reversely. In the absence of 3HPA the 3HPA sensor HpdR binds to its operator, allowing the polymerase to read the HpdR promoter.
Further product sceening
The usage of biosensors for product screening is a fast and cheap method enabling high throughput analysis of pathway libraries.   However, to further characterize the pathway variants and implemented enzymes we planned to measure enzyme activities.   In that way we can quantitatively benchmark each enzyme and establish in vitro assays as a prototyping engineering approach.  For the malonyl-CoA reductase, it is easy to measure reaction velocity, because the enzyme converts NADPH into NAD+ and both compounds have different absorbances at 345nm (De Ruyck et al. 2007) .     Based on that we designed an enzyme assay, where we use cell extract from
Mcr
producing cells or directly purified Mcr and mixed it with a defined amount of NADPH and MgCl2.   By measuring the absorbance, one can determine if NADPH concentration changes.   By adding malonyl-CoA to the reaction mix we then start the reaction and are able to observe a decrease in absorbance because the reaction consumes NADPH.   Here the starting concentrations of malonyl-CoA and NADPH have to be high enough to ensure, that nearly each Mcr molecule in the mixture is saturated and the reaction goes proportional to enzyme concentration."

There is no potential for harm to human health through use of our constructs, as described above. There is therefore no risk of malicious use.
Our constructs pose no threats to human health, as described above, and scaling up would not change this. Our project is a ""fundamental advance"" that contributes to the coordination of population-level cellular behavior by allowing messages to be sent between populations of E. coli cells. However, many additional layers of complexity in engineering would be required to use our method to enable pathogenic or otherwise dangerous behaviors in populations of cells.
The cell to cell communication project does include packaging viral particles. Although there are only some proteins of the M13 virus that are packaged and are therefore not a safety risk. M13 is not a safety risk even if its whole genome is packaged. Our project poses no threat to safety and thus we haven't implemented any of these mechanisms.
All the lab and design team members successfully passed the following safety training:
Employee Orientation Training Session
Workplace Violence and Harrassment Training
General Laboratory Safety
WHMIS
Laboratory Biosafety Training
Biosafety Guidelines followed by the Waterloo iGEM Team
University of Waterloo has a Biosafety Committee and can be found here: http://www.safetyoffice.uwaterloo.ca/hse/bio_safety/bsc.html. Although the project has not been discussed with the Biosafety Committee, it has been discussed with several faculty members and has been found to have no risks. Furthermore, the laboratories operating at the University of Waterloo have obtained permits from the Bio-Safety Committee in order to perform intended research. Since the Waterloo iGEM team performs all laboratory work in a parent lab under the guidance of the Masters and PhD students of that lab, the permits obtained by the parent lab cover the projects carried out in the lab.
Canada has very well established biosafety regulations and guidelines which can be found here

An Apeeling Solution to Panama Disease
The Issue
The banana is the most popular fruit in the world, with a whopping 160 million tons produced annually. In America, we think of the banana as a fruit, something we love but could live without. However, the same cannot be said for over 400 million people in developing countries. These individuals rely on bananas as their biggest, and sometimes, sole source of calories and nutrition. Terrifyingly enough, 7% of the world’s population could lose its sole source of food as the banana crop is being ravaged by a devastating pandemic: Panama disease.
Panama disease is caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Cubense race 4, which is deadly to the Cavendish banana. This fungus is able to first infect the roots of the plant, secreting different hydrolytic enzymes, and subsequently infect the xylem, blocking water and nutrient flow, leading to the death of the plant. Symptoms, however, are typically not visible until four months after infection, providing ample time for the fungus to spread without notice. Additionally, the fungus remains in the soil in the form of spores for up to"

Optimize The Project
Attending lecture in Peking
This year we communicated with Peking team. Because most of TUST-CHINA’s team members were freshmen for iGEM , some of us went to their school to learn some basic knowledge of synthetic biology on the end of January 2017. We also shared our experiences concerning biology and our love for sciences and practical lab work. We all cherish the opportunity to collaborate and we do have a brand new understanding of synthetic biology ,a lot of gains.
Communication with Peking
This May, we organized a meeting and invited Yihao Zhang ,the instructor of team Peking and Haoqian Zhang who have got a lot of medals in iGEM game. We introduced our project to them. The entire team was involved, and this allowed members to chat and ask questions. The level of enthusiasm from Peking team members was extremely encouraging, and we have a lot of gains again.
Five Teams Meetup
In order to meet, socialise and discuss projects , TUST China, Jilin China, NWPU, NKU China and Tianjin iGEM team had a meeting in Tianjin on August 1, 2017. We invited and encouraged other team members to look at our designs and think about how they might alter them. The level of enthusiasm from other team members was extremely encouraging, and we were very surprised by the number of questions. We were also inspired by the questions and we will do our best to improve our project. We may also cooperate with other teams in the future.

The plan is to potentially use one plate tomorrow to seed more plates for Thursday and Friday, and expand what we have in culture. We need to have a conversation with Deepak to have a concrete plan on how much we need to expand our cultures.
June 12th, 2012
To Do: 1cm plate for Deepak/ other students  both 1:6 plates appeared way under confluent on the scope (about 10% confluence) used 1:3 plate from 6/11/12 for transfections of pEXPR Hef1a:Cerulean and IGEM-BBa_K779100 (the gate i.e. the fluorophore + RNA)
June 13th, 2012
Cells are still underconfluent, and have reached a pretty high passage number (at least 30). So, we are talking about getting fresh cells from the summer, and this time making a DMSO stock so we can return to a low passage.  We performed 6 transfections in duplicate using both 1:6 plates.
June 14th, 2012
Bleached and threw out all remaining 1:3 and 1:6 plates which we were maintaining Received a frozen DMSO stock of HEK293 (without constitutive YFP) from Kenneth (1.5x 10^6 cells). Going to make more DMSO stocks on Monday.:  We thawed out the cell. Added them to 12 mL of DMEM with phenol red. Spun down at 1180 RPM for 4 minutes. Aspirated off the media / DMSO. Resuspended the cells in 12 mL of fresh DMEM. Transferred all 12 mL of culture onto a new dish.  We also observed the Zeiss data from the transfections.

Catalog for regulatory RNAs
Over the years, the number of regulatory RNAs in Part Registry has steadily increased over time and many has been made available to end users. Based on different mode actions and natures of regulatory RNAs, they can be grouped into different categories. However, the Part Registry currently does not have a catalog page, categorizing methods or guidelines to organize and curate existing regulatory RNAs. Some of them are grouped under type ""RNA"", while others are not. This is not useful for looking up and utilizing them.Over the years, the number of non-coding RNAs in Part Registry has increased steadily over time and many have been made available to end users. More than 400 entries in the Part Registry are related to RNA devices (updated 25-12-2014). Based on different mode of actions and natures of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), they can be grouped under different categories. However, the Part Registry currently does not have a catalog page, categorizing methods or guidelines to organize and curate existing ncRNAs. Some of them are simply grouped under type ""RNA"", while others are not. This is not useful for looking up and utilizing them. For example, BBa_K145013, which is a part for antisense LuxI, could be used to add an extra layer of control to the widely utilized quorum sensing Lux pathway but it has not been extensively reused. It is likely that Part Registry users are unaware of its existence because there has yet to be an information hub for ncRNA.
We would like to solve this problem by designing a list of category tags as well as a guideline, so that automated display of non-coding RNAs by the
function can be facilitated. By doing so, we hope that"

Johns_Hopkins-BAG,2009,Team:Johns Hopkins-BAG#Synthetic Yeast Genome_-_-_TEXT.html," And sure, they can light up, detect, act, react, and do all sorts of biological gymnastics that would make any biologist feel all warm and fuzzy.  However, we need a good chassis to put all these goodies in.  iGEM needs a sleek, efficient, and advanced host to showcase all the newly derived luxury, sport, and tow packages.  This is where JHU Build-A-Genome's custom Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Sc2.0 comes in.
A few liberties have been taken in removing junk DNA, and introns to see if these features are really needed.  Also, this strain of yeast has been redesigned from the ground up to act as a biological 'goal seek' to find all of the solutions to the fabled minimal genome.  The driving force for minimization is supplied by the addition of numerous loxPsym sites between genes throughout the genome.  LoxPsym sites act like couplers between train cars allowing additions, deletions, and general reordering of the yeast genes.  Cre recombinase acts on loxPsym sites and, depending on local geometry and more likely random chance, allows recombination to occur between any pair of sites.  We employ a very specialized engineered Cre-ER chemically regulated by the human sex hormone estradiol so the process can be controlled at will. (Those who attended iGEM2008 will know the JHU Team has a tradition of always inserting the word SEX into its presentations). Such genome reorganization allows for a staggering number of permutations.  Most of the genomes in this “swarm” will not survive, but the ones that do can be analyzed.  Commonalities and linkages can be drawn by what genes are commonly left behind, with which other genes, and a huge linkage map can be made.  This map can lead to the minimal genome as well as the discovery of genes related by their presence in a biological pathway.
This is an image of S. cerevisiae growing in a pseudohyphal state
An entire chromosome arm “9R” has been synthesized according to our mad scheme and successfully inserted into yeast. Moreover, the native chromosome 9R can be trashed and the cell continues to smile and happily reproduce ad infinitum. Initial testing of the Cre-ER system strongly suggests that recombination occurs when estradiol is added.  However, a more visual test is appropriate.  A FLO8 gene has been added; this gene allows yeast to grow and organize into “fuzzy” structures similar to mold, technically referred to"

In the substrate section we established that Yarrowia lipolytica constitutes a great platform for utilizing waste streams. In order to unlock the potential of Y. lipolytica, we developed a molecular toolbox which allows for efficient genetic engineering of Y. lipolytica. In this section we present the theory and results of the development of a BioBrick backbone and CRISPR tools for Y. lipolytica

pSB1A8YL - The BioBrick Plasmid
Introduction
A key part of synthetic biology is to streamline the process of engineering biological systems, by standardizing parts and methods 1 . Perhaps the most versatile standards available is the BioBrick standard, in part due to the contributions made during the annual iGEM competition. The BioBrick registry currently has over 20,000 2 BioBricks, and by creating BioBrick plasmid backbones compatible with a new organism, one is effectively unlocking the entire BioBrick registry available for that specific organism. Realizing this, it was decided to develop a plasmid that supports the BioBrick standard and replicates in Yarrowia lipolytica. Due to the convenience of manipulating Escherichia coli it was determined to develop a shuttle vector that allows for cloning and confirmation of the construct in E. coli, before the construct is transformed in Y. lipolytica. Additionally, as the only replicative plasmids currently available for Y. lipolytica are low copy yeast chromosomal plasmids (YCp) 3 our plasmid allows for high amounts of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to easily be propagated in E. coli, before the the plasmid is purified and transformed into Y. lipolytica. Figure 1 shows a suggested workflow for the proposed BioBrick plasmid.

Figure 4. CBD cipA-BMP2 protein concentration  as function of time. The concentration is dependent of the IPTG  inducer until the saturating level (IPTG=0.1 mM).
 
CONCLUSIONS
The present IPTG-inducible mathematical model,  where a fusion protein CBD cipA-BMP2 was cloned in psb1c3, can be analyzed in  two stages. First, the concentration of the IPTG inducer added to the culture  medium interacts with the repressor protein LacI following the Hill equation.  Then, the expression of CBD cipA-BMP2 becomes relieved, and at saturating  concentrations of IPTG ≥ 0.1 mM it reaches the highest value (CBD  cipA-BMP2 protein = 172.69nM, CBD cipA-BMP2 mRNA=2.21 nM).
The IPTG concentration inside E. coli is 94,845% of the total IPTG added to the culture  medium. Moreover, the phase line analysis of the ODE representing the IPTG  concentration inside E. coli as function of time showed that the equilibrium point  is stable.
The linearization of the mathematical model revealed  an stable equilibrium point for the expression of CBD cipA-BMP2 because two  negative igenvalues,

Project Pneumosensor Abstract
Figure 1. Pneumosensor Overview Diagram
Quorem-sensing peptide CSP produced by S. pneumoniae is detected by the Detection Module; the response regulator ComE links the Detection Module to the σx Promoters Module which ultimately drives the expression of GFP.
Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for approximately 1.6 million deaths every year mostly in developing countries where vaccination      is unaffordable (World Health Organization, 2014). Current methods used for diagnosis of pneumococcal diseases include X-ray imaging of chest, PCR assay using blood and Gram stain using sputum (Muench, D. F., 2014). They require sophisticated equipments, help from physicians or laboratory settings, all of which are limited to people in third world countries. To provide an affordable solution to combat pneumococcal diseases, we are engineering an E. coli ""Pneumosensor"", that will      work inside as an in vitro diagnostic device. Such a device should provide diagnosis result in absence of laboratories, medical equipments or doctors, making it more accessible for the people. Through this cheaper and easier diagnosis method, people can prepare themselves better against the      transmission and adversity of S. pneumoniae.
Pneumosensor has a rewired comCDE signal transduction pathway native to S. pneumoniae that detects     autoinducer molecules released specifically by S. pneumoniae. Upon detection of Streptococcus pneumonia, Pneumosensor will produce a fluorescence signal. Apart from that, Pneumosensor is also equipped with a new promoter, Com-Box promoter, for the specific and tight regulation of target gene expression in E. coli.

Our final example of our facilitated microfluidic workflow in action follows a fictitious researcher in synthetic biology, Dr. Ali. Dr. Ali is looking to automate and parallelize his ability to characterize a novel genetic part in terms of how cells express his reporter gene when various levels of inducer are present. The video below follows Dr. Ali through the entire process of creating a microfluidic device using the Neptune workflow, as well as controlling the chip with Neptune's parametric control hardware. This video gives a proof of concept for the entire user-interface driven design flow and also demonstrates how our control interface works in real time inconjunction with our servo-syringe control infrastructure.

Each component stores the cnModel structure of chains and trees. Related reactions are also stored. It is suggested that the constructor of a database stores template species instead of real species in this container. Only in this way can he make use of the power feature of template modeling of MoDeL.
:: Reactions: This container contains definitions of various reactions. Each component has its own compartments, reactants, modifiers, products, substituent transfers, and kinetic law. This forms a detailed description of reactions. Again, constructor of a database is suggested to store template reactions instead of real reactions.
The organizational structure of components in MoDeL is shown in the following figure.
Figure 6: Structrue of MoDeL components
As mentioned above, reference relationships are stored in most components. The following figure shows the relationship between different components, the pointer pointing to a component indicates referencing to that component.
Figure 7: Reference relationship of MoDeL components
It is worth noting that MoDeL does not attempt to include all information about each component. In PartsRegistry, a long list of data in XML format is provided including part author, status, sequence, and even group access information. Such data are redundant for our database since they are not necessary elements needed to construct reaction network. Only the useful data is retained.
Relationship with SBML
SBML(The Systems Biology Markup Language) is a machine-readable language in XML fashion. It's oriented towards describing systems where biological entities are involved in, and modified by, processes that occur over time. As a widely used model exchange standard, SBML is chosen to be the output of our auto-modeling module.
Generally speaking, MoDeL needs not to be conformed to any constraints set by SBML. However, since SBML is a widely used standard, it is better for MoDeL to share common concepts and components with SBML as many as possible. For example, MoDeL still uses rules, function definitions and unit definitions in SBML. By doing so, it will be easier for software tools to change formats between MoDeL and SBML.

BIT-China,2015,Team:BIT-China#Questions and answers_-_-_TEXT.html," time of two promoters used in our basic circuits is half an hour, according to our experiments. More importantly, by error-prone PCR, we selected plenty of promoters which have different pH responsive range and various reaction time. Therefore, we can choose different promoters relying on different regulation needs. Besides, if the regulation circuits cannot quickly react to the changes, we still have resistance system which can maintain the homeostasis of bacteria. Thus the bacteria can have an enough time to sense the change and make regulation circuits function.
Q: Have you ever considered the issues related to biosafety? Do pH Controller need suicide device?
A: Yes we considered the concern for biosafety. Two central aspects of our project may cause biosafety concerns. The first is whether the acid and alkali produced by bacteria are harmful and the second is where the pH Controller will be ‘placed’. For the first concern, D-Lactate produced by ldhA is toxic for human. But we just use it for our basic verification and test the function of our design. Its use will depends on the real fermentation situation since D-Lactate is also an important product in fermentation. What’s more, we have already found functional genes which can produce harmless L-Lactate. Except D-Lactate, most of our functional acid and alkali we used is not harmful to human, and some of them are salutary for us human beings. As for the second concern, we can ‘place’ our pH Controller in engineering strains as well as another kind of strains for co-fermentation or immobilization. In other words, where the pH Controller function is decided by the fermentation situations and regulation needs. If it is used for co-fermentation, we may apply suicide device."
SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#project-m_-_-_TEXT.html," and instead consider the flagella as being stuck directly to the wall, with one end glued to the wall and the other pointing out into the fluid.
Next step is to figure out what kind of flowfield such a pointforce creates. The flowfield created by a pointforce in a fluid with no walls or other obstructions near it can be calculated using the corresponding Green's function known as the stokeslet:
where the three indices on G represent the number of walls and their matrix-coordinates, h is the distance between the pointforce and the wall and r is the vector from the pointforce to where the flow is to be calculated.
If the pointforce is placed near a wall, modifications must be made since the flow velocity has to go to zero at the boundary (known as the no-slip condition). This is done by using the Oseen-Blake tensor. Simply described, the Oseen-Blake tensor creates a mirror image of our force on the other side of the wall, thus cancelling the flow near the wall (This is not a completely accurate description, but rather an intuitive one).
In our case the flagella are stuck to a wall, so we use the Oseen-Blake tensor.
Here R is the vector from the mirrorpoint of the force to the point where the flow is to be calculated.  The two formulas above are based on [ 8 ].  In our case the system we are trying to describe is a microtube. This means that the tube is so narrow that the forces created by the flagella are not only close to the wall to which the bacteria are stuck, but also close to the opposite wall. This presents an interesting problem. Since the Oseen-Blake tensor works by creating a mirrorpoint of the real force on the opposite side of the wall, we will need a mirrorpoint behind the other wall if we are to uphold the no-slip condition. But the mirror forces also affect the flow near the other wall. In order to cancel this effect one could create another mirrorforce, corresponding to each of the mirror forces, but of course these would obstruct each other to, requirering yet more mirror forces. In the end we decided to see how precise the system would be for one mirrorpoint behind each wall. This corresponds to taking the equation above and adding the three last terms once more, but with the mirrorvector corresponding to the other wall.
The flowfield corresponding to this is shown below.
Figure 3: All 3 images show the flowfield created by a pointforce at (0.000007,0.000007) with an angle of 45"
Alberta,2009,Team:Alberta#Project#Explore the Debate_-_-_TEXT.html," it has unpredictable outcomes (ex: modified crops wiping out other crops and causing famine), and the government must ensure that case by case we understand it and the risks are worth it.
Re: knowledge for the sake of knowledge: knowledge is not enough – we need application, and we have to understand it well before it can be applied. We don’t allow all knowledge to be applied – for instance, knowledge about how to make biological weapons is kept secret because we fear what we could create and value pre-emptive measures.
Arguments:
1) Role of the state: the role of the scientist doesn’t trump the role of the state. The state is necessary to make sure science doesn’t go too far and ensure the population is included in its decisions. The best decision for society can be made by the state, not by scientists.
2) Genetic arms race: others will push boundaries to compete with you. We don’t want these limits pushed in countries whose governments don’t have the ability to react, contain it or understand it like other nations do. Knowledge is so mobile that this is a serious risk.
Fourth Proposition Speaker
Competitor at the World Debate Championships 2009
Two major questions arose in the round:
1)Are genetically modified things good or bad?
Genetic engineering is merely speeding up natural processes used for thousands of years. The negative consequences could happen anyways, but the benefits can only occur if we take advantage of genetic modification. For instance, out of control crops can occur with traditional breeding, but continuing to feed the masses will be difficult without genetically improved strains.
2)What is the state’s role in limiting science?
Science is not out of control – the problems actually occur when the state takes control and doesn’t allow science to take its own course. There are cases of unintended consequences, but genetics also tries to fix them. If we only engaged in science that was necessary, safe and understood, we wouldn’t even have developed fire. We wouldn’t have any science by these criteria. Regarding the argument that the state is needed to ensure societal input in science, scientists are representative of society – the scientific method can be done by anyone, science is open to anyone and is fundamentally democratic. We need to allow science to be science.
Fourth Opposition Speaker
Competitor at the World Debate Championships 2008 and 2009

They told us         the number of heavy metals in water is low enough to drink, but most of the detection methods are about chemistry,         detecting heavy metal in water with biology has excellent prospects, and it’s a good choice for us to keep on with         the project. To know more about water quality around the world and relevant safety problems, we sent emails to IUCN,         EEA and so on. Through our efforts, we realized most developed countries don’t have such concerns, and developing         countries have the main populations who concern about this issue which helped us ensure our projects direction. What’s         more, the product also has the potential to be used by relevant organizations and professionals.

However, because it also binds to nucleic acids, we treated it as a potential mutagen as well – we worked in an active fume hood and wore lab coats and gloves. The disposal of the product was carried out according to protocols and safety regulations.
Environmental considerations
Synthetic biology involves taking genetic material from various organisms and creating new organisms that may never exist in nature. Such organisms could have unpredictable impact on the environment if they escaped from the laboratory conditions. Due to this reason, iGEM has a strict Do Not Release policy our which our team took very seriously.
Even though our project does not result in a genetically modified organism (GMO) but we generated them for our basic cloning, transformation and PCR experiments. To fully understand what we were working with, we not only studied the biological parts we are working with, but also the organisms they came from and the organism they are transferred to (in our case E. coli strains). Those factors helped us determine that our project is required of Biosafety Level 1 and according means for handling the resulting GMO.
Examples of considered characteristics included:
Treats arising directly from the inserted part: assessment if the product of inserted gene has known biological or pharmacological functions that may cause harm (e. g. toxins, gene expression regulators, oncogenic gene sequences, antibiotic resistance, allergens, etc).
Pathogenicity of the host strain, consequences of exposure and availability of treatment.

A similar pattern can be seen here as for  the mammalian- bacterial promoter with eCFP as at a 20mM concentration the intensity of fluorescence sharply decreases, however the intensity here decreases down to a level between 10mM and 15mM  potassium nitate concentration. There is also only a small difference between 5mM and 10mM potassium nitrate, which differs to the pattern seen with the bacterial-mammalian promoter ligated to eCFP.  As previously stated, this may be due to the cell overexpressing eCFP up to the point at which the excess protein begins to form inclusion bodies which can no longer fluoresce; alternatively, this could be due the potassium nitrate concentration reaching the critical concentration at which it becomes toxic to the cell. This data differs to the readings taken from the bacterial-mammalian ligated to eCFP, as well as the hybrid promoters to RFP, which may suggest there is a difference in the molecular mechanisms that these promoters function by; however at this point the change in intensity at 20mM is inconclusive and is an area which we would like to look into further.
Figure 14.A graph of the intensity of RFP fluorescence at different wavelengths ranging from 600 - 650 nm where the samples were excited at 560 nm. The samples of E. coli were transformed by the M-B + RFP BioBrick and grown overnight in different concentrations of potassium nitrate (0 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, 15 mM and 20 mM) before being lysed in order to release proteins from the cells for fluorometer analysis.
The graph above shows the flourescence measured from the expression of RFP due to the response of the mammalian-bacterial promoter to  different concentrations of potassium nitrate.  The wavelength reading which corresponds to RFP is between 600-650nm.  The graph clearly demonstrates that between 0mN and 15mM there is a proportional relationship between fluorescence intensity and potassium nitrate concentration. It has been found that for all BioBricks apart from the mammalian-bacterial promoter ligated to eCFP at a 20mM concentration the intensity of fluorescence sharply decreases.

Precautions:
When cutting the chip, complete it as much as possible, and repeating the cutting multiple times may cause the chip cavity error to become larger;
Check whether the layers of the chip are aligned before bonding. Use a small amount of tape when fixing to avoid the indentation on the surface of the chip.
When bonding, pay attention to the stability of the bonding temperature. If the temperature is too low, the bonding may fail. If the temperature is too high, the chip may melt.

SU-8 Based Processing Platform
The SU-8 flux detection chip can achieve detection requirements for 10 to 1000 samples. We made microchip chips based on solid particles. The principle of flux detection is very simple. The area is divided on the microarray chip, and the shape of the holes of each piece is different. Each shape of the hole can only accommodate the solid particles of the corresponding shape. Before the test, it is only necessary to process different samples to be tested into gel particles of a specific shape in a certain step.
If you need to detect the detection of multiple disease markers, it is more convenient to use the SU-8 chip. Figure (Fig. 4) is our production process.

The data obtained in this experiment revealed that the strong promoter displayed a higher basal level of RFP expression than the weak promoter. Moreover, both promoters exhibited similar decrease in fluorescence over time, as seen in Figure 2, indicating that a considerable portion of the cell populations for both promoters lost their ability to fluoresce during growth, with one population containing around 60% non-fluorescent bacteria, clearly divided from the fluorescent portion. As expected, the strong promoter displayed a high level of RFP expression, roughly 500-fold of the non-fluorescent MG1655 control at 1 hour. A 10-fold decrease in fluorescence was observed from 1 hour to 4 hours. The RFP expression mediated by the weak promoter exhibited a similar decrease in fluorescence over time, though with measured fluorescence levels 5 times lower than for the strong promoter.
Comparing these findings to the fluorescence microscopy data, it was hypothesised, that the increasing noise could be caused by bacterial plasmid loss. This could be ascribed to degradation of ampicillin in the medium, since the mechanism behind ampicillin resistance relies on the β-lactamase mediated cleavage of the antibiotic, thereby relieving the selective pressure. Consequently, the bacteria, which have lost their plasmid could be able to compete with the bacteria still containing their plasmid.
The fluorescence microscopy for the strong promoter did not exhibit a considerable level of noise, however, this does not reject the hypothesis. The increase in noise was revealed by flow cytometry, as measurements were carried out at several times throughout growth. However, the fluorescence microscopy measurements were only carried out once in the exponential phase, where the noise was not prevalent yet.
To substantiate the hypothesis, the experiment was performed anew using M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2 % glycerol and 100 µg/mL ampicillin, in an attempt to decrease the plasmid loss rate and optimise the selection.
The resulting data revealed, that the decrease in fluorescence levels had a lower rate for both promoters when the bacteria were cultured in M9 minimal medium, seen in the right graph in Figure 2, than in LB medium, seen in the left graph in Figure 2. Furthermore, when the bacteria were grown in M9 minimal medium with double amount of antibiotics compared to the LB medium, they displayed a higher level of fluorescence. Some of these observations could potentially be ascribed to the increased selection, that was strived after in this experiment. Moreover, the difference between the measured fluorescence levels for the two reporter systems was notably lower. This could"

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Modeling du traitement_-_-_TEXT.html," : Le développement du vecteur tissulaire
Le vecteur tissulaire est injecté au patient à un temps t, proche de t2. Le Nombre de vecteurs injectés (Nbi) est de 1x10^6. Le tropisme pulmonaire du vecteur n’est pas parfait, seul un Pourcentage (Pp) va au poumon. Le nombre total de vecteurs tissulaires dans le corps augmente, car ce vecteur est de type bactérien et possède donc un Temps de Doublement (DTB).
On peut ainsi établir que le Nombre de vecteurs tissulaires dans les poumons (Nb(t)) est égal à :
Le nombre de vecteurs tissulaires augmente jusqu’à l’injection de la doxycycline, où dès lors ces derniers sont lysés pour libérer les vecteurs cellulaires dans le poumon.
Ce temps d’injection n’est pas anodin. En effet, si l’on attend suffisamment longtemps, le nombre de vecteurs tissulaires est suffisant pour éliminer la tumeur ou du moins la réduire de façon importante. A l'inverse, si l'on attend trop longtemps, une dose de doxycycline plus importante (et donc potentiellement toxique) est nécessaire pour libérer les vecteurs cellulaires .
On peut ainsi se servir de la modélisation pour déterminer le Temps optimal d’Injection de la doxycyline (Tdox).
Haut de page
Troisième étape : La libération du vecteur cellulaire
Une fois la doxycycline injectée, le vecteur cellulaire est libéré. Le nombre de vecteurs cellulaires est proportionnel au nombre de vecteurs tissulaires dans le poumon. Or, on sait que la valeur moyenne de Phages recombinants libérés par M. avium (Npl) est égale à 100.
On peut écrire que le Nombre de vecteurs cellulaires au moment de l’injection (Np(Tdox)) est égal à :
Le nombre de vecteurs cellulaires ne croit pas comme pour le vecteur tissulaire . En effet, il décroit au fur et à mesure du temps, à cause de la stabilité du phage et de son internalisation cellulaire (pour libérer le plasmide thérapeutique ).

Pasteur_Paris,2017,Team:Pasteur Paris#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," subsample, we obtained the following results for our survey.
As we can see, the European society feels concerned by the problem of pollution. 77% of respondents think they are affected, and almost half feel very affected by the pollution, since they live in a polluted city. For indoor pollution, even though 43% of people think they are exposed to pollution in their home, more than half do not know if they are affected or think that pollution does not affect them at home.
This observation has strongly influenced our scenario and more particularly our desire to develop an application to raise awareness about the dangers of indoor pollution and create a database of pollutants so that people are aware of the dangers of this scourge.
Even though people are aware of the dangers of pollution, especially indoor pollution, most of them do not take measures to fight it. Most do not inquire, or inform themselves passively (TV, Radio). And only 13% of respondents really use protections against air pollution. We can interpret it as follows: pollution is a problem, but a second-area problem, which is not the priority of our fellow citizens at the individual level, which we can compare with the next question of the survey (How do you feel such an issue should be addressed?). Finally, we noted once again that a significant number of participants think that they will avoid air pollution by staying at home: a pedagogical work is therefore strongly necessary.
We asked the previous questions to see if the key concepts of our project were well known to the general public. As we have seen, most respondents think they know what are the fine particles (which we hear a lot about in the media). A large proportion (62%) also thinks they know what an endocrine disruptor is. This result is very high for such a technical term and contrasts with results from other continents, where on average 35% think they know what an endocrine disruptor is. This difference can be explained by the high-profile debates in the European Union on the banning of certain compounds suspected of being endocrine disruptors. After asking these questions, we gave a definition for these terms from a pedagogical perspective.
We gave the following definition for particulate matter: Atmospheric particulates are microscopic solid or liquid matter suspended in the Earth's atmosphere. It’s the deadliest form of air pollution due to their ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and blood stream unfiltered, causing permanent DNA mutations, heart attacks, and premature death. [Ref.]
We gave the following definition for endocrine disruptor: Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that can interfere at a certain level with your endocrine (or"

Education and Public Engagement
iGEM Team Tec Chihuahua believes that regardless of the results we get and the goals we complete if they are not shared, they can be considered as never done. This is the basic goal of Education and Public Engagement, getting other people involved in the project one way or another. However, there are some previous steps that should be carried out before explaining our project and results to other people, most importantly, giving them a basic preamble of what Synthetic Biology really is. Therefore Team Tec Chihuahua participated intensely in 7 events/projects.
IV Foro Estatal de Apicultura
In our state, 250 honey producers are distributed in 10 regional associations. We count with more than 43,000 beehives. We produce approximately 600 tons of honey per year, of which 400 are exported mainly to Germany and the rest stays for local consume.
We live in a state where beekeepers need to be informed of what is happening in the outside world, they need to know how synthetic biology can influence their business and how can it benefit their economy. For us, it's very important to keep in touch with the people who are directly related to bees. Therefore, we went ahead with the task of making a bigger step and getting more informed citizens and conscious beekeepers.
That's why we participated in the “IV Foro Estatal de Apicultura” (4th State Beekeeping Forum in English), to discuss what is behind synthetic biology and to let people who are not related with the laboratory know that this new area of genetic engineering is not that far away.
This event took place from July 27 through July 29 in our state in the city of Delicias, a couple of hours away from our home. The “IV Foro Estatal de Apicultura” was organized by the Delicias' Beekeepers Association and the State's Government, which counted with the presence of state and federal authorities.
The Delicias' Beekeepers Association invited beekeepers from Chihuahua’s state, future beekeepers, the delegate of the Secretariat of State in"
