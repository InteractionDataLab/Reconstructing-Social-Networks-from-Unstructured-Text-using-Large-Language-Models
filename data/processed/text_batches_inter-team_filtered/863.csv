UCL,2018,Team:UCLouvain#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,". However,                 this is the third time our University has participated in this competition. Currently, this Swedish team know all the workings of the competition. That's why we asked them for advice.
Uppsala Igem team have a project called “WormBusters” related to the problem of nematode parasites in the horse in an agricultural setting. They want to develop a detection kit that can be used easily by farmers. If you want to know                 more about their project : https://2018.igem.org/Team:Uppsala
This summer, Nina (from UCLouvain team) left for a week in Sweden to meet them and talk about a potential collaboration between our two teams. Our two teams had the opportunity to present their projects to each other.
Firstly, we exchanged our impressions about both projects (BactWars and WormBusters). What helped us most was to learn more about the internal organization of their team.                 This summer, we had some problems with our results of the InterLab too and the Uppsala team gave us advice regarding the Interlab. It’s mainly thanks to them that we were able to obtain valid results for the InterLab part.
To thank them for their help, we shared on the social networks their french form about their problematic. Indeed, one of the official languages ​​in Belgium is French. And it allows them to check if their problematic affects only                 their country or if their project could help farmers from other countries.

Collaboration with Laval University (Canada)
We wanted to work with overseas teams for our European Conference. It was important for us to not only work with European teams. So propose to other worldwide teams to organize a                 rediffusion of our event. In this perspective we got in touch the University of Laval. As they were very enthusiastic we planned together the logistic details and talk about some content details. They book a room and invited over 20                 students to watch and interact during our event.
Collaboration with IGEM Paris Saclay (France)
In early March Celestin went to Paris to meet two iGEM teams in order to share our mutual experience on all the aspect of the contest. He first met met with Arthur Radoux and his colleague Julie Miesch from the Paris Saclay iGEM                 team. We able to share our concern about different aspect of the contest such as the modeling part, etc. It was great to have this opportunity to help each"

I aliquoted another 250 uL of the fraction to syringe filter, all of the silk particles were trapped in the filter (checked under UV box).
some things we can try:
add more solvent to try to solubilize the Tamura particulates
I took 2 mL of ""Fraction 4"" from the Functionalization team
This solution is much more viscous, has much less particulates, and has comparable fluorescent intensity when checked under the UV box.
I will take Fraction 4 and mix it with the silk dope.
Considering how viscous both the silk dope and the Tamura fraction are, I should probably add some water to the mix
Will add 50 uL of ddH2O to bring the total volume of hybrid dope to 300 uL.
FINAL RECIPE that I am co-spinning:
50 uL ddH2O
185.7 uL of 20%w/v silk dope
62.5 uL of Tamura Fraction 4
Extrude at rate of 6 uL/min into 70% v/v ethanol
retroactive information added
our Tamura fraction 4 was found to have a concentration of 146 ug/mL.
Our recipe contained the total masses:
b.mori silk: 0.037g
Tamura: 9.125ug
Our Tamura to b.mori silk ratio was 2.466E-6
This is a very low ratio. Upping the ratio would increase fluorescent intensity. It also might destabilize the silk structure (which is already very unstable)
All in all, the hybrid dope that we spun was 12.3% w/v.
Results
I think it worked!
fibers formed without a problem
checked for fluorescence under the UV box and under microscope. Note that for the following images, the co-spun silk thread was taken out to dry on the benchtop immediately after coming out of the tubing.

Overview
This year we made the components of CRISPRi system into parts and submitted to the iGEM Registry. With continuously increasing interest in work relevant to CRISPRi system, we believe these 2 parts will provide lots of convenience to users. Since in our project we hope that light could be the only parameter that we directly adjust, we did some improvements to the pre-existing parts: inserting them into a constant expressing operon.
All of our parts can be divided into 2 categories, the CRISPRi system and the light sensing system.
CRISPRi
Original Components: dCas9 protein( BBa_K1026001 ) and sgRNA( BBa_K1026003 )
Constitutive Expressing Components: dCas9 protein( BBa_K1026000 ) and sgRNA( BBa_K1026002 )
We have tested CRISPRi system though the following experiment: After successful transformation, the control group expressed dCas9 and mRFP constitutively while the case group expressed dCas9, sgRNA and mRFP. The color of these two groups should be different due to the knock down effect of CRISPRi system.
The result is in consistent with our expectation:
Additionally, the base-pairing region can be changed according to different people's needs. Inverted PCR will provide an easy way to replace this region and make it a universal and convenient regulating tool.
We also built the part that combines a promoter regulated by light sensor with sgRNA(BBa_K1026004), if used together with light"

Site-specificity of the miniTn7-Gm insertions in P. putida KT2440 obtained was determined by PCR amplification using a primer annealing at the 3' end of glmS and a primer annealing at the Tn7R end. The occurence of a 164 bp product indicates successful site-specific integration at attTn7, while absence of this product suggests non-specific insertion elsewhere. 12 candidates each from the electroporation and mating experiments were tested by colony PCR as indicated (Figure X). All candidates from the mating experiment and 10 out of 12 from the electroporation experiment displayed a band of the expected size, indicating that miniTn7BB-Gm efficiently inserts at the chromosomal attTn7 site of P. putida.

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  The PCquad Yeates will be grown again in order to rerun the purification and a purer product will be attempted to be obtained.  For today, the glycerol stock will be used to streak on a plate.  In addition, sequencing primers will be designed.
The previous sequencing primers look like they should work for PCquad prime 3.0 and Mutant 10, so no primers were made.
Streaking the plate:
The glycerol stocks were obtained and put on ice.  The ampicillin plate was obtained and warmed in the incubator for 15 minutes.  Using asceptic technique, a wire loop was flamed, and cooled on the gel.  It was then dipped into the glycerol stock, and then plated in a zig-zag fashion.  The wire loop was flamed and cooled again before running another zig-zag pattern across the end of the previous streak.  This was done a total of three times.  The plate was then put in the 37C incubator at 5:30PM."

Mambalgin: We were able to get Mambalgin into pGEX and started working on protein expression.
HCG: We were able to submit an improved HCG part in PSB1C3.
Factor C: We worked with Emory's iGEM team and gave them the G-Blocks of Factor C to fuse together using PCR Overlap extension. We used the PCR Overlap Extension protocol from Ichiro Matsumura.
Human Practices: After working hard this summer with wet lab work, we were able to explore some new additional ways to allow our lab to reach more students at GSU. The work that we have done with the deaf students, allowed for our lab to seek out new ways to educate students on the field of synthetic biology. The introduction of American Sign Language into our lab by creating the gallery is a great start for connecting to students who may not be involved in STEM due to a communication barrier. Since starting to learn ASL, we were able to seek the interest of a student who wanted to get involved in our lab that was hard of hearing. We are hopeful that as more students on Georgia State's campus see our gallery, that they will feel welcomed to our lab. We know that this new addition to our lab will allow us to build a stronger STEM community and serve as a model for other iGEM teams.

Survey
Today, fish provides more than one billion people with most of their daily animal protein. Fish provides nutrients and micronutrients which are essential to the cognitive and physical development of people, especially of children. It is also an important part of a healthy diet. But heavy metals in water have become a threat to both fish and public health. The EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) announced that women living on the East and West Coasts had twice as much mercury in their blood (5.9 parts per billion, or ppb) than inland women (2.4 ppb). Levels higher than 3.5 ppb may pose a threat to the woman or fetus.
We designed two kinds of questionnaires including a Chinese questionnaire and an English questionnaire, in order to enlarge the region of our investigation.The Chinese questionnaire and English questionnaire are basically similar.
We totally acquired 544 questionnaire responses. The survey in China was carried out both online and offline. We used an online survey website and collected 526 effective questionnaires. We also got 18 effective paper questionnaires. As to the English questionnaire, we put it on the website and promoted it. Finally, we recycled 12 effective questionnaires from 5 different countries (German, Canada, USA, UK and Netherlands).

Hannover,2016,Team:Hannover#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," large part of science is the ethical questions that need to be answered every time one starts a new project. So we decided to talk about the ethical aspects of genome editing and the future abilities you have when your project is ready for the industry or a medicinal facility. Questions that are posed are “Where are the ethical limits? or what happens when they get extravagated?” Most of the time, scientists just see the positive impacts of their work and in the process, forget to think about their negative consequences.
We talked to a group of science students about the fact that genome editing gives us the possibility healing cancer and hereditary illnesses, and how this could introduce discrimination of disabled people or the beginning of “designer babies”.
Selling cake
While selling cake in the lounge of our university, we tried to inform people about the competition and our project. We got to talk about TALEs and how genome editing is? no longer just a dream. Everybody enjoyed good conversations and some sweet treats.
Social media
Because we live in a time where social media has such a big influence in the world; we tried to build up an online community on Twitter and Facebook. We attempted to connect with other teams and keep everybody updated on our progress. We also wanted to inform the public about the competition and our team. Reaching out to the community is very important in order to get new ideas, solutions for lab problems or just to exchange knowledge.
Sponsors
Our project would not have been possible without financial support from multiple sponsors and supporters."

SynBioDay: Street Science in Bielefeld
Preparation
On the 28th of June all German iGEM teams were invited to the strategy process „Biotechnologie 2020+“ in Berlin. There we decided to plan and arrange a common day in all German cities with participating iGEM teams. In the end the SynBioDay took place in Munich ( TU and LMU ), in Darmstadt , Göttingen , Marburg , Tübingen , Bonn and of course in Bielefeld. To raise public awareness we all agreed to organize the event on the 25th of August. The idea behind our common day was to inform public not only about Synthetic Biology, but also about iGEM and our project. We also wanted to show that there are plenty of iGEM teams with great ideas, therefore, as part of our collaboration with the iGEM team from the Southern University of Denmark we invited them to present a poster at our booth and to help us with the realization. In Germany there is an ongoing debate about modern life sciences, especially biotechnology, genetic engineering and synthetic biology and we thought that by informing and explaining we might reduce prejudices (for the german debate about Synthetic Biology see here our discussion with René Röspel, a member of the german parliament).
Realization
The poster to describe our project, which we presented at Street Science.
In Bielefeld we organized the booth in cooperation with Bielefeld Marketing . We had prepared a lot of different things. For example a microscope to have a look on microorganisms and “wanted poster” for the organisms. For kids we had organized pipettes and lab coats to feel like scientists. They could pipet colored water and merge it, to see how colors change. We also held small competitions: jump roping with ropes made of reaction tubes and filling"
Hamburg,2017,Team:Hamburg#Cooperations_-_-_TEXT.html," in detail they gave us valuable tips. Their ideas were a raise of the annealing temperature to 72 °C, adding 0.5 M betaine, try adding DMSO in 3 %, 5 % or even 10 % concentration or a combination of both DMSO and betaine. We gave a try to all these suggestions, unfortunately without having a hit. We expected a lane at about 1100 bp.
The PCR was tested with a Q5-High- Fidelity polymerase and a Phusion polymerase but neither led to a positive result.
We discussed the result with the iGEM Team Heidelberg who did not want to give up and gave us additional tips to try. Their next suggestion was to design new primes, as ours had a very high GC content in the middle part and were therefore prone to the formation of secondary structures. Also, the new primer pairs should be designed to anneal at 72 °C. They offered to design to take over the design for us. These were the original primers:
Fw: CATTATGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGA
Rv: GATAATCTGCAGCGGCCGCTACTAGTA
These are the newly designed primers by the iGEM Team Heidelberg:
Fw: CATTATGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGATGACCATCACCATC

Unfortunately, we did not have enough time at this stage of the project to order and test new primers. Therefore, we will only add the primers to the gene to facilitate the work for the next group who wants to work on the gene.
Even though the gene amplification was not successful in the end, we are very grateful for the help of the iGEM Team Heidelberg, especially Pauline for her advice and not giving up on our problem. Thank you very much!
Harvard
The iGEM team Harvard offered the opportunity to participate in the design process of a set of questions for human practices partner in politics, economics, and science. The questions were targeted to set standards for future surveys so that the results become comparable. And that future teams can easily navigate through interviews with highly qualified personnel originating from the respective fields.
Many teams came together working on the questionnaire, however we want to mention one team especially: Aalto Helsinki, adding a ton of good questions while also fueling the discussion.

INSA-UPS_France,2017,Team:INSA-UPS France#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"25: Kick Off Meeting
Gathering the team members and distribute the tasks... The adventure begins!
Week 5
01-30: 2th brainstorming: on the track of crocodile antimicrobial peptides...
We’ve took charge of differents accounts of the association (facebook, twitter, email, bank account, google drive…), and made a listing of 45 potential subjects for the competition.
Week 6
02-06: 3th brainstorming meeting
We’ve selected 17 subjects that we considered the most originals, the most feasible, and the most interesting. We’ve imagined to make a dressing against nosocomial infections containing bacteria that produces antimicrobial peptides from crocodile. We’ve read that crocodile peptides are not toxic for humans at microbicide quantity.
Week 7
02-16: 4th brainstorming
Only 7 subjects left! To make a safe device, we’ve thought of switch on the dressing by using spores that can be activated with the temperature.
02-13 to 02-17: Training course for INSA students at LISBP with our instructor Brice Enjalbert
Week 8
02-23: 5th brainstorming
We made a list of our public engagement events. For our subject, we’ve focused our research on the originality, and we’ve noted that a similar dressing has already been made by an iGEM team before. So we imagined the use of anticoagulant molecules in the dressing. We’ve thought of a bandage for pets.
Week 9
03-02: 6th brainstorming
We’ve analysed the 7 subjects, and we’ve noted some technical issues. For the “crocodile peptides project”, we’ve raised several questions : what organisme should we use to produce antimicrobial peptides? We need to find an organism which is not susceptible to their antimicrobial activity. We need to use a special membrane to contain GMOs inside the dressing and not directly in contact to the skin.
Week 10
03-05: Team building at the restaurant
Our team met for the first time outside the INSA buildings and shared a delicious korean meal after brainstorming the whole afternoon!
03-09: 7th brainstorming meeting
We’ve voted for our 4 favourite subjects : “crocodile antimicrobial peptides”, “bioluminescent living board”, “expiration pastille”, and “colourful cellular cycle”.

The problem of originality"
TU-Eindhoven,2016,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," cultured bacteria from smartphones, banisters, tables, etcetera on petri dishes to teach the children about bacteria. We explained the iGEM competition and the basics of our research to the parents. We also showed a video which explains transformation of plasmids in bacteria in a simple way. Most of the children were very interested in bacteria and certainly learned something new.
Figure 4: impression of the Dream and Dare festival.
While the children were listening to our story about bacteria, we told their parents something about synthetic biology and the iGEM competition. In conclusion, this festival was a very useful way to reach out to the public and a small step in acquainting the general public with synthetic biology. Our team is very proud to contribute to sharing this knowledge.
NIBI Bionieuws
After contacting the Dutch Institute for Biology (NIBI), they gave all iGEM teams from the Netherlands the possibility to design an advert in their news magazine that appears twice in a month: Bionieuws. Bionieuws has an edition of 6500 pieces. With this advert the possibility was created to explain iGEM and the project each team has been working on.
Figure 5: The advert was placed in NIBI Bionieuws for the Dutch iGEM teams.
Open Days
At the Open Days of our university, high school students will take a look at different studies and faculties to find out what they are interested in. During these days our team will present the iGEM competition and the TU Eindhoven team to the future students. We will explain the term synthetic biology and explain why the iGEM competition is important and interesting. Moreover, we want them to get interested in the field of research and challenge them to get the most out of their studies.
NBC-16 Biotechnology the Next Level
The 14th of April we were invited by the Dutch Biotechnology Association (NBV) to attend their conference: NBC-16 Biotechnology the Next Level. We enjoyed the interesting talks about new developments in synthetic biology and also participated in an refreshing discussion about the ethical aspects of synthetic biology. It was also nice to hear a presentation from the winner of iGEM 2015: iGEM TU Delft. A short report of the conference can be found here.

SYNENERGENE forum
On the 24th of June we visited the SYNENERGENE forum in Amsterdam. SYNENERGENE is an European project which aims to open dialogue on responsible research and innovation (RRI)."
BIT,2016,Team:BIT-China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,"                                 camp lasted for two months. Then, we welcomed students                                 who showed great passion to iGEM to take part in the brainstorm activity.
What's more, our teacher, Prof. Chun Li,                                 introduced iGEM to students at Yan'an University. They wanted to set up                                 a team to participate in the iGEM, but they had never established any iGEM team and had no experience.                                  Therefore, we invited three students from Yan'an University to be our team members to design and                                 implement our project together. In this process, they not only expanded their knowledge of synthetic                                  biology and improve their experimental skills,                                 but also learned how to build an iGEM team.All those will help                                 them to establish an iGEM team next year on their own.                                  More importantly, we are closer to the idea of iGEM and spread synthetic                                 biology to more people.                                 We look forward to their outstanding performance next year.
Conferences
In August, 2016, BIT-China was invited to take part in the Asia-Pacific                                     conferenceheld by team NCKU-Tainan. About 20 teams participated in the conference. All of them made splendid speeches to present their own projects and discuss with each other. During the special journey we got to know plenty of exciting ideas and got many useful help.
We also presented our project, and received lots of feedback to improve our                                 design. As the first one to present, the Q and A section of our team was                                 under hot discussion. The questions raised referred not only to the                                 project design, but also extended to considerations about safety issues.                                 However, since the logic order of our presentation was not clear enough,                                 the audience misunderstood the core concept of our project.
After the conference, we adjusted the logic order and improved our oral presentation.
In addition to this, we held and took part in several exchange                                 meetings with other three teams: Peking,  Jilin_China , UCAS.
Through these exchange meetings, we got many useful                                 suggestions to shape our project step by step.
HP Union
In the Asia-Pacific conference, we greatly enlarged our horizons by sharing ideas with other teams. At the same time, we felt it’s not enough and it’s necessary and urgent to do more things. So we decided to establish a platform for teams’ interactive communication called iGEM Union.
This union mainly have three purposes:
a) Make it more convenient for iGEMers’ online communication this year:
In this way, most of the common problems can be solved as quickly as possible, and the members can"

This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

St_Andrews,2011,Team:St Andrews#debate#debate_-_-_TEXT.html," activities of the overall cell.  They began their discussion of the benefits of synthetic biology by introducing the role particular biobrick sequences could play in the treatment of disease.  Dundee mentioned examples of ongoing scientific projects such as the effect of using various biobricks to synthesize pharmaceuticals treat malaria and diabetes. But the use of biobrick sequences extend further than simply medical applications.  Synthetic biology can also help to produce greener fuels, such as bio-alcohol or photosynthetic algae, which are becoming increasingly popular due to the changes in the world’s climate and increasing dependence on fossil fuels.  Dundee introduced the idea that synthetic biology could be used in controlling and reducing the spread of oil spills, by creating bacteria that are able to metabolize oil, enabling them to be utilized in the cleanup effort.  Novel ideas like this open the door for synthetic biology to play an important role in environmental protection. Other applications of synthetic biology include material production, such as cellular production of fertilizers and pesticides that could help to boost agricultural growth, or chemicals that require non-cost-effective human effort to synthesize. It seemed as though synthetic biology could solve some of the most prominent problems of our time.
Following the Dundee iGEM presentation was the St Andrews iGEM Team, who discussed the negative aspects of synthetic biology.  St Andrews chose to highlight three main practical dangers of synthetic biology, including how best to prevent these disasters from occurring in the future.
St Andrews introduced the concept of bioterrorism within a synthetic biology context. Whilst one of the best things about the synthetic biology community is its largely open-source approach, this also means that anyone with the appropriate equipment and skills (which are widely available) could assemble a virulent strain of bacteria/virus - we highlighted for example the assembly of Polio from mail order oligonucleotides [Cello et al. 2007]. Another practical danger is the prospect of an organism escaping the lab and being released into the surrounding environment.  The danger here is two-fold, with the bacteria either colonizing an individual or individuals, potentially causing serious bodily harm and even death, or the bacteria colonizing the environment, causing damage to the environmental niche, or out-competing other natural flora into extinction.  The last practical danger is the need for scientists to test synthetic bacteria in an open environment.  Whilst some applications such as creation of pharmaceuticals could be done entirely in the laboratory, other projects such as the Arsenic sensor that was produced by another iGEM team would inherently need to be released into the field to realize their application.  The fear here"

Why not use the two different sequences but for the same target in the two phages (for example, both DNA polymerases)?

Video-based collaboration:
  We have filmed China's bio-safety education video with Shanghai University of Science and Technology and 11 other universities. We undertook the part of design and shooting of the eighth episode, laboratory reagent leakage treatment.
  1.Background  
  We were connected by Shanghai University of Science and Technology. The lack of teaching materials in the field of bio-safety education in China, the obsolete of the laboratory-safe instructional videos and the disconnection between the content and the actual work of today's laboratories caused us making some educational videos. We aimed to strengthen students' bio-safety awareness and correct students’ operation which do not conform to safety standards. We hope to improve the level of bio-safety education in China and the safety awareness of people with the help of the Yale Laboratory Safety Handbook and other foreign bio-safety education materials.

3.Overview 
  We choose ""reagent leak treatment"" as the theme and narrated a story through the form of melodrama. Two students missed the teacher's teaching because they were late in experiment class. They accidentally overturned the test tube containing ether while dropping the ether. Being panic, they opened the doors and windows immediately and asked the teacher for help. After the teacher handled the accident, he educated the students and mentioned what had happened before: solid reagent leakage treatment (take the case of sodium bromide leakage as an example) and the leakage treatment of ultra clean workbench medium.

Transformation of E. coli safer, but takes more time.
5. For electroporation, transform 1 μL into 50 μL electrocompetent cells. For large recombinant DNA, electroporation is required. In complex cloning, electroporation is recommended, as it is 10-100 times as efficient as chemical transformation.
Electrocompetent cells have to be made, or we use heat shock (see protocol“transformationof E. coli”), protocol for electrocompetent cells can be taken from NEB

Transmission of genetic information into competent cells (or plants, algas, mushrooms) (the target organismn)
2. Steps
1. Prechil 1.5 ml tube on ice.
2. Thaw a tube competent E. coli  cells on ice for 10 minutes.
1.  Mix gently.
2. Pipette 50 µl of the cells  into the 1.5 ml tube.
3. Add 1-5 µl (containing 1 pg-100 ng of plasmid) DNA to the cell mixture.
(as soon as as the last bit of ice in the tube is disappeared!)
4. Flick the tube 4-5 times to mix cells and DNA.  (No vortexing!)
5. Place the mixture on ice for 30 minutes. (without mixing!)
(2-fold loss in transformation efficiency for every 10 minutes this step is shortened!) 
6. Heat shock at exactly 42°C for exactly 30 seconds.  (without mixing!)
(temperature and timing specific to transformation volume and vessel)
7. Place on ice for 5 minutes.
(without mixing!)
8. Pipette 950 µl of room temperature SOC into the mixture.
9. Place at 37°C for 60 minutes and shake vigorously (800 rpm in thermo mix block).
(2-fold loss in transformation efficiency for every 15 minutes this step is shortened)
(SOC gives 2-fold higher transformation efficiency than LB medium"

Collaboration with Aalto-Helsinki
We collaborated with Aalto_helsinki team as well. We contacted them because they were working  on a similar project we were working on: producing boifuel with the tools of synthetic biology. While  they focused on producing propanol, we focused on producing butanol.
We kept in touch regularly trought e-mail, but also held a skype conference, where we talked about  our projects and the ways we could help each other. We both ordered gene fragments from IDT and  talked about that expreience and we gave each other tips on how to best accomplish other tasks of  iGEM. At the time, Slovenia HS has already done some work on our Human Practices, such as  presentations for students and appearences in media, while Aalto-Helsinki was just starting to  prepare their Human Practices, so we talked and echanged information and ideas about that. On teh  other hand, aalto-Helsinki already had experience creating wiki pages (their team won the award for  best wiki in 2014), while Slovenia HS was beginning to learn, so we were glad to also be able to ask  some questions about creating wiki.
We did some work for them in the laboratory as well. Aalto-Helsinki sent us one of their BioBricks (BBa_K1655001) for validation and to be able to compare their results with ours.  This BioBrick is a GFP that can be fused into any protein's aminoterminal. We first attempted to  validate this brick by fusing it with one of our genes (CtfB) that was already tested and proved to be  functional and active.
Our construct with CtfB and double terminator (K1669005) was first ligated as a back insert into their  plasmid pSB1C3 with GFP (BBa_K1655001) .

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," tries the teams would have been able to complete this step, but it would have taken precious time away from their projects.
Fast growth
Some teams were so used to good ol’ E. coli they weren’t prepared for Vibrio natriegens. The fast growth of V. natriegens surprised them and threw off their lab routine. In some cases they ended up overgrown plates. We think that we can solve this problem in the future by simply spreading the word on Vibrio natriegens. If people are confident that the organism will deliver on its promises and grow fast, they can plan their workflow accordingly.
Not storable in the fridge
In the beginning of our project we realized that Vibrio natriegens had problems surviving in the fridge. If left outside in room temperature the plates became overgrown. We are working on a strain that is able to survive cold temperatures to solve this problem. We want to insert a KatG catalase into our VibriClone strain, but we haven’t completed this experiment as of now.
InterLab promotors in Vibrio natriegens
First, we conducted the Vibrigens InterLab (Fig. 4) ourselves and established what promoters were the strongest for us. We plotted a graph to show how strong the promoters were in relation to each other by comparing the data gathered after 3h of growth time.
The strongest fluorescence was emitted by device 5. Device 4 and 2 were very similar, but had a much weaker fluorescence than 5. Devices 1, 3 and 6 had incredibly low GFP values.
Also, we plotted a graph to show how strong the promoters were in relation to each other by combining the data gathered after 3h of growth time from all participating teams.

We calculated the mean emission of each device for each team and the strongest fluorescence was emitted by device 5.  Device 1 and 4 were very similar and came in at about half the fluorescence signal as 5. Devices 2 and 6 had a quite low emission and device 3 almost no signal.

Modeling the system
Metabolites & Enzymes | Reactions | Ordinary Differential Equations | Assumptions of the Model
The objective of our modeling is to accurately describe and predict  the behavior of the system and its response given an inducing signal.  Also, we aim to better know and understand the  system through the  identification of critical parameters and species, and thus be able to  obtain the desired dynamics.
Our system is composed of 13 species and 11 coupled biochemical reactions that completely describe it. This can be represented through a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The simulations were done using Simbiology, a package from Matlab.
FIG 1: Our system is conformed by two regulation mechanisms. The first mechanism is the one controlled by us through AHL . LuxR and AiiA compete to bind AHL when it enters the cell. AiiA efficiently degrades AHL, while LuxR and AHL form a dimer. This dimer serves as an activator of CI *, which represses RcnA . The second of these mechanisms is the natural regulation of RcnA in response to the intracellular nickel concentration. When there is no nickel inside the cell, RcnR represses RcnA. However, when nickel enters the cell, it forms a dimer with RcnR and changes its conformation so it no longer represses RcnA. RcnA is then free to start pumping Ni  out of the cell. We are keeping this because it is damaging to the  bacteria to have the pump always on, and otherwise it would need a  constant supply of AHL.

UFlorida,2018,Team:UFlorida#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," transformed with an oligo that caused a stop mutation in the ldhA gene.  Cas9 was induced via addition of anhydrous tetracycline on the right plate but not on the left, and 10-fold serial dilutions were made from the bottom of the plate to the top. No group had any order of magnitude of more killing than any other, implying that either recombination was not efficiently occurring or that crispr-Cas9 was not selectively killing wild-type bacteria as we had hoped.
We switched to the Datsenko-Wanner method. This technique utilizes antibiotic resistance replacement of the desired gene deletion. To accomplish this we used primers to amplify out a kanamycin resistance gene. This sequence was flanked upstream and downstream with regions of homology to the specific gene to remove. This amplified oligo was then used to recombineer a deletion and select for by kanamycin resistance. The resistance was necessary to remove so we used a FLP recombinase to 'flip' out the resistance gene. PCR and patching was used to confirm deletion. Within a week of switching, the frd operon (fumarate reductase) was successfully deleted though dozens of colonies had to be screened in order to find the correct mutant. From then on this was our chosen deletion method.

1. Integrate Resistance Cassette
#1. Ladder #2. Wild type (5kb)     #3. frd operon + frt-kanamycin-frt cassette (1.5kb)
2. Flip out Resistance Cassette
Frt-kanamycin cassette flipped out using the pcp20 plasmid encoded recombinase.  The sample to the right of those two bands represents the previously integrated 1.5kb fragment.
The colonies with the confirmed removal of the Kan cassette were patched on kanamycin plates (pictured below). The plasmids we used, pCP20 and pKD46, had to be confirmed via patching that they're cured of the cell.  This is done because unless the untransformed cell is sensitive for the antibiotic you're selecting it with, you wont be able to select for properly transformed cells. By plating the same colony on multiple antibiotic resistant plates, you can confirm that the cell is sensitive and resistant to respective antibiotics.
3. Patching
However, we discovered through HPLC that fumarate was still being produced at higher concentrations than what was predicted by our metabolic model. We went back"

Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the general tendency of expression level of csgA-EC & tetR when the concentration of extracellular cadmium ion is 10^(-8), 10^(-7), 10^(-6), 10^(-5), 10^(-4) mol/L, respectively. Here we assume an ideal situation that csgA-ECs and tetR won’t degrade or be secreted.
Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the general tendency of expression level of csgA-EC & tetR when the concentration of extracellular cadmium ion is 10^(-8), 10^(-7), 10^(-6), 10^(-5), 10^(-4) mol/L, respectively. Here we assume an ideal situation that csgA-ECs and tetR won’t degrade or be secreted.
According to these two figures and the value of Hill constant ( 3.7*10^(-6) ), the expression level of csgA-ECs and tetR shows great difference in order of magnitude when the concentration of extracellular cadmium ion is 10^(-6), 10^(-5), 10^(-4) mol/L respectively with one when the concentration of extracellular cadmium ion is 10^(-8), 10^(-7) respectively.
Then we assume that after E.coli is incubated for 40min, the expression of csgA-ECs and tetR enters the stationary phase. In this situation, a graph can indicate this great difference more accurately as follow.

We had a great time chatting with their team via Google Hangouts about the details of our previous project and discussing the various issues and problems we ran into, as well as how we overcame them. Their project sounds really awesome, and we're excited to see their presentation at this year's Jamboree!
Collaboration with UCSC iGEM on Human Practices
Members of the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) iGEM Team reached out to us over the summer asking if we would be able to help them with their Human Practices project by providing an interview with them. The project focused on the discussion of the recent movement in ""Do-It-Yourself Synthetic Biology.""  We had a great time as a team discussing our thoughts and ideas about the movement; many of us were unfamiliar with it and it was awesome to be able to learn about it while helping another team with their project! We all love synthetic biology and are huge advocates for expanding the influence of synbio throughout our world and community. Our video interview can be viewed here."

Prof. Dr. Skerra (our main PI, TUM) already filled the role of the main PI of TUM's 2012 and 2013 iGEM teams and thus had the first-hand experience of what it means to host an iGEM team. Initially, he was disinclined to host yet another iGEM team at his lab, but finally we could convince him of this. He is a renowned expert in the field of protein design, especially for therapeutic proteins, and has also founded two successful companies. For this reason, he is quite busy and unable invest great amounts of time in the iGEM competition. He joined our weekly team meeting once after we had decided on our project, giving us several invaluable tips concerning what components to integrate and what aspects to focus on in order to arrive at a proof of principle in the end. Apart from this session with him, it is his philosophy that iGEM is a student's  competition and that the students themselves should design and create the project. He generously offered all of the resources available at his chair together with the excellent analytical equipment, while letting us free rein to plan and execute the project on our own – and we are very grateful that he provided us with this opportunity!
Prof. Dr. Westmeyer (secondary PI, TUM, Helmholtz center) was asked to join the team halfway through the project when we realized that we required his expertise in the field of fluorescence microscopic imaging. He supported us, especially in the final weeks, with cell-biological reagents for staining and transfection as well as with the analytical instrumentation of his lab. As he spent the last years in Boston at the MIT and at Harvard, he is very open-minded concerning the potential and possible applications of SynBio in the future.
Our Journey Through Munich
In the course of our project, we have met many nice people willing to help and support us with lab space, knowledge, or materials. Below you can find all the stations we stopped by throughout our journey up to the outcome of our project.

All work associated with planning, conducting, and evaluating experiments was performed by student members of our team. Instructors assisted the students in planning their experiments, introducing relevant molecular-biological and chemical techniques to the students when they performed a specific experiment for the first time. Moreover, the students evaluated the experiments themselves after an introduction to the theory and advice on what to do and what to avoid. After this preliminary evaluation, all data were accumulated and discussed in the weekly team"

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#notebook 9_-_-_TEXT.html," of hope, and this week has definitely been a big leap for our DB. This time Liao finally realizes that we are actually making the next-generation standard of SBML, haha. Settling a brand-new standard of bio-modeling has actually become the core of our work. As far as I’m concerned, we have made 3 shifts on our goal, UI -> simulation -> bio-modeling standard, this is poor goal-setting, we didn’t make a clear map of what we are doing at the very beginning. I talk on DB and modeling with 2 junior students, they are all confident and eager to learn, I think they can handle it properly very soon. I just don’t have the time to talk with Soimort and Kun.
Sep 12 ~ Sep 19, 2010 Plan: Write note on UI&input, discuss UI&input with Soimort. Discuss ODE solver with Kun. Settle the final edition of DB. Writing DB of EPF-Lausanne with 2 junior students. Have fun working.
Summary: Write a detailed note on UI&Input and discuss it with Soimort. I believe it is not easy for him to understand the whole design of UI&Input and its connection with the database, I should spend more time to explain the details for him. Kun says he has finished the L2V4 update of ODE solver, he is now working on the boolean value judging module which will be used in Liao’s code. Liao’s first edition of document on DB standard is done, it’s now my turn to refine it and fix the bugs. Zhengda He has written part of the DB of EPF-Lausanne 2009 under my guidance, we can see the whole DB by next week, hopefully. Another junior student Zhaoyi Li is working on synchronized E.coli oscillator, a biological breakthrough published on Nature 2009. Last but not least, this is a busy week for scheduling trip, paying fee and talking to sponsor. Handling these things cost me lots of time, we should have a secretary for this, luckily we find one, she is Jue Wang. My boss doesn’t push me so hard on finishing his assignment, and I’m grateful for that, he must know that I don’t have much time. I do have fun working this week!

Time: 2015.8.18.
Location: COFCO Institute of Nutrition and Health, Beijing
On August 18th, our team visited COFCO Institute of Nutrition and Health and communicated with their staffs.
COFCO is the world’s top 500 enterprises, and also China’s leading supplier in the fields of agriculture products, food products and service, which is committed to building the whole industry chain about oil and food. COFCO constructs the whole service chain of urban complex. Research Institute of Nutrition and Health in COFCO based on the life sciences, is committed to the health and nutrition, which improves the life of Chinese people.
It is the 3rd year for BIT-China to participate in iGEM, and the collaboration between BIT-China and COFCO Institute of Nutrition and Health has been three years. We did get plenty of help and advice from COFCO, contributing to the further more collaboration. This year we mainly collaborated with COFCO Institute of Nutrition and Health.
Our project, pH Controller, is mainly designed to solve issues related to industrial fermentation pH adjustment, which attracts many fermentation companies.
At the meeting, Chenyi Li, the team leader of BIT-CHINA, gave a presentation for project description and synthetic biology introduction. We promoted the concept of synthetic biology and iGEM to COFCO. As an internationally renowned food company, COFCO has raised many substantive recommendations for our project, especially in the actual fermentation industry. They issued explanations for conventional fermentation conditions, fermentation technology and problems occurring in fermentation. According to these recommendations, we made a preliminary verification of fermentation, which would effectively support our project. Tai An and other staffs of COFCO proposed some suggestions on how to apply our project in fermentation industry and showed great interests in learning about the application of synthetic biology technology in their company. After discussion, BIT-CHINA visited the biological lab of COFCO and had a group photo.

This page shows an overview about the BioBricks we obtained over     the summer. To find more information about how we constructed the     parts, see Plasmid     construction . If you are interested in the experiments we     performed with our BioBricks check our Experiments page. Otherwise click     on the BioBrick numbers to see our parts in the registry.Since     CryptoGErM is a bio encryption system we created an encrypted     message ( BBa_K1930001 ), which can be decrypted with the associated     key ( BBa_K1930000 ). To protect the sensitive key we developed     biological safety layers. One is hiding the key, which involves     decoy spores. To distinguish between our CryptoGErM spores     containing the key and the decoy, we constructed the sfGFP(Sp)     BioBrick ( BBa_K1930006 ) optimized for B. subtilis. To allow the user     of CryptoGErM to select the key spores, we constructed a     ciprofloxacin resistance cassette ( BBa_K1930004 ). This cassette     contains a constitutive promoter for B. subtilis 168 ( BBa_K1930005 ),     novel to the registry.

Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#Content#PolicyAndPractices#PolicyandPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," at august the 16th. We wanted to know, what people know about synthetic biology and also show examples for products of synthetic biology in everyday life. Therefore, we distributed cards with facts about synthetic biology in everyday life (for further information we added the URL of our homepage). Furthermore, passengers could get a free balloon attached to one of the cards in exchange for a small conversation with one of our members about synthetic biology. Since balloons obviously attract young and old, we had the chance to speak to people of all ages.
The conversations were very interesting and varying, but most passengers had several opinions in common:
Almost no one knew synthetic biology
Many passengers were positively surprised about the facts we told them
After the mention of genetic engineering almost every passenger rated synthetic biology as dangerous
Most people concerned about: uncontrollable super-viruses, bacteria, etc. accidently evolved in research and low biosafety standards in labs and factories that may set them free
These concerns were usually not funded
Based on these impressions we decided to gain statistically valid data about the public opinion regarding synthetic biology. Hence, we started an online survey about synthetic biology (LINK).
Furthermore, we decided to focus on biosafety issues, since a lot of people seem to concern biosafety (LINK).
A perfect example for the lack of knowledge about genetic engineering is Jimmy Kimmel’s recent video. This may be in the US, but it sums up the general situation in Germany, too. Enjoy!

Definition of “artificial cell“ and “living machine“ in synthetic biology
Synthetic biology is still a young science field, which combines areas of engineering, chemistry, biotechnology, computer science and molecular biology.
The synthetic biology can be defined by their objectives. This definition encompasses four points. One goal is to gain new scientific knowledge about the processes within cells by trying to build cells from the bottom up or the top down. Another goal is to open up new fields of possible applications for synthetic modified organisms for example in medicine. A key issue involves the creation of novel, non-naturally occurring organisms and structures, as well as modularization and standardization of repeatedly compassable components: Biobricks.(TESSY).
Before discussing the definitions of „artificial cell“ and „living machine“ it is crucial to define to what extend can ever be spoken about a creation of life in synthetic biology.
The currently pursued research approaches in the synthetic biology do not aspire the creation of life ""de novo"". “De novo” can be explained from the Latin term “"
Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary_-_-_TEXT.html," on-site detection method. In response, our team is using synthetic biology to develop a system to rapidly detect the presence of EHEC in the beef industry. Although we designed our sensor for testing in the beef industry provides, we designed it so that it can also detect EHEC in things like vegetables, water, and other livestock.  By using engineered biological nanoparticles and DNA binding proteins, we can specifically detect pathogenic DNA sequences. Our biosensor functions at the genomic level to detect the presence of EHEC in a sample. This system allows us to quickly identify contamination during meat processing and also provides the ability to pre-screen cattle to limit potential sources of contamination before cattle enter the processing plant. Our system not only provides a powerful new tool for food safety, but also has the potential to act as a platform for the rapid detection of target organisms. These tests could hugely impact a myriad of industry applications ranging from the everyday, large-scale use in food safety testing and medical screening, to the specialized use in the detection and monitoring of biological weapons and hazards.

Bisphenol A degradation with E. coli
The bisphenol A degradation with the BioBricks <partinfo>K123000</partinfo> and <partinfo>K123001</partinfo> works in E. coli KRX in general. Because Sasaki et al. (2008) reported problems with protein folding in E. coli which seem to inhibit a complete BPA degradation, we did not cultivate at 37 °C and we did not use the strong T7 promoter as Sasaki et al.

On the question of ethical questionability of synthetic biology, Prof. Lam explained that it depends on how we discern ethical from unethical. If, being ethical meant bringing “good for the people” or to “help people,” then synthetic biology can be deemed ethical, he conveyed. However, he also acknowledged that some people would disagree and express the view that genetic manipulation is against the way God has created all living things. Then Prof. Lam wittily suggested that synthetic biologists “just make use of the gene that is created by God”. However, we cannot play deaf to questions concerning the actual impacts of synthetic biology: ultimately, does the good outweigh the bad? Additionally, he has enlightened us that the nature of science, especially the new fields in science inevitably carries risks, but we “should not stop any new science merely because of risks.” He carried on to introduce some regulation measures with handling biological materials, which naturally flowed into our next question.
An important part of iGEM is to recognize the potential dangers of laboratory work and that of synthetic biology. Prof. Lam emphasized that regulation measures are important to ensure that the entire procedures is kept under control, and that minimizing the negative impact is also a part of science. He mentioned the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as the universal guidelines for all research labs to follow.
We further extended our discussion to some of the concepts, applications and safety issues regarding our main project. He emphasized that we should consider issues of how the core mechanism of our project can be distinct or superior from the existing technologies.  He also provided professional opinion regarding the daily application of the project. He suggested some alternatives to the application aspect, which is to use a small bottle or a container with agar that contains the culture of engineered bacteria. The saliva from the potential patients is then inserted into the bottle to give either positive or negative results.
If it is decided that the project were to be used for charity purposes, Prof. Lam told us to consider how the targeted users would treat the manufactured device. Our targeted patients are those in the undeveloped countries in the world such as Africa, and where Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.P.) infection is more widespread. The lack of sanitization and the lack of knowledge on how use the kit and how to dispose of the finished product in the targeted area could potentially trigger infection from our own diagnosis kit once it has been used.

Detection of Glucose
      With standard curves found for both 10-ß and Iq, using casaminos, experiments were done to determine if we could induce greater growth with the addition of glucose.  Our initial experiment was with 10-ß and glucose was added in 10, 25 and 50 mM amounts.  The data showed that 10-ß responded negatively to added glucose, giving 600 nm ODs of greater than 35% less than our standard curve at all concentrations.
      An identical experiment was performed with Iq cells.  In this case, glucose increased growth by up to 38% (at 25 mM glucose) over the standard curve after 25 hours.  With a positive result, the experiment was repeated in triplicate.  The results confirmed those of the initial experiment.  In the presence of 10 mM glucose, the average OD at 600 nm, after 24 hours, was 67.9% (n=3) greater than our standard curve.
      Having confirmed that Iq cells respond positively to glucose in BG-11 media with casamino acids, we wanted to look at the levels of glucose we would need to feed our E. coli.  Other researchers have shown that Synechocystis PCC6803 agp knockouts are capable of producing 10 mM sucrose (Zhao, N., et al. 2003).  Another group has shown that introducing invA to cyanobacteria can convert nearly all cellular sucrose to fructose and glucose (Niederholtmeyer et al., 2010).  On the notion that 10 mM sucrose can be produced by knocking out agp and all sucrose can be converted to glucose, it was hypothesized that our maximum glucose output from Synechocystis would be 10 mM.  Our previous experiments had shown that there was no noticeable difference in growth increases between 10, 25 and 50 mM glucose, with 10 mM actually showing the greatest increases.  If we could detect even lower amounts than our hypothesized maximum, we would be ready to begin co-culturing.  An experiment was done, in triplicate, in which glucose was tested in BG-11 in the following decreasing concentrations: 10, 5.0, 2.5, 1.0, 0.50 mM.  Even at concentrations as low as 2"

The exterior of the cell contains no leucine at t=0 and is perfectly mixed
Extracellular diffusion of biomolecules happens much faster than the cell movement. Thus, diffusion is independent of cell movement and has a constant rate
Transcription
Transcription is the first step of gene expression. It involves the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter region of DNA and the formation of mRNA. The transcription rate is dependent on a number of conditions like the promoter strength and the used strain. Our system has both constitutive promoters, which are always active, and inducable promoters, which can be activated or repressed.
Maximum Transcription rate
First we will try to find the maximum transcription rate. The prediction of the transcription rate has been an important hold-back in the past, even though Polymerases per Second was introduced as a unit. This is the amount of Polymerases that passes through a given position in the DNA per time unit and is essentially the transcription rate at a particular location on the DNA [1] . We can use this value as the transciption rate of the whole gene because it is the value of the slowest and thus rate-defining step, the binding of polymerase on the promoter. It remained difficult to measure in vivo but Kelly et al. have introduced a way to measure the activity of promoters using an in vivo standard, promoter J23101. This gave rise to a new unit: Relative activity of promoter (RPU)$=\frac{PoPS_{phi}}{PoPS_{J23101}}$ with $phi$ being the promoter of interest. Through the use of relative units, the variability due to equipment and conditions was drastically decreased. The PoPS of J23101 was found to be 0.03 [2] .
As our constitutive promoter, we used J23114. On the iGEM website we found that the whole J constitutive promoter family had been characterized. From these measurements we conclude that J23114 has a PoPS of 0.00429. The strength of the pLuxPR promoter has been measured relatively to pLacIQ by iGEM Tokyo_Tech 2010. Using these measurements, we calculate the PoPS of pLuxPR to be 0.00169 PoPS. Next we sought values for pCI. iGEM NYMU-Taipei 2009 measured the pLux promoter relative to pCI, which allows us to calculate the PoPS for pCI: $\frac{1}{"

This routine                         step up treatment is not suitable for patients at risk of rapid disease progression and may                         delay optimal medication time and increase the risk of hospitalization and surgery. The use of                         top down therapy, that is, the preferential use of anti-TNF monoclonal antibody than the step                         up strategy can more effectively induce and maintain remission and change the disease process                         [25].
Figure 4. The current therapies to IBD patients. Left: step up therapy. Middle: top down therapy. Right: fecal microbiota transplantation.
Surgical treatment is often seen as a last resort, but as the understanding of the disease                         continues to deepen, it has been found that some patients with early-stage IBD have a better                         quality of life than patients who administrate biological agents [27]. This provides us with a                         new top down therapy that prioritizes the use of surgery. But for patients with complex IBD,                         surgical treatment can easily lead to disability and a significant decline in quality of life.
There are pros and cons of specific drug treatments. Non-specific anti-inflammatory drugs are                         inexpensive, and immunosuppressive agents are effective, which can reduce the need for surgery                         and hospitalization in patients with IBD, and reduce the risk of clinical recurrence and                         glucocorticoid dependence in patients with IBD [28]. However, non-specific anti-inflammatory                         drugs are prone to tolerance and fail. Biologics are currently the most effective drugs, but                         they are expensive and difficult for ordinary people to bear. For example, in the United                         States, 75 kg of IBD patients are treated with a standard dose of infliximab, which costs about                         $26,700 per year, while a year of azathioprine (a biologic immunosuppressive agents) costs only                         $750 per year [28]. Therefore, immunosuppressive agents are a reasonable and cost-effective                         treatment strategy for patients with IBD and still have value in use [28]. In addition, clinical studies have found that anti-TNF biologics combined with steroid immunosuppressive                         agents have better efficacy than monotherapy. At the same time, the risk of solid tumors and                         serious infections increases [29]. In short, IBD patients need tailored personalized treatment                         options.
The recent emergence of Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) provides a new option for the                         treatment for IBD. FMT is referred as transplanting the flora of healthy human feces into the                         intestine of a patient, rebuilding the normal intestinal"

P.hD. David de Jong is a professor of genetics and entomology at the University of São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto School of Medicine (specialist in pathology, biology, and management of Africanised honey bees); he is also technical Editor of an online scientific journal: Genetics and Molecular Research (GMR).
Our team leader, human practices leader, and our ethics, legal and mathematical model  representatives  were  present  in  this  40-minute  call  to
approach issues regarding their respective divisions. David the Jong is a researcher that has written in many papers we had previously found and read on bees; we thank MVZ Ernesto Tanús for contacting us with him. First off, he was curious if we were planning to test our peptides on the bee larvae or in the colony, so far, the idea was to test them against a bacterium within a culture in the lab, we were working on the time to see if we could test them in vivo on the larvae but we were not quite sure yet. He said that was a good first step and recommend us to emphasize that on our plan.
He was curious whether we know if it is feasible for beekeepers to eventually use our product, if it could be a costly production or if we have an idea of how much these peptides were going to cost in a final presentation. We mentioned him experimental procedures were still missing to solve these issues, like determining how much a bacterium can produce within a particular time and with given resources to give a better approximation of the cost.
He mentioned using AMPs in food for bees was newly and thinks it's feasible for us to test in culture and then determine which combination of AMPs works best to inhibit the bacteria. Before our phone call, we sent him our detailed project description to which he recommended us to add more details  on  our  justification  as  well  as  mention  the  importance  of  honey,  money
involved in its exportation and beekeeping in Mexico. He said we should also emphasize the impact of this diseases on the whole colony and beekeeping, “the larvae are interesting, but not so important concerning the application"".
Regarding the application method of our product, we were considering putting nanocapsules containing our AMPs within the bee’s liquid food substitute. He said it’s feasible, but we would want to make sure bees could digest them."

1 Motivation of our Project E.colipse
1.1 Skin Cancer protection
1.2 The Malignant Melanoma
2 References
Motivation of our Project E.colipse
E.colipse - intelligent sun protection aims to prevent sunburn and as a consequence of more protection ultimately reduce skin cancer incidence
Sun burn and skin damage from UV radiation are important issues when one exposes oneself to sun radiation for a tanning session without applying proper sun protection. Furthermore, UV radiation is always present on sunny days, but often no sun protection is applied before exposing oneself to sunlight. With our project E.colipse, intelligent sun protection, we want to create a sun protection where no one has to worry anymore if he is protected from sun or not since on exposure to sunlight, a protection molecule and a warning signal in form of a pigment are produced.
Skin Cancer protection
Among all cancers that, with the help of biological and clinical research, are better and better understood, melanoma has the highest increase in incidence rate (see figure on the left). Despite better prevention, treatment and detection melanoma is still one of the most abundant and dangerous cancers.
Our intelligent sun protection system aims to protect human skin from dangerous UV radiation, one of the major suspects in provoking DNA alteration in melanocytes that can lead to melanoma.
The Malignant Melanoma
Worldwide cancer incidence change in percent
Each year, approximately 160 000 new cases of malignant melanoma are diagnosed worldwide, of that 20-25 % finally lead to the death of the patient, making the malignant melanoma one of the most malignant existing cancers. It occurs more often in the light-skinned population of northern European countries as well as in highly UV–exposed"

From the sensitivity analysis, it can be seen that the Michaelis constant \(k_m^{Fdh}\) of the rate-limiting reaction is the most sensitive parameter. By changing the initial pH and temperature to the optimal value of the parameter \(k_m^{Fdh}\), the yield of butanol in the system can be effectively increased.

Track: Environment
Our project focused on improving the wastewater treatment process through uniting the functions of nitrification and denitrification in a single chassis. This system is more energy-efficient as less water oxygenation is required.
Knowing what legislation within the United States regulates the use of GMOs within the environment and with products such as drinking water is important if we want to make our project usable outside the laboratory.

Abstract from the 2005 ETHZ iGEM Wiki :
The project of the ETH Zurich team consists of the design and in vivo implementation of a gene circuit that can count to 2. In essence, the counter uses two toggle switches, each storing 1 bit, to keep track of the 4 internal states. The design of the counter is highly modular, with the hope that it can be included as a unit in larger circuits, and also combined with further counter instances to keep track of a much larger number of states, up to 2^n with n units. To facilitate further developments and integration to other projects, the parts of the counter are available in form of BioBricks. Among many exciting applications, the availability of a counter enables the execution of sequential instructions, and therfore paves the way for the execution of artificial programs inside living cells.

Wellesley_TheTech,2015,Team:Wellesley TheTech#Team#Notebooks_-_-_TEXT.html," the Widget shapes to circles, we ultimately changed our main Widget shape to be an ellipse.  This choice made us start to consider other ways that we can apply basic concepts of synthetic biology to our project, so we decided to have two forms of Widgets-- large white “E. Coli” and smaller, more colorful widgets that represent viruses.  We hoped to display and share the concept of bacteria absorbing or “eating” a virus.  Currently in our app, if a E.Coli and virus intersect, the E. Coli “eats” the virus and the virus appears within the E.Coli to represent its infection.  When an infected E.Coli collides with a non-infected E.Coli, the second E.Coli displays the same virus to represent contamination.  When you tap a virus, three new viruses are created to simulate the virus growing on its own.  We are struggling with keeping the virus within the boundaries of the E.Coli parent widget, and working on inspecting the Widgets’ locations and reference points so that we can better understand how to work with them.
6/4/2015: Day 4
Today was a very successful day!  We added movement to the Widgets so that when left unattended, the E.Coli and viruses float about on their own.  The use of markers has also been incorporated, so that tapping a marker to the screen creates a new Bacteria.   In addition, we managed to set boundaries around the screen to prevent the Widgets from going out of frame.  Another exciting new addition is that the E.Coli now individually grow in size and once they reach a certain size, divide into two separate E.Coli.  If the original E.Coli was infected with a virus, the new E.Coli will also display its infection.  This process is accurate and true to the natural E.Coli growth and division process. Our next step is hopefully to keep the Widgets from overlapping and to eventually make them bounce off of one another upon intersection.
6/5/2015: Day 5
We have started programming specific actions for specific markers-- now, one marker creates a new Bacteria, one removes that specific Bacteria, and one displays the bacteria’s infection status with a simple attached textbox that states “Infected” or “Not infected”.  We have also introduced ImageWidgets into our app so that we can have custom images deployed onto our app.  We have only just started to realize the vast number of directions that this app/exhibit can go in and the many different concepts it can teach, and this textbox that will"

As college student, the first step of our popularization was in the campus. We choose the students as our target objects and held a series of campus activities like delivering a lecture, visiting high school students, introducing synthetic biology in our campus open day.
In order to make the safety and application of synthetic biology accepted by more people, we did amount of efforts in the public outreach. The most influential we did is the synthetic biology exhibition in the Guangdong science center which let the public have a better understand of our theme, antimicrobial resistance.
We evaluated our method with the feedback from different people and analysis through our different filed of content.
Social Media
Life Science Community
The most efficient way to popularize the synthetic biology and antimicrobial resistance is through the media. There are many reports about what we did in public during the year, and we also published some articles in the journal of our school.
The ones who own the knowledge of skills to turn Synthetic Biology into real products are gathered in research labs of universities and companies. So we"

\(d_ug_a + d_af_u\gt 0\)
For \(g_a\lt 0, f_u\lt 0\), equation 6 is never satisfied whatever value d_u takes.
Requirement 2 unsatisfied, this model cannot form Turing pattern.
To meet the equation 6, \(f_u\) must be bigger than zero. And to satisfy this, the positive feedback
Therefore, there must be a system that has allee effect, or density dependant effect. The former means that ""When E. coli increases, the growth rate of E. coli also increases.""Allee effect is a positive correlation between population size and indivisual fitness. Mimura and Murray(1972) said that Allee effect is important for some pattern formation on predator-prey systems[1]. However, there is no Allee effect in E. coli. E. coli increase however little amount they are(one colony would be formed from one cell). The multiplication rate of E. coli is small when it’s introduced into culture medium, for it’s not adapted to the environment. But that doesn’t affect the formation of Turing pattern, because the equilibrium point of Turing pattern occurs on log phase or stationary phase.The latter is saying that ""When there are very much E. coli, the effect of AHL is not proportional to E. coli's density""; the effect will be lower. This is seen in the model of ""Prey-Predator model"". Since predator eats no more than they can eat, when preys are rich, the probablity of being killed of an indivisual prey would be decreased. However, since AHL is much smaller and richer than E. coli, there seems little chance to expect it to happen.
It seemed that both cannot be satisfied only by one type of E. coli. Therefore, we decided to solve this problem by using two types of E. coli and made positive-feedback-like system. Most positive feedback system have bistability (which does not exist in the system of population of E. coli). In other words, the space would be separated by two areas, according to the convergence value. The convergence value is polarized.  This is a kind of the system of the competition exclusion. To learn more about the principle of competition exclusion, see Murray, mathematical biology volume 1.
We wanted to realize competition exclusion system. We chose the system that utilizes colicin. See the system page for detail. Why colicin?"

The homemade laboratory safety deserves special attention, too. There are an awful lots of noxious chemical substances utilized in biological experiments, like EB and so on. Using safer substitutes to replace is a sort of solutions and nowadays many firms are also striving to design and manufacture these safe products, such as safer dyes to substitute EB. However, if these toxic agents are indispensable and irreplaceable, proper treatment and disposal of these hazardous agents and other bioactive poison is a vital procedure for conducting experiments at home. In this respect, some international biosafety standard is instrumental. To give an example, prior to disposal, all laboratory materials must be sterilized by autoclaving. All autoclave bags (including clear) MUST be marker with international biohazard symbol. After it, any bag must be over bagged again with an opaque trash bag, sealed and finally disposed. For various biotoxins, there are also multifarious corresponding decontamination procedures, it’s better to realize them before you commence the experiment. What’s more, children should be kept away from your homemade lab. Any slight negligence may cause serious results, so safety measures should always be fully considered before experiments. This arouses further concern about an efficient and effective management system. Though it is difficult to create a completely sterile environment at home, the idea of asepsis is still vital. As I see it, a special room should be emptied out to establish a lab, all dangerous laboratory things should be hidden in shelves carefully and necessary disinfection measures should also be taken every time you get in and out the lab. More details call for more people to concern.
To sum up, DIYbio is an unprecedented opportunity to spread science as well as an immense challenge to biosafety. How to make full use of its advantages and prevent the potential hazard, more considerations and practice are needed.

Cell Culturing Microfluidic | July - September 2017 | Harvard iGEM
This collaboration between the BostonU Hardware Team and the Harvard iGEM team was based around engineering a microfluidic system to culture cell and measure the resulting cell growth.   Each team was responsible for separate parts of the system.  The BostonU Hardware Team primarily worked on the design, manufacturing, and testing of the microfluidic device. The Harvard iGEM team primarily worked on an optical density sensor which was aimed to measure cell growth. Even though each team focused on individual parts of the system collaboration was imperative to test and develop each teams work.
Stage 1
The initial stage of the collaboration focused on outlining the goals we wanted to achieve from the collaboration. This meeting occurred over the summer after initial interest was sparked after hearing about each other's work at a local conference. The Harvard iGEM team had initially wanted to design the chip in order to do culture fiber producing cells.  After looking over the initial designs that the Harvard team produced, both teams agreed that more literature review was needed to redesign a new microfluidic chip.
Stage 2
After reviewing different cell culturing microfluidics devices, we had come across a microfluidic chemostat and turbidostat which matched the same functionality that both teams were looking to achieve. The teams agreed that this design was able to be manufactured and suitable for performing the cell culturing experiment.
The two main challenges that were involved with replicating the microfluidic chip were designing the microfluidic device and manufacturing the PDMS membrane with the proper thickness. An initial chip was designed by the BostonU Hardware team using circular chambers. After performing several tests, it was determined that the paper’s original design would be more suitable. The next step was to obtain the proper PDMS. The PDMS membrane needed to be extremely thin (75um thickness) in order to be actuated the full depth of the chamber. This prompted the BostonU Hardware team to learn how to spin coat PDMS in order to obtain the precise thickness. There was varied success in the beginning, but eventually we were able to get a consistent result."

Click here for a highly detailed overview of how the pipeline works.
Genome assembly
Raw genome data directly from a Next Generation Sequencing device comes in the form of files containing many pieces of DNA called ‘reads’. These reads are usually obtained through cutting up the genome and sequencing the small bits at random after amplifying them many times. The idea is that many reads will overlap and can be assembled like a big puzzle. Our pipeline uses a de novo assembler, meaning that it can assemble the reads from scratch, without a reference genome to map them to. This is done by a 'graph-based approach' The nodes of the graph represent whole reads or parts of each read called k-mers, while the edges represent the overlap between them. . 7 Once the genome is assembled into contigs A contig is a closed loop in the graph, the longest stretches of DNA possible from all of the reads. we can start doing gene prediction. In this pipeline we used the IDBA-UD The Iterative De Bruijn Graph De Novo Assembler for highly Uneven sequencing Depth (IDBA-UD) is a tool for assembling genomes in a de novo manner . 8
Gene prediction
The pipeline does gene prediction through the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) 9 that have been trained to distinguish between prokaryotic coding and non-coding regions. These regions are then translated using BioPython's 10 translate function. These are the proteins we compare to our existing Cry Protein database 11 In this pipeline we used the GeneMarkS utilizes a non-supervised training procedure and can be used for a newly sequenced prokaryotic genome with no prior knowledge of any protein or rRNA genes. program for this purpose. 12
Machine Learning
As Cry proteins are a group that is hard to define biologically, other than having highly specific toxic activity, it is somewhat of a challenge to find them through means other than direct sequence comparisons. This is why we use three methods to find potential Cry proteins:
A direct sequence comparison with a stringent cut-off defined to be an E valueExpect value is the"

Thus we created a BioBrick of the supP tRNA that included 100bp upstream and downstream of the tRNA gene and validated that it indeed worked in amberless cells: BBa_K1499251 .
We thought of several design strategies for implementing Codon Security. Among them were placing the supP tRNA on a separate plasmid, incorporating supP into the amberless genomic DNA, and placing it under an inducible promoter. We moved forward with a testing construct with the reporter gene + stop codons and tRNA in the same plasmid. The reason was that we wanted to perform the hardest test on system first and then employ more creative solutions only if it failed this robustness test. With the gene and tRNA on the same construct, it is easier for non-amberless cells to express the protein. However, we hypothesized that the supP tRNA would be toxic enough to non-amberless cells, because it would read through UAG stops, that mutations to the tRNA would be selected for. We tested this hypothesis by transforming DH5-alpha and amberless cells with the test plasmids and measuring protein output.
Figure 3. Workflow for Amberless Hell Cell side of the project. We isolated 5 radiation resistance genes from D. radiodurans genomic DNA using PCR. We moved forward with 2 candidates, uvsE and MntH.  We first tested the radiation resistance they conferred in DH5-alpha. Then, we performed mutagenesis PCR at 2-3 leucine codons to create nonsense mutations, tested non-functionality in DH5-alpha, and recovered radiation resistance in amberless by adding the supP tRNA construct.
For the Amberless Hell Cell, we are taking resistance genes found in extremophiles in nature and mutating leucine codons into stop codons before putting the genes into the Amberless chassis. In this way, we produce cells that can withstand stresses, like dessication, pH, and radiation, but cannot transfer those capabilities to other organisms. We focused on radiation resistance genes this summer, drawing both from bricks produced by the 2012 Stanford-Brown iGEM Team and new bricks produced by this year's team.

The absorbance curves showed peaks characteristics of the respective carotenoids: at wavelength 474nm for lycopene, and 456nm for β-carotene. In the case of β-carotene, we used pure β-carotene of known amount as the standard reference and included it in the graph below.
Lycopene-producing device (constitutive)
Lycopene in cells (pellet from 20mL LB culture at 37°C for 24h) was extracted with 300μL acetone. For each reading, 100μL acetone exextract was diluted with 100μL water and loaded on to MicroPlate Reader for a full spectrum. Each graph shows the average of two readings. Value normalised with blank (50% acetone) and OD600.
β -carotene-producing device (constitutive)
β-carotene in cells (pellet from 20mL LB culture at 37°C for 24h) was extracted with 500μL acetone. 100μL acetone extract was diluted with 100μL water and loaded on to MicroPlate Reader for a full spectrum scan. Value normalised with blank (50% acetone) and OD600. Pure carotene (from Invitrogen) was added as standard. Each graph shows average of three readings.
To investigate the induction of pigment production, we tested our device K274220 in E.coli MG1655 and 1mM arabinose was added to LB culture. Cell culture that was induced with arabinose showed greater β-carotene production than cell culture without arabinose, indicating the feasibility of inducing pigment production. Using known amount of pure β-carotene to construct a standard curve, we were able to estimate the amount of β-carotene produced per unit volume of cell culture by our device.

From 2010.igem.org
Monday 19th  July - Early (9:00 am) start for a few to attempt to get some more web design done. We started labs today by finding out that our banana E.coli had once again failed, but we're still determined to get E.coli that don't smell like E.coli, so for part of the day we transformed a wintergreen and 2 other banana plasmids into E.coli, in case there was a problem with the DNA in the first well.
Meanwhile we looked at sponsorship and added some finishing touches for our presentation in Newcastle tomorrow. At 15:30 we presented our progress to the advisors fearing a grilling...
Grilling again was not as bad as expected. The advisors were impressed by all of our work so far and were happy that the genes we ordered cost much less than what they were fearing. After completing our presentation, we worked a bit on the buttons for the wiki and on some genetics.
