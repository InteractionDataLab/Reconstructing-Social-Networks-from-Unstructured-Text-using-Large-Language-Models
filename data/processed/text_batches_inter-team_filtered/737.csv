LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#project_-_-_TEXT.html," have various areas of application in life science, including protein detection, pulldown experiments and even immunotherapy. Having originally been discovered in 1995 during an in vitro screening for antibodies against cytomegaloviral proteins [6] , the A3C5 antibody is an established molecular tool for specific recognition of proteins. By tagging cell surface proteins with an epitope specifically recognized by A3C5 (being a peptide sequence of 11 amino acids), one is easily able to detect tagged proteins via immunofluorescence microscopy, FACS or one may purify them via pulldown experiments. Through the latter, one may also screen for in vivo interaction partners of the tagged protein.
mRuby 3
Having originally been engineered as a monomeric form of the red fluorescent protein eqFP611, mRuby variants are sine of the brightest red fluorescent proteins available. [7] With an excitation maximum at a wavelength of 558 nm and an emission wavelength maximum of 605 nm, the resulting stokes shift of 57 nm makes mRuby a good choice for fluorescent microscopy imaging and, thus, allows the visualization of the receptor in its cellular environment by being fused to the C-terminus of the transmembrane domain. mRuby is especially powerful for the fusion with receptors - not only due to its small size and high stability, but also due to the fact that, in comparison with eGFP, it appears up to 10 times brighter in membrane enviroments. The mRuby variant used here is mRuby 3, having been engineered for even more improved brightness and photostability. [8]
Strep-tag II
The Strep-tag II is an eight amino acid peptide sequence (WSHPQFEK) that specifically interacts with streptavidin and can thus be used for easy one-step purification of the receptor via biochemical and immunochemical methods. [9]
Nanoluciferase
The concept of bioluminescence has a great meaning for several invertebrate species, allowing communication with other individuals, signaling receptiveness or deterring predators. [10] The most common enzyme responsible for the creation of bioluminescence are the luciferases (from the latin words ’lux’ and ’ferre’, meaning ’light-carrier’).  These enzymes, among others found in fireflies and deep-sea shrimp, commonly consume a substrate called luciferin as well as energy in the form of ATP or reduction equivalents in order to create light-emission through oxidation. The underlying mechanism hereby relies on the creation of an instable, highly excited intermediate under the consumption"

Vector construction
We used Spe I and Pst I to do dual digestion in pSB1C3 which contained HSP gene and recycled gene fragments in 2117bp, used Spe I and Pst I to do dual digestion in pSB1C3 which contained pBAD gene and recycled gene fragments in 3280bp, used Xbal I and Pst I to do dual digestion in pSB1C3 and recycled gene fragments in 4208bp.
We use T4 ligase to link phaC1-A-B1 to the down stream of HSP promoter and pBAD promoter, then transform the vectors to Trans 5α for plasmid extraction. The agarose gel result showed that the plasmids were all in their correct size.
Fig.2 Agarose gel result of linkage production
(the strap size of HSP+P(3HB)+pSB1C3 is about 6325bp, and of pBAD+P(3HB)+pSB1C3 is about 7488bp.)
We sent the plamids with correct size to sequencing, the results showed that phaC1-A-B1 was successfully linked to the down stream of HSP promoter and pBAD promoter.
Induced expression
We transformed the correct plasmids to TransB(DE3) for expression, and set different conditions for inducement as shown in table 1.

We reported the effect of gene silence to our teacher. We found out some abnormal data in the diagram. Maybe we had some mistake in the step of mixing the solution. So we prepared to do the RT-PCR once again. But this time, unfortunately, we put PCR Tubes Strip in wrong way. So we plan to do the experiment again tomorrow. We believed that failure can let us go further.
We observed a strong fluorescence from the cells transfected yesterday.
Wednesday 19/8
We went to Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital of Guangdong Province for visiting patients and making a survey. We communicate myocardial ischemia with the patients. We prepared some questions to ask them and we hope to get some useful references about the disease. We asked in detail about the disease and encourage them to establish confidence, adherence to treatment. On the one hand, in this interview, some patients pointed out that the frequency of taking medicine quite bothered him, and almost every patient should take with the emergency treatment drug all the time. We found that most of the patients not only had cardiovascular disease but also had diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disease and so on. On the other hand, we know that the healthcare system of China were good but quite inadequate. It definitely reduced patients’ financial burden. But we found that there were still some problems in the healthcare system. We concluded four major problems, for example, low coverage, lack of unity, the high insurance beyond reality and a waste of personal account in the process of constructing the social medical insurance system. After the visit, we shook hand with patients and showed our gratitude to the doctors and nurses who gave us support.
In the progress of experiment, we detected the concentration of cGMP in the cells which we transfected the day before yesterday by ELISA. And we found that the content of cGMP in the third group increased by twenty percent.
Thursday 20/8
We inoculated the shRNA puncture bacteria in different sites, the concentration of AMP in medium was 100ng/ul.
Friday 28/8
Today we conducted the experiment of No’s positive control. We measured the concentration of cGMP by Elisa. There was a significant difference between adding cysteine 20min later and adding cysteine 30 min later.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," about healthy ageing?
So what is biosynthage going to do about this? Currently, treatments for the elderly focus on treating each age-related disease. Biosynthage are working on therapies that prevent the onset of all these diseases. We have created a suite of solutions that are specific to organs that we feel are vital to human health and believe that targeting healthy ageing via many routes is the best way to maximise our ability to increase the healthy human lifespan. The health challenges currently posed by ageing are many and complex so we propose a suite of synthetic biology solutions, to tackle the challenges shown below. Click on the links to find out more:
Lungs: As you get older, the ability of your major organs to work at their maximal capacity is lost. One of these important organs is the lungs. These changes contribute to an older person's reduced ability to do vigorous exercise, especially intense aerobic exercise. We propose a gene therapy that over-expresses antioxidant Superoxide Dismutase 3, as a way to reduce oxidative damage that causes cells to age.
Gut: Increasing evidence suggests that oxidative damage to cells in the gut is one of the main causes of the ageing of gut cells. We are developing a bacterial oxidative stress sensitive probiotic that releases lycopene antioxidant in the presence of oxidative stress in the gut.
Teeth: Healthy teeth, healthy ageing. The health of your teeth can directly impact the health of your body. Studies suggest that accumulation of dental plaque leads to periodontal disease as well as hypertension. We are building plaque removing devices that minimise this risk. It is also known that plaque causing bacteria produce an acidic environment. We have created our bacteriocin producing device that responds to low pH conditions using our SPY promotor.
Heart: Bacteria in your mouth can directly influence the health of your heart. We are building engineered oral bacteria that lower blood pressure, reducing the risk of heart attacks.
Lubricant: Lubricant is a substance used to reduce the friction. It can be used as a personal lubricant for sexual activities as well as for the insertion of catheters in hospitals. This is very important for the elderly as they are the main population of hospitalised patients receiving catheters and STIs have been on the rise in elderly populations over the past years.
Pest control: Decreasing the healthy lifespan of pests can be another alternative way to kill pests, such as Whitefly. We have used RNAi to remove the Vitellogenin receptor that would cause Whitefly to die as a result of accumulated oxidative stress.

Parts Submitted to the Registry
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts on the Registry than on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
When should you put parts into the Registry?
As soon as possible! We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better recall you will have of all details surrounding your parts. Remember you don't need to send us the DNA to create an entry for a part on the Registry. However, you must send us the sample/DNA before the Jamboree. Only parts for which you have sent us samples/DNA are eligible for awards and medal requirements.
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)

1 Integrated Human Practice regarding future application
In order to broaden the prospect for applications of our device, we conducted an interview with various people. Among them, the problem of salt damage was overwhelmingly rising from people's mouth like a big problem. Salt damage is caused by a large amount of salt remaining in cropland and we learned that this is a worldwide problem and even it is also common in Japan. Therefore, we started to think that we could propose a salt-sucking device as one of the solution methods for salt damage. We incorporated the opinions of experts, thought about how to use it even in and out of the lab environment i.e. in an actual field.
1-1 About Salt damage
We contacted many of the salt damage experts and started human practice activity from learning about real-world problems caused by salt damage. Salt damage occurs in 1/5 of the world's agricultural land. In Japan as well, due to the tsunami associated with the 2011 earthquake off the Pacific coast of Tohoku, 2.6% of the cultivated land area in the Tohoku region was affected. In Miyagi prefecture alone, 11% of the arable land area suffers from salt damage. In the world, food shortages are a concern because of the exponential growth of the human population. If effective agricultural land is lost due to salt damage, it is clear that the food shortage situation will become more and more serious.
Soil salinization caused by irrigation(Provided by Prof.Funakawa)
1-2 How to apply device to field
Can our device perform desalination of problematic salt water in agricultural land? First, we asked Prof. Funakawa of Kyoto University who is familiar with the soil. In our initial thought, we were thinking of removing all salt from the area where salt damage is occurring and making it an agricultural land where crops can be raised once again. However, Prof. Funakawa insisted that ""It is not realistic to have the yeast to absorb all the salt because about 1 t / ha of salt is accumulated on farmland where salt damage is chronically occurring."" Based on"
KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Human Practices#HansJonas_-_-_TEXT.html," we compare this new categorical imperative with the categorical imperative of Kant (Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law without contradiction), we may notice several differences. Firstly, the imperative of Jonas contains an explicit reference to time. In this re-formulation of Kant’s categorical imperative, we do find a reference to time, more precisely, a reference to a time span far beyond one’s own lifespan. We have seen that Jonas emphasized explicitly this aspect. However, although Kant’s imperative does not contain an explicit reference to time, his imperative does not exclude a relation to temporality. Jonas is more explicit on this aspect. Secondly, one can get the impression that the new categorical imperative is no less anthropological than the classical one. Still, in the philosophy of Jonas, the human plays a key role, but he is not placed above or against nature. Neither has the human part of the nature an intrinsic value as a whole. Jonas emphasizes that nature has its own value and teleology which should be distinguished from the value of human beings. This position may be called hybrid, for he both emphasizes the value of human beings and shifts away from it. This hybrid position of Jonas is a difficult one, and perhaps incompatible. Thirdly, the addressee is different. The Kantian categorical imperative is directed to the individual and his conduct, whereas Jonas’ categorical imperative is directed to the collective conduct (Melle, 1999). In the first instance, the new ethical perspective is political.
Jonas thinks he can overcome the ‘Sein-Sollen-dichotomie’ or, in English, the is-ought problem (figure 2). The first step in his reasoning is that the whole nature is teleological, it is purposeful. Setting a purpose is assigning it as valuable. The second step contains a incorporation of axiology in ontology. In other words, Jonas wants to demonstrate that purposeful is better than purposeless. The proof of this argument lies in its intuitive character. This reasoning is very problematic: Not his teleological attitude towards nature, but the naïve epistemology of Jonas’ metaphysics is very problematic. The compelling force, in terms of universal application, of this ethical frameworks, which Jonas promises us to develop, is lacking.
The practical application of Jonas’ principle of responsibility
In the second chapter of Das Prinzip Verantwortung, Jonas tries to answer two questions. The first question asks about the foundations of ethics in the era of modern technology. The second questions its practical application, in which Jonas chiefly emphasizes the role of politics."

Connection to Project
Biofilms function as a platform to sustain the whole system in vitro. Biofilm-anchored nanorods can efficiently convert photons to electrons, which transfer to engineered strain producing FeFe hydrogenase gene cluster, thereby achieving high-efficiency in biohydrogen production. In addition, a brilliant traits, the intrinsic adherence of biofilms towards various interfaces, allows us to grow biofilms on easy-separation micro-beads. Based on those merits, biofilm stand out by facilitating recyclable usage of the biofilm-anchored NRs and endowing this whole system with recyclability.
Introduction
Biofilms are ubiquitous as they can be found both in human and some extreme environments. They can be formed on inert surfaces of devices and equipment, which will be hard to clean and cause dysfunction of the device.
However, we view it through different lenses to transform this ill impact into merits. We envision to establish the Solar Hunter system on E.coli’s biofilm. Biofilm can substantially increase the resistance of bacteria to adverse conditions like acid or oxidative stress and form a stable and balanced system. These traits make them easily grow with low cost and elevate bacteria’s adaptability. So it will be a good practice to applied to industry environment.
What’s more, biofilm can automatically assemble extracellularly grow by static adherence, which facilitates regeneration and recycling in mass production in industry. Startlingly, biofilms can also serve as a synthetic nonconductive biological platform for self-assembling function materials. The amyloid protein CsgA, which is the dominant component in E.coli, can be programmed to append small peptide without losing biological activity of peptide and self-assemble function of CsgA. Also, it has been tested that CsgA subunits fused with not too large peptide can be tolerated by curli export machinery and maintain the self-assembly function[1]. In all, we highlight the recyclability, stability, scalability, and versatility of biofilm in our system as a design that is truly applicable.
Motivation
For the reasons above, biofilms become our best candidate to engineer and would be equipped with some additional functions we want. Here,"

ARCHAEAL COLLABORATION STUDY: HOW WE DID IT
STEP ONE: THE IDEA
We were interested in signing up for the E. Coli. collaboration study earlier this year, but were disappoint to learn that our archaeal study could not contribute to the Interlab’s framework. This led to our idea to create a new InterLab study of our own utilizing our labs methanococcus mCherry stocks.
STEP TWO: INITIAL PROPOSAL
Since early 2015, the University of Georgia iGEM team has been working on establishing a sound, effective, and universal protocol and logistics system to circulate mCherry samples on a largescale circuit for fluorescence measurements. We decided to contact iGEM headquarters officially early June 2015 with a formal proposal to motion for a new Archaeal InterLab study modeled after the current E. coli InterLab administered by iGEM. We suggested that we send out our own collection of mCherry protein extracts from our methanococcus experiments. iGEM Headquarters and the Measurement Division advised us to pursue a sort of ‘pilot’ InterLab, which we began calling the Archaeal Collaboration Study.
STEP 3: PREPERATION
After a few weeks of carefully refining our proposal, gaining proper clearance from the biosafety office, developing the shipment system, creating registration and data input forms, and creating a universal protocol for measuring mCherry protein florescence, we were ready to contact an assortment of iGEM research teams across the United States gauging general interest in our collaboration study.
STEP 4: GAUGE INTEREST
An assortment of teams across the United States were contacted with our proposal and an invitation to join the collaboration effort. We were truly inspired by the level of interest we received from the feedback and began to slowly build up the network of participating teams we have today. Slowly but surely, we built up a network of 9 participating teams: University of Georgia, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stony Brook University, University of California at San Francisco, Carnegie Mellon University, College of William & Mary, Genspace, Columbia University, and Vanderbilt University. We can’t thank our participating teams enough for their support and efforts toward our study.
STEP 5:"
SJTU-Software,2015,Team:SJTU-Software#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"olerance mechanisms, among which sodium export is the most important one. Halorhodopsin is a light-driven inward-directed chloride pump from halobacteria. They functionally expressed it in cyanobacteria to drive the influx of chloride together with sodium, thus conferring cyanobacteria the ability to absorb salts to a significant degree. And the biobrick they used in their program is to control the expression quantity of HR protein which served as the pump.
Our goal is to evaluate their biobrick by scoring two parallel experiment results.
we got the new devices and its structure from SJTU-BioX-Shanghai and noticed that the parts was built by themselves not long ago. when we download the database data, they had not upload their new biobrick. So we could not find the parts' ID from the new devices in our database.
In order to evaluate the new parts, we use the blastn to find the parts in our database with most similar sequence compared to the new parts. Then we use the parts found in our database to evalue the the new devices. We found the coding parts in the device is most important, so our algorithm give the coding part a highest weight.
And the consequence of this collaboration is very ideal. The two devices got two disparate scores, one of which is scored 32.98 and the other is 3.542. In addition, this difference is also reflected by their experiment result that the one with the higher score is chosen as their final biobrick to control the expression of the iron pump.
so this collaboration prove that our algorithm can evaluate new device roughly on the base of existing part.
This year, China-Tongji used the optogenetics technology to control  the simple movement of nematodes. In the pathognostic motoneuron and muscles of nematodes, the opsin will be expressed, which is a type of photosensitive channel protein that will be activated at a specific wavelength of light. Then it will stimulate some neurons and ultimately achieve the purpose of nematode movement control.
However, during the evaluation, we found that some of their biobricks are so new that we nearly couldn't find them in our database which covered the data in the iGEM official website. The result showed that those biobricks were never synthesized before.
Beyond that, we also found the regulator BBa_K1634003 is almost 80% similar to BBa_K309026 which is made by a team from Canada. This result might be used to compare the function of their biobricks with the other team, and explored more useful information from"
Minnesota,2015,Team:Minnesota#Software#PyMOL360_-_-_TEXT.html," three PCSK1 fragments were joined into the the full 2300 bp product using overlap extension PCR. The full PCSK1 product was cloned into the shipping vector. Cloning primers were not designed for PCSK1 with flanking BioBrick consensus sequences. PCSK1 was cloned into the pCR®Blunt II-TOPO® vector, provided by Invitrogen.
E. coli C2566 cultures were transformed with PCSK1- pCR®Blunt II-TOPO®. PCSK1- pCR®Blunt II-TOPO® was isolated  from transformation cultures and used as a template for PCR amplification of PCSK1 with our insulin primers that contained the BioBrick consensus sequence.
Two transformations were performed using Escherichia coli C2566, one with pSB1C3-Insulin and another with pSB1C3-PCSK1. Both constructs were submitted for sequencing.
Results
The products that were cloned into the shipping vector were verified by gel electrophoresis (Figure 1).
Several colonies were identified in colony screens for PCSK1 and insulin in transformants containing the shipping vector. Seen below are verification gels for PCSK1 and insulin.
Figure 1. PCR colony screen of PCSK1-pSB1C3 transformants. Note the banding in each lane at roughly 750 bp, consistent with the second fragment of PCSK1.
Figure 2. PCR colony screen of Ins-pSB1C3 transformants. Banding can be seen at roughly 333 bp, consistent with the full insulin ORF.  Sequencing data received for both PCSK1 and insulin was inconclusive.

Table 2. The predicted process emissions of producing StyGreen in our bioreactor[ 3 ]
This is a lot better than 7.8 CO2-eq per kg for petroleum-based styrene. However, at this point in time our conversion are not yet 100%. For each kilo of styrene we produce, we need 263 kilograms of cellulose (recycled toilet paper) right now . This would result in 24.89 CO2-eq per kg, which is way worse than regular (petroleum-based) styrene. This partly due to the assumptions made in the flux model, which assumes that yeast needs have a net biomass gain at all times. While, that is not necessary in our bioreactor. Moreover, the first version of our yeast is just a proof of concept. There are still a lot of parts that can be optimized. Both in the yeast strain itself, in the form of knock-outs, and in the bioreactor, by reducing the process emissions.
Conclusions
Toilet paper waste is used as the primary raw material in the biorefinery to produce styrene. The reason for this it is not used for feeding humans. The other reason is we can add value to this product.
Currently the process is not sustainable (based on flux model, with mass balance of 263 : 1)
We could still optimize our process a lot, so we should be able to decrease the mass balance by a lot. And starting from a mass balance of 33 : 1 we are cleaner than petroleum-based styrene
We can also improve the process emissions, lower process emissions means our mass balance can be higher (at the moment the process emissions are more than 28% of the total emissions of petroleum-based styrene).

Average thrust =0.41pN. In the Berg and Brown paper it states that the speed of the bacteria up an aspartate chemotactic gradient increases by 7%. Therefore in our model we shall use the following; thrust DOWN the Asp gradient =0.41pN, up the Asp gradient = 0.4387pN. Data was obtained from 32 AW405s, a strain which has provided the majority of our previous parameters but is not as motile as MG1655. The value was obtained at 23ºC in viscosity 0.93 and 3.07 cP for motility buffer and motility buffer with 0.18% methylcellulose, respectively. The standard deviation is not used as the speed is fixed at 50µm.s-1 . 0.57pN is the average thrust generated in strain HCB30 (a non tumbling strain). The thrust value was obtained when the imposed flow (U) U=0 at 23ºC. O.41pN was calculated using the resistance force theory treating the flagellar bundle as a single filament.

A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.

An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the"

About future Human Practices
Even though Wiki Freeze and the Giant Jamboree are here, we have still some human practices left after all this. We will be presenting our project results and achievements from the Jamboree to some of our sponsors, as well as school representatives. As a part of the recruiting the next year’s team, we will present our project in a few different events, such as the Water Day of the Aalto Unviersity School of Engineering, where different projects related to the water industry are presented, and the Career Day of Faculty of Biological and Environmental Sciences of the University of Helsinki.
“ These experts gave us much appreciated information and new perspectives to our ideas ”
Integrated Human Practices
Meeting with experts
When our team started brainstorming for the project idea, our general knowledge of what would be feasible and what wouldn’t was quite insufficient. We had a many meetings right in the beginning of our project just to hear from different experts what they consider to be synthetic biology, what they thought of our various ideas and how they would proceed with the project. Especially talking with our primary PI Markus Linder directed our brainstorming and ideation, which finally led up to the final design of the project. Even though many experts gave us advice and guided our brainstorming, deciding about the topic and more precise plans were left for ourselves.
When we had decided on the top three project ideas, we met with researchers working with these different subjects as a part of the background research we did about the different options. We found about the Cyanobacteria research group of the University of Helsinki and met with them. And what a goldmine it was! Thanks to input from Kaarina Sivonen and her group, the decision about our project subject was finalized. We much appreciate that they truly dared to turn some of our ideas down, if they thought that these ideas wouldn’t result in a successful"

Public Outreach
We have made public engagement and education a cornerstone of our 2016 iGEM work. Through a variety of educational initiatives and public events, we have taught close to a 1000 students, talked to hundreds of adults, and are working in schools to promote learning and inquiry into synthetic biology and science research. This section documents our public engagement activities that are apart from our Building with Biology outreach activities.
2015 Loudoun STEM Day
October 17, 2015
Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA) Loudoun Campus
Loudoun STEM Day is an all day event for families organized by the Northern Virginia Community College to showcase opportunities in science, technology, engineering and math. It is the largest STEM event in Loudoun County.
Building on the success of last year’s iGEM, we were able to secure a spot as an exhibitor at this event.  Our iGEM team held hands-on, fun learning activities at our booth. We exposed students to molecular biology with activities such as Twizzler DNA, DNA Trait Bracelets, and Plasmid DNA. These activities were modeled off the 2015 William and Mary iGEM team’s Synthetic Biology Teacher Curriculum. As we worked with the students during the hands-on activities, we used team-created colorful printed graphics to help parents and students better understand DNA and traits and to gain a sense of how that leads to engineering biological parts.
To teach people about the vast range in size of things in the world, from a cell to the DNA inside the cell to the molecules that make the DNA, we set up monitors with the “Size of the Universe” , an interactive online program. At a third station, we used our iGEM poster and wiki to talk about our research and engage parents in a discussion about synthetic biology.
The event far exceeded our expectations; from 10 am until after 4 pm, we worked with large groups of kids and adults at our booth. With no break for lunch, because of a perpetual line of kids at our tables, we kept talking to parents and students and working through the day. Because of the unexpected high volume of attendees, we ran"

Safety Checklist
Read about Safe Project Design, Safe Lab Work, and Safe Shipment
Notice the few hard-and-fast rules we have: don't use organisms from Risk Group 3 or 4, and don't release our project into the wild
Know our local guidelines: talk to our team instructors and our institution's biosafety officers
Ask for help: email safety (at) igem (dot) org, or join the iGEM team for Virtual Open Office Hours
Safe Organisms
We use two kinds of organisms, Escherichia coli and Caenorhabditis elegans in our experiments. E.coli is categorized as a Risk Group 1 organism [1] while C.elegans is on the whitelist [2] . According to the official iGEM description, “Risk Group 1 organisms do not cause disease in healthy adult humans.” and organisms on the whitelist “do not cause any threat to the environment”. To make sure that everything is safe enough to use, we have always been talking to our lab technician, Mr. Ho xx, about the proper usage, storage and disposal methods.
Safe Project Design
Safety is always our first priority when carrying out the program. Although the only species we use is E.coli and C.elegans, which are only organisms which do not cause harm to human when used properly, we believe that there is still a danger when our bacteria is released into the public environment, especially to children and elderlies. For example, it may cause bacteria to develop antibiotics resistance and make more diseases incurable [3] . Therefore, we make sure that no bacteria or organism carrying our modified genes will be released out of the laboratory. To achieve this, the bacteria will always remain inside the laboratory; we always bring worms into the laboratory but not our bacteria outside the laboratory into the public environment. While doing any experiment with e.coli, we ensure the bacteria do not expose to the environment by setting up a sterile space using a Bunsen burner and working in the heated area. Also to keep the bacteria away from the open environment, we seal every used petri dishes with parafilm before"

HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION
Last year, the 2013 VGEM team reached out to Renaissance School and offered to teach a class on synthetic biology and the iGEM experience. Renaissance accepted, and the VGEM team visited the school once a week for six weeks during the fall. This pilot class has now become a regularly offered course at Renaissance School, and students taught by the 2014 VGEM competed at the 2014 High School iGEM competition. The work of the 2013 team inspired this year’s team to continue and expand their collaborative efforts with other schools in the community.
The Math, Engineering and Science Academy (MESA) at Albemarle High School
A New Partnership
We began the summer by reaching out to specialized science programs at public high schools in Albemarle County. We met with Jeff Prillaman, the director of the MESA program, to discuss teaching a synthetic biology crash course similar to our predecessors with his students. He accepted our offer, and we spent the summer preparing a three-day synthetic biology crash course to be presented to students in the program. Team members taught the synthetic biology course over the week of September 8th. The first class consisted of a general overview of basic molecular biology and an introduction to the field of synthetic biology; this curriculum was taught to both juniors (60) and seniors (40) in the MESA program. The second class focused on BioBrick formation and lab work.  Seniors completed a restriction enzyme digest worksheet, loaded, ran and visualized a gel and transformed and plated bacteria containing plasmids with an RFP construct. The third class was split into two mini-lectures on the modeling used in synthetic biology and a discussion of the ethics involved in synthetic biology research. The students were given pre and post-assessments for this crash course.
Figure 1. Average points obtained on each question was compared using data from 25 students on pre and post assessments.
THE RESULTS
Figure 1 illustrates an overall improvement in student performance after the three-day course. From Figure 2, we can see that the topic that showed the most improvement was restriction enzymes with a 40% difference between pre and post assessments. Questions on gel electrophoresis also improved with a 33% difference on diagram identification and 32% difference on identification of the laboratory process.  Questions on"

2. Open-Source Insulin Pump / Cloud Monitoring
BACKGROUND
Insulin pumps have been designed already to remove the need of needle injections following meals by diabetics. These pumps however have been designed to function with a single company's insulin, which means that your insulin determines the pump brand that you use. Recently, there has been a calling for an open source insulin pump which is universal to all insulins. [1] Furthermore, continuous glucose monitoring in the cloud has recently become an open source system, could be integrated in with the insulin pump to remove the day-to-day stress of blood-sugar control.[2]
ISSUES
The technology could be modified to serve the whims of a totalitarian regime…however this is the case with all science these days.
Doesn’t really impact any issues of inaccessibility to insulin felt by a large portion of diabetic globally on its own.
Insulin pumps are specialized for a single insulin, which also means that a specific insulin would need to be designed for it. Unless of course the pump could be designed to universal, but we are unsure as to how this would work.
These insulin pumps are extremely complex medical device, may have to be reverse engineered with long term patents still covering a significant portion of these technologies.
3. Standard Business Model
BACKGROUND
Following a standard business model, a patented insulin could be taken to market following the completion of relevant clinical trials. Upscaled purification protocols would be needed to ensure efficiency and to meet cost-effective price points. The new business could either license an existing manufacturing plant to produce the insulin, OR could design a new manufacturing plant to leverage new technologies. If the later option were chosen, Good Manufacturing Practice approval and upkeep would be needed.[3]
ISSUES
Likely need about US$20m for a medium-scale facility, which will still have little impact on the global insulin supply.
Initial investment will leave manufacturer vulnerable to a price war if price drops suddenly.
Good Manufacturing Practice licenses would cost around US$100M, with additional yearly costs  required to maintain this status.
4. Private Investment
BACKGROUND
We could rethinking the road to market for open-source medicine. Rather than a single entity attempting to get approval for a patent, allow individuals and businesses to  invest in"

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook )."

2014 iGEM Project
Fixing Nitrogen and Sensing Light
What was our goal?
There were two key components of our project:
Richard and Caroline were working in the Pakrasi lab, and had been using genes from cyanobacteria to get nitrogen fixation working in E. coli. They were testing nitrogen fixation by running acetylene reduction assays and designing experiments to test the optimal criteria (ie. E. coli strains, temperature, nitrogen source) to get maximal results.

Ben and Jeffery worked in the Moon lab, and cloned plasmids to create a system that represses and expresses a fluorescent protein with the presence and absence of light, and were running experiments to test the induction levels compared to various positive and negative controls.

The top two graphs shows tAI levels over these organisms, with our genes of interest marked in red (AMO, HAO and cytochromes for N. europaea and Nir for P. aeruginosa), and the bottom two graphs show heterologous expression of the same genes of interest in E. coli.  The grey area shows the distribution of tAI values over all genes in the organism specified.  Click for a larger image.
Conclusions and Discussion
Without codon optimization, the genes that we are interested in have tAI values close to the mean for E. coli.  This is sufficient for our purposes, and codon optimization is not necessary.  If we wanted to express these genes at a higher rate, there is room to codon optimize, however, since many of these genes code for membrane proteins, we are concerned about expression at too high a level that will lead to membrane stress in E. coli.

We will place CRO on the pBAD plasmid with the pBAD promoter (or on pLAT with a pBAD promoter), and the pBAD promoter is induced by arabinose.
KP 5/1/13 Today we were trained in Cholera handling safety and we made our plans and goals for a summer full of success.
5/3/13
KP 5/3/13 Today Kendall and I did PCR for the first time. Jordan and Clarice showed us how to do it. We did PCR on our E. Coli that has our lysogenic lambda encased within. We also froze down our lambda e. coli samples for future use.
KK 5/3/13 Kelton and I worked with Jordan today to PCR amplify the CRO gene from π9907-infected E.Coli. We boiled the E.Coli to use as template and then followed the PCR protocol as outlined. Jordan actually was performed most of the protocol so that we could learn. Our control was E.Coli that had not been infected with lambda.
5/6/13
KK 5/6/13 We ran a gel of our PCR product that we had created over the weekend. This was the first time I had ever done so, so it was fun and interesting! To make the gel, we mix 100 mL of TAE buffer with 1 gram of agar and heat in the microwave. The agar powder needs to completely dissolve. That mixture, with ethidium bromide, is added to the gel dock, and let set for about 20 minutes, or if you set the gel in the fridge it is a little less time. The CRO gene is about 300 base pairs. However, when we ran our PCR product against the ladder and against our negative control, our PCR product matched the control and did NOT match the length that indicates 300 base pairs. So, we know that our PCR reaction failed. It may be because we used a colony that did not include that lambda prophage.

Overview
What is TAL effector?
TAL (transcription activator-like) effectors are proteins secreted by Xanthomonas bacteria via their type III secretion system when they infect various plant species. These proteins are able to bind promoter sequences in the host plant and to activate the expression of plant genes that aid bacterial infection.[1]
What can TAL effectors do and how do they function?
There appears to be a one-to-one correspondence between the identity of two critical amino acids in each repeat and each DNA base in the target sequence. [2]As a result, TAL effectors have attracted great interest as DNA targeting tools.
Their targeting specificity is determined by a central domain of tandem, 33–35 amino acid repeats, followed by a single truncated repeat of 20 amino acids. The majority of naturally occurring TAL effectors examined have between 12 and 27 full repeats. A polymorphic pair of adjacent residues at positions 12 and 13 in each repeat, the ‘repeat-variable di-residue’ (RVD), specifies the target, one RVD to one nucleotide, with the four most common RVDs each preferentially associating with one of the four bases.[3][4]
Figure 1. Structure of a naturally occurring TAL effector[5]
What’s the weakness of TAL effector?
This simple code between amino acids in TAL effectors and DNA bases in their target sites might be useful for protein engineering applications. Numerous groups have designed artificial TAL effectors capable of recognizing new DNA sequences in a variety of experimental systems. It has been reported that TAL effectors target genes efficiently in many eukaryocytic cells like mammalian cells and yeasts. However, the former experiments with E. coli indicate that TAL effectors don’t work well in E. coli cells.
What are we doing?
We attempt to construct a marvelous TALEs system which can efficiently work in prokaryotic organisms. By optimizing the TALEs coding sequence with modeling methods （Genetic Algorithm） and testing it by Golden Gate Assembly and Report System, we hope we can have"

NUS Singapore Science: InterLab
As part of #CasWrites, we wanted to provide a literature review on the legislation present in Singapore that shapes the direction of gene manipulation research. To make things more exciting, we did this in a form of a collaboration with the iGEM École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) 2018 team! Our collaboration was a comparative study to highlight similarities and differences between the existing guidelines related to genetic engineering in the two countries. We identified several important areas - use, research, distribution of genetically modified (GM)-related products and the frameworks to mitigate risk and manage data. By analyzing the differing administrative structure and population, we gained valuable insight about how legislation can be contextualized. This discussion and exchange of ideas was extremely interesting and fruitful. We are glad to have the opportunity to embark on this collaboration!"
Washington,2009,Team:Washington#Project#Display_-_-_TEXT.html," and, second, binding biotin on the surface of the cell, we decided to do the following tests:
Western blot to verify expression of Harvard 2006 surface display parts
Assess biotin binding to cell surface by fluorescence microscopy
Assess biotin binding to cell surface by flow cytometry
Western Blot Demonstrates that Harvard 2006 iGEM Parts Are Expressed
The goal of this experiment was to make sure that the proteins were being expressed in our cell strains, and also to make sure that they were the correct length. This was crucial to ascertain before we moved on and began to test the parts. Even though we had the individual parts sequenced confirmed we needed to make sure that the proteins were being expressed correctly in the cell. Since all the Harvard parts are His tagged, we used a Western blot reagent (horseradish peroxidase) that was conjugated to nickel-NTA which binds His tags.8.
Data
The expected sizes of each of these proteins are shown in the table below:
Bio Brick
Length (in Da)
J36848
21478.7
J36849
34600.9
J36850

J36851
44972.3
Based on the table above, we were able to verify expression of the Harvard 2006 iGEM surface display parts.  The varying intensity of the bands does not indicate the strength of expression because the protein amount was not normalized before it was inserted into the gel.  Next we wanted to determine whether functional, biotin-binding streptavidin was displayed on the cell surface in cells expressing these parts. To test this, we used two different methods: visualization by fluorescence microscopy and by flow cytometer.
Streptavidin-Biotin Binding Is Not Visualized By Fluorescence Microscopy
The goal of this experiment was to confirm the display of streptavidin on the surface of the cell. To do this, we incubated cells expressing the Harvard 2006 iGEM streptavidin surface display parts with a biotinylated fluorophore9.  If cells are expressing functional streptavidin on the surface of the cell, they should bind the biotinylated fluorophore, and this binding should be detectable in our florescence microscope as a halo of fluorescence surrounding each individual cell.  As a positive control for streptavidin-biotin binding we incubated the biotinylated fluorophore with streptavidin-coated beads that were roughly the"

As a control, one of the tubes incubated contained a strain of E coli resistant to chloramphenicol but with none of the raspberry ketone producing genes. There was one peak that existed on the RaspberrE coli spectra but not on the control, which when run through the mass spectrometer turned out to be benzalacetone, the precursor to raspberry ketone.
None of the cultures which also had benzalacetone reductase transformed in produced any peaks which gave mass spectra corresponding to that of raspberry ketone. These results suggest that while the 4-coumarate coA ligase and benzalacetone synthase both worked, the benzalacetone reductase, as shown once already by the Dutch research team who first cloned the enzyme’s gene sequence (led by Jules Beekwider in Wageninen), does not actually reduce benzalacetone.
Some other experiments we did:
Overcoming the Indol smell of E-coli by two different techniques and their comparison
Problem
E-coli cultures have a pungent odour due mostly to the production of indole. We were afraid that the strong smell of E-coli would mask any other synthesized volatiles. We therefore decided to look into ways to reduce their production of indole.
Summary
We overcame the odour issue by advancing a new protocol to make normal E-coli strains produce less indole. We compared the efficiency of our technique in terms of both odour and growth rate with indole-free strain of bacteria. Our technique produced pleasant smelling E-coli, indistinguishable from indole-free bacteria. However they required 6h more to reach similar population density.
We also produced E-coli with equal growth rate as standard bacteria in standard media which smelled significantly less.
Story
1- We located an indole free strain of Ecoli from a neighbouring lab. This mutant strain has a non-functional TnA enzyme so can no longer metabolize Tryptophan into Indole.
2-  We also learnt that normal bacteria grown on a Tryptophan-free medium and minimal salts have been shown to produce significantly less indole and still grow at good rates. No data had been recorded on smell or growth rate.
Experiment
We set up cultures of
Ecoli +T (wild type) and Ecoli –T (which can’t make indole) and grew them in

NCTU_Formosa,2012,Team:NCTU Formosa#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," we carry out our project. As long as we conduct an experiment, gloves and laboratory coat will be worn if necessary to prevent our hands or clothes from contacting with microorganism or chemical materials. Besides, our team chose Escherichia coli, which is non-pathogenic and very general resident of the natural gut flora found in humans, as our chassis. Therefore, we have confidence that everyone who participates in this project can work under safe circumstances.
public safety
Figure 3. After sterilizing, things related to E.coli were collected in specific trash can.
No, the places where we work and practice have good surveillance. Any unintended person without specific admission will not have access to our workplace. On the other side, all practices with live E.coli are conducted in the laminar flow to make sure that there is the minimal possibility of releasing Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) to public areas or other places. After we finished our progress for a step or a day, we use 70% alcohol to sterilize our hands, equipments and platform we used. All stocks, wastes and cultures are decontaminated carefully before disposal by Autoclaving and then all sterilized wastes will be packaged and executed base on standard decontamination procedures. So, our project does not raise public safety issues according to above reasons.
environmental safety
Figure 4. This is the autoclave in our laboratory.
No, as previously stated, all wastes are sterilized before disposal. In fact, E.coli is classified under biosafety level 1 and is non-hazardous, non-infectious, commonly used and accepted bacteria strains. Even releasing by accident will not cause any risk to environment. Furthermore, genetically modified E.coli, which we use to produce isobutanol , is thought of as less competitive than wild type in environment . Hence, we really don't worry about raising environmental safety issues. Another, our final product, isobutanol, exists in natural environment and is also safe, non-hazardous.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes,
1.did you document these issues in the Registry?
2.how did you manage to handle the safety issue?
3.How could other teams learn from your experience?
No, our goal is to let E.coli produce isobutanol from glucose and then try to promote the yield . The BioBrick parts we used aim to translate enzymes or proteins which the pathway need and most of them are from MIT or the old BioBricks parts."

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#stakeholders_-_-_TEXT.html," better, but still evokes negative associations. An important goal should be to find a term with a very positive ring to it. Another solution could be to sell something which evokes good associations (a particularly good synbio application like a cure for ebola) while stressing that it is synthetic biology, to change the perception of the term.
The main conclusion of the discussion was that in order to get synthetic biology accepted, a clearly beneficial real-life application is needed. Our ELECTRACE system could play a big part in this by enabling biosensors to be used outside the lab. To make such an application possible, a change in legislature, a different innovation process, and a different way of communication, is needed.
Report NPA meeting
To familiarize ourselves with the current methods used for landmine detection and to understand better the upsides and downsides of these methods, we got in contact with NPA (Norwegian People’s Aid http://www.npaid.org/).Mr. Justin Brady kindly accepted our invitation and visited our office on 3rd of September.
Mr. Justin Brandy is a senior adviser for NPA and is based now in the Netherlands. Previously he was the head of the United Nations Mine Action Service in New York, having a vast experience in this field. The NPA in active in different countries, covering: Asia, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and South America. They got a lot of advocacy work to prohibit landmines and cluster munitions. Furthermore, their works expands also to explosive remnants from war (ERW).
They rely primary on manual demining, using metal detection methods, partially also due to costs. In countries where they are active the labor is quite cheap and this represents also a productive way to put people back to society. In addition, they have also a very large dog programme, being one of the leaders in using the canine detection.  They also used to supply dogs to other programmes. Yet, dogs have several limitations, mainly due to the environmental conditions (eg. heat as well as the terrain where they are working on).
There are also other efforts for landmines detections. There is a tool sensor which uses a ground penetrating reader and a metal detector. However, this is not commonly used due to the fact that is quite expensive. Another experiment is a plant that reacts to nitrogen, turning into a specific color. But, this is subjected also to some limitations. Another experiment for detection was by using bees.  In the end this was classified as an inefficient method.
Apart from asking about the current used methods, we also asked more details about the process itself."

Kyoto,2012,Team:Kyoto#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,". By using this part, the amount of Tat transporter is and pspA can be increased . In short, we can make E.coli secrete more proteins with TorA.(Fig.2-9)
Fig.2-8 Tat secretion cassette; Tat ABC, pspA and constitutive promoter(BBa_K797004)
Fig.2-9 pspA helps proteins to go through Tat secretion pathway.
Kyoto 2012 suggests this new way of secretion, Tat pathway and kil protein, and provides iGEMers with these genes regulated by constitutive promoter. We checked the sequence of TatABC (BBa_K797000) and the sequence of pspA (BBa_K797001) individually, and then, we made Tat construction composed of constitutive promoter (BBa_J23107) , TatABC (BBa_K797000) , pspA (BBa_K797001) and double terminator (BBa_B0015) . We performed electrophoresis of this cassette confirmed the length of our parts and sequenced them partially.
3.PENETRATION
The third step is PENETRATION. In order to induce flower formation, FT protein from E.coli must enter into plant cells. This is because FT protein upregulates other proteins which lead to flower formation in plant cells.
However, normally proteins cannot penetrate a cell membrane of a plant. Therefore, we needed a method to send FT protein into plant cells. Thanks to the advice from Doctor Washida, we found a method for the penetration of cell membrane. In this method, we use polyarginines called R9 peptides.
R9 peptide enables FT protein penetrate membranes by endocytosis
Fig.3-1 Image of R9 peptide : R9 peptide consists of 9 arginine residues.
R9 peptide consists of nine arginine residues(Fig.3-1). It is known as a kind of CPP (Cell Penetrating Peptide). Arginine-rich peptides induce macropinocytos, a type of endocytosis. From this, we judged that R9 peptides were suitable for cell membrane penetration.
This is the mechanism of how R9 peptides work(Fig3-2).
Firstly, R9 peptides adhere to a cell membrane of a plant because of their hydrophobic character.
Secondly, the cell responds to this stimulus and starts to endocytose.
Finally, proteins around the endocytosing region of the cell are taken into the cell.
R9 peptides seem to work effectively whether or not R9 peptides are fused with target proteins"

Tamanna Ananna
My name is Tamanna. Originally from Dhaka, Bangladesh, I have been living in Folsom, California for about 8 years now. A junior in the Chemical and Bioengineering Department, I joined iGEM because it was a fantastic way to work with my peers who were just as passionate about biotech and create something together. In my spare time, I love drawing and sketching -- in fact I have just begun a crazy art project where I am sketching all of my favorite paintings, people, and places to plaster all over my wall. Fun fact about me -- I was bitten by a monkey while hiking in the Sundarban Forest in Bangladesh when I was 8.
Helen Park
My name is Helen, and I’m a junior in the Chemical and Biological Engineering Department. I hail from Rockville Maryland -- that just so happens to have the largest indoor rock-climbing gym in the nation, a favorite hobby of mine. Other things I do in my spare time include painting, furniture/jewelry making, photography... anything crafty really. I’m in iGEM to put all the class-work and lab experience we’ve gained to good use, and because I wholeheartedly believe we as a team can design something innovative and valuable to society. A fun fact about me: I have a complicated relationship with hot tubs.
Ifunanya Nwogbaga
My name is Ifunanya Nwogbaga and I am currently a junior in the Chemical and Biological Engineering program at Princeton University! I was originally born in Enugu, Nigeria but now I live in Dover, Delaware with my immediate family. I joined iGEM because I was interested in bioengineering and biotechnology and I wanted to get experience developing a new project using the things I have learned over the years. For me, it was a way to put my knowledge to good use without it having to be some boring government job but instead a cool, innovative project! What I like to do for fun mostly is run"

PPS-Programmed Polyketide Synthesis
The domain in type I polyketide synthase(PKS) can work independently without losing their function[1]. We want to standardize the domain and assemble them in correct order and finally we can rational design and produce new-to-nature polyketide as we want.
1.What kind of polyketide synthase do we choose as our candidate?
Polyketide almost exist in every organisms but many of their synthesis processes are unclear[2]. First thing we did is to search suitable PKS. Erythromycin PKS modular 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase(DEBS) from Saccharopolyspora erythraea is a good candidate[3]. It has served as a module system for researching to engineer PKSs and to explore their structural plasticity and substrate tolerance[4] for long. DEBS, encoded by the gene eryA, are divided into three part including totally six module. DEBS1 which include three module, is the first part of DEBS[5]. (figure.1)
2.How to search the boundary between the domains and linker in a module?
The domains in PKS have independent functions[6]. We tried to separate different domains in the sequence of erythromycin type I polyketide synthase. To make sure that the integrity of domains are unbroken, it’s important that searching for the boundary between domain precisely. We find out the boundary between two domain, each domain are connected by the short adhesion.We search two database ASMPKS (Analysis System for Modular Polyketide Synthases: http://gate.smallsoft.co.kr:8008/~hstae/asmpks"

The Burkholderia Diffusible Signalling Factor (BDSF) Sensing System
Initial Planning and Cloning Strategy
Building the BDSF Sensor
Characterisation
Initial Planning and Cloning Strategy
Cis-2 fatty acids are used by many bacterial species as signalling molecules to facilitate inter- and intra-species communication and as a method of regulation of gene expression. Burkholderia Diffusible Signalling Factor (BDSF) is a cis-2-dodecenoic acid that is produced exclusively by the pathogenic bacteria of the Burkholderia cepacia complex where it regulates expression of genes involved in virulence1,2. It is structurally similar to, but distinct from, DSF (cis-11-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid) produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
In B. cenocepacia BDSF activates gene expression through a two component phosphorelay. BCAM0227 is a transmembrane histidine kinase which phosphorylates the response regulator BCAM0228 in the presence of exogenous BDSF. BCAM0228 then binds and activates transcription of cblD , a gene involved in Burkholderia virulence2.
We engineered E. coli to express this signal transduction system for the detection of BDSF (as shown in Fig 1), with a promoter-less gfp gene downstream of the cblD promoter. With this, our sensor will detect any BDSF in its"

Emma Finlayson-Trick
Microbiology and Immunology
My name is Emma Finlayson-Trick and I am a fourth year student at Dalhousie University majoring in microbiology and immunology and minoring in history. Last year was my first time on the Dalhousie iGEM team as ethics consultant and this year I am the president. I originally began university thinking that eukaryotic cells were the most fascinating things out there, and not to anger anyone who agrees with that statement, but I am now a prokaryote fan after learning about the many marvelous abilities and complexities of these curious cells. I hope to pursue a career as a clinical microbiologist and I am particularly fascinated in exploring antibiotic resistance.
Landon Getz
Microbiology and Immunology
My name is Landon Getz. I am an aspiring researcher and microbiology student at Dalhousie University. Having watched the iGEM team last year, and taking a few classes in synthetic biology, I decided I wanted to try my own hand at it. So here I am. My task with our iGEM team this year, with the help of Mackenzie Thornbury, is to sequence some 16S rRNA genes and discover what microbes are found in the gut of the porcupine. I am also the main web designer for this years team. I am looking forward to continuing our porcupine research and hopefully finding some interesting microorganisms in the process!
Mackenzie Thornbury
Microbiology and Immunology
My name is Mackenzie Thornbury and I am a fourth year Microbiology and Immunology student at Dalhousie University. I first heard about iGEM last year and was really interested in their project and also synthetic biology as a whole. We have very little classes that focus on synthetic biology so I joined the team in order to learn new techniques and see what synthetic biology was all about.

Duke,2009,Team:Duke_-_-_TEXT.html," Whatman paper and a vacuum flask. The polymer was then precipitated from the filtered solution by adding 10 volumes of ethanol, centrifuged, and then re-dissolved in chloroform. Finally, 10 volumes of methanol was used to re-precipitate the polymer before centrifuging to obtain a purified polymer pellet. A promising sign was that there was much more white powder precipitate in the experimental samples than the negative control samples after harvesting (Figure 7).
1H NMR Spectroscopy
To characterize harvested polymers, 300 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy was used. The NMR sample was prepared by re-dissolving 20 mg of each polymer sample in 600 μl of deuterochloroform in an NMR tube. Attempts were made to harvest and identify the 3HB, 4HB, and poly(3HB-co-4HB) polymers. The first harvest attempt was made on pUC19phaCAB and then on pASK-phaCAB-no tag (Construct 1) to try and obtain 3HB polymer; the NMR results for the harvested product were compared to that of a negative control (no insert) and commercial 3HB. Several harvest attempts were also made on pSOS-cat2phaC bacteria (Construct 4) to try to confirm 4HB polymer production. Finally, bacteria transformed with pASKphaAB-termpLZCat2phaC (Construct 7) were harvested in an attempt to identify poly(3HB-co-4HB) by NMR.

This Bsc Molecular life sciences student was born 04-09-1990. From the moment she could walk she knew it: I want to be part of the iGem competition! Her reason to join this year was that she had to do a Bsc thesis and really liked the opportunity of designing your own project and working both individually and as a team. The most awesome moments for her were when she made a picture of her actin-GFP fusion and the group activities. Her hobbies are diverse: horseback riding, ultimate frisbee, playing guitar and transforming fungi. Summarized in ‘one sentence’: iGem is a really awesome competition where you learn a lot & have a lot of fun, where you can work both individually but mostly as a team.

When describing iGEM with 3 words Emiel ten Buren would describe it as a “really awesome experience”. Emiel, who was born on 16.12.1990, is a master student in the field of biochemistry and did his bachelor in molecular life science. Currently he is working on the chromoproteins we got from Uppsala and Braunschweig to optimize them for and introduce them to A. niger. Next to the practical work he is our hard working secretary and sponsoring person. When asking him why he joined the iGEM team he says that he wants to learn more about synthetic biology and likes the idea of doing it in a competitive way such as iGEM. It might be obvious that Emiel is eager to do his job well. There are a lot of things he likes about iGEM, including the team activities such as going bowling or playing pool. But he also enjoyed attending the molecular interactions symposium in Berlin for a poster presentation.
When you meet Emiel outside of the laboratory you will find a person that likes to do weird Dutch sports such as Knot"

Indeed, this cooperation resulted in us sending one of our new BioBricks to them for validation.
Questionnaires
Questionnaires of different sorts are a part of many iGEM teams projects, ourselves included. We created two questionnaires, the first one on the integration of modeling and wetlab efforts in iGEM and the second one on finding collaboration partners. Having ourselves approached the iGEM community for this purpose, we recognise the difficulties teams sometimes face in getting answers to their surveys. To do our part in solving this problem we wanted to answer and forward as many iGEM questionnaires as possible as well as we could. We answered and/or forwarded the following teams questionnaires:

TAS_Taipei,2016,Team:TAS Taipei#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," concentration of GSR outside nanoparticles adjusted for degradation, as a function of time.
$$C_{oa}(t)=C_{out}\cdot e^{-k_dt}$$
Parameters
We know all components of the diffusion constant (temperature, viscosity, natural constants) except for nanoparticle radius. In addition, we find the volume of the aqueous humor by literature data. Other parameters, such as surface area and volume, are determined by the radius.
Determination of Diffusion Layer Dependence
From literature research, we estimate that the diffusion layer is on the order of -11, based on details on turnover rates in the aqueous humor and lens (Toxic). After creating our initial model to guide the experiments, we then used the experimental data to revise our initial model, by altering this constant to -2.5*10^-11
For initial conditions, the concentration inside the nanoparticles start at an initial value, while the concentration outside the nanoparticles start at the natural concentration of GSR (see Model 2 collapsible).

Also our sister team METU_TURKEY is our main collaborator.     They have provided feedback BioGUIDE at different stages of the development.     And they had the chance to analyze their constructs input/output relations     throughout this collaboration.
ALL TEAMS: The Parts Registry Survey that has been     developed by METU_TURKEY_SOFTWARE got response from 253 of participant     from 94 teams. Analysis of the survey results we have received so far     indicates that we were able outreach to the iGEM community and help     them verbalize their concerns and suggestions for the parts registry     standards and the maintenance of the database.
WARSAW: Our team members have participated in their     survey abour iGEM participants profile.
METU_TURKEY: Beta testing of the algorithm developed     and the BioGUIDE software has been performed by METU_TURKEY on few case     studies. Additionally they have tested their construct for 2010 competition     with our algorithm.
Material
Our main data source for BIO Guide Software Program was the available     background information of parts distributed in 2010 iGEM plates (Total     of three384-well plates of dried DNA) to the wetlab teams. This data     was available through both the parts registry main website ( http://partsregistry.org/Main_Page )     in XML format and parts registry libraries (http://partsregistry.org/assembly/libraries.cgi?id=31)     in Excel format. Data from parts with specific part IDs have been parsed     with a custom code developed to modify SAX Parser. Then, the rest of     the data which needs to be standardized according to biological importance     have been extracted from the Registry of Parts Page manually. The chemical     (IPTG, galactose etc.) or physical (UV irradiation, temperature etc)     external inputs and proteins synthesized from a biobrick coding sequence     can affect promoters on the parts. These effectors are identified under     the title “Input”. And the “Output” s of these effectors are classified     as inducers (a molecule that starts gene expression), repressors (blocker     of attachment of RNA polymerase to promoter), activators (increasing     the rate of transcription) and inhibitor s(decreasing the rate of transcription).     These standardizations on the database helped us to build the algorithm     based on input/output relationships. MySQL Server is used for Database     development and organization.

PROJECT
Description
Synthetic Biology is largely restricted to well-funded laboratories at major research universities in high income countries.       One significant barrier to entry is the capital cost of instruments. The cloning and assembly of BioBricks, for example, includes the transformation       of Escherichia coli, which requires the purchase of a refrigerated centrifuge and an ultra-cold freezer. Here we assemble BioBrick-compatible shuttle      vectors for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, a naturally competent relative of E. coli that grows as rapidly under identical conditions. We will show that       A. baylyi can be transformed with recombinant DNA simply by adding ligation reactions to mid-log cultures; transformants are selected as usual by       spreading them onto LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, cefotaxime or amikacin).       These experiments will show how BioBricks can be constructed and assembled in modestly funded laboratories in community colleges, high schools and       even private homes. The resulting plasmid constructs retain their pSB1C3 backbones and will thus remain compatible with the BioBrick standard and       capable of replication in the widely used E. coli chassis.

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

Week 10-11
I tried to adapt an in vitro assay to measure chitinase activity. This assay is based on a reaction with 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazine (MBTH) and was developed by Horn et al. 3 Colloidal chitin was prepared according to Murthy et al. 4 The MBTH method yielded no results, as even the calibration curve with N-acetylglucosamine showed no increase in absorbance at 620 nm. The experiment was repeated twice but no conclusion on chitinase activity was reached.
Week 12
I made colloidal chitin plates according to Murthy et al. 3 and pipetted BL21 cultures with the chitinase devices onto them, as well as Bacillus thuringiensis positive controls. The colloidal chitin density was not high enough and the chitin formed flakes. No halo could be observed that would confirm chitinase activity.

- 4 primers were constructed by Angela for the sequencing of MSC1 and MSC2 of pETDuet-1.
- Inoculated two cultures from the transformation plate (one each from the 7/7 ligation and 7/10 ligation. The culture did not grow.
- Reinoculated four cultures (same as before except duplicates of each with no ampicillin).
- Also streaked competent cells on an amp plate. Did this to see if it is problem regarding ampicillin concentration.
- Also started two new digestions of PUF and pBad for and construct.

-Today, we ran a PCR of wtPUF and a gel to go along with it. We will contact Sigma-Aldrich to see when the C15 alkanes are arriving and plan for it. We should also transform pSB1C3 into dH5a.
-Corrected a primer for PUF-cCFP tethering and re-submitted the order. Made a detailed plan of the cloning that needs to be done for PUF-CFP tethering and split-CFP construction. Bob inoculated pETDuet-1 and K157005 for me as well as transformed K157006 into DH5a cells. I plated the transformation on an ampicillin plate afterword.
-Made new primer sequences for PUF project. Modify YFP construct using Venus gene (proven it worked) instead of biobrick: E0030. A set of CPEC primers are also designed. Transformed the 6:1 ligation of YFP. Also inoculated more protet. For YFP florescence testing will need a negative and a positive control....
-Ran gel of digested pBAD and PUF for construct. Only found band for PUF. Second time in a row where digested pBAD showed no bands.Gel extracted the PUF band. Also started three new digestions of pBAD. Checked inoculations, the two without ampicillin grew, but the other two with ampicillin did not grow. Also checked streaked plate of competent cells on amp plate. Found a lawn. Concluded that the amp plates do not have enough ampicillin. Therefore the transformation plates were not reliable.

NPU-China,2018,Team:NPU-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," due to the heavy burden of our experimental and academic tasks, there were not adequate staff     to characterize all the parts. At the CCIC, Jilin_China came to our aid and proposed to characterize the parts     after learning about our predicament. There existed low GC content in the mitochondrial genomes and a large amount     of replication in E. coli, which jeopardized the balance of four nucleotides in the cell, resulting in strong     cytotoxicity. Jilin_China helped us measure the growth curves of the two submitted parts: cob (BBa_K2707004) and     var1 (BBa_K2707008), the sequences of which were examined to determine if they were toxic to cells.
These two parts are two of the eight proteins expressed by the mitochondrial genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.     One is Cob encoding cytochrome oxidase b, which is a component of the electron transport chain, and another is Var1     that encodes ribosomal protein. Note that cob has been removed all introns.
Experimental results:
Figure 5. The growth curves of cob and var1
Conclusion: These two genes were constructed on pB1C3, the amplification of which after being transferred into DH5α     has little effect on bacterial growth, qualitatively proving that these two sequences are not toxic to cells.
Protocol:

Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and meaningful data. This part not only furthers the development of ratiometric measurements in molecular biology but due to the choice of promoters and terminators it can be used to characterize the difference in activity between E. coli and B. Subtilis
Fast Germination (B. subtilis) BBa_K911008
This part is entirely novel for the registry and fully utilizes the recombination machinery inherent in the Bacillus chassis. Have spores that can germinate at a faster rate is certainly a worthy achievement and could help with experiments with B. Subtilis that any future iGEM teams may wish to perform.

We are suffering from some setback on the PCR front. Tom and Emmy's PCR re-runs for the large vectors did not work despite lengthening the elongation time to 5 minutes per cycle. After sequence alignments we discovered that the primers may anneal to various sites on the primer, producing a range of undesired products. We will carry out touch down PCR tomorrow to make the annealing conditions more stringent.
PCR of the mOrange gene last Friday also yielded no visible products. Looking at the primers' designs again, we think it might be due to problems with the annealing temperature. Therefore we are setting"

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.

To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

LINKOPING SWEDEN
Liu took part in a city festival where normal people can discover differents projects. They thought it was a great moment to spread word about iGEM and SynBio, so they asked us to write them a short summary of our project description. In addition, the helped us by explaining us the current situation of transgenics in Sweden.
RICE
Rice wanted to divulge SynBio by sharing photos and descriptions of members of different iGEM teams in social media, as part of their #humanofsynbio promotion campaign. Alicia and Jose Antonio, members of our team, were posted on Rice iGEM facebook page. Meanwhile, we also fulfilled a questionnaire, while Rice sent us the current situation of transgenic regulation in the USA.
IONIS PARIS
Utiel-Requena is land of vineyards and Ionis team wanted to gather as much information as possible about them, so they asked us if we could make the vineyards answer a survey. One of our team members lives there so he spoke with wine producers and they were happy to answer it. In exchange, they researched about transgenic regulation in France and gave us valuable information for our human practices.
PARIS BETTENCOURT
Paris Bettencourt was heavily decided to help spreading SynBio knowledge and they created an Scape Room game about it. To help them in that arduous work, we helped them by translating it to spanish. Furthermore, Álvaro, played the game with a lot of people on a Juniors. Lastly, we send them an interview for greenhouses, and shortly they replied us with the results of the interviews.
PURDUE
As United States regulation is different than European ones, we asked Purdue iGEM team to gather data about greenhouses. We shortly received the results of the survey we sent them, and it was very useful. Afterwards we also answered them a survey about a pulmonary disease and benzene degradation.
GREECE
Greece wanted to assemble a group of experts of different scientific disciplines. To achieve it one of our instructors answered them a survey and a few questions about health, ethical and environmental consequences of our work. We sent them the text, hoping it was useful for them.

Inspired by the modularization, call-and-return and do-not-reinvent-the-wheel philosophy in                     computer programming design, we come up with the idea of using the dCas9 protein to manipulate                     the expression of proteins and implement complex logic in a single E. coli cell this year. we                     want to construct versatile “library strains” that contains many, and maybe redundant coding                     sequences of commonly used proteins which are dormant by default; when we need to use the function                     of particular already coded proteins, we just simply transform a much smaller “Minimid” containing                     sgDNAs targeting the desired proteins into the library strain, and then utilizing the dCas9-sgRNA                     complex to initiate the transcription then expression of the particular protein.
To show the power and practicality of the design above, our team aims to test the system by using                     fluorescent proteins and apply it to a sustainable dyeing strategy. Indigo, as a current widely used                     dye, its production, transportation and using employs many toxic and not environment-friendly chemicals.                     However, the enzymes that catalyze the relevant reactions are found and the biological solution seems                     promising. We design a strategy that not only circumvents the use of toxic reagents for indigo chemical                     synthesis but also removes the need for a reducing agent for dye solubilization. Our engineered E.coli                     will be transformed with the above proteins and become a manipulatable library for us. This project                     will provide a fundamental contribution to the construction of engineering bacteria and clean manufacturing.

Chloe is sophomore majoring in Biochemistry. She learned soooooooo much going through iGEM but it was also really really stressful and tough process!!
Random things:
She really doesn't understand why the Gibson Assmbly for ACEB contruct did not work out. It should at least have the same number of colonies as the negative control, how can it have no colony at all!!! The Gibson Assembly mix certainly have affected the DNA fragments in some way...Is it possible that a gene is toxic to its native strain? Also, for BBa_J176171!! She confirmed that the linear plasmid is stable at 50°C but why does it not assemble with complementary sequences engineered in GFP? Can we really trust sequence of this part? If this is heat sensitive, how can we confirm its sequence?

Astrid is a sophomore in HKUST, and studying Biochemistry and Cell Biology. Astrid works in sub-group 2 and mostly does the inoculation, which might be too many times so she got a new nickname, ""Inoculation girl""!

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," reactions were performed with different dNTP and substrate-dCTP concentrations and the amplified DNA was analyzed on agarose gel. Results shown on Fig. 8 hint that large concentrations of substrate bound nucleotides might inhibit the reaction, as the the amplified DNA band fades as more substrate nucleotides are added. The DNA smear seen in the gel is a characteristic part of the rolling circle amplification. The final concentration of substrate bound dCTP molecules was chosen to be 25 µM in the amplification reaction.
Figure 9. Phi29 amplified DNA dependence on the concentration of nucleotide concentrations. DNA, amplified using multiple displacement amplification was synthesised using 750 - 100µM dNTP concentration with or without 25µM substrate nucleotide concentration. Decreasing the concentration of nucleotides decreases the amount of DNA amplified only when concentrations lower than 200 µM are used. Red dashed line highlight the chosen condition for MDA reaction.
Next, we seeked to determine the lowest native nucleotide concentration for the MDA reaction usable with the corresponding 25 µM concentration of substrate nucleotides. While substrate dCTP concentration was constant, the concentration of dNTPs was gradually lowered. In addition to this, reaction without modified nucleotides was carried too, to determine whether the nucleotide concentration or ratio to substrate-dCTP is the product limiting factor. The results indicate that 200 µM and 100 µM final concentrations are too low to be used with 25 µM sub-dCTP, therefore 300 µM was chosen to be the final working dNTP concentration (Fig. 9).

The emulsion was incubated off chip at 30oC for 6 hours. The amplified DNA was stained with SyBr green and imaged using a microscope. Pictures show brightfield and fluorescence at 488 nm of the same spot.
In bulk reaction conditioning allowed us to quickly screen the required concentrations for the workflow, as droplet microfluidics and require separate, time consuming experiment to try out the each setting. After the initial in bulk conditioning followed the experiments in picoliter sized droplets. First of all, the chosen dNTP concentrations were tested in water-oil emulsion environment by encapsulating single circular DNA templates into 50 pL droplets with the same MDA reaction mix.

MOTIVATION
As part of our project brain-storming process, we had been looking through some of the previous projects for inspiration. However, when we start looking into how teams tackle the problem of their project safety, we realized that most teams uses kill switch as their genetic containment strategies. However, there are no practical implementation and standardization of the strategy.  We wanted to create a universal safety switch that teams can easily implement it into their project in the future. We were inspired by the application of recombinases in eukaryotes where only a specific gene inside the cell will be knocked out without harming the cell itself. As a proof-of-concept, we therefore uses the Cre-lox system to illustrate how recombinase can excise the gene of interest in the DH10b strain of E.coli bacteria that are easy to grow and safe to use in the laboratory.
Having received feedbacks from people joining our organized activities in Hong Kong Science Park, where the majority is parents,                             it surprisingly shows that our samples view GMOs to be more safe if the genetically modified                             gene within an organism has been knocked out before the consumption. We, therefore, directed                             our focus on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) with the addition of time delay controlling                             the expression of gene of interest for safety reason.

TOWARDS OUR APPLICATION
Feedbacks from the participants in our workshops surprisingly shows that the public view GMOs, specially food to be more                             safe if the genetically modified gene within an organism has been knocked out before consumption.                             We, therefore, directed our focus on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) with the addition                             of time delay controlling the expression of gene of interest to satisfy the public’s concern.                             Time control mechanism can allow the genetically modified crops to grow under extreme conditions                             to increase crop yield while having this foreign gene removed before reaching the consumers so                             that these crops will be considered safer in the public"
