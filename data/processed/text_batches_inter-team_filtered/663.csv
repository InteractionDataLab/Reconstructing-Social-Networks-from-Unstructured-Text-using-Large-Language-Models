— Gold Medal Criterion #1 —
To achieve the standard of Gold Integration in Human Practices, iGEM teams must show the evolution of their project in the design/test/build cycle. This cycle is foundational in experiment design and a valuable skill that when developed well, can last a lifetime. The evolution of experimental ideas relies heavily on theoretical application, trial and error, logic, and ingenuity. Troubleshooting and streamlining are some of the main components of research and by integrating feedback from others in the field, we learn so much more than just repeating data that has already been characterized. Our team had the opportunity to meet Dr. Sharona Gordon, a professor from the University of Washington who specializes in Computational Neuroscience and has extensively studied the expression of the TRPV1 protein. Dr. Gordon provided many suggestions and ideas that can be implemented in future projects. We discussed how to make cell response times quicker no just by producing proteins and excreting them outside of the cell, but by using innate molecules or mimicking molecules that closely resemble intracellular proteins that don’t have to be produced and bringing them to the plasma membrane. Dr. Gordon and our team also uncovered different types of fluorescent proteins that could be used -  some with shorter degradation and activation times. We learned about optical genetics and different proteins we can activate by using different wavelengths of light. All of these are great ideas for our future work in activating protein secretion in a quick response manner, but most valuably, she relayed to us the optimal conditions in which yeast grow. This information was vital in the directioning of our research to prepare for future implication. Dr. Gordon has extensive experience with TRPV1 in yeast, and has learned over the years that the range of calcium a yeast cell with TRPV1 can handle is 0.1nm to 20nm. This is a much smaller range from those typically given in the literature because when the TRPV1 channels open, they will diffuse a much greater amount of calcium down the gradient by being continuously open than by calcium pumps alone. This cut down many potential replicates of research and trial and error, and maximised the time we spent in the lab working on"
SCUT,2014,Team:SCUT#HP#Magazine#iGEM People_-_-_TEXT.html," about the iGEM team in Peking university. From then, the little seed was growing in his heart , which bring him the dream that one day he would has his own team taking this top competition in biology filed. During his year 2. He joined the lecture which was given by the researcher, Li Yan from the institute of microbiology as well as the summer camp in Shanghai Jiaotong university which are all quite relevant to iGEM. All of these brought him more and more close to synthetic biology ,and laying the foundation of establish the iGEM team here.
Through indefatigable effort of university, teachers and students, the IGEM team from the Jilin University is formally launched on 2014. The team is led by Wu Yongge subdecanal, Mr. Liu Chengbo, Mr. Gao Chaohui, Mr. Jiang Yiqun and Ms. Wu hui as the co - director of the team, Han Jia and Du Bochuan as the team leader, Song Guangyuan and other sophomores as principal members，and around other 20 students from the freshmen to seniors who are interested on the scientific research join the team. Then this team is named as Jilin-China as suggested by the organising committee; meanwhile, they jointly create the IGEM China Community and Synbiclub together with other colleges, to facilitate further scholarly communication exchanges.
（Pic 1 Han Jia and his instructor, Prof. Teng）
Finally, after October ,2013,  the iGEM team from Nanjing university who won the gold prize and entered the international competition came to Jilin university to introduce the iGEM.  At that time, Mr Han has already in his final year . When he hear this news, he decided to back Changchun right away , starting to form the first iGEM team for his mother school -- Jilin university .
When he came back to school,  he started pushing this issue with his schoolmates and friend  Du Bochuan. They introduced iGEM to junior students during the college welcome party and also brought this news to the deputy dean professor Teng Rongli.  Prof. Teng  gave great support and encouraged them to go further. Step by step, the dream of iGEM team has become more clear and workable. Meanwhile, Mr Han became more  confident to build iGEM team in Jilin university.
At the present time, they has entered a tense phase of experimental stages, everything are new, they come up against a great"

Cells with no colanic acid
Neutral pH
Overall, fluorescence outputs are lower at a neutral pH in cells that are not treated with colanic acid.
pH - 3
In figure 4, we can see that for non-colanic acid cells the fluorescence starts to decrease earlier than in colanic acid protected cells (around 60 minutes). Therefore, we can see that there is a protective advantage of inducing cells with colanic acid in the cell culture
Conclusion
Treating cells with colanic acid provides a significant advantage to the cells. Fluorescence output of the constitutive promoter is higher in cells treated with colanic acid. Therefore, we can infer that colanic acid has a protective effect that could potentially isolate the polypeptide of interest we are synthesising from the harsh acidic environment of the stomach.

NYMU-Taipei,2010,Team:NYMU-Taipei#Project#Speedy protein degrader_-_-_TEXT.html," prokaryotic systems, for example, Bacillus subtilis. Actually, the components of SsrA system has been transplanted into a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain that allows for tunable degradation of a tagged protein (Grilly et al., 2007). The striking instance suggested that it is plausible to apply the ‘speedy degrader’ even in eukaryotic systems.
2.Less interference to the protein function:
Most fusion protein studies require an available functional assay. Because the peptide tag may be detrimental to the structure of target protein, it is critical to assure that the tagged protein behaves as the native protein. A nonfunctional FP-tagged protein will be uninformative in most, if not all, biological studies. Fortunately, ssrA tag does not affect the structure or thermodynamic stability of attached proteins (Gottesman et al., 1998). Therefore, the degradation tag will be a suitable component to integrate with other synthetic devices.

Presently distributed GMO crops include species of maize, soybean, cotton, and canola but other vegetables have also been produced (Yuen-Ting Wong & Wai-Kit Chan, 2016). Fruit is not a common modified organism but with the looming threat of climate change farmers may have to change tact. At the beginning of the year France’s total wine output fell 10% because of frosts, having losses of up to 50-100% of crops in some places (“french winemakers”, 2017). Leominster in England had no peach crops (Jasinski, 2017) and New Jersey in America (Pickels, 2017) had a decrease in plum crops in 2016 because of the same reason. New Zealand may even have to start thinking of expanding their laws on GMOs as morning frosts are becoming more unpredictable. Kiwifruit are quite susceptible to frost and they are a major product of New Zealand, this could have a profound effect in future. This is already causing difficulty for another major producer, Italy, that lost 70% of its kiwifruit in the region of Lazio due to frost in 2016, some orchards losing 100% (“Italy: Up to 70% of Kiwifruit”, 2017). China are also main producers of this fruit and have allowed the cultivation modified plants (James, 2014). There could be an avenue for selling to growers in the colder northern China.
The crop damage from frosts have been shown to cause major product loss. But also, the extents farmers go to prevent this occurring, such as heaters and fans and in some cases the downdraft from helicopters, may be equally as expensive. Marketing the financial and practical benefits to governments and farmers could open better possibilities for them.

Week 26
This is the final week in the lab! We got two more complete pRS plasmids with Pfet3-mOrange-Tadh1-pRS316 and Psuc2-mOrange-Tadh1-pRS316. Pfet3-mOrange-Tadh1-pRS316 was co-transformed with Padh1-mPR Xl-pRS313 in w303 wild type yeast. Fortunately, the transformation was successful, so we finally have a yeast strain for the next crucial step in characterization: to proove whether the membrane progestin receptor can influence the promoter activity of Pfet3 or not. The last microscope pictures of Psuc2-mOrange-pTUM100 and Panb1-mOrange-pTUM in the repressor deficient strains were taken. Furthermore we investigated the influence of changing the medium to SC-Ura (2% galactose). As expected Psuc2 activity depends on the carbohydrate source in the media!
iGEM 2013 ends with a lot of cleaning and sorting of all transformed yeast strains, plasmids, and E. coli glycerol stocks. See you at the Jamboree in Lyon!
Week 25
Finally! We found a good protocol for the fluorescence measurement in the Tecan-Reader! As expected, an 8 h long induction of Pfet-mOrange-pTUM100 gave good results. Assemblies of Padh1-mPR Xl-Tadh1-pRS313 and GAL-mig1-Tadh1-pRS313 were positive. In that way, we got our first fully complete pRS vectors! Unfortunately the restriction, ligation, and transformation of Pfet3-mOrange-Tadh1 and Psuc2-mOrange-Tadh1 in pRS313 had to be repeated due to problems with the vector. The ligation of Pfet3-mig1 in Tadh1-pSB failed. Sadly, there is not"
Aberdeen_Scotland,2014,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#Parts# 2001_-_-_TEXT.html,"unolabelling of Bba_K1352000 (negative control). A) red filter, B) brightfield image.
A strong fluorescent response was evident as a ring shape around bacteria expressing the Ag43-FLAG tagged construct, indicating successful expression of a FLAG-tagged protein external to the membrane; red fluorescence was not observed in the cytoplasm. As expected, the negative control, expressing un-modified Ag43, did not display characteristic fluorescence pattern. Immunolabelling results let us conclude that FLAG expression is localized on the outer membrane and is accessible to anti-FLAG antibody.
c) Testing the aggregation properties of Ag43+FLAG+MCS
We observed that created Ag43+FLAG+MCS construct does not aggregate in overnight cultures in contrast to the original Ag43 BioBrick (Bba_K1352000). To investigate further, overnight cultures of Ag43+FLAG+MCS and Ag43 were transferred onto sterile glass test tubes, induced with 0.2% arabinose and incubated in a shaking water bath at 37oC for >2hrs. Subsequently, test tubes were removed from the water bath and photographed for visual investigation for aggregation.
Fig.10    Aggregation of Ag43 without FLAG (Bba_K1352000) (left) and Ag43+FLAG+MCS (Bba_K1352001) (right) after induction with 0.2% arabinose.
A clear difference is visible between aggregation of two BioBricks. It seems that insertion of a FLAG tag flanked by MCS into alpha subunit of Ag43 disrupts the velcro-like mechanism of aggregation.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The ambition with our human practice project is to get a better understanding of how food allergies affect the quality of daily life for an allergic individual. Since our project is specifically about peanut allergies, it is of utmost importance for us as a team to understand these very personal issues since we want to develop a product for the individual consumer. Initially we had to examine whether or not there is a current need for such a product.  We also aim to inform the general public about the problems associated with food allergies.
Through our two surveys, one national and one international, we have received information about the daily life of people with peanut allergies both in Sweden and in the rest of the world. Our international survey has also been a great way to get in touch and collaborate with iGEM teams from all over the world.

We invited two Swedish university iGEM teams (Uppsala and Chalmers) and hosted a Swedish pre-jamboree in Linköping. All teams, including ours, officially presented their project for each other and participated in an ethics and collaboration workshop which we hosted and planned. Furthermore, we interacted with our sponsors by hosting seminars for both Thermo-Fischer Scientific and Sigma-Aldrich.

EXPERIMENTS WITH ISOLATED CHIMERIC PROTEIN
 
The main form of bacterial flagellin in vivo is polymerized protofilament, flagellar filament. To be recognized by TLR5, flagellin must undergo depolymerization. It might occur during phagocytosis of activated cell or during bacterial growth and replication (Smith et al, 2003). Thus, flagellin filaments used for assessing biological activity in some experiments were depolymerized by heating for 20 min at 70°C. In experiments with isolated monomeric chimeric flagellin depolymerization was not needed.  HEK293 cells were seeded into a 96-well clear-bottom plate (Corning-Costar) and after 24 h transfected with the following plasmids: 20 ng wtTLR5, 50 ng fLuc, 10 ng rLUC per well and JetPEI transfection reagent (Polyplus). 24 h post transfection they were stimulated with recombinant Salmonella typhimurium flagellin (for positive control) and isolated chimeric flagellin for 6 h and lysed. Luciferase activity was measured using multilabel reader Mithras.
 
 
EXPERIMENTS WITH MODIFIED BACTERIA AS MUCOSAL VACCINES
 
Bacteria were grown in LB medium with required antibiotics (kanamycin, chloramphenicol and ampicilline). Protein expression was induced with IPTG. After the cell density was high enough (0,8 to 1,0 at 600 nm), bacteria were washed with sterile 1x PBS to remove growth medium and IPTG.  After  washing they were diluted 1:2000. One bacterial sample was lysed by cooking at 70° C for 20 minutes, while the other one was stored at 4° C. Both samples were tested on HEK293 cells for TRL5 activation with the dual-luciferase reporter assay.

Jeffrey (along with Sabrina Chu) has also been in charge of documentation and has completed the safety and judging forms for the competition.
Eric Wong is also a returning member from the 2013 iGEM team and helped train and mentor the new students for this year’s team. He played a primary role in gathering data for the characterization of promoters as well as data of completed circuits through flow cytometry. He also helped construct and assemble 11 alpha factor-responsive promoters and rtTA. Eric also integrated several motifs of the constitutive promoter circuit into our yeast cell lines.  In addition, he also helped create the slideshow presentation displayed at the Exploratorium event for our Human Practices.
Robert Wong mainly worked in the wetlab, building several constructs: alpha factor-responsive promoters driving Ste2 or mCherry, constitutive pTEF1 promoters driving GFP, and construction of parts to submit to the Parts Registry in the pSB1C3 backbone.  Robert was also Social Media Captain (Twitter/Facebook).
Ianto Lin Xi led the initial alpha factor-responsive promoter identification and selection through literature searches. He spearheaded the characterization of these promoters through the construction of yeast strains with alpha factor-responsive promoters driving GFP. He helped set up initial flow cytometry experiments and programmed our flow cytometer data analysis and interpretation pipeline in both FlowJo and MatLab. Ianto is also in charge of our graphic design, developing our wiki and creating our poster. Ianto will also represent the team by presenting at the Jamboree.
George Yip has been primarily in charge of strain construction inS. cerevisiae. With Jeffrey Shu, he was responsible for building multiple yeast strains containing iterations of our primary circuit (pTEF1 and its mutants driving rtTA, pTET-alpha factor, and alpha factor-responsive promoters with mCherry/BFP).  As the summer has drawn to an end, George has been essential for construction of all strains required to test the remaining parts of our circuit, doing hundreds (perhaps thousands) of colony PCRs. George has also been heavily involved in testing our final circuits in flow cytometry.
Hyun Youk is a team advisor and helped with conception and execution of this project. The inspiration for the 2014 UCSF-UCB iGEM project is based on his prior work characterizing sense-and-secrete circuits in yeast (Youk and Lim, 2014), and his insight and previous constructs gave us many of the"

When the plasmid is integrated, the clone can grow on minimum medium with threonine and on LB + Spectinomycin but can not grow on the minimum medium without thronine. Moreover, a colony PCR can be performed with the same protocol as previously presented. The used primers are VFBS and VRBS.

Final Tests
Chemotaxis test
Many chemotaxis tests exist such as plate tests or capillary tests. We tried all of them and we decided to optimize the « Capillary essay » from Imperial College 2011 iGEM team.
- Prepare the bacteria in LB medium until they reach an OD between 0.5 and 0.6 (exponential growth phase). This step takes about 5 hours.
- Prepare the multichannel pipette: improve the cohesion between the tips and the pipette with Blu-Tack to avoid air and the possibility of leakage.
- Put 200 µl of the different chemoattractants in the wells of the ELISA plate and pipet 15 µL of each with the multichannel pipette: galactose which represents our negative control, glucose which represents our positive control and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG). The volume in the tips must be marked.
NB: The NAG is the most important test because it is the monosaccharide which composes the chitin on Ceratocystis platani wall.
- Put the tips with chemoattractants in 300 µL of the bacterial solution in exponential growth phase in the ELISA plate.
- Let the installation settle for 1 hour at room temperature.
- After an hour, put the volume of the tips on parafilm.
- Each solution is diluted 1/10,000 and 100 µL is spread on LA medium.
- The plates are then incubated overnight at 37°C.
Binding test
CBB (Chitin Binding Buffer):
- 500 mM NaCl
- 20 mM Tris-HCl
- 1 mM EDTA
- 0,05% Triton X-100, 25°C, pH=8
Column activation:
- Vortex the beads
- Put 50 µL of beads in a 1.5mL centrifuge tube
- Wash with 500 µL of CBB
- Put the centrifuge tube on a magnetic rack
- Wait 30 seconds

Birkbeck,2015,Team:Birkbeck#pp_-_-_TEXT.html," TB (XDR-TB), in which the bacteria are resistant to all first and second-line drugs, making the disease incredibly difficult to treat, is becoming a growing problem around the world. As a result of developments such as these, antibiotic resistance has been identified as ‘one of the greatest challenges to global public health today’ (WHO 2015).
Fig 1. Multi-drug resistant TB prevalence around the world. Drug resistance has become a major problem among the Russian prison population in the wake of the fall of the Soviet Union (Kenyon 2009); meanwhile, drug resistance remains under-reported in many developing countries due to lack of monitoring and diagnostic facilities.
Interview Video 4 with Dr. Sanjib Bhakta
Click here to hear Dr. Sanjib Bhakta, Director of Mycobacteria Research Laboratory at the Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London and UCL, discuss what are the current biochemical pathways that TB-inhibitor drugs target and whether there is a specific mechanism by which drug resistance develops
Fig 2. Occurrence of XDR-TB around the world. It should be noted that many cases of XDR-TB are thought to remain unreported due to a lack of diagnostic and monitoring facilities in the developing world. (Data: WHO)
M. tuberculosis is notoriously slow-growing, making positive diagnosis of TB a lengthy process, with drug resistance even slower to confirm: although faster diagnostic methods for MDR-TB have been developed in recent years (WHO 2014), these remain expensive and rare, so even in areas with access to modern technology the time to diagnosis is usually 2-4 weeks. In developing nations, and especially in rural communities without access to laboratories, equipment for the growth and analysis of liquid cultures is not available and a significant percentage of drug-resistant TB goes undiagnosed. Therefore, a bacteriophage-based diagnostic tool that does not require advanced training or equipment could significantly improve rates of diagnosis, which could lead to better treatment and improved monitoring of the spread of drug resistance. Such a method was first proposed by Hemvani et al (2012) using plaque assays of mycobacteriophage D29 to identify bacterial viability after exposure to the five most common TB medications. Although this study was carried out on concentrated M. tuberculosis cultures, the rapid and extensive proliferation of bacteriophages in the presence of host cells could enable the test to be performed on sputum samples of affected patients, with diagnosis requiring no more than 48 hours. Furthermore, the addition of a chromoprotein marker to the phage"

Therefore, financial status could provide the rich only with the possibility of becoming a ‘better’ person when it comes to genetic constitution.
We addressed the challenges described above with the creation of our detection method and discussed the topics in our expert discussion at the University of Stirling. Here we talked about why gene doping detection is so important and why it is extremely important to unite strengths. You can watch the movie on this discussion below.

Video 1. Our expert discussion on the future of gene doping.
2. Inclusion
In Anticipation we discovered the topic of gene doping in the broadest sense, both scientifically as well as ethically and socially. Subsequently, we took it further as a part of the inclusion process to involve as many people as possible for optimal design requirements for everyone. Here are some of the approaches we took in involving people from science , from sports as well as the general public .
2.1 Science
Here we elaborate on science related events that have largely influenced our project. At reflection and responsiveness we elaborate on individual stakeholders that have changed our project.
Hackathon
From our surveys we knew that 98% of the public feels strongly about maintaining strict doping controls. People feel that sports is only moderately fair and 75% is afraid of gene doping becoming a big problem in sports. These figures, and the strong collective spirit that was stressed in Stirling , prompted us to involve cyber security specialists in the fight against gene doping through the design of possible gene doping sequences.
On October 5th, 2018 we therefore organized a Hackathon at the Cyber Security Week in the Fokker Terminal in The Hague. The goal: engaging the public and especially computer scientists in developing their own gene doping sequences. We developed a software tool that learns from the ever growing database our participants helped create. In this way, we improve gene doping detection together, so that we are able to detect new approaches in gene doping and to be one step ahead of the doping developers. We think that together we are stronger, inspiring each other. Many computer scientists joined our event and provided us with useful input from a different perspective.

UNITN-Trento,2012,Team:UNITN-Trento#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,".
I will build and characterize our new lac operator-containing plasmids. I will then pass the information I gathered to Andrea and help her testing her parts.
These are the constucts I will create:      lacI_lacIq_pTAC_lacO in pSB1C3,      lacI_lacIq_pTAC_lacO in pSB4K5,      lacI_lacIq_pTAC_lacO_GFP in pSB1C3,      lacI_lacIq_pTAC_lacO_GFP in pSB4K5.      The gene we ordered is pTAC_lacO_RBS_CysDes into pUC57 and flanked by prefix and suffix. Since I need to extract the lac operator alone, along with Cristina I designed the primer lacoperator_rv, the reverse complement of lacO followed by the suffix reverse complement.
Since the ordered gene needs to be amplified, I’ve transformed it into DH5α.
I’ve had some troubles amplifying the 139bp construct, since the designed primer annealed with better affinity to the 30bp-long suffix. The results were two bands, one more intense corresponding to the whole ordered construct (unwanted), and one less intense of the desired length. After a couple of tries with different conditions and buffers, I’ve been able to selectively create and amplify the wanted construct . The key is extension time: shortening it to 10s prevented the amplification of the long construct.
Numerous attempts of amplifying the ordered gene by both me and Andrea resulted in low yields; it is strange, since pUC57 is an extremely high-copy plasmid…
This week we tried to insert T7 in pSB1C3, but from the sequencing we found that it didn’t work.
We also tried to extract the right band of the RL0024*(we designed with a star each mutation made on the construct)+prefix-suffix from the gel, but the attempt failed: the concentration of the final sample was almost nothing.
Discovered that the prefix-fwd annealed also at the end of Venus (the two proteins have N-term homology), thus we ordered ANOTHER primer, this time the prefix-fwd one… When it arrived, I tried again this insertion, both with RL0024 and 30 and sent for sequencing .
Giaco obtained the second mutation, the XbaI site .

Grenoble-Alpes,2018,Team:Grenoble-Alpes#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," instead of watts which corresponds to the responsivity curve of a photodiode.
→ The previous issue should be solved with the conditioning circuit:
This circuit can be divided in 3 parts: a transimpedance circuit, the amplificator stage and the memory stage.
I) transimpedance circuit:
As I did not find any photodiodes in LTSpice, I replaced it with an ideal source current: this is in theory the same thing, the idea is just to get a current which is supposed relatively low (the values for the current do not correspond to the following tests)
The aime of this stage is to convert the very low current into a voltage. The output voltage of this stage is:
As the current is very low, the resistance should be very high. A 400 MΩ resistance is usually expected for that kind of circuit but it is not an easy resistance to find, and I bet it is expensive. For the moment, let’s use a 4.7MΩ resistance: it is not as good as using a 400MΩ resistance as the signal will be more noisy.
II) Memory
The memory stage is the heart of the circuit. Its aim is to hold the voltage related to the dark current so that it can be removed from the experimental current at the amplification stage:
This graph corresponds to an initial current of 600 nA (dark current of the photodiode) which 10 pA is added from the fluorescence (let’s hope it will be greater).
The voltage at the output of the 1st circuit is in blue and the voltage at the output of the memory stage is in green. We want the green voltage to be equal to the blue voltage during the first 60s (it is the dark current voltage). There is a little difference at first of a few µV so I think we can consider they are equal. When the photodiode is illuminated, which comes out with a greater current and then a voltage lower (this is indeed what we can see at 60s).
The voltage is stored thanks to a S/H stage built with a capacity and a follower. After 60s, the switch is off, so the voltage from the fluorescence light is not stored in the capacity. However, as the capacitor is no longer supplied, it eventually unloads. A high capacity reduces the unload time: the previous graph is displayed with a 1µF capacity, but the voltage is pretty damn constant with a 100µF capacity:
It is quite important to take care of this stage: if its output voltage is"

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," include all codon substituted versions, because there would be roughly 10104 of those, which is computationally impossible to generate and unnecessary. Therefore, we provide the algorithm with a basic set of sequences that contain all codon variations within 9 bps around the first three junctions, a set of 72 sequences. The code for the generation of these sequences is given at downloads .
Directed learning will take place after classification. The database is further extended with sequences that appear in athlete samples. As the detected sequences form a start for gene doping developers to continue development, the addition of these sequences to the database is highly valuable to improve our detection accuracy.
Additionally, we added 30 DNA strings of 150 bps as DNA from other endogenous sources than EPO. The 30 DNA strings were randomly chosen fragements from four other human genes: ACTN3 ( Beggs A.H. et al., 1992 ), Growth Hormone ( Seeburg, P.H., 1982 ), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( Tischer, E. et al., 1991 ) and Oxytocin Receptor ( Inoue, T. et al., 1994 ). The chosen genes all have GC contents that are similar to the human EPO gene, around 57% ( Clark et. al., 2016 , Biologics International Corp, 2018 ). Therefore, they are especially important genomic DNA fragments to use for classification reference as they would be hardest to distinguish based on combinatorics. The reference genes were furthermore all chosen to be of length 150 bps, since that is the expected cell free DNA length for genomic DNA ( Fan et al., 2008 , Lo et al., 2010 ). In this way we are able to accurately distinguish between gene doping DNA and DNA that does not code for EPO as is described in results .
Data Simulation
To train our gene doping detection algorithm, we need to accurately predict the data our algorithm would come into contact with in a working setting. We need to take into account both the type of DNA and the length of DNA. We generated all sequences using R ( R core team, 2015 ). Packages used for data simulation are seqinR ( Charif and Lobry, 2007 ), Rbioinf by ( Gentleman, 2018 ), Biostrings ( Pages et al., 2018 ) and Magicfor ( K. Makiyama, 2016 ).

Conclusion [3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Even if we could not give the proof by our own experiments, many studies show that to bring a wild-type version of a tumor suppressor gene into a mutated tumor cell for this gene permits to launch the apoptosis. In vivo studies on Human in the framework of the prostate, ovary and lung cancers have already been hold and present convincing results.
The implementation of this study has been originally done to determine if the DVS , application in the fight against non small cell lung cancer, is feasible or not. Because we have not been able to conclude, the implementation of the study has been done by analyzing several publications. According to these publications, the application is first confirmed in the framework of the chosen pathology but it can also be reached to others cancers like hepatocellular carcinoma, on which the fact to bring a gene suppressor of tumor launch the apoptosis process. The only limitation is set by the tissue vector tropism.

Anti-KRAS siRNA (siRNA for KRAS gene silencing)
Introduction
This part is an artificially designed RNA strand. It serves as an element of the Team NJU-CHINA RNAi module which can be used for down-regulation of KRAS expression in lung adenocarcinoma cells. We designed specific KRAS siRNA with algorithm based on a software developed by SYSU-Software team. This tool can find the best siRNA sequence on target gene KRAS to ascertain the maximum gene-specificity and silencing efficacy and also designs the pair of oligonucleotides needed to generate short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in the plasmid. Then we synthesize the shRNA sequence from a DNA synthesis company (Genscript).
Figure 1. The sequence of KRAS shRNA
Usage and Biology
We packaged KRAS siRNA into exosomes by transfecting HEK293 cells with a plasmid expressing KRAS siRNA and then collected siRNA-encapsulated exosomes. When modified exosomes being intravenously injected, they will specifically recognize integrin receptors and fuse with lung adenocarcinoma cells under the direction of the iRGD peptide. Once inside cells, KRAS siRNA will bind to KRAS mRNA through base-pairing and digest the mRNA, resulting in sharp decrease of K-ras in lung cancer cells. As a consequence, K-ras protein’s reduction and disturbed function will both result in the inhabitation of the proliferation of cancer cells, which ultimately have some therapeutic effects on lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer in this case).
Characterization
Interference efficiency of anti-KRAS siRNA plasmid
To ensure the interference efficiency of anti-KRAS siRNA plasmid, we transfected it into human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and then extracted protein from these cells to perform western blot. Significant down-regulation of K-ras can be observed in A549 cells treated with anti-KRAS siRNA, demonstrating that anti-KRAS siRNA has the gene silencing effect on lung cancer cells"

Bielefeld-Germany,2010,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project#Theory_-_-_TEXT.html," has a special ori, named R6K, which can only amplify in E. coli strains that express the gene pir to produce the so called Pir protein. Most of the strains used in laboratory are pir- but few (e.g EC100D) are pir+ ( Bowers et al., 2007 ).
The setup of the different oris was chosen to separate both plamids at this experimental stage. To change the read out system from KanR to luciferase, one just needs to perform two transformations and isolations of plasmids. In the first step plasmids are isolated from colonies with positive binding properties to one of the tested substances. This mixture of plasmids with ColE1 and R6K oris is then transformed to a pir- strain (e.g. TOP10). In the following only the plasmid with ColE1 ori will be amplified during the growth of the transformants, leading to pure plasmids with virA when plasmids are isolated for a second time. In the last step this isolated DNA can be transformed to bacteria including another read out plasmid (e.g. with luciferase).

Initial Population of The Depot
Teams ZJU-China, UCSF, Stanford-Brown, and Bielefeld-Germany collaborated with our team in an effort to see how our promoter characterization standards worked in practice by further characterizing the Anderson Promoter Collection (J23100-J23119). This collaborative effort taught new and verified many important facets in making data standards: how to communicate in a common vocabulary in a global environment, to weave in standardization with the already strict timetables of iGEM teams, and to understand what components of the characterization process can be standardized. Most importantly, however, this process showed iGEM-er's eagerness to share. Check out the results of this collaborative efforts at The Depot.

Required Devices
The three required constructions shown various fluorescence intensity at OD 600 nm = 0.5, as shown on graph and bar chart below.  As shown on corrected GFP fluorescence intensity according to OD 600 nm, the relationship between corrected GFP fluorescence and OD 600 nm is linear that corresponded to the expected profile for a constitutive promoter.
Theoritically constructions I20260 and J3101 were similar, constructions and alignments in sillico matched perfectly. The difference between these constructions lies on the assembly way. However we obtained, as some other teams (University of Oxford, Paris-Bettencourt and ITESM-CEM), significant GFP expression difference. There is probably a Biobrick standard  construction problem, which relates to the traited question on our Phylosophy subsection.
Entire Anderson library of constitutive promoters (J23100-J23119)
Our team achieved the 19 constructions of the Anderson library. Constructions were first designed in a software(Geneious v. 6.1.6)and then relized on web lab using iGEM 2014 Distribution kit. Verifications were made by eletrophoresis gel analytic PCR amplification and sequencing. Glycerol stock of 3 colonies per constructions were conserved and used for the measurments of GFP expression.
Unfortunatly, we did not collect satisfying data for the 19 constructions,although assays were repeated several times. The data profile was repeatable under people, apparatus and strain. Strain carrying promotorless vector seemed to had higher fluorescence intensity than strain containing constructions from the Anderson library, that explains negative curve on Corrected GFP fluorescence intensity according to OD 600 nm graph. However exploitable data were collected for 5 constructions (100, 104, 105, 107 and 118) for which  the relationship between corrected GFP fluorescence and OD 600 nm was linear that corresponded to the expected profile for a constitutive promoter (See graph Corrected GFP fluorescence intensity according to OD 600 nm). Corrected GFP fluorescence intensity at OD 600 nm = 0.45 of these 5 constructions were presented on bar chart above and compared with registry data on table below.
Ratio were calculated dividing constructions corrected GFP fluorescence at 0.45 OD 600 nm by construction 100 corrected GFP fluorescence at 0.45 OD 600 nm.
Results were similar to registry results for the 100, 105 and 107 constructions contrary to constructions 104 and 118 for which data were significantly divergent.
Possible approach to overcome data acquisition problems:
"
NDC-HighRiverAB,2018,Team:NDC-HighRiverAB#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," they would put them into a separate container where we would add our bacteria. The benefit to the second option is that our bacteria are contained, and we can use the products for other things; A past iGEM team (MIT 2015) was investigating taking fatty acids and turning them into biofuel which would be a great way to use the products of our fat breakdown.

A fancy story about us detecting and fighting HUA (the high urbic acid) with UOX (Uric acid oxidase) man
Background
Learn more
Hyperuricemia is a annoying monster. It is a representation of abnormally high levels of uric acid in the blood and is best at attacking human joints, which can cause acute gout arthritis, chronic gout arthritis and even joint deformities. However, this is only the tip of the iceberg of evil damage. It can also damage the kidney, cause abnormal renal function, cause chronic kidney diseases such as renal stone and renal colic, and is closely related to metabolic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and fatty liver.
The various forces currently battling hyperuricemia show their deficiencies: side effects, drug resistance, painful treatment processes, and so on. Therefore, we all look forward to the hero who can truly defeat hyperuricemia.
The Urate Oxidase will be the hero, an enzyme in organisms that catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid in purine metabolism. It can oxidize uric acid to 5-hydroxy iso-uric acid, an unstable compound that is readily converted to allantoin in organisms. Allantoin can be easily metabolized by the kidney, thus lowering the body's blood uric acid level. When uric acid oxidase attacks hyperuricemia, the target of action is uric acid itself, so it will not hurt the body.

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," security thus come to the fore as relevant topics in designing an appropriate governance structure for emerging technologies (Kelle 2012).
Resulting from this duality between beneficial innovation and harmful outcome surrounding synthetic biology, is therefore a socially constructed dilemma that such a dual-use technology seems to imply (Tucker 2011). This dilemma thus pertains to practices and discourses conveying this dual nature through portrayals that can be both negative and positive depending on the social dispositions held by members of society. Moreover, the dual-use nature of synthetic biology becomes even more salient in instances when its use is set against an environmental backdrop where the technology is perceived as a strategic tool in bioremediation efforts and the development of biofuels, while the inherent characteristics of synthetic biology can cause major concern in terms of the ecological calamities it can induce. Hence, there is a discursive discrepancy that can become rather acute when its technological implications are concerned in relation to the environment (Dryzek 2005, Purnick and Weiss 2009).
It is therefore interesting to take a closer look at how diverging narratives on technology and environment can occur within one iGEM team working on an environmental solution. As part of the competition's Environment Track, the Goodbye AzoDye Project of UCL iGEM 2014 can from that perspective be instrumental in getting a better understanding of the dynamic tension between tackling the problem of textile dyeing process wastewater disposal, and the potential ecological hazards from the technology they are using to solve this problem. However, unlike genetic engineering and the production of genetically modified crops, synthetic biology has not yet been challenged by a widespread public controversy surrounding its scientific practices, mostly due to the general unfamiliarity of the discipline among the wider lay public. As a result, the iGEM competition provides an experimental opportunity to see how opposing discourses develop both internally and externally as teams look at various aspects related to their summer project (Pauwels 2013; Torgersen and Hampel 2012; Tucker 2011).
Anticipatory Socialisation for Sustainable Governance in iGEM
Considering that the iGEM competition urges students of synthetic biology to be comprehensive in the way they deal with in their own technology and their project as a whole, the assumption can be made that the competition and the iGEM framework in general, fosters a context of social learning for students. This implies that the competition can be seen as a form of education for responsible innovation that, in turn, demonstrates some of the qualities that are required to make the governance of synthetic biology viable in terms of managing sustainable innovation"

Vice versa, they assisted us on the interLab , especially on the plate reader.
With common interests, Team:NAU-CHINA
As Team:NAU-CHINA in Nanjing found out that we had parts Part:BBa_K2549061 , Part:BBa_K2549062 that they could use to build their genetic circuits. They reached out to us, and we gladly provided them with these plasmids with detailed sequence information and instructions on how to use them. The parts we provided were ultimately very effective in constructing and testing their signal transduction system. The parts and the plasmids containing them are listed below:
Part:BBa_K2549061 LaG16 with mNotch1 extented core region and tTA, which we have tested and characterized in 2017 .
Part:BBa_K2549062 : surface EGFP (surEGFP), which we used as one of our antigens against the SynNotch receptor. We have also characterized surEGFP in 2017 .
☺ Manufacturing and distributing, Team:OUC-China
Sharing a similar idea on how to promote basic science, Team:OUC-China and we, Team:Fudan , both wanted to provide a visual and entertaining way for people to understand synthetic biology. We took different approaches toward this mutual goal. They created a comic book on theories and technologies of synthetic biology . And we helped promote synthetic biology by hosting a Bio-Art display and propagating our ENABLE project and synthetic biology at the school fair, in both of which we distributed and displayed their book to grab the interest of the audience.
Surprise visits, Team:USTC
When our teammates went to USTC to visit their high school friends who studies there in July, they contacted the USTC iGEM team at impromptu. Received with enthusiasm, our teammates happily shared our ENABLE project design with them. The USTC iGEM team gave us a thorough introduction on their lab and project. Later in August, one of their team member also surprised us with his presence in Shanghai, so we delightfully gave him a campus and lab tour in return. We also had an in-depth project communication at CCiC.

The first BBMVs from the midgut of mealworms were made. TEM pictures of the first samples were made. From this could be concluded that all fat on the outside of the mealworm gut should be removed before making BBMVs.
Week 3. (18/07-24/07)
More mealworms were dissected. 12 different samples of BBMVs with variations in the protocols were made. An emission spectra, excitation spectra, and calibration curve of fluorescein were made. Varroa mites were dissected. Obtaining the guts of varroa mites did fail, because the varroa mites were too small. 12 mites were stored at -80⁰C until further use. DLS measurements were performed on the 12 BBMVs samples from T. molitor.

During my 2 years’ journey in the nano world, I got to know iGEM and joined in USTC Software team with great honor. Just as NEW YORK TIMES says, iGEM is a Do-It-Yourself Genetic Engineering Program. I am strongly attracted by this idea and cannot help imaging the science fiction picture where our daily life is changed by our genetic machine. It is unforgettable to have a brainstorm with talents from different academic background and turn our imagines into reality. Thanks to iGEM, I experienced a new trip in the synthetic biology and benefited a lot from my partners. Also, to compete against more than 1,000 other students from 100 schools, including many top-flight institutions is exciting.
I love traveling and always enjoy trips with my friends. I have a dream that one day I can travel around the world to discover the great scenery make new friends and experience different culture. Sports is also my favorite, I am good at playing football and gifted in table tennis.

PCR
We used the Thermo Scientific Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase . Amplification of templates with high GC content, high secondary structure, low template concentrations or long amplicons may require further optimization.
Materials
PCR thermocycler
PCR tubes
nuclease-free water
dNTP
Phusion HF Buffer (X5) or GC Buffer
Primers (both forward and reverse)
Template DNA
Phusion polymerase
Procedure
All components should be mixed and centrifuged prior to use. It is important to add Phusion DNA Polymerase last in order to prevent any primer degradation caused by the 3´→ 5´ exonuclease activity.
Phusion DNA Polymerase may be diluted in 1X HF or GC Buffer just prior to use in order to reduce pipetting errors.
Use of high quality, purified DNA templates greatly enhances the success of PCR.
We recommend assembling all reaction components on ice and quickly transferring the reactions to a thermocycler preheated to the denaturation temperature (98°C).

The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace the detecting cell more conveniently. We drilled two holes on the lid of the cell, to insert the pump pipe.
A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds"

After finishing the brochure, we delivered the brochures to farmers who contacted us online though China. In brief, nearly 400 brochures were sent to twelve cities and counties in China, including Suzhou, Yanan, Yancheng, Jining, Guanzhou and so on.
Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

    9) Repeat step 8.
    10) Centrifuge at 12,000 rpm (~ 13,400 x g) for another 2 minutes to remove residual wash buffer PW. Note that residual
ethanol from buffer PW may inhibit subsequent enzymatic reactions. We recommend opening the CP3 lid and keeping it at room temperature for a period of time to remove residual ethanol.
    11) Place the rotary column CP3 in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. To elute the DNA, 50-100 μl of buffer EB was added to the center of the rotary column CP3 for 2 minutes and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm (~ 13,400 × g) for 2 minutes. Note: If the volume of the elution buffer is less than 50ul, the recovery efficiency may be affected. The pH of the elution buffer has a certain effect on the eluate; buffer EB or distilled water (pH 7.0-8.5) suggests elution of plasmid DNA. For long-term preservation of DNA, it is recommended to elute in buffer EB and store at -20 °C because the DNA stored in water undergo acid hydrolysis. Step 11 is repeated to improve the efficiency of the recovery of the plasmid.

TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Team#Supervisors_-_-_TEXT.html," He worked on the combination of supramolecular chemistry with protein biochemistry and cellular biology, generating new approaches to modulate biological processes. In 2006 he became group leader at the Chemical Genomics Centre of the Max Planck Society, Dortmund. Here he was working on the chemical biology of nuclear receptors to understand and modulate the nuclear receptor-cofactor interaction, in close collaboration with Bayer-Schering Pharma, Merck-Serono, and Schering-Plough.
In the middle of 2008 Luc Brunsveld received an ERC starting grant and became full professor in chemical biology in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. In his research Luc Brunsveld uses chemical biology approaches to study protein-protein interactions. Two general themes are: 1) Supramolecular Architectures are being pursued as instruments to modulate protein-protein interactions and 2) the Nuclear Receptor – Cofactor interaction is being investigated as a specific protein-protein interaction with many unsolved questions, possibly amendable via chemical biology

To my point of view, the most interesting aspect of the iGEM project is the collective construction of a new way of doing bioengineering. The modular approach is clearly more efficient in terms of experimental effort and it also helps understanding how cellular functions are organized. Implementing new functions in bacteria should in turn help to build up more efficient ways to represent the living beings complexity. Besides that, I like  and challenges and iGEM is all of this.

I am a biology and immunology teacher at the Grenoble Institute of Technology-Phelma. One of the important points of my teaching is to train students to be able to work at the interface of different scientific disciplines. iGem is a very exciting challenge that plunges us straight into interdisciplinarity and puts teachers and students face to face with what we aim for in our daily work. Personally I worked in bacterial genetics during my PhD, a field I left some 15 years ago and which I am more than happy to work in again with our team.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,". Lower production of milk could also result in a healthier cow because the cow can put more energy in its own immune system. In order to bring the disease burden down, the environment and food for the cow should be adjusted accordingly. The stress on the animal should be minimized as stress has negative effects on the immune system of the cows. According to Gerbrich the solution to the antibiotic resistance problem is further reducing the use of antibiotics in all sectors of livestock farming. Besides this she thinks reducing the transport of animals can improve the situation as then the spreading of the resistant bacteria becomes less. When transport is necessary hygiene is of utter importance!

Insights
There are plenty of different diseases that play a role in the dairy industry.
Fast diagnosis is essential to minimize loss of cattle and productivity, since most illnesses cannot be prevented.
While only sick cows are treated with antibiotics, more antibiotics are potentially used in the chicken and pig industry.
Para-infectious diseases (spread through manure) are especially tricky.
The tool should neither be too complicated, nor take a lot of time.
Changes
Research into the chicken and pig industry.
Research into Bovine Virus Diarrhoea, a para-infectious disease.
Summary
As a farmer, Machiel aims to deliver qualitatively good cow milk as inexpensive as possible. In 2014 his company started to buy embryos to enhance the animal’s properties through breeding. These are strong races with health certificates.
Machiel informed us about different diseases that play a role in the dairy industry, such as Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR; viral) and pneumonia. For some (like IBR), animals can be vaccinated. However, often this is not the case. So, the only thing that can be done to minimize the loss of cattle and productivity, is quick diagnosis of illnesses. Currently, a blood sample takes approximately half a week to be analysed.
According to Machiel, no antibiotics are given to cows (in the Netherlands) unless they are sick. This is potentially different in the chicken and pig industry, which he suggested us to look into. Furthermore, he recommended research in para-infectious diseases, i.e. diseases spread via manure (e.g. Bovine Virus Diarrhoea).
With regards to our tool, Machiel thinks this would be very useful. However, the tool should then neither be too complicated, nor take a lot of time, as farmers generally do not have much spare time.

Restriction analysis on scaffold
Colonies were picked previously by Rianne. 10 of these were selected for restriction analysis to verify the transformation. For the plasmid containing CipA3, the enzyme SmaI was used. SmaI has two recognition sites on the empty plasmid, pHIPZ7, producing one fragment of 4.6kb and one of 900b. When the gene is successfully inserted it will remove one of the recognition sites, producing only one large fragment of roughly 8.2kb.
The following scheme was used to prepare the reaction mixtures for all restriction digests of the CipA3 containing plasmids.

Figure 25. Effect of steady state EPO concentration in plasma on the steady state red blood cell count. The blue vertical line indicates the neocytolysis trigger, when EPO drops below 9.8 mU/ml. The black vertical line indicates the EPO level where neocytolysis reaches its maximum rate. Below this EPO level, the neocytolysis level stays a 0.1/day. The red horizontal line indicates the red blood cell count above which the risk of stroke due to blood clots becomes prevalent. The stroke risk occurs at a steady state EPO concentration of 18.3 mU/ml.
When the EPO feedback loop is incorporated, the time dependent model converged to an EPO concentration of 9.8 mU/ml, just above the neocytolysis trigger. In the steady state model, the red blood cell count is 24.72 trillion total circulating cells at an EPO concentration of 9.8 mU/ml. The error between the steady state model and the estimated count by Lichtman et al. 2005 of 24.98 trillion  is 1.05%. Due to the large range of red blood cell counts and the low error between the model steady state and the expected average, the model parameters were not optimized to exactly match the"

When the number of bacteria reaches the threshold, suicide mechanism will be activated, then intracellular lactase will be released to the gut.
Thus, it guarantees the proper number of bacteria in the intestines, and continuously produces lactase, achieving the goal of sustainable and effective treatment of lactose intolerance.

Modification of Lactic Streptococci to Produce Arginine to Treat Oral Diseases
In this project, we transfer the gene segments which can code the synthesis of arginine from the corynebacterium crenatum to the lactic streptococci of which the lactate dehydrogenase has been knocked out through gene engineering, then put the modified lactic streptococci to human oral cavity so that arginine can be secreted in abundance when it’s acidic ,which is good for prevention of dental caries. Caries, one of the most common oral disease, is caused by that the cariogenic bacteria from the oral biofilm produce so much acid because of metabolism that pH declines to certain level which leads to enamel demineralization. Arginine is alkaline so it can improve the oral pH; it can increase the absorption amount of fluorine of enamel, enhance the antiacid ability of the surface of enamel and facilitate the remineralization of enamel. There is not much arginine in the mouth, but Glu, the synthesized substrate of arginine, is rich in our mouth. The lactic streptococci is a kind of oral probiotics, which can adhere to the surface of oral mucosa planting itself and develop and restrain the breeding of pathogenic bacteria. Besides, it has acid resistance and can produce bacteriocin which is totally good to oral health. We control the synthesis condition below pH 5.5 using pH control promoter, so arginine will only be secreted in abundance when it’s acidic and has a risk of dental caries.

Kinetic modeling for the limonene production pathway
Objective: To model the limonene production pathway and find the effect of different enzyme activities on maximum limonene production
Author      : Shashank Shekhar
Advisors : Jennifer Reed, PhD Brian Pfleger, PhD Matthew Copeland, PhD
Introduction
An enzyme kinetic modelling of the Limonene production pathway is done in this study. The work reported uses Michaelis-Menten assumptions to model the enzyme activity and rate of production of substrates
A set of ordinary differential equations were used to represent change in concentration of different substrates in the pathway using the Michaelis-Menten equations and solved using the ode45 solver available in MATLAB. The given differential equations is the rate of production of limonene, V9M and K9 are the VMax and Km for the Limonene synthase enzyme.
A steady state analysis was targeted and concentration of all enzymes was kept at 10-6mM. The initial concentration of all substrates was set to 0mM.The equations solved at (T = 1013 seconds equivalent to 27x108hours) did not achieve steady state. The substrates acetoacetyl-CoA, GPP and Limonene did not achieve a steady concentration. The concentration of mevalonate phosphate (Mev-P) showed stable oscillations. It was concluded that a steady state analysis cannot be used.
The aim of the project is to find the optimum range of enzyme concentrations for all enzymes in the limonene synthesis pathway used in our engineered organisms after maximizing Limonene production in a in-silico model of the same pathway. The control parameters for the model simulation are only the enzyme concentrations. This input parameter (Ei, Enzyme concentration) was in real-time optimized using a direct evolution algorithm. The range of enzyme concentrations in which maximum limonene (with a tolerance of 1%) in time T was produced in the in-silico model is the result.

Collaborations
It takes many recourses to accomplish extensive projects and collaborating with other teams is an important part of iGEM. In this project, our team has collaborated with several other iGEM teams in the aim to reach further. Presented below are the highlights of our collaborations, namely The Wiki Wizard, The BioBrick Workshop, No Money, No Project and What is Fracking? 
 
The Wiki Wizard
Creating and editing wiki pages, uploading files with the correct name can be a tedious task. Therefore we are making the Wiki Wizard, which helps with the naming of pages and files, making sure that they have the correct namespace etc. Also it has a WYSIWYG editor for content and syntax highlighted editors for html, javascript and css files.
It can be found on GitHub .
 
 
The BioBrick Workshop
The DTU iGEM team of 2015 hosted and prepared the content of the BioBrick Workshop from the 24th to the 26th of April, 2015. SDU ,  KU , and DTU collaborated to represent every iGEM team within Denmark. teams also participated. The BioBrick Workshop was an initiative to educate iGEM team members with the basic lab competences required to perform a synthetic biology project as ambitious as iGEM. It also provided an opportunity to introduce fellow iGEMers to general lab safety and cloning techniques while strengthening the social dynamics within the teams.
Highlights of the program included a general assembly tutorial for the creation of a new BioBricks independent of organism and project. In the tutorial, the teams practiced designing primers for Uracil Specific Excision Repair (USER) cloning and they integrated a green fluorescent protein expression cassette into a target location on the chromosomal DNA of E. coli. In order to teach everyone a variety of techniques, the iGEM teams were mixed and half of the groups used the USER-cloning technique while the other half used traditional restriction enzyme cloning techniques. "

Experiment Rationale
To investigate the behaviour of the lamda-cI thermoinducible promoter and show that when temperature is low (at 28 degrees Celsius), there is low fluorescence output. This shows that the genome deletion module is repressed. When temperature is raised to 42 degrees Celsius, fluorescence increases, indicating that the repression is lifted.  We are looking at both absorbance and fluorescence data. This analysis serves to characterize the construct BBa_K200022 , submitted by Harvard last year.
Summary of method
In order to characterize the thermoinducible promoter, absorbance (optical density) and fluoresence data were recorded over time for:
Cells containing the BBa_K200022 construct: The thermoinducible promoter.
Positive control cells: Containing the BBa_I13522 , acting as a baseline comparison by constitutively expressing GFP.
Negative control cells: These contain the thermoinducible promoter on its own ( BBa_K098995 ) with no GFP attached to it.
Analysis
Variation of the blank
Here we repeat a similar analysis to the previous part, except that this time we will account for variations in the blank for fluorescence data. However, we suspect that there has been a systematic error in the results returned by the fluorometer. The analysis brings out the data's most important features and compensates for these.  All the raw data files will also be uploaded in the wiki for further details and explanations.
28 ºC
At this temperature, variations of the blank levels have been taken to be between 250 and 300 Fluorescent units (discarding overshoots).
This means that once again, fluorescence data must be normalized against different blank data values to account for this variation.

Here, variations seem to be linear, as seen in the absorbance case so one of the causes for this may be evaporation.
However, they may also be due to systematic"

Expert consultation
To analyze our project on a scientific level we further did our best to search for potential flaws or improvement             in applicability and relevance of our system:
We were highly ambitious in contacting the science community to discuss and reflect our project.                 That is why we contacted a lot of scientists from different fields (e.g. virology and protein engeineering)                 and discussed in a constant dialogue different aspects of our system. Especially Dr. Manel Camps from Santa Cruz                  University helped us a lot by answering our questions and giving us recommendations were to improve our project.                  We also attended different symposia to stay in touch with state of the art research and presented our poster                  at the Cebitec Symposium to get in touch with other scientists in a uncomplicated way.

To further examine how applicable our system is regarding manufacturing processes, we created a concept on how to apply our method of                 Evobody generation on an industrial level. We developed a complete process from start to finish about using our molecular biological techniques                 on an up scaled level.
Business plan
Based on the process development and the integrated modeling, we did around our project, a business plan around Evobodies was constructed.                  In this plan we analyze not only applicability  but also compare the parameters of our designed process to existing generation techniques                  in binding protein producing industry. Furthermore we examined aspects regarding legal guidelines, tax law, accreditation and marketing."

Tomorrow we’re going to do the final test with the bioaccumulation construction (BB_Essential + K346004). So we discussed the procedures and let the material ready. Besides that, we tested if our construction BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation grows at higher concentrations beyond the ones tested before (20µg/ml). So we plated those colonies in LM medium on Hg concentrations of 50 µg/ml, 70 µg/ml and 100 µg/ml.
We also continued the validation and characterization of our parts regarding to molecular-genetic. Back again to the rigorous digestions using the following system for BB_Essential e BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation:

Silk in Therapeutics
Silk proteins belong to a class of unique, high molecular weight, block copolymer-like proteins that have found widespread use in biomaterials and regenerative medicine. Silk boasts an impressive array of properties, including: self-assembly, robust mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and biodegradability, each of which may be enhanced through a variety of chemical modifications. Here, we focus specifically on the silk fibroin produced by the Bombyx mori silkworm, one of the most prominent silk proteins utilized for therapeutic and biomedical applications.
Silk fibroin, one of the strongest natural fibers, is formed with glycine-alanine-glycine-alanine-glycine-serine (GAGAGS) repeats which self-assemble into anti-parallel β–sheet structures. These β–sheets are highly crystalline and extensively cross-link the protein, giving the silk its robust mechanical properties. This structure can be further modified with specialized processes in order to manipulate mechanical strength, degradation, and aqueous processibility.
Silk fibroin in both the raw and regenerate forms has been extensively utilized in biomedical applications such as sutures, coatings for cell culture, drug delivery matrices, 3D scaffolds for ligament, bone, cartilage, fat, and vasculature engineering, and, most recently, to model brain function in vitro . Silk has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for various medical applications and recent research has successfully demonstrated their efficacy for orthopedic purposes. These biomaterials are particularly advantageous for orthopedic purposes as they are fully biodegradable, avoid temperature sensitivity, evoke limited inflammatory response, provide a better mechanical match than metallic alternatives, and can be functionalized with antibiotics or other therapeutics to enhance repairs or reduce infections at the surgical site . Silk fibroin has also been developed for skin grafts and shown to accelerate wound healing, improve adhesion and spreading of normal human keratinocytes and fibroblasts, and upgrade the growth and development of skin tissue.
Perhaps the most exciting property of silk fibroin is that the self-assembly process of the proteins ensures the material can be functionalized for controlled release and drug delivery, a quality incredibly beneficial for in vivo structures. These interactive biomaterials not only offer a controlled and predictable therapeutic release, but have been proven to ther"

SynBio Intro
Before June
We hold a journal club to give everybody a chance to present what they have learnt from paper. According to this activity, all of us have learnt a lot knowledge about synthetic biology and known the frontiers of science.
Brainstorming
Before our team decides to make a transcription terminator efficiency calculator which is our project for igem, we held a brainstorm to find an idea which can become our project and will work, which everyone propose many impressive ideas. Then, we are going to see what are proposed.
First, a software called “Potbear” design by Xianggeng Liu, Yao Chen, and Zishan Woo. It is an all-in-one software, which can deal with all things about genes that you want to create. Users can choose promoter, ribosome binding site, terminator and other functional biobricks in themselves’ ways that they want. In some way, it is a friendly and strong database.
Secondly, Liuxing Shen and Mengshi Zhang want to design and create a new organelle which can translate electric signal to RNA and memorize information by using reverse transcriptase. It can produce products that other kind of cells can do by input different electric signal, like Taxol. Besides, the organelle is expected to live in cancer cells or E.coli cells.
Finally, the idea which we make true designed by Boyu Qie and Shui Jing is TTEC, in other words, transcription terminator efficiency calculator.  Users can use it online or download by PC. The main function of TTEC is that calculate the terminators’ user offered efficiency. Besides, it also provides a terminator database for users to select terminator they need.
After thinking and talking, we decide to make true TTEC, and we finish it successfully.

Imperial_College_London,2010,Team:Imperial College London#Schistosoma_-_-_TEXT.html," caused by Schistosoma is most notably found in young children between 5 and 10 and is rare during and after adolescence. The eggs of S. haematobium, which are excreted via urine as part of the parasite life cycle, can be trapped in the genitourinal system and elicit a granulomatous inflammation, ulceration or pseudopolyposis both in adjacent blood vessels and the urethral walls. The early symptoms include dysuria, pollakisuria, proteinuria and most importantly haematuria. The later can vary from small amount of blood found in the terminal urine to darker colouration of the whole urine sample in more severe cases and the condition can often be exacerbate by bacterial superinfections or bladder stones. The proportion of untreated infected individuals with bladder complication to those without seems to vary significantly (between 0% and 97%) however after treatment with Praziquantel a full recovery is made in most cases. Notably this suggests that the renal parenchyma is usually compressed but not destroyed although schistosomiasis-induced renal damage can be fatal particularly for older patients (Gryseels et al. 2006) .
Furthermore a study by Bedwani et al. 1998 also found urinary schistosomiasis to be a significant contributor to bladder cancer accounting for around 16% of the cases amongst the Egyptian population and the IARC (1997) found that there is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of infection with S. haematobium.
Intestinal schistosomiasis
Once again the eggs of the parasite induce an immune response in the form of mucosal granulomatous inflammation, pseudopolyposis, microulcerations, and superficial bleeding, with lesions mostly located in the large bowel and rectum. Symptoms include chronic as well as intermittent abdominal pain and discomfort, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, and bloody faeces. This condition manifests itself in chronically infected individuals at a relatively moderate level between 3-55% with 30-60% of diarrhoea cases attributable to Schistosoma infection. However the statistical significance of these numbers is debatable as sampling techniques have varied across different studies.
Hepatic schistosomiasis
This is one of the most significant complications Schistosoma can cause during chronic infection, which can cause long-lasting, potentially fatal health problems, even after treatment with Praziquantel. It is caused by S. mansoni, S. japonicum and S. mekongi"

Jake (the ""antagonist"") became more snarky than before while Mrs. Parkin was given more of an attitude. We hope that you will enjoy listening to our play (bear in mind that we are all new to acting!).
College interns
As part of our project, we had two A-level students from two different colleges come in and help us with the science and art aspects of our project.
Kiran is about to start studying for his A-levels. He arrived on the 3rd of August and remained with us until the 12th of August. In this time he learned a lot in the lab, even contributing towards some of our results (see the study on E. coli survivability in soil). Kiran will be pioneering his college's efforts towards their participation in next year's High school iGEM jamboree. Watch our interview with Kiran below:
Good luck to Eton College's iGEM team for 2012!
Poppy is a soon-to-be A level student. She joined us for a week in early September to start her artistic project which is inspired by the Arts Catalyst lectures from the artists who create work that “experimentally and critically engages with science”, with an aim to create an artistic expression to aid the communication of the project to the general public.
To represent the team's experimental use of GFP, a protein that exhibits fluorescence when under blue light in order to prove that the plant roots had taken up this engineered bacteria, Poppy's artistic project utilizes fluorescein, a compound that dyes orange yellow colour in the present of UV light and glow in the dark, to illustrate how root growth of the plants infected by the bacteria is promoted.
She says, ""Due to the frieze like arrangement you will have viewed my work from left to right, allowing a story to be told. Please have a closer look using the portable light. This emits  UV, causing the fluorescein to glow. The larger plants seem brightest; representing the successful uptake of engineered bacteria and therefore promotion of root growth.""

The procedure, as it is established by Zumstein et al.6, could potentially be adapted to be fit for PETase screening using D.I.V.E.R.T. Microtiter plates coated with PET-film could be inoculated with single cells from aforementioned pre-cultures before determining the hydrolysis activity of PETase using a plate reader. As negative control and blank for quantification, E. coli carrying only adhesive mussel proteins, but no PETase, could be inoculated in parallel. Finally, the most active clone can be picked from the microtiter plates and be subjected to the next round of mutation.
Mutation of a target gene could be conducted in a simple shaker-culture, induced with arabinose. According to S. Yoshida et al. (2016), I. sakaiensis, the organism originally carrying our gene of interest PETase,  can be grown on PET film immersed in YSV medium and shaken at 300 strokes/ min at 30 °C.7
