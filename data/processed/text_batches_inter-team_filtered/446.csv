Tsinghua,2018,Team:Tsinghua-A#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," which is the output in the signal pathway model. From figure 14, it is clear that the output is dynamic. However, using the whole time series as an output result is complicated in calculation and analysis. Thus, we decide to choose the output at a certain time as the output. Now the dilemma is how to choose the proper time that makes the testing is most accurate and effective.
The core concept is the greedy method here. As the result we observed in figure 14, the EGFP outputs at a certain time are different from the input, which means we can define a gap at a certain time as follow
$$ gap(t)=max\{EGFP(t,RL_{max})\}-min\{EGFP(t,RL_{min})\} $$
The $RL_{max}$ and $RL_{min}$ in the definition mean the $RL$ values that let the EGFP in time $t$ has the maximum or minimum value respectively.Generally, $RL_{max}=RL_p$ and $RL_{min}=0$.The gap can be calculated and shown in the following chart.
Then,the time that has biggest gap $t_{max}$ can be easily found by algorithms, for example, the simulated annealing we used.In this set of parameter, we find that $t_{max}=145$.
Next, we focus on the relation between the concentration of activated histamine receptor (input) and that of EGFP (output) in the time $t_{max}$ (145), which is demonstrated in the follow line charts.
As the chart shows, the concentration of EGFP soars when that of activated histamine receptor is less than approximate 250nM, but the growth rate decreases and maintains stable after this.And, by interpolation, we figure out the function of relation between the concentration of activated histamine receptor and that of EGFP in one yeast.
Then, we assume that the fluorescence intensity ($Flo_p$) and the concentration of EGFP in one yeast (EGFP) follow this simple linear relation.
$$ Flo_p=kEGFP=kf(RL_p) $$
Recalling the number of yeasts in the testing system $N$, we can derive the relation between the fluorescence intensity ($Flo_t$) and the expectation of concentration of EGFP in one yeast.
$$ Flo_t=k\times N \times EGFP=k N  f(RL_p) $$
The $k$ is scale coefficient and $N$ is the number of yeast in the system.To further improve, we combine the model 'Reaction in system' that provides the relation of hist"

University of Virginia
Vik from the UVA iGEM team completed a conference call with Jessica, Emma, Ian, and Adam to discuss important qualities and timelines needed to build a strong foundation for future iGEM teams at Delaware. Additionally, Vik shared UVA's protocols with UD, which will be extremely helpful for next year's project. We are very grateful for Vik's time and look forward to talking with the team at the Jamboree!
Princeton University
Jessica was in contact with Helen from Princeton University regarding a training video collaboration. A protocol was written by Emma (UD) and was shared with Helen to edit/make suggestions. Although the video cannot be completed in time for this year's project due to lab unavailability, we hope to start this collaboration for next year's project. We are thankful for Helen's time and her suggestions!
Community Engagement
Urban Promise
For our team’s outreach we have focused on the small local community. For our first outreach experience on October 5th 2017 four members of our team went to Urban Promise in Wilmington Delaware. Urban Promise is an after school program that works with elementary school students. Our team members taught the kids about biology. They taught the kids about lab techniques, they specifically focused on how to plate bacteria. In order to be both informative and fun they set up and completed a painting activity with the kids. They set up cups of paint, that served as the bacteria and gave the kids plates which served as the plates of agar that people use in the lab to plate bacteria. The kids used straws to transfer the paint from the cups to the plates. Then the kids were able to spread the paint around, as if they were plating real bacteria.
The Tatnall School
On Friday October 27, 2017 the University of Delaware iGem team held our second outreach event. Two members of our team went to The Tatnall School in Wilmington, Delaware one of which is an alumna.  The team members presented to the high school’s Biomedical club. The presentation covered information pertaining to scientific research in college. More specifically, we gave a presentation which encompassed explaining what iGem is, what to expect when studying biology in college, and our team’s current research. After the presentation the students asked a variety of questions pertaining to our team’s current project and advise for how to succeed in college.

We provide an example to illustrate the product-generating procedure. The reactant has two chains, A-B-C and D-E-F. A, B, C bind with D, E, F, respectively. The products are A and C. First we mix chains and trees. Chain A-B-C will not appear in the mixture. Since node B does not appear in mixed chains, tree with nodes B and E will be removed in the trim process. Because part C and F, A and D, are both bound to nodes, the final product should contain A and B both after split processing.
In the example above, there is only one product finally though two product templates are defined in database. What compartment does the product locate in if the two product templates locate in different compartments? A reasonable solution is to halve the quantities of the product and add it into both compartments. Another problem is that the corresponding reverse reaction would never be found because it fails to match two templates to only one species. The source of the two problems is essentially the same: how to describe intra-molecular reactions in framework of MoDeL language definitions. At present, it is not supported. However, supporting intra-molecular reactions is one of our future plans to refine our MoDeL language.

Because metabolism is the foundation by which organisms sustain their lives, we divided both pathway and module into two kinds. One’s prefix is Meta, which means gene network diagram generated by only those genes related to metabolism. The other one’s prefix is Entire, which means gene network diagram generated by the whole minimal gene set.
For the functions of fetching information from KEGG, we reused the project of two previous iGEM teams.  USTC_Software (https://2014.igem.org/Team:USTC-Software) and Illinois-Tools (https://2009.igem.org/Team:Illinois-Tools).
4. Processing gene to standard parts
For researchers aiming to bring their design into reality, MCCAP provi3des information related to standard parts and biobrick assembly standard. So that users can decide which certain gene to use and how to process this gene into a standard part. Currently, biobrick assembly standard supported by MCCAP contains RFC[10], RFC[12], RFC[21], RFC[23] and RFC[25].
Besides, considering the data, there may be some genes which have been processed into standard parts. In order to avoid repeating the wheel, then we tried to find out them from protein coding sequences in registry of standard biological parts. If a gene from minimal gene set has already been processed into a biobrick, MCCAP will provide relevant information and we call it biobrick content. For this kind of gene is really seldom, we also list all of them in a table by considering the user’s convenience.

In Indonesia, supplementary documents must be submitted to use GMM biological foods and products. In Australia, there is no such law for GMM products.
In terms of international trade (export, import), countries like the United States, India, and Korea have clear laws detailing the procedures. They have taken permission and submission of documents to the law regarding this export and import of GMM uses. In European countries, these directly come under the laws of regulations of GMMs. There seems to be no specific laws regulating international GMM trade in Australia, Japan, Korea and Canada.
The most important documents related to GMMs are concerned with biosafety, food, trade and production processes. In places such as India, European Union, United States, Brazil, Japan, Canada, there are many different laws regulating each of these issues. On the other hand, Korea, Indonesia, and Australia have only one or two laws governing all these issues.

The upper band was identified (score = 384) to be ArnA a bifunctional polymyxin resistance protein. This protein weighs 74.289 kDa. When trying to match the spectrum to the expected NAGA-Intein, we achieved a sequence coverage of 8.3% and an intensity coverage of 8.1%.
For the lower band the best hit (score = 459) was glmS, a Glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase. This protein weighs 66.908 kDa. Trying to match the spectrum to the expected NAGA-Intein yielded a 23.3% sequence coverage, but only 10.1% intensity coverage (see figure).
Figure 6: Alignemnt of the NAGA-Intein sequence with the MALDI results.
While the bands seemed very distinct and promising, the results from the MALDI experiment suggested that neither was in fact not the desired protein. However, since the lower band was a better fit than the top one, we do speculate, that the lower band does in fact also represent the desired NAGA-Intein, but we cut the band too broadly and the glmS, being only 2.5 kDa lighter, shows very similar migration behavior. This would have the effect, that NAGA-Intein’s peptides would be “overshadowed” by other peptides, like the ones generated from the glmS, a protein commonly purified during IMAC [Bolanos-Garcia 2006] Further purification, for example with strong cation exchange chromatography, followed by MALDI analysis, might have confirmed or disconfirmed our suspicion. We were not able to conduct this follow-up experiment.

Wageningen_UR,2012,Team:Wageningen UR#HumanBody_-_-_TEXT.html," it's limitations. Though there are several limitations in the model, it can be used for different scenarios involving the use of VLPs. In this paragraph we'll discus the limitations and it's possibilities of this model and how we can improve this model.
Important parameters
One of the major limitations of every model is the lack of information to determine the parameters. This is the same in this model, shown below is a list of the parameters we've estimated by the little information we've had. If better information becomes available we'll be able to predict a more precise simulation on how the medicine distribute around the body.
Ratio of receptor concentration between tumor and healthy tissue
Distribution of receptors on cell surface
Medicine absorption of tumor / healthy cells
Stability of the VLP
Packaging quantity of the VLP
Binding affinity of the VLP to the receptor
To determine the parameter of the receptor ratio ,receptor distribution and medicine absorption, clinical studies must be done to calculate the parameters. To determine the stability of the VLPs can be done by DLS . The packaging constant can be determined by loading the VLPs and let the particles decay so that you can calculate the medicine-particle ratio. To determine the binding affinity for the receptors, several experiments needs to be done to discover the affinity for the binding. It is also information available on the binding database , however this information is not complete.
Future work
To improve this model several things can be done. First of all, research should be done on several parameters of the model. Specially parameters involving the number of receptors and the breaking down of VLPs. Second looking into other models to further improve the mass balance equations to get a more accurate and faster result. Besides looking for things to build upon, we also want to look at the limitations the model has and how to remove those limitations, creating a more solid model.

General Overview
Our project refers to innovative matters such as genetically modified organisms. We have aimed to achieve the safeness GMO´s requires due to the impact in the economic, social and legal aspects. As a result, our Human Practices are divided into two big groups; Integrated Human Practices and Public Engagement.
Integrated Human Practices
In our concern of the biosafety of the development and usage of GMO´s, we developed a thoughtful and complete project that integrates the legal, social and entrepreneurship aspects. Respect to the legal, we created two projects of law-protocols which regulates the creation and liberation of GMO´s due to the lack of legal biotechnology regulations in the Mexican Law. As social, we aimed to make biotechnology products, as Erwinions, available for all those with serious social necessities through the creation of public policy that establishes the guidelines Mexico must follow to eradicate starvation. The entrepreneurship proposal refers that based on a reinforced business plan we developed an economical novel technology that efficiently solves the fire blight and that without it, it could not be possible to materialize our legal and social projects because each of them compliments and make a more strengthened plan.
Public Engagement
Tec-Chihuahua developed two subprojects to address two different but equally important challenge in Mexico; the lack of educational tools that sparks scientific curiosity at young ages and the disinterest in dialoguing about new technologies and their risks like synthetic biology. The first way to tackle this is by the creation, with the collaboration of TecCEM and TecMonterrey_GDA, of an Experimental Handbook for elementary education created with consideration of the National Program of Education, established by the Minister of Public Education (SEP by its acronym in Spanish). On the other hand, we organized an event for approximately 400 high school students called TecChMun, where students will roleplay delegates of different nations and will try to create real diplomatic solutions to various problems like antibiotic resistance and on the spot crisis like bioterrorism. This event will enhance problem-solving and decision making"

Transduction mouse cells (different incubation times)
NIH 3T3 cells (60% density) were transduced with MuLV IRES EGFP and incubated for 8, 16, 24 and 2 x 8 hours. Virus was taken from different supernatants (an older one and a newer one) to see, if it makes any difference. Cells were infected with supernatant (500µl viral supernatant, 500µl completed growth medium + 1µl Polybrene/ml) harvested at different time points. Results indicate that there was no difference between older and newer virus; best results were given with an infection time of 2 x 8 hours.
For testing, if centrifugation brings better transduction efficiencies, mouse cells were infected with the different viral supernatants and centrifuged for 45 min, 1800 rpm, 32°C. In two wells it was tested if the double amount of Polybrene brings better transduction efficiencies. However, we found out that cells were death after centrifugation.

This treatment delivery would be no more invasive than one insulin treatment, and has the potential to deliver treatment for an extended period of time in the same manner as the gut microbiome delivery system. A microcapsule delivery system may be considered a safer option because it localizes the therapeutic bacteria in its own environment instead of having it free in the body. Additionally, E. coli can be tagged for degradation by the immune system with the addition of specific antigens in the event that the integrity of the microcapsule membrane is ever compromised. The microcapsule itself can also be designed in a way that allows it to be degraded on command in the event that treatment is no longer needed or discontinued. These features allow the treatment to be less permanent and act as a safety switch when applied in vivo.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Results_-_-_TEXT.html," min), coacervation is still visible in both tubes, indicating that there is still sufficient long polyU to coacervate. However, after 45 min and beyond, a clear solution can be observed in the mix containing active Cas13a, meaning that enough polyU has been cleaved.
Conclusions
Here we have proven that the ability of Cas13a to collaterally cleave RNA can be combined with the formation of coacervates of long polymers into an easy and cheap detection method. By incubating Cas13a for one hour at 37 °C in solution with 0.1 wt% polyU and subsequently adding spermine to a final concentration of 1.0 wt% the presence or absence of the RNA target can be proven.
TDPs - Designing for on-site usage
To preserve activity of Cas13a and provide our device with a longer shelf life, we investigated the use of Tardigrade intrinsically Disordered Proteins (TDPs), which were found to preserve protein activity after desiccation and subsequent rehydration ( Boothby et al. 2017 ). We picked four different TDPs, two cytosolic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) and two secretory abundant heat soluble (SAHS) proteins, further referred to as CAHS 94205, CAHS 106094, SAHS 33020 and SAHS 68234.
Achievements
Plasmid assembly
The first step in using TDPs to preserve Cas13a activity was assembling the construct from the gBlocks synthesized by IDT. Since the first stage in the TDP module involved protein purification, we chose the T7 promoter. This strong promoter results in overexpression of the produced proteins. To assemble the parts, a Gibson Assembly ( Gibson et al. 2009 ) was carried out following the Gibson assembly protocol , and cloned into a TOP10 strain. The resulting colonies were then screened for the inserts after extraction of their DNA and subsequent PCR amplification of the insert. The colonies chosen for sequencing, included in Figure 25, were purified using Miniprep and subsequently sequenced.

Bands with the expected size for the insert are marked with.

Introduction
What is bioluminescence ?
Bioluminescence is visible light emission in living organisms mediated by an enzyme catalyst. The bioluminescence has been observed in many different organisms including bacteria, fungi, fish, insects, algae, and squid.(1)
lux system
Lux operon codes for bacterial luciferase (luxAB) and the fatty acid reductase complex (luxCDE) that is responsible for the biosynthesis of the aldehyde substrate for luminescent reaction.
The luxA and luxB code for α and β subunit of luciferase. Bacterial luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMNH2) and long-chain fatty aldehyde resulting in the emission of a blue-green light.(1)
FMNH2 +O2 → FMN + RCOOH + H2O + light
The luxCDE are required for conversion of fatty acid into long chain aldehyde.
luxC : reductase
luxD : transferase
luxE :  synthase
the luxG which codes for flavin reductase is very closely linked to the luxE gene
advantage of lux system
Adding substrate is NOT necessary
Light emission occurs AUTOMATICALLY
Objective
1. Cloning lux operon from Photobacterium phosphoreum
Why we chose lux gene from Photobacterium phosphoreum?
P. phosphoreum (NCMB844) is known that the luminescence intensity is brightest of other strains. (2)
But maximum luminescence levels require lower temperatures than the other luminescent species, because this species live in the deeper waters of the ocean. (2)
Method
Construction of biobrick
Original lux gene from P. phosphoreum has three illegal restriction sites.
In order to remove restriction site, we chose overlap extension PCR method and designed four primer set.

The Team
The team came together during the course 'Mammalian Cell Cultivations for Production of Heterologous Proteins' in the month of June. Due to our late team registration we have been working hard all summer to catch up with the other teams. Luckily Mathilde was able to work full time on the project from August and we recruited a fifth team member Maja who joined us in the middle of August. We are five students from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) all studying biotechnology at graduate level. The project is conducted at the Center for Microbial Biotechnology, where associate professor Mikael Rørdam Andersen is our supervisor together with Post Doc. Helene Faustrup Kildegaard and Ph.D. Dorte Koefoed Holm.

For future reference, we have the following stock solutions:
Leucine: 20 mg/mL, add 5 mL per liter
Histidine: 100 mg/mL, add 200 uL per liter
Tryptophan: 10 mg/mL, add 2 mL per liter
Methionine: 10 mg/mL, add 2 mL per liter
Of these, leucine, tryptophan, and methionine were made today.  To make leucine stock sol'n, dissolved 2.0025 g in 100 mL ddH2O.  To make tryptophan stock sol'n, dissolved 1.001 g in 100 mL ddH2O.  To make methionine stock sol'n, dissolved 0.500 g in 50 mL ddH2O.
Ran a gel of our PCR products from yesterday.  Visualization indicated that there were some successful PCR reactions.  From the right of the gel, there were bands in wells 7, 9, 21-24, and possibly also 16.  This appears to be slightly different than seen in the pictures taken earlier.  This corresponds to all three activators and two of the mCYC + BS parts (GliA and LexA).  Note that the actual sizes were very distinct for the activators but there was some confusion concerning the lengths and thus the identities of the mCYC + BS parts.
Ordered new dropout media.  This media has no carbon source, so we will be able to supplement it with galactose or glucose as needed.
Innoculated fresh colonies in YPD in preparation for transformations tomorrow.  Three 5 mL cultures of W3031a and one 5 mL culture apiece of GliA + GliArpt and ZifA + ZifArpt.  Took all cells directly from glycerol stocks, glycerol stock #1 in all cases (e.g. W3031a #1).  Placed in incubator ar 5:03 pm.

SYSU_CHINA,2015,Team:SYSU CHINA#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," our own tent. With posters and display boards, we introduced synthetic biology, IGEM competition and our project to passers-by in the campus. Besides, a small challenge was designed for them. We prepared several biobrick cards, if they can sort out a circuit that could function(a circuit with one promoter, at least one target gene, one terminator, and is in the right order), they will be rewarded. Actually, though most of the participants were not major in biology, they were really interested in synthetic biology and enjoyed our little game. What's more, a few freshmen and sophomores showed passion in joining us.
National Teenager High School Science Camp
In July 20, 2015, we were honored to give a lecture in National Teenager High School Science Camp as invited speaker, which was held in Sun Yat-sen University this year. National Teenager High School Science Camp aims to make full use of the resources of colleges and universities in China to activate and cultivate the science-related ability of teenagers. More than 10,000 students attended in the camp every year, with alternative holding schools. Since SYSU-CHINA is an iGEM team with rich experience, our lecture introduced the history, influence, and some great ideas of iGEM, and most importantly, we introduced some of the most amazing projects in previous years. The students present for the lecture showed huge interest to systematic biology and genetic engineering. Some of them asked very good questions and showed a friendly attitude to this frontier of science. Frankly speaking, we believe it is worthwhile to participate in such education activity and bring more people to the wonderful world of synthetic biology. This is a big success and we would like to continue such kind of human practice in the future.
Freshmen Work
Suicide gene is a plug-in for our system to construct the delayed suicide system. Two freshmen of our school were assigned in this task. They really did a nice job but due to the lacking of time and experiment, they couldn't get the final results in time before wiki freeze.
The structure of the device (BBa_K1641058[2]) as follows. With a pBAD promoter, the killing system can be induced by arabinose and the cells will be killed in the presence of yellow-orange light (540-585 nm).  Their experiment contains four groups: two experimental groups which our devices are transformed  into E.coli and two control groups with empty plasmids. At the same time, only one of the experimental groups and one of the control groups are added arabinose. After adding, groups were cultured"

Wageningen_UR,2014,Team:Wageningen UR#project#gene transfer_-_-_TEXT.html," the Kill-Switch, making use of the required balance between toxins and antitoxins. The activation of the Kill-Switch after induction and subsequent absence of fusaric acid will cause the toxins to be produced, disrupting the T-A balance, resulting in cell death. There are different theories on the T-A system putative functions that are not mutually exlusive. Besides plasmid retention, increasing evidence suggests that the T-A systems can act like a hysteric switch, in which a fraction of the population can enter a toxic state. In this toxin state the free toxins inhibit cell growth transforming the cells into persistent cells. In this slow growing persistent state the organisms become more robust to external fluctuations allowing it to survive in unfavorable environments [7,8]. Many micro-organisms contain multiple toxin-antitoxin systems, six T-A systems are predicted for P. putida. As free toxins have an impact on the growth of our host this characteristic has been taken up in the system performance model in order to describe the system as accurately as possible.
Approach, constructing BioBricks
Cloning the T-A systems in pSB1C3
The first step to build the toxins and antitoxin BioBricks was a PCR amplification and elongation to add a Ribosomal Binding Sites (RBS) to the individual toxins and antitoxins and incorporate standard overhangs for RFC10 assembly , containing the BioBrick prefix and suffix. Two plasmids, pHT286 and pAB24, containing Zeta-Epsilon and Kis-Kid respectively, were obtained from Imperial Imperial College London (ICL) ACS Synthetic Biology [2]. After successful amplification and elongation, the toxins and antoxins were cloned in the standard iGEM backbone pSB1C3 with and without the LacI promoter BBa_R0010 .
Toxins and antitoxins cloned in pSB1C3 containing and not containing the LacI promoter were transformed into commercially DH5a cells. Moreover, toxins and antitoxins containing the LacI promoter were transformed into E. coli JM109, that expresses the LacI repressor, and therefore can inhibit the production of toxin, a desirable effect to avoid the death of the cell by their toxic effect.
Cloning the toxins in a low copy number plasmid in combination with the antitoxins
An alternative approach was taken, cloning the two toxins in low copy number plasmids in electro competent cells containing the antitoxins in the pSB1C3 backbone. To chose the most appropriate backbone we"

I am 20 years old and I have just finished my first year of the nanobioscience bachelor.  I have great experience in project-management from the technical high school, but have very little previous experience with the microbiology lab.
I joined the iGEM team because I always thought genetically engineering to be exciting and to gain valuable experience in this line of work. And mostly because it sounds fun.

Helle Bogetofte Thomasen.
My name is Helle Bogetofte Thomasen, I am 23 years old and have just begun on my 6th semester of medicin at SDU.
Regarding my motivation; I generally think that syntetic biology is a very interesting scientific field with great potentiel and I really look forward to joining the competition and meeting students from all over the world.
I would like to work in medical research later on but our education doesn't really involve any lab work. So for me this iGEM project is also a great chance to get some lab experience and try some things that I would otherwise only read about. Beside from this I am strangely fascinated by bacteria ;o)

Motivation: I found synthetic biology to be an exciting new field to explore. It has a lot of potential for real world applications and iGEM provides a perfect setup for us students to wrestle with new ideas and projects.
About me: I study medicine and am currently on my 7th semester here at SDU. I've worked on detecting LOH in a rare cancer called multiple self-healing squamous epithelioma at Odense University Hospital and spent some time at University of Illinois a summer ago trying to be helpful at Kelly Tappendens lab.

It was our opportunity to learn beyond our degree, to get practice in the lab (wet and dry) and feel responsible of an entire project. Then we learned about Synthetic Biology and got hooked by the way it deals with scientific projects.
I have read that the problem of albinos is that they cannot synthesis melanin. Could Synthetic Biology help these people?
Why not? A microorganism which synthesizes melanin is a conceivable project in Synthetic Biology. It would be necessary to analyze this particular disease and study the best solution, which may or may not be to synthesize melanin. Synthetic Biology could definititely be a way to work in the solution to this problem.
How do you obtain fluorescent molecules from jellyfish?
Fluorescent proteins such as GFP were originally identified in jellyfish and other organisms. Nowadays, the genes for several of these proteins are cloned and can be expressed (meaning the proteins can be produced) in many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals
What is the limit of Synthetic Biology?
By now the limit is technical. It is difficult to build a genetically engineered machine that works the way you expect it. And it is hard to characterize each singular part and the system as a whole.
But if you mean the ethical limit, it is defined by each scientific team; having in mind the limits of legality. When we talk about synthetic living forms we must analyze advantages and disadvantages and the ethical limits are set by the society in which we live.
How did Synthetic Biology start? Was it by necessity or by chance?
By chance, the chance that some engineers felt challenged to change their field of work to Biology and felt that their Engineering approach could be a new useful way to study Biology.

Analysis of subtilin impact on pathogens
To prove that subtilin has an inhibiting impact on pathogens and thus, is convenient as a BaKillus killing strategy, different growth and killing assays were performed. These experiments included spot-on-lawn-assays, growth and killing curves and luminescence assays and were conducted for Streptococcus pneumoniae and with the kind support of the iGEM Team Groningen also with Staphylococcus aureus sp., including MRSA. Protocols to the specific assays can be found here .
Heterologous expression
As our working horse Bacillus subtilis 168 is closely related to the subtilin producer Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633, one approach for subtilin production is the heterologous expression by transferring the complete spaBTCSIFEGRK gene cluster into B. subtilis. In this case, the native regulation of subtilin biosynthesis and immunity, the two-component system spaRK,  is maintained. Moreover, the transition state regulation should be similar for both organisms.
The BioBrick approach
The SynBio approach of this subproject is the standardization of the subtilin gene cluster. Therefore, the gene cluster was subdivided into BioBricks according to their function and maintaining the transcription entities. However, in contrast to the classical heterologous expression, the BioBricks are standardized according to the RFC10 or the RFC25 standard, respectively.  Moreover, gene expression and subtil"

Collaboration Introduction
This year, NYMU-Taipei 2017 has been collaborating with iGEM teams from all over the world!
(1) Taiwanese Universities
Chung Cheng University (CCU Taiwan)-Experimental Help
We introduced iGem members of CCU Taiwan to running Fusion PCR through webcam. We taught them the principle of Fusion PCR while sharing our experience and reminding them of some precautions of running Fusion PCR. On the other hand, they helped us characterize our suicide mechanism and sent us the functional test results.
Chung Shan Medical University (CSMU NCHU Taiwan)-Team Establishment
NYMU-Taipei assisted CSMU NCHU Taiwan to establish their iGEM team. We gave them advice about how to form a successful iGEM team and gave them a brief overview of the competition rules.
Chang Gung University (CGU Taiwan)-Education
This year, NYMU focuses on the Energy track, and CGU Taiwan focuses on the Environment track. In August, NYMU Taipei collaborated with CGU Taiwan in Wego Bilingual High School education. Through presenting different dimension of global crisis, we believe that these kids could be more acquainted with iGEM.
(2) High School
Taipei American School (TAS Taipei)-Experimental Help
NYMU this year collaborated with TAS Taipei, and they helped us with suicide mechanism functional test. Their test results make us more certain that our suicide mechanism is reliable, so our project is without biosafety concern as well. Moreover, we also educated Taipei American School how to conduct site-directed mutagenesis and assay biofilm production, which is also a great progress to their project"

The amount of DNA to add was calculated such that a final content of 250 ng of DNA would be reached.
The restriction digest was incubated at 37℃ for 2 hours, after which the enzymes were inactivated by heating at 80C for 20 minutes.
Restriction analysis on gel
The restriction analysis of the EGII and CBHII containing plasmids was run on an agarose gel. 1% of agarose was used in TAE buffer. 5 µl of SYBR green was added to 50 ml of agarose in TAE as prescribed by the manual. The gel was run at 100V for about 55 minutes after which it was imaged using a UV light source. As a standard DNA ladder, 1 kb generuler was added to the well in the middle.

Aim Restriction analysis of BGL1 and PAL2
The colonies have grown overnight and are miniprepped to isolate the plasmids. The BGL1 plasmids, along with a pHIPZ7 control plasmid are restricted with XbaI. The PAL2 plasmids are not processed, as it turns out the PCR reaction didn’t add the needed restriction sites. Therefore these plasmids cannot be correct.
The restriction tubes are placed in a PCR machine. 2 hours at 37℃, then infinite time at 4℃.

We use different primer for colony PCR . First, we use the chl upstream and downstream primers, after electrophoresis we get the right stripe. Second, we use the mRFP upstream and downstream primers, after electrophoresis we get the wrong stripe.
We get the Chl gene but we don’t get the mRFP gene, it shows that we did not connect snippet on the cell genome. When we do it, we also do a contrast experiment .We put mRFP complete and it primers together, after colony PCR  and the electrophoresis we get the right stripe. This suggests that the primer was correct.
14/08/2016 Aug 14th
1. We use the mRFP upstream and downstream primers, after electrophoresis we get the wrong stripe again.
2. So we decide to check the whole snippet. We use VF and VR to copy the whole snippet, the whole snippet was about 2053bp, but the snippet we get was about 300bp , that was clearly wrong.
15/08/2016 Aug 15th
1. Now we were confused. Why always can't successfully transfer into the TOP 10 cell? Why did it grow up in the B plate but doesn’t have positive results?
2. We thought about the above wassues, the only way to make it have Chl gene was transfer the PKD3 plasmids into the cell by mistake. In order to get the Chl gene, we use PCR technology to get it from PKD3 plasmids. So we make a verification experiment.
3. We extract the plasmid from B plate, use it to be the complete for cat gene, and we succeed. And we also do electrophoresis to compare with PKD3 plasmid, we get the same stripe. It shows that the Chl gene was brought by PKD3. To solve this problem, we nitrify after we copy the whole snippet. It will eliminate plasmids.
16/08/2016 Aug 16th
1. We copy the Chl gene snippet and mRFP gene snippet by PCR technology.  After electrophoresis we get the right stripe then we use kit recycle the snippet and the last we verify the snippet.
2. Use OE-PCR link two snippets.

Fluorescence
Test the expression of Pfus+mRFP+cyc1t+pRS42K in engineered CEN.PK2-1C strains, △far1+△sst2, △far1+△sst2+△ste2, △sst2.
We research the impacts acted by various concentration of α factor to the amount of expression of fluorescence  as well as the the growth of engineered CEN.PK2-1C strains, △far1+△sst2、△far1+△sst2+△ste2，△sst2 containing the examined circuit.
The plan and method
We set the concentration of alpha factor as 0umol/L，1 umol/L， 2.5 umol/L， 5 umol/L，10 umol/L，15 umol/L.We take out 5ml cultivating bacteria liquid of each of them after 0、4、8、10、12、14、16、18、20、22、24、26、28、30h respectively and correct them by the YPD solution which not inoculated yeasts after shake culture. Afterwards,the intensity of triggered fluorescence is measured in microplate reader(584/607).We create the coordianate system of the expression of fluorescence of engeneering yeast by setting the value of that intensity of triggered fluorescence/OD600 as Y-axis and time taken as X- axis.
The results and discuss
With the increase of the concentration of α factor, the fluorescence intensity increased.
With the increase of the concentration of α factor, the fluorescence intensity increased.
The strongest expression of fluorescence belongs to △far1+△sst2, while that of △far1+△sst2+△ste2 and Cen.PK2-1C are similar.
Conclusion：From the above results we can see that in the α factor concentration range, the expression of mRFP was induced. With the increase of the concentration of the alpha factor, the fluorescence expression was enhanced. And more obvious. Knocking down the sst2 and far1gene, making the strain respond to α factor enhanced.

Nanjing-China,2016,Team:Nanjing-China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," students in team NEFU-China are excited about this invitation and expressed intense interests in collaboration. Therefore, about one month later, they invited us to their lab for a visit. Team members of our team gave presentations in their lab and both of the teams had a great team communication about iGEM and experiments. However, because of the long distance and the big expenses, they cancelled the plan to come to our lab proceed experiments. Nevertheless, we are communicating through emails and we have supported them with experiment materials as well as suggestions on their experimental design.
 
 
3. Team UCAS
 
We formed collaborations with team UCAS during CCiC’s poster time. We are impressed about their hard work and great courage because they are the youngest team and the oldest students of their school (UCAS has been established three years ago). During the conversation between two teams, they put forward their future plan to use a kind of reusable materials to adhere bacteria, which is exactly the same as we tried last year. The adviser of our team realized immediately that they might have chosen the wrong reusable material. Therefore, we gave them suggestions about choices of reusable materials. Students of their team were grateful hearing this useful suggestion. Moreover, we also provided them with materials shown in the picture, which is used for bacteria aggregation in solution. No doubt that we saved them a lot of time choosing the reusable material and building the right equipment.
Establishment of New iGEM Teams
 
1. Southeast University
 
Students from Southeast University are interested to use DNA to manipulate gate control circuit. However, they are not familiar with characteristics of DNA. They are also unaware of iGEM. They came to us for suggestions about how to use DNA to manipulate gate control circuits and expressed their interests in participating iGEM in 2017. Thus we assigned one of our team members, Zhen Li to help them with their project design as well as give them information about the iGEM competition. From then on, we formed intimate collaboration relationship with them and discussed with them every week to track their progress. We even specially designed a brochure containing detailed explanation of iGEM competition to them. ( Click here to get the PDF file. ) The collaboration goes smoothly and they have already formed ideas about the project in next year’s competition. They will establish a new iGEM team next year with our help!

Concordia,2016,Team:Concordia#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," working on simulating cell to cell battles in the iGEM competition. NAWI-Graz’s project, titled “ The Last Colinator ” focuses on using two strains of E. coli, each containing a unique toxin-antitoxin system, for the purposes of creating a battle.
Although we weren’t using toxins and antitoxins in our own battle system, we still aimed to collaborate with NAWI-Graz on two fronts. We wanted to have a discussion about the ethical dilemmas in our projects; after all, both our teams are forcing cells to fight for instructional and entertainment purposes. Additionally, we wanted to find a way to utilize their toxin-antitoxin system in our own project.
Ethics Discussion:
On September 19th, 2016, we had our first meeting with iGEM NAWI-Graz over Skype. We talked about our projects and our experiences (both the good and bad!). We then got on the topic of the ethics of our project. In our research, and in much of the domain of molecular biology, model organisms such as E. coli and S. cerevisiae are manipulated for the purpose of furthering human understanding of the molecular world. These cells, although microscopic, are considered living entities, a part of the tree of life which also includes humans, plants, and much more.
Knowing this, we asked questions related to the rightness or wrongness of our projects. In a macroscopic world, it is seen as deplorable to force living animals to fight for human entertainment, such as dog or cock fights. Yet, in the microscopic world, we humans don’t have any issues with forcing cells to fight one another, or to die in the case of untransformed DH5α E. coli cells on LB+Amp plates. For what reason or reasons do we not care about manipulating our microscopic brethren to die for us? Is it because of size differences? Is it because there are vastly more single-cell organisms than humans? Because single celled organisms do not have nerve cells meaning they can’t feel death? Is the alternative just too problematic that the ends justify the means?
During our Skype call, we asked these questions and more to members of iGEM NAWI-Graz’s team. We touched on the aspects of cell manipulation, cloning, stem cell developments, and all sorts of hot topic ethical issues in science. Much like us, they had asked members of their school’s community how they felt about a project manipulating cells. And much like us, most members of academic institutions did not have issues with our projects,"

NU Models: Breaking Down Walls!
NU Models seeks to expand promoter and ribosome binding site characterization of E. coli to other non-model organisms chosen for their promise in other fields of research. All processes take place in a cell-free system to provide a consistent characterization platform. This information is useful in synthetic biology applications for healthcare, the environment, and industry as it provides a basis for DNA design in organisms other than E. coli that are more optimized for the needs of a given application.

Calgary_Entrepreneurial,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Market#_-_-_TEXT.html," During this process, the water becomes contaminated with fine silts alongside many highly toxic chemicals, making it unsafe to return to the environment. The potential toxicity from oil sands processed water (OSPW) has led to Alberta’s zero discharge policy. All oil sands tailings water must be stored in a contained environment (known as a tailings pond) where the fine silts are settled out so the water can be reused in oil sands processing streams. In the longer term, the water is stored with the goal of eventually remediating the toxins so that the site can be reclaimed.
Today, 200 million litres of contaminated tailings water is produced every day. These tailings ponds of contaminated water cover over 176 km2, an area 50% larger than the City of Vancouver. They are expected to reach 250 km2 by 2020. Holding 840 million m3 of water as of today, this will expand their volume to 1.2 billion m3 of water (Comprehensive Guide to the Alberta Oil Sands - May 2011). Every effort is made to reuse the water in the processing cycle, however it contains highly corrosive contaminants (naphthenic acids for example) that result from the extraction process and can cause corrosion damage to equipment that can lead to expensive repairs and costly shutdowns. In addition, these tailing ponds have been found to seep into the surrounding environment, releasing toxins into nearby rivers which harm wildlife and contaminate ecologically sensitive areas.
Stemming from concerns for environmental contamination, monitoring of wastewater and the surrounding environment is mandated by the government. Through the Joint Canada-Alberta Implementation Plan released in 2011, the number of ground & surface water quality and soil testing sites along rivers & ecologically sensitive areas is set to double by 2015, with more remote testing sites to be introduced. In this plan, costs for sampling are shared unequally between government and industry players.
Large oil companies generally hire environmental monitoring and consulting companies in order to do this testing. These groups either collect and test samples themselves or have samples from many waste streams shipped to a central facility for testing. These companies are actively searching for better technologies to rapidly detect toxic compounds in process water alongside existing soil, surface water, and groundwater testing. With more remote testing sites being introduced, they also require more portable technologies and are poised to be one of the largest customer bases for our technology. The environmental sensing and monitoring market is growing substantially. In the United States, it is expected to reach $15.3 billion by 2016 (BCC Research).

Alice recorded another ‘Desert Island… Science?’ interview today, this time with Dr Mark Ramsdale, an academic here at the University of Exeter. The interview will likely be posted to our YouTube channel shortly.
Whilst lab work has slowed down a little, the lab team decided to conduct some side experiments on reverse GFP, motivated purely by curiosity. Jack and Pablo followed the pJET protocol for the mini experiment. They also carried out some transformations for Killer Red, Killer Orange and pkD4 plasmids.
Meanwhile, Dan and Dr Paul James investigated the control and setup of the mini stat in preparation for initial tests tomorrow, and made overnights of wild type DH5α and plasmid backbones to be used in the mini stat.

As of today, our project name will be ‘Exepire’. We settled on using the word expire in the end as we wanted a short, snappy title which related to what we are doing - part of the project is looking at deterioration of kill switch function over time. The spelling Exepire is a play on the word to incorporate a link to our university, the University of Exeter. There were quite a few other ideas, but after a vote from team members and supervisors, Exepire was the winner.
The Westminster team focused on writing the presentation today, with the various team members doing write-ups on their areas - human practises, modelling, wiki design, etc - to incorporate into the talk.
The lab team for today - Dan, Eloise, Jack and Pablo - started using Modular Cloning to clone Lysozyme and DNase1 for our comparison kill switch tests. They also set the ministat up today and started taking ODs (optical density measurements) of the plasmid backbone before inoculating it in the minstat chambers.
They also made more overnights of Killer Red, Killer Orange and the pJET reverse GFP in DH5α E. coli cells.

We had a full team meeting today, with all our supervisors and instructors - Dr John Love, Dr Paul James, Dr Chloe Singleton, Jamie Gilman and Ryan Edginton - to discuss what we’re all currently working on, what recent setbacks we’ve had and what we need help with. We collectively decided that the logo needed a little revising to dispel possible negative connotations (e.g. dangerous), but overall, they were happy with our progress which was quite the motivational and emotional boost.

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Collaborations#Freiburg_-_-_TEXT.html," try a measurement of their mammalian cells.
They prepared a dilution series with biological triplicates of their NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts in the respective growth medium. The absolute cell number was determined at 106 cells/ml. The transmission of light that was measured by our prototype, is plotted against the fraction of cell culture in the sample in the left chart:
Transmission at different concentrations
A linear dependency was observed between the calculated concentration of cells transmission [%].
Transmission versus true OD of the sample
Calculation of the true ODs revealed, that the optical density of the samples was very low.
From the transmittance data of the dilution series, we calculated the true OD of the sample (right chart above).
Finally, we incorporated the measurements by team Freiburg into our characterization of the OD-measurement device that now covers multiple strains over three orders of magnitude:
Transmission of different cell types at OD-values from 0.001-1
The transmittance data of NIH 3T3 cells align with the transmittance of P. putida and S. cerevisiae strains, even though the measured optical densities are lower by 1-2 orders of magnitude.
Our friends in Freiburg also tested a Nanodrop, but reported that this commercial device was unable to quantify the diluted samples. In the end we were very satisfied with the results of our cooperation!

Our team consists of undergraduates, graduate students, professors, and advisors, who have all come together to create our FerriTALE. Each team member worked on a separate aspect of our project. There was a team for our detector , reporter , linker , modeling , prototype , and human practices . Some of us dedicated our time to one part of our project, while others tried their hand at everything. Each team member brought their own skills and knowledge, and sacrificed their time to make our FerriTALE become a reality. To get to know each team member and their contributions, click here .

Katie Fitton
My name is Katie Fitton. I am the president of the iGEM team, making sure everything that we are doing gets recorded. I am currently studying biochemistry and hope to go to pharmacy school after I graduate. In my free time in lab, I like to plan parties with glowing bacteria and food on petri dishes. Hopefully one day one of these parties will actually happen, and all my time planning will not go to waste.
Tashfia Chowdury
Hey! My name is Tashfia Chowdhury, and I’m the Secretary, Gel Master and lab rat for our iGEM team. I basically make sure that whatever we do is recorded both in and out of the lab. I am also the main point of contact between the faculty and students for our team. Currently, I’m a third year Biomedical Engineering student minoring in Chemistry, and pursuing a pre-med track. After graduation, my plan is to attend medical school whilst doing simultaneous research in a field of my own choice. In the time that I’m not tending to my iGEM duties, I like making gels. I believe our unique iGEM way of making agarose gels are highly therapeutic, requiring a certain degree of precision and patience. So far, my greatest achievement in life was performing CPR without breaking the patient’s sternum. Yaaay!
Stefan Tassoulas
My name is Stefan Tassoulas, from the live music capital of the world, Austin, TX. I grew up under two cultures, American and Greek. Every other summer, I would go to Greece and live with my relatives and then come back to America and go to school. I took interest in biochemistry in my ventures in olive fields of my village, riding my bike around, pondering about how the olives grow and what makes them so delicious. Now, at Georgia Tech, I followed my interests and I am now a Biochemistry student and I am now an iGEMer

Paris_Bettencourt,2013,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Detect_-_-_TEXT.html," the pREC promoter. With the cleavage of LexA, the expression of our reporter LacZ is started, which leads in the presence of X-gal to a blue color output.
Figure 2:Course of the detection and reporting of an antibiotic resistance gene with the CRISPR/Cas system.
After the plasmid has been released into the target cells, gRNA and Cas9 get expressed. The gRNA guides the Cas9 to the target, where it generates a double strand break. This activates the SOS response. As a results, LexA is cleaved which allows the expression of the reporter. In the presence of X-gal the cells turn blue.
   Our system is highly modular as with the simple change of the gRNA target sequence (20bp), any gene of interest can be identified and targeted. This means that our system can be used for different applications and purposes, as for example a mutation screening. It is also not specified only for E.coli and the phage M13. Our whole system can be easily transferred to other phage systems that target other host bacteria. In our case, as we want to develop a sensor to test Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we could in principle transfer our system to mycobacteria phages. With what we are presenting here, we have a proof of concept in E.coli. By using host specific phages, we can easy identify specific bacteria and genes they carry.  By building a library of phages with different gRNAs we could screen for many different genes in parallel including other resistances or pathogenic genes.
   For future perspectives, we plan to further test and improve the system so that in theory, we will generate a sensor that can be used without using high-tech laboratory facilities. This is very important, as easily to use sensors are needed in the developing countries in which tuberculosis is still a prevalent disease.
In a prospective design study we imagine the development of a handkerchief, in which our phagemid system can be integrated. By spitting on the tissue, we get a bacterial sample that will be tested by phages. Depending on which phagemid is integrated into the handkerchief, we can test for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis in general as well as for the different antibiotic resistances. A handkerchief is easy to use and the blue color output easy to read out. As phages are acting very fast, an easily usable and fast sensor system is developed.

Liao Chen (7.20): Discuss framework of core programme of simulation part of our project with Jiang
Hao. We decided to take consideration of the structure of complex, which solves problems we encountered when handling reactions with regard to complex molecules.
Liao Chen (7.21): We decided to model the species (either complex or simple species) using two data
structures:
ChainList is used to describe chains of DNA, RNA or Protein molecules. Small molecules are also
of such structure with only one element on one chain.
Tree structure is used to describe binding state of elements of different chains. Children nodes
bind with each other and form their parent node. Thus, other than chains, a species has its binding state forest, which composed of many trees mentioned above.
Liao Chen (7.22): We decided to store data of species and reactions in XML format.
Liao Chen (7.23): To search reactions of species includes, we need powerful support of species and
reactions database. But first, we need a database manager to manage our XML data files, which must provide query operation of data we want.
Liao Chen (7.24): We find it! Oracle Berkeley DB XML! It is a Native XML Database. It is capable of
storing and indexing collections of XML documents in both native and mapped forms for highly efficient querying, transformation, and retrieval.

The IPTG inducible lacI regulated promoter  ( BBa_R0010 ) was tested electrochemically to demonstrate its leakiness when not used in conjunction with strong expression of regulatory elements. This data can be found on our Electroreporting page.
A β-galactosidase (LacZ) inducible generator construct existing in the registry ( BBa_I732901 ) was found to possess a frameshift mutation, affecting its functionality.  This part was replaced with a new circuit ( BBa_K902090 ), which was characterized for functionality both qualitatively as well as electrochemically.   This data can be found on our Electroreporting page.
( BBa_K590025 ), the PetroBrick, submitted by the Washington team in 2011, was characterized for a novel function: the conversion of naphthenic acids and 2-hydroxymuconate- a catechol break-down product from from the xylE gene ( BBa_J33204 ) into hydrocarbons and potential value added products.  This data can be found on both the Decarboxylation page and the Decatecholization page.  We feel that these new and meaningful applications of this part present a distinct improvement on its usefulness for other teams.
The output of ( BBa_K590025 ) was also optimized through a program we developed in MATLAB for the optimization of metabolic pathways in synthetic biology metabolic networks.  The program allows you to build an artificial synthetic biology network in E. coli and predicts substrates that should be fed to the organism to increase production of the compound.  This was characterized and validated in the wetlab with the Petrobrick. This data can be found on our Flux Analysis page.

Fudan,2017,Team:Fudan#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," famous board games. It was much easier than developing a brand new one, but it existed big problems: borrowed forms are rarely incongruous with our contents and ideas. We tried to invent some rules ourselves, but none of us were familiar with board games. We also considered making online games once, but for us majoring in medic and biology, it was too hard to write complex program. The dream of spreading through the game remained on the blueprint for a long period.
Development
Things were turning around after we got in touch with a professional board game lover, Ruiling Zhong. Miss Zhong was the president of Fudan University Board Game Club. Luckily, she was such a nice person who agreed to help us with our board game project for nothing in return. She had rich experience in numbers of board games, and provided multiple examples for us as references. Several team members were invited to join their club activities to experience multiple types of board game. With our relative professional knowledge and enhanced experience in board game, we finally started designing.
After times of playing, discussing and brainstorming, we decided to abandon the previous strategy of copying and improving. What we want to achieve is a game that can motivate players to learn more about immunotherapy by themselves, rather than a normal board game just for fun. Thus we need a frame which suit our idea perfectly. This can only be achieved by developing the game mechanics and the contents at the exact same time. That was when an even bolder and even more impressive idea was brought up: To design a game of our own and by ourselves. And we started from scratch, to construct from the very first piece of stone.
And it was hard. We’ve been brainstorming until all the ideas ran dry. We’ve been constantly making tests until every part of the game was polished again and again. And we’ve been so desperate because things just didn’t seem to work out perfect. But it grew gradually. And after all the brilliant ideas we never gave up on, after all the joys and troubles we will never forget, Cell War was finally brought to life, on the fifth of July.

Tsinghua,2009,Team:Tsinghua#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," any other conventional treatments being administered.
One of the difficulties in advancing gene therapy technology from the laboratory to the clinic is that the perfect vector system has yet to be created. In clinical gene therapy, the ideal vector would be administered through a noninvasive route, transducing only the desired cells within the target tissue. This vector would then allow for expression of therapeutic amounts of the transgene product with desired regulation for a defined length of time. By definition, gene therapy should be able to replace, augment, or block gene expression toward a specific therapeutic goal.  Another major restriction in treating cancer with gene therapy is the limitations in specifically targeting tumor cells, especially cells sthat have metastasized into the systemic circulation.
Frontiers in Gene Therapy
Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPS) and Gene Delivery System
gene delivery system
In 2006, Shinya Yamanaka et al showed that mouse embryonic and adult fbroblasts acquire properties  similar  to  those  of  embryonic stem  (ES)  cells  after  retrovirally  introducing  genes  encoding  four  transcription factors, namely Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and  c-Myc (known as iPS). In 2007, mouse and human iPS cells were generated[4].
In 2008, Qiao Zhou et al identify a specific combination of three transcription factors (Ngn3, Pdx1 and Mafa) that reprograms differentiated pancreatic exocrine cells in adult mice into cells that closely resemble beta-cells. These reprogrammed cells express genes essential for b-cell function and can ameliorate hyperglycaemia by remodelling local vasculature and secreting insulin. This approach implies a promising application of reprogramming on diabetes therapy[5].
The booming research on iPS and the subsequent in vivo reprogramming implicate an enormous future. In addition to the obstacles of transformation risks and low efficiency, specifically delivering certain transcription factors into the targeted cells is another problem before the medical and pharmaceutical applications of reprogramming.
Therapeutic microRNA Delivery
Frequently referred to as ‘micromanagers of gene expression’, miRNAs were first identified as regulators of developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans. Since then, molecular biologists have been hard at work dissecting the pathways that govern the biogenesis of these small RNA molecules.Another important focus for molecular biologists has been the exact mechanism by which miRNAs bring about translational silencing of their targets. Recent publications indicate that this much-disputed topic might in fact"

Because the agar assay (Fig.3) is difficult to replicate and collect the data from, we just show the results of capillary assay (Fig.4) . We made a negative control using washing buffer and five concentration gradients (100mM/10mM/1mM/0.01mM/0.0001mM) of attractants. These E.colis were divided into three groups based on the plasmid they have been transformed into. The plasmids are biobricks, BBa_K608003 and BBa_K515102 (they are from 5A and 8F wells in plate1), and the McfR plasmid was designed by us. BBa_K608003 (5A) only has a strong promoter and medium RBS, so it doesn’t have specific chemotaxis towards TCA intermediates. BBa_K515102 (8F) is a biobrick from 2011_Imperial_College_London, which responds to L(-)malic acid (HO2CCH2CH(OH)CO2H).
Fig.3 Agar assay: The three plates shows the chemotaxis results of 8F towards three kinds of attractants, malate, citrate and succinate from left to right. The filter paper of attractants is put on the left, the PBS is put on the right, bacteria is in the middle. Here, 8F swims fastest to malate.

The cells were diluted 20000 times. 5A is a control which doesn’t have chemotaxis towards malate or succinate.
Malate: 8F showed the strongest respond. The tendency of curve of 8F was biphasic with maximums at attractant concentration of about 10-2 M and 10-5 M, and reached minimum at attractant concentration of about 10-1 M, which is similar to others’ work. With attractant concentration decreasing for 8F, the number of cells decreased slowly. McfR stayed stable at range of 10-7 M to 10-3 M, and had only one phase which reached its maximum at attractant concentration of 10-2 M, then it went down sharply at 10-1 M.

5. Selection by Cre-loxp system
Cre-loxp system played an important role in directed evolution, because we needed to screen a single cell colony only with one loxp site in the genome of each CHO-K1 cell for single copy insert of mutated TRPC5. Here we tested the function of cre-loxp system by making 3 different groups of transfection in the cells that already inserted with loxp gene on genomes using Lipofectamine® 3000.

Linkoping_Sweden,2018,Team:Linkoping Sweden#Human Practices#Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," For one, we adjusted our way of presenting the project to the public, but we also made changes in the lab.
In the survey the participants were asked to rate their knowledge about synthetic biology, the result can be seen in the diagram below where 1 is much knowledge, 2 is some, 3 is poor, 4 is none and 5: unable to answer.
As can be seen, most people feel that they have poor knowledge about the field of synthetic biology. This is something that should be taken into account when trying to communicate what we are doing in the lab. As a result of this, we tried to communicate our project through multiple channels. For example: when we took care about the Instagram account aimed at potential and current students at Linköping University (LiU Student) we tried to tell what we are doing through short videos, pictures and short texts. We hope that this proved a more engaging way to find out about the project.
The results also showed that the public prioritises synthetic biology in research over production of pharmaceuticals and other industrial production as can be seen in the chart to the right. The blue bar correlates to the amount of people who put research as the highest priority, the red one to industry and the green bar to production of pharmaceuticals.
This result, together with discussions within the team and with our PIs, made us switch from a focus on trying to understand the mechanisms behind protein folding in E.coli to one focusing on trying to increase the amount of correctly folded proteins. Because the survey showed that the public is more concerned with research than with e.g. industry, we chose to test our system of chaperones on proteins used in research at Linköping University.
More specifically how the answers were allocated concerning prioritization of research, industry and production of pharmaceuticals can be seen in the pie charts below. Since the public considered research and production of pharmaceuticals the most important, they are represented in the charts below.
Quotes
The following quotes are answers that were put under the section other in the survey. They have been translated freely from Swedish.
- I know very little about this! - Research
- Good luck!! - Research - Industry
- Good Luck! But remember that this [Synthetic Biology] is very a complex field, and  that there are some big ethical issues along the way! - Pharmaceuticals
- Generally, I'm very doubtful when it comes to manipulation of ""genetic material"", but I should learn more about this! - Research
- I choose production of pharmaceuticals as my priority field because we need to help sick people. And second priority -"

Safety
Considering the implications of synthetic biology tools to the world beyond the lab, It is important to maintain safe and ethical use of engineered organisms.
Lab Safety
Even a relatively innocuous chassis such as E. coli can be risky to use if improperly handled. To prevent our engineered microbes from being released into the environment, we followed our host lab’s guidelines for proper disposal of organic waste. To prevent exposure, we wore basic personal protective equipment in the lab at all times. This included appropriate clothing, covered shoes, lab coats, goggles, and disposable gloves.
When choosing bacteria to use in our microbial fuel cell for their special ability to degrade Terephthalic Acid(TPA), a by-product of PET plastic degradation, we were careful to select only BSL1 organisms. For example, we chose not to work with P. aureginosa, a BSL2 organism which can use TPA as a carbon source.
Some techniques involved using chemicals that are hazardous to inhale. When working with such chemicals, we were careful to only work under the fume hood. Flammables were stored in a separate cabinet and disposed of according to strict guidelines.
Safety in Collaboration
We transported materials between our lab and the Northeastern team’s lab in sealed containment to prevent release.
Safe Project Design
Since we were working on a prototype with possible real-life applications, we considered safety when making crucial decisions about important aspects of our design. iGEM suggests that teams consider the following questions when designing their projects:
Who will use your product? What opinions do these people have about your project?
Our product is intended to be used as a plastic-mapping and plastic-degrading device for ocean researchers and others concerned with the distribution of plastic in the ocean. The Seabin Project was very excited about Plastiback, and is interested in future collaborations. Parley for the Oceans also sent us a typical sample of ocean plastic. Read more about our human practices here
Where will your product be used? On a farm, in a factory, inside human bodies, in the ocean?
Because our prototype is meant to be used in the ocean, we envision a bioreactor design that ensures the"

Samples of the tracked paths (from left to right): Photosensor exposed to blue light, photosensor exposed to red light, wildtype exposed to blue light.
Figure 5: Tracking of E. coli strain MG1655-pSB3T5 exposed to blue light, MG1655-pSB3T5 exposed to red light and wild type MG1655 exposed to blue ligt. Both transformants move straighter than the wild type. However, the streightest path is seen when cells are exposed to blue light
This might indicate a decreased tumbling frequency, but the low motility of the bacteria, the inadequacy of the cell track software and the small amount of data analyzed make results of this experiment unreliable and a new protocol had to be devised.
Computerized analysis of the bacterial motility with the THOR prototype by Unisensor A/S and the Unify software
For this experiment we changed our protocol for cultivating swimming bacteria in order to optimize their motility PS1.2
The machine and software used for the analysis are prototypes and still under heavy development. Because of trade secrets it is impossible for us to explain how the machine works or give a detailed explanation of it's mechanism until the THOR has reached production status. Simplistically said it is a very advanced video microscope, with which it is possible to analyze liquids and the particles inside those in both 2D and 3D, while also tracking them over time and also space, since the camera/optical lens can also move along the slide, while recording.
2.5 µl of the bacterial dilution were placed on the center of the microscopy slide and covered by a cover slip, which results in a layer of liquid with a height of 6 µm. Afterwards the sample was sealed with mineral oil as to prevent a flow in the liquid. The data collection was done exactly as described in the previous experiment, with the exception that we used diodes instead of optical filters. The light used for recording was a red LED diode with a wavelength of 660 nm. The light source used for the exposure was a blue light LED, which emitted light at a wavelength of 470 nm, and hit the sample with an angle of attack of 17°. Moreover we also recorded the bacteria's behavior when exposed to a blue light gradient and varying intensities of light measured in milliampere ranging from "

(Source: Alberts, et al. Molecular Biology of the Cell 6th, 2014)
From previous literature research, we found that microtubules can self-assemble in vitro under appropriate conditions. The assembly of microtubule from purified tubulin consists of two steps: microtubule nucleation and microtubule elongation.
Whenever in vivo or in vitro, microtubule dynamics is profoundly influenced by the binding and hydrolysis of nucleotide—GTP. The tubulin heterodimers are known to bind GTP in different stability (Tian, 1999): α-tubulin binds GTP nonexchangablely, whereas the GTP-binding sites on the β-tubulin is exchangeable. The hydrolysis of GTP is coupled with the assembly of microtubule such that variation in the size of the ""cap"" of GTP-bound subunits on a given microtubule determines whether it will continue to grow or undergo transition to a rapidly depolymerizing phase. Generally, the change from growth to shrinkage is called a catastrophe, while the change to growth is called a rescue (Alberts, 2014). Therefore, due to the unique features of its dynamical behaviors, suitable condition is needed for tubulin dimers to reassemble into microtubules in vitro.
Why microtubule?
Microtubules, a component of the cytoskeleton, are widely found in eukaryotic cells. They are very important in a number of cellular processes, such as maintaining cell morphology, intracellular transport and cell division. So it has been a hot spot for research. Displaying microtubules on yeast surface will greatly promote the study of microtubules.
Moreover, Microtubules can act as substrates for motor proteins. Maybe we can use microtubule molecular motors to create a micro-factory based on the extracellular microtubule network we built.
Additionally, due to the important"

The use of a special protective mask in order to protect the eyes from the UV Light while analyzing gels.
The use of certain machines at the laboratory posed some risks as well. As an example the use of big centrifuges, which if mishandled could cause harm to the investigators.
Biosafety: No danger to scientists, the population or the environment
In the daily work with genetically modified microorganisms and cells, it is always important to consider various aspects of biosafety. When planning and conducting experiments one has to evaluate all potential risks and dangerous posed to human health and the environment thereby and take all eventual necessary precautionary measures (precaution principle). Under this principle, general contact with the biological material, for instance, shall be reduced to a minimum. As our project relies on a variety of wet lab work all constructs and experiments were carefully checked ahead of execution. Our work in the laboratory was determined not to pose any kind of unusual risks neither to the experimenters nor the general public or the environment. The strict containment of the experiments within the lab was ensured at all times. All strains and lines organisms and cells used were specifically designed for lab applications and are therefore not able to survive outside laboratory conditions as no aspect of our project work overrides these restraints.
Biosecurity: No potential misuse or dual-use character in our project
In order to fully ensure that a project does not allow for any harm to be dealt it is also imperative for the scientists to assess possible harmful misuse of an invention. Relevant to such an analysis are whether the genetic construct can be used directly or indirectly to arm microorganisms. Constructs for example that allow for the production of any kind of toxins or dangerous chemicals as well as genetic code that allows for the integration or transmission of DNA.
As we have evaluated our project accordingly we were not able to find any aspect of our work which could be used or modified to serve exterior unwanted purposes. No part allows for the production of any kind of harmful substances nor the spread of the construct themselves.
The debate surrounding bioprinting
The topic of bioprinting , due to the fact of being relatively young, is still currently being discussed in international ethics and safety forums and in courts. This is why we consider it to be essential to briefly present and discuss the main concerns around bioprinting. It is important to mention that there is a broad spectrum of perspectives and disciplines, in which key questions about tissue printing can be analyzed.
The world is facing a lot of challenges nowadays with the constant improvement and advances in the field of biology. These being"

Week 4: Let's get this started!
The first preparations for performing the qPCR were done. We contacted the CMPG, a laboratory from the faculty of Bioscience Engineering (FBSE), that is willing the help us and provide us the space for our qRT-PCR experiment.
The first four steps of the protocol ‘qRT_PCR_Protocol’ were followed with success:
We now have a fresh plate with an E. coli strain harbouring the methyl salicylate MIT brick (2006; BBa_J45700)
We have the isolated plasmid DNA from this very same brick with a concentration of 155 ng/µl.
We successfully designed primers for pchA/pchB and for bsmt1 using Primer Express Software (Applied Biosystems, Foster CA).
After we got this, we started with the preparation of three samples according to the ‘qRT_PCR_Protocol’ (step 5 – 9 and step 12).
29/07 – 02/08
Week 5: DNA contamination?
We continued with the isolation of mRNA explained in step 13 of the ‘qRT_PCR_Protocol’. This protocol was followed without any problems. We then converted a part of the isolated mRNA into cDNA (step 14 of the ‘qRT_PCR_Protocol’).
Before you start with the actual qPCR, it’s a good idea to check whether all the DNA in your RNA-isolation is fully degraded and removed to prevent any false positive results. Therefore we ran a regular PCR, which amplifies a plasmid DNA region, to check if there is still any DNA contamination. Because all of the DNA should be degraded, we should not be able to see any bands after a PCR, unless for our positive control. We put this PCR on gel and got the following result:
Because also our negative control gives a very clear band, we concluded that we have some contamination somewhere in one of our PCR products. So we had to retry this PCR with other products and it took a while until we finally got a  negative control which was actually negative:
Unfortunately it is clear that we still have DNA-contamination in our RNA-sample, even after a DNase treatment.

Descripcion general del proyecto
La Biología Sintética ha permitido cambios en todo ámbito biologico, uno de estos es la comunicación. La comunicación celular se ha basado desde tiempos inmemoriales en mensajeros químicos usados para intercambiar información. Como tal, estos mensajeros, independientemente de su alcance, se ven limitados a un sistema químico, incluyendo hasta esos mensajeros de largo alcanze, como las hormonas se vinculan a un sistema químico (cuerpo humano).  Sin embargo, este modo de comunicación está a punto de cambiar.
En este proyecto, nuestro objetivo es hacer que la barrera química  de la comunicación celular se vuelva obsoleta al usar mensajeros no químicos: fotones. Estos transportaran información entre células que han sido diseñadas para detectar y emitir luz, creando así un sistema de comunicación basado en fotones inter-celulares.
Estos mensajeros son producidos a través de reacciones bioluminiscentes y son capaces de atravesar múltiples entornos. Por ende, esta capacidad permite la propagación de información más allá de las restricciones químicas, biológicas y e incluso  espaciales. Como el mensajero es efectivamente libre de la barrera química, es un paso natural en el puente de comunicación entre los sistemas de base orgánica y aquellos basados en el silicon, como las comput"
Alberta,2010,Team:Alberta#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html,".  In supplement of the physical kit, we created GENOMIKON.ca , which contains an online lab manual, glossary, encyclopaedia articles, and protocol generator.  One of our goals is to challenge common misconceptions surrounding E. coli, such as the belief that all E. coli is harmful.  GENOMIKON will educate not only students, but parent and teachers alike.  Our kit will expose society's up and coming scientists to a field of unlimited potential: synthetic biology.  Aymen Saidane, one of the high school students who used the kit, described GENOMIKON as the ""application of what [he] learned in high school"". Although this innovation is a huge step, it will not change the future of education if it cannot get into the hands of students, so our team also created a hypothetical product distribution plan, outlining the entry of GENOMIKON into the market. For more details, please visit the distribution analysis and human practices pages.
Best New Standard
The BioBytes 2.0 standard is an innovation in the way DNA pieces are assembled into multi-piece constructs. With the BioBytes 2.0 system, all the parts that are created still fit the BioBrick standard and, as such, offer maximum utility to users of the Parts Registry. The BioByte 2.0 method is:
Fast - The addition of a piece to a growing construct takes 7 minutes.
Efficient - The BioBytes 2.0 Assembly Method was modeled as 95% efficient and has produced plasmids that have been successfully transformed into E. coli.
Modular - The BioBytes 2.0 system allows for the production of your own BioBytes by PCR, which can be cloned into our RFP plasmids or used directly in the assembly of a DNA construct.
Sequential - The BioBytes 2.0 system's sequential addition of parts and anchoring to an iron micro bead allows for complete control over the construction of your DNA assembly.
In Vitro - BioBytes 2.0 is an in vitro system, allowing it to be specific and fast. The parts that can be made allow for the in vitro production of plasmids that can be cloned into an organism to interface our in vitro system to living systems.
The BioBytes 2.0 assembly method is simple to understand. We have shown that even high school students, with limited molecular biology backgrounds, can construct and transform a plasmid in one afternoon.  Beyond its educational purposes, BioBytes 2.0 can also be used in both fundamental and application-based"
