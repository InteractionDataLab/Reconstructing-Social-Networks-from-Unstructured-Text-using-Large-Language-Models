Moreover, in our communication with other teams online, we found that the acquisition of data is pretty difficult, especially hundreds of large volume data, so we are pretty grateful to Clinical Laboratory of SIR RUN RUN SHAW HOSPITAL for the selfless help.
• Applied Design
In October, after rounds of testing using simulated samples in the laboratory of Zhejiang University, we took the products to SIR RUN RUN SHAW HOSPITAL for real sample testing. It is also approved by the experimental center of Zhejiang University(see scanned certificate document here ).
At the very beginning, Doctor Jin of Clinical Laboratory gave us a comprehensive training on how to use a blood sample in a standardized manner.
We were supposed to wash our hands in six steps, then wear overalls, disposable medical masks and gloves.
In October, after rounds of testing using simulated samples in the laboratory of Zhejiang University, we took the products to SIR RUN RUN SHAW HOSPITAL for real sample testing. It is also approved by the experimental center of Zhejiang University.
We were designated to use the blood samples in blood collection tubes with a purple test tube cap. Doctor Jin introduced that the blood collection tubes contain EDTA-K2 anticoagulant, which is usually sprayed, so that the anticoagulant is evenly distributed on the wall of the tube, and the specimen is prepared for whole blood, which is generally suitable for routine hematological examination.
1. Put a blood collection tube into the Allegra X-12 Centrifuge series of universal desktop centrifuge, centrifuge at 3000 RPM for 5min, the supernatant is the serum needed.
2. Unplug the purple test tube cap and use a disposable dropper to draw a certain amount of supernatant (serum) from the tube to the surface of the modified interdigital electrodes.
3. Immediately cover the purple test tube cap.
4. Throw the used disposable dropper into the waste bin specially for biohazard.
When we have completed the preparation and protection, the following is the specific compliance protocol (under the guidance of Doctor. Jin).
5. Collect the electrode-washed liquid containing serum to the waste bin specially for liquid biohazard.
Under the supervision of Doctor Jin, we performed several repeated exercises using real blood samples and then started independent experiments on the prototype of A Detector.
The whole process of product testing was full of twists and turns, but we eventually got experimental data of applied design! Here is our demonstrate , product design and"

NKU_China,2016,Team:NKU China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," his students to be careful because ""the product is easily to explode"". Pitifully, hardly when he had finished the sentence did it come true. Two of the students became blind with their face destroyed.
Event 2 Young Overseas High-level Talents Introduction Plan is a program started by the government of China. The program encourages young scientists to return and work in China. With the help of the government, talented young scientists can do research freely. However, many young scientists work so hard that they don't care about their health. They work for so long time that many of them suffer from serious health issues. According to a survey made by China Association for Science and Technology, scientists work for 8.6 hours per day in average, the longest of which spend 16 hours a day working in lab. Things are particularly worse for PhD students. They work for 9.29 hours per day. Recently, a professor died at the age of 35, the best age for scientists.
Traditionally, respect hard-working people are highly regarded. This tradition influenced all the East Asian countries. In Japan, you could still see that many people work as long as they could. Another reason is that the government used to encourage scientists to devote themselves to their work. This is because China used to be poor and weak in 1950s. Many scientists devoted themselves to the country and scientific research, which was badly needed at that time.
But now China is a confident and powerful country. As Chinese scientists are doing better and better, they shouldn't be encouraged to work for too long simply in order to publish more papers. They should be encouraged to care about their own health, instead.
Rationale: We hope to change the life of Chinese young scientists and we wish them to be safe and healthy. The most important part is to change their working habits. We decided to start from master and PhD students because it's a crucial period for them to form their habits of working, which might influence their whole career. The more people we could influence, the larger changes there will be.
Information collecting
What are the most common poisonous reagents in biology laboratories? We have asked many students in the campus. In fact, the answers varied in different labs. As undergraduate students, we can remain careful when we use the hazardous reagents. But postgraduate students might lower their guard after working in the lab for several years. So we summarized the hazardous reagents most often used in biology labs.

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," to show how the youth of the discipline, already conceptually mentioned, is embodied in practices and scientists, and how because of new methods and ways, science is actually performed differently than what the Craig Venter Institute is promoting. The youth of the field offers the opportunity for actors to try out new ways to build knowledge, manipulation, place of science, criticism, etc.
It is above all a way to check out what kind of internal critics are made. That critics are both obvious, claimed as different practices by groups such as Do It Yourself movements, than something more softly performed in everyday science making process.
DIY practices are, to me, highly critical. By leaving academic laboratories, by building (both conceptually and materially) new kinds of experimental places, new tools, new ways of communication between scientists and open to non scientists participation, DIYists are clearly performing something new, which gives other aim to the science process. From a narrow  perspective, science could be regarded, amongst other characteristic, as a way to build knowledge, technique and technology. DIYists consider science as a social activity thus changing radically the standpoint we can have on it. That way, science is regarded as something in which you can find personal achievement, in contrast to the more traditional perspective where the scientist is erased in the process of knowledge construction. Science as an activity, as a hobby, as a way to find fulfillment, changes, as a logical consequence, who will be involved and concerned by such practices.
The logic is quite simple: when science is about creating knowledge, not for yourself as a person (in a learning process) but in order to contribute to the whole system of knowledge, your aims, concerns and perspectives will be different. Of course with social studies of science, we already noticed that human and social factors are involved in the scientific process. There is nothing such as a pure scientific mind. But, the discourses about “why do we make science?” are mostly lead by such participation to a whole system of knowledge. That way, the traditional scientist’s aim is to contribute to a big ensemble, transcending their own work, their own person, even their own discipline. However, if we look at science as an activity, you can answer the question with something like : “making science to have fun” or “to build knowledge from scratch, in a garage or a kitchen”. That way, non scientists can be welcomed by DIY communities, and such aims can be imagined as something to be shared by everyone. That openness to non scientists, now called “amateurs” (motivated but uninitiated people) allow us, in my"

● The sales of anti-oxidant products are on the rise.
● More and more people are pursuing anti-oxidant and anti-aging products.
Therefore, we have more reasons to believe that our product has a good application prospect in                         the market.
Wehand-bio
A leading innovative pharmaceutical company in Beijing, communicated with us about what our                         product can do.
● Most medicines would use antioxidants to prevent oxidation of medicines. So, our product                             could also be applied in pharmaceutical production.
● In addition to detect the antioxidant capability of antioxidants, we also can test                             whether the natural antioxidant products will deteriorate in quality over time.
Now, more and more antioxidant products are on the market, consumers are confused about the                         antioxidant effect of products and we learned it by questionnaires. Hopefully our product can                         help them.
You know the most amazing thing is that countless excellent natural antioxidants are hidden in                         nature, just countless starts twinkling in the Milky Way. When I was young, I looked up at                         starry sky and asked, ""Are there aliens in the universe?"". Someone answer, ""The universe is                         big, bigger than you, bigger than anything. If it's just us, it is a waste of space."" Today I                         wonder if there are excellent antioxidants in the nature to solve the problem of aging. There                         are so many substances in nature beyond our imagination. If not, it is a waste of space.                         Hopefully, our product can detect excellent antioxidants, which is our original dream.
We would do our best to make the product more beneficial to the world.

However, we persisted tirelessly with another PCR of pSB1C3, ADF-3+ and ADF-3, this time with a Tm=59º C. It worked for ADF-3+!!
We purified the DNA sequence of ADF-3+. Afterwards we did PCR again, but this time to amplify the backbone of ADF-3 that has the promotor pBAD, and to amplify the vector backbone for ADF-3+.
The PCR of the backbone of ADF-3 that has the promotor pBAD looks successful! Later we proceeded with the corresponding DNA purification.
Joyfully we proceeded with the Gibson Assembly to join ADF-3 to its backbone with pBAD. We transformed the E. coli, but no colony survived.
August 6 – 12, 2012
We did another PCR, but this time amplified ADF-3 with a Tm=56º C ;  The vector backbones of ADF-3+ and ADF-3 with Tm=60º C and touch-down PCR of the vector backbones of ADF-3+ and ADF-3 with T annealing = 54º C. Tragically, none of them worked.
The next day we did PCR again with Tm=59ºC of ADF-3 and the vector backbones of ADF-3+ and ADF-3.
The PCR of ADF-3 was successful! Later we did the purification of the DNA.
Afterwards, we completed the Gibson Assambly of ADF3 with the backbone PSB1C3 and the transformations of the E. coli. The next day finally we had some transformed E. coli! Immediately we proceeded with colony PCR to verify if the transformed bacteria correspond to our designs. Unluckily, the colony PCR was negative (the DNA strand that we obtained had a smaller molecular weight than what we expected).
So that we repeated the PCR for the vector backbones of ADF-3 and ADF-3+. The bands were from the right length! Afterwards we proceeded with the Gibson Assembly of ADF-3 with its backbone, and of ADF-3+ with its backbone. Both Gibson Assemblies were positive! Finally we continued with a colony PCR.

Colorado_State,2012,Team:Colorado State#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"olisin-As has a maximal activity at a pH of 4 and would work well in the pH range of 5.2-5.5 found in beer. For expression in yeast we had to account for codon bias, and optimized the sequence so it could more easily be moved from a prokaryotic system to a eukaryotic one. Another promising enzyme was AN-PEP. This protease already cleaves after proline residues and is stable at low pH. Used in the cocktail known as Brewers Clarex, AN-PEP has been shown to reduce gluten levels in beer when it is added to a final product. Unfortunately, the enzyme is protected by patent and was unavailable to us.
How will the enzyme be secreted?
Yeast have two mating types, called “a” and “
$\alpha$
”. Yeast of the alpha mating type secrete mating factor-alpha (MF-
\alpha
), which is tagged with a secretion factor at the N-terminus of the protein. Experimental evidence shows that this signal sequence is cleaved in the golgi before MF-
\alpha
is exported from the cell. It is commonly used by researchers to mark foreign proteins for secretion in laboratory yeast. The tag’s sequence was placed directly upstream of the sequence for Kumamolisin. The DNA itself was synthesized by IDT, but we were also able to extract it from the yeast genome by PCR. [1] [2]
How will we move our system into yeast?
Yeast can take up plasmids from the environment, but without selective pressure will drop them quickly. This would not be ideal for our purposes, as it would be unrealistic and potentially harmful to add antibiotics to every batch of beer just to ensure plasmid retention. As a proof of concept we introduced our system into yeast using plasmids, but we were also in the process of developing an integrative plasmid that would insert our sequence directly into the yeast genome.
Two plasmids were used:
pCM189: centromeric yeast plasmid, marker URA3, tetracycline repressed expression of target gene under control of tetO2, low copy number
pCM190: episomal yeast plasmid, marker URA3, tetracycline repressed expression of target gene under control of tetO7, high copy number
The integrative plasmid was constructed by adding the resistance gene for geneticin to pCM189/MF-alpha/Kuma-max.
How will we assay the enzyme and screen for gluten?

Commercialisation
Overview
Our exploration into the commercial potential of our Assemblase scaffold helped to steer the direction of our overall project. We started by consulting with a number of industry experts to understand how they could forsee our scaffold fitting into industry and research practices, resulting in several metabolic pathways suitable for use in our system being suggested as commercialisation case studies. Examples included the Taxol, Levofloxacin and Astaxanthin synthesis pathways.
By integrating advice from industry experts, we were able to thoughtfully and creatively redesign our project to include a focus on scaffolding the enzymes involved in Taxol side-chain synthesis, a choice informed by our understanding of its commercial context. We designed the relevant DNA sequences for the tagged enzyme fusion proteins that could be involved in this reaction. We also used our mathematical enzyme kinetics and diffusion model to  test the potential increase in product titre that could be obtained by scaffolding the enzymes with the Assemblase system.
Relevance
The Foundational Advance track exists to allow teams the opportunity to come up with novel solutions to observed needs within the industrial and scientific research communities. In order for our solution to add value on a larger scale, the team realised that we would have to demonstrate how our Assemblase system could impact a metabolic pathway of commercial use and value. Therefore, we focused on consulting with industry experts to gain an understanding of the target market for our scaffold, enabling us to adjust our design to best meet their needs, whilst compiling a short list of possible, highly commercial applications of our system.

Calgary_Entrepreneurial,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Market#_-_-_TEXT.html," the overall toxicity of a sample. Service companies must see clear advantages in using our product over presently utilized competing technology, both financially and analytically. They will be the primary customer source in our market. See below for an assessment of potential customers in our market:
Figure 9: Potential customers who we would market our product to in the oil and gas industry.
FREDsense aims to acquire customers from the oil and gas environmental monitoring service industry as well as the analytical laboratories required for government regulated toxin monitoring.  We also hope to be able to expand into small- to medium-sized oil and gas companies that would have interest in self-reporting in order to internally regulate their waste water streams and monitor toxins which can lead to potential corrosion problems.
Customer Requirements
It is critical to assess the requirements of our customers in order for our product to be adopted. In order to assess these requirements, we have communicated with many industry players to determine what they would need from our system in order to adopt such a technology. Our group communicated with HydroQual Laboratories based out of Calgary: an analytical laboratory which routinely monitors oil and gas as well as other industry water samples. They demonstrated several key areas that would need to be shown to be incredibly effective with our technology in order to have interest in purchasing it. These include:
Regulatory Approval - The technology must achieve appropriate regulatory approval for the oil and gas industry.  Environmental Technology Verification, Environment Canada, and Health Canada approval.
Sensitivity - The technology must be shown to very adequately demonstrate when any toxic level of any chemical is in solution (i.e. no false negatives).
Accuracy - The identification of a toxic sample must be incredibly robust.
Track Record - The technology should have a proven track record with numerous samples of various different compositions to demonstrate reliability within the industry.  The more of this we make available to our customers the better.
It is also critical to evaluate changes that the customers would have to make within their operations in order to utilize our product, as these could be barriers to the adoption of the technology. Our product will require a change in the measurement platform currently used, however, using the device is simple and does not require any technical training. Therefore, this may represent an advantage of our system rather than a burden. It may require some changes in staffing however, if more individuals are required to take samples on site. The data will require server space within the system of the customer, but we plan to design our system to integrate into existing server providers and data management systems, making this a minimal barrier.

London_BioHackspace,2014,Team:London BioHackspace#Policy Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," pollination of ideas between individuals with backgrounds in different disciplines and often leading to innovative ideas. We hope that the diverse composition of our iGEM team and the cross-disciplinary nature of JuicyPrint is a good example of what can be achieved.
Infrastructure for a community run biolab
When we began our iGEM project, our lab was not equipped to efficiently culture bacteria or perform PCRs, and we did not have the biosafety, documentational or training infrastructure to legally carry out transformations. As a result the majority of the time invested by our team during this iGEM competition was not actually on the biology and engineering of JuicyPrint itself but instead on sorting out the infrastructure in order to make our iGEM project possible at all. Thus, projects we undertook in parallel to our iGEM entry (some of which are still ongoing) are crucial to the work we have submitted for this competition and the continued work planned for JuicyPrint. Examples of these parallel projects outside the scope of our iGEM entry are our DIY flow hood and our Standard Operation Procedure documentation . We believe that these projects may be of help to those wishing to set up new community biology labs.
Collaboration
Due to the coincidental similarity of biological topic and the close geographic proximity of their labs, it was possible to set up an extensive collaboration with Imperial College London's iGEM team : We were able to inform each other's work on the development of protocols for growing Gluconacetobacter. As our work on JuicyPrint continues, we will be able to extensively test the Gluconacetobacter transformation protocols their team has developed and the library of Gluconacetobacter plasmids they have designed. As the Gluconacetobacter work from Imperial's iGEM team is limited to the time they have for the iGEM project, our lab will be able to provide a well equipped space for continuation of Gluconacetobacter work. Imperial have also kindly developed a model of the cellulose production in our 3D printer.
YSB 2.0
The Young Synthetic Biologists conference conference sponsored by the Wellcome Trust and UCL was a great opportunity for us to meet with many of the British teams in lieu of the iGEM regionals this year. We presented our idea and received plenty of great feedback about how to improve our project as well from all those who attended.

This festival, through exhibits, talks, and workshops brought together people from different horizons to meet and discuss. There were displays of devices and many different concepts related to economy, health, agriculture or environment were discussed. We presented the 3D printed models of the Mos(kit)o device made by our design students from ENSCI-Les Ateliers. We presented a poster, which gave us a chance to exchange ideas with a very diverse audience

Conclusion: We had growth for all of our BioBricks, but also for the negative control which indicates there was contamination. Given we have had several issues with negative control recently, we decided we would not let the contamination delay the project. We will risk colony picking with the hope that we have some correctly transformed colonies. This will be commenced next week. It is worth noting that for Constitutive Promoter BBa_J23106 and for the Gas Vesicle Cluster BBa_I750016 there was a continuous film of growth. This suggests to us that the agar was not selective enough.

One suggestion in the biosafety of the researcher is to include in the iGEM parts kit the bacterial less endotoxicchassi (developed by Berkeley UC 2007), to avoid serious septic problems in the case of an accident that leads to an intense contact with the bacteria (eye or bloodstream contact, inhalation or ingestion).
Another suggestion for population and environment safety is to (somehow) include in all biobricks an operating unit that detects if the bacteria is not in a culture media (detects some molecule produced through the metabolism of a specific media constituent) and express lysozyme to kill it if it's released in the environment (idea inspired by Team UNICAMP-Brazil 2009).""

Here we express our heartfelt thanks to Yang Bo, Xu Yakui and other staff working in the Student Office in College of Life Science, for their selfless supports for our team, such as communicating with professors owning unique instrument, connecting outstanding students in the art and designing fields, and help us during the progress of negotiation with the corporation.
In addition, we express our gratitude to Peng Hairong for her outstanding techniques of designing posters for iGEM popularization (Human Practice).
Thanks to the help offered by Student’s Association for Science and Technology in Nanjing Agricultural University, we successfully exhibited our project, conception of synthetic biology and iGEM to people in China Pharmaceutical University and communicated with them over concerning topics.
Attributions:
Project:
Instructors’ attribution lied in the fund and room for our experiment, and sometimes they may ask about the situation of our project and deliver their professional ideas about it. In addition, instructors delivered lectures to us about the security in the lab. Moreover, they helped us contact other professors to borrow some special instruments.
Advisors helped us to get the hang of the usage of some complex instruments such as florescence microscope and microplate reader for ELISA .
Nearly whole project was designed by us students and we were responsible for most of the experiments with the exception of primer synthesis by Genewiz. Following are the responsibilities taken by students:
Wang Kun was in charge of the construction and functional verification of promoter vgb. Li Huiyu and Jiang Zhenxiong also participated in this project.  Xu Xuan was in charge of the selection and characteristic exploration of three copper inducible promoters or generators. Zhou Peng also participated in this project. Zhang Xuan was in charge of the design and construction of CRISPRi system. Wang Yicheng also participated in the project. Hou Xianglong was in charge of the construction and functional verification of GSH coding gene: gshF. With the help of CAU-China, he successfully got the correct sequence. Xia Xianyou was in charge of the exploration of minimum lethal cupric concentration. Wang Weiyi was in"
Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Risk_-_-_TEXT.html," where we require extra finances that we cannot acquire, we will suspend all research and development activities not focused on reaching the market for our first generation product.
People Risks
Risks in terms of key personnel in our company have been outlined and contingency plans developed. These can be found on our management page .
Systemic Risks
Finally, systemic risks are an important category to consider. In terms of FREDsense Technologies, this could involve drastic changes to government-mandated regulation in the oil and gas sector. As our market opportunity is largely due to significant changes that affect regulated monitoring in Alberta, this could drastically affect the usefulness and viability of our products. Although this is extremely unlikely, as trends seem to suggest that regulation will increase in the industry, it is still important to consider. In the event that this occurred, we would shift our focus to target other more stable markets. Again, as much of the research and development activities of FREDsense focus on developing our versatile detector platform, transitioning into another market using this would not represent a serious setback in terms of timelines.
Risk Factor Analysis
In order to start designing a comprehensive strategy to minimize our potential risks, we have done a risk factor analysis. We have identified some of the key risks that our start-up could face as well as the type of risk and likelihood of occurring for each. We then came up with possible mitigation strategies and their relative cost. Although this likely does not cover all of the possible risks that we could face, starting our risk assessment early will hopefully help us avoid making critical mistakes.
* Relative costs variable due to new market. Markets requiring high sensitivity of analysis or specific regulatory challenges could invoke significantly high costs both in terms of financing and time. Versatility of platform would allow for relatively easy transition, thus we have made an assumption of low cost.
SWOT Analysis
In order to better understand our position in relation to risk, we performed a SWOT analysis. Here we identified four key areas: our strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats as shown below.
Key Strengths and Weaknesses
Several key advantages can be seen in our SWOT analysis. These include the versatility of our technology platform and the significant advantages our products can offer over existing technologies. These strengths are things we need to maintain, build and leverage. Through development of our first generation product, we will be optimizing our platform in order to facilitate the development of next generation products.
Despite our strengths, we also need to be wary of our venture's weaknesses. These include the primarily technology-focused background of our key members and the high costs that we will incur in bringing our first product to market. These"

I compared the forward and mutagenic primers that we have to what I originally designed and they were all the same, so the problem only exists with these reverse primers. I went through the primers I originally designed too and double checked to make sure they were good for the genes and restriction sites, and they all seem to be alright in those regards. So it is interesting that norC and nirS actually worked despite the error. I sent Dr. Grose a summary of the primer issue and she will order some new primers so that we can get working on cloning the genes with the right primers next week.

--CS-- Today I talked to Dr. Breakwell about our project to get some ideas about how to make the denitrification pathway work better in N. multiformis. He talked to me a lot about how the type of bacteria that N. multiformis is has a lot to do with whether or not adding the denitrification genes into it will work. We went through the redox reactions that are involved in ammonia oxidation (what N. multiformis already does) and denitrification (what we want N. multiformis to do)"
Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," team was doing wet lab work, learning the basics of performing PCR and doing gel electrophoresis. We extracted successful PCR bands and restriction digest ed our products before determining the concentrations of DNA using the nanodrop machine, after which we ligated our template DNA into the appropriate vector. We then prepared competent E. coli and transformed our DNA!
We've had to repeat a few of the protocols. 7 (one was faint so it was also repeated) of the 14 PCR lanes gave bands on the first day, the DNA from which has been ligated into pSB-1C3 plasmid s and transformed into E. coli. We repeated PCR for 8 of our samples and two gave bands, the DNA from which is hopefully transforming our E. coli cells tonight. For the samples that are proving stubborn to PCR, we are adjusting concentrations of template DNA and the annealing temperatures in an attempt to coerce our samples into amplifying.
On Tuesday, we ran a workshop for high school students attending a science summer school at Corpus Christi College, during which we went over gene structure and biobricks. We discussed the applications of synthetic biology and worked in groups to come up with potential construct designs. Tomorrow we're going up to the Churchill Hospital to visit the Urology department and talk to nurses about our project and the problem of UTIs. Also tomorrow, we are presenting our project to Biochemistry Department alumni to show them what current undergraduates are doing. Next week, we'll be splitting up into smaller lab groups and starting the Interlab study. Until tomorrow!
WHAT'S UP? 21/06/15
Hi iGEM world!
We haven't posted anything for a while because term and exams have been taking up all our time. But school's out now and we're preparing for a busy summer of iGEM. Our DNA arrived a few weeks ago and has been waiting for us in the fridge. The primers are in the post and we're busy filling in safety forms for induction into the lab tomorrow. And so after months of reading about secretion systems, studying biofilms and sussing out how to use SnapGene, we're ready to get started!
An aim of the project is to outreach to as many different groups of people to ask for feedback on our project, and to spread the message of iGEM and synbio. In lieu of this, last week we skyped with team:ITB Indonesia to talk about both our projects. They brought up concerns about depletion of our bacterial population in the secretion system and we talked about the possibility of antimicrobial resistance ."

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental"

Wash_U,2009,Team:Wash U#Biological Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," the saturation curve heights.  Cells  receiving the most light on the outside of the bioreactor saturate at low absorption levels.  This allows more  light to transmit to further layers, which have elevated saturation curves due to lower incident light.
Model Assumptions
- Light intensity at next layer is given by transmittance from previous layer (assumes no backscattering).
- Total energy funneled to photosynthetic pathways is estimated as the sum of light absorbed by each layer.  This  generalizes to the optical density measurement of cell culture density.
- The constant wild type saturation curve inherently includes both LH2 and LH1 contributions to absorbance.  The  mutant's variable saturation curve only accounts for LH2 absorbance, since this is the only complex under the  light-sensing regulation.  To account for the component of absorbance provided by LH1, the proportion of total  optical density due strictly to LH1 was investigated by comparing the growth of wild type and LH2-knockout  (dbcOmega) cultures.  It is evident that by day three the proportion of Optical Density accounted for by LH1  absorption converges to a value near 0.2. In other words, at the phase the layers of cells have grown in the model,  20% of total optical density can be attributed to LH1.  To account for this, the absorption in the mutant was  divided by the factor (1-0.2) = 0.8.  Then, the total optical density of the mutant cultures reflects total  absorption by both LH1 and LH2.
Relative growth of DBComega to WT in Flask 2 at OD600
- The model was revised upon gathering optical density data from the five layers of the bioreactor setup. (See  Results Figure 2a.) In the wild type, the optical density of the first flask of cells was much lower than  predicted, a phenomenon that was attributed to photodamage of the cells due to exposure to a large quantity of  light past the saturation point of the LH2 complexes.  In the optical density data for the flasks, both the  dbcOmega knockout and the wild type logistically grew to an absorbance value of 1. This gave reason to put a hard  limit of 1 on the first flask's potential optical density.  Any light left over from this cutoff was transmitted to  the next layer, as evidenced by in the increased growth of the second wild type flask in the Optical Density data. - The response curve for the coefficient of saturation for the mutant"

As a student at DTU you get to do plenty of project work, however it is mostly carried out individually or in a small group, with very specific goals and a high degree of supervision. iGEM offers the opportunity to work on a much larger project with a high degree of autonomy, where everything from the overall goals and strategy to design of experiments is left for the students to manage. This provides a great opportunity to experience the challenges of actual research projects

Analysis of survey findings
To facilitate data analysis, choices of concerns provided in part 1 and part 2 of our survey was grouped into the following categories:
1. Environmental damage (eg. release of toxic chemicals, disposal of parts, etc)
2. Impacts on human health (low frequency waves due to turbines)
3. Production constraints (limited power supply, weather dependent)
4. Cost to society (Ethical issues on land and crop usage)
Figure 1
Figure 1 shows a stacked bar chart comparing the total average points of importance that the general public of different age group gave when considering each category of concerns when choosing renewable energy. The brown toned stacks show grouped data of answers before  the video while the green toned stacks summarized data after our team’s introduction video.
In general, all 4 areas of concerns shows differences before and after the video with ‘health impacts’ and ‘production constraints’ showing an increase in importance under the public’s perception, while the ‘environmental damage’ and ‘social cost’ show a decrease in importance. Since the function of our video in between the parts are aimed to educate the viewers about different types of renewable energies, it suggests that these differences can be influenced by education outside classes, implying that there can be a significant shift in society's concerns and interests in certain renewable energy source when they are exposed to the new or updated information about renewable energy and, therefore, show that there is a need for public education in this area. However, there are also possibilities that these differences are purely due to the fact that there are views to the issues that the public did not originally consider.
Figure 2
Factors in Fig. 2 are grouped according to the following:
Environmental Damage
Environmental pollutants
Visual Impact
Pollution Caused by parts
Impacts on human health
Effects on human health
Product Constraints
Low Energy Production
Weather Dependent
Difficult energy storage
Thick solar panel
Requirement of wind power
Large area used by generator
Social Cost
Ethical issue on crop usage
Ethical issue on land usage
Maintenance cost
When expanding the different limitations each renewable energy poses, Fig.2 shows that impacts on human health are still considered the most important when choosing renewable energy. Impacts on human health that renewable energy might potentially cause are the low-frequency waves caused by the wind turbines in wind farms or the toxic and carcinogenic chemicals released during the manufacturing processes. This shows that impacts on human health should be our top priority when modifying our MFC.
Production constraints are the second most important category after"

Sydney_Australia,2017,Team:Sydney Australia#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"ulin as it is a reliable, unpatented, and well characterised therapeutic. Proinsulin itself is inactive, and to become active it requires additional processing to form insulin. This processing is performed by the protease trypsin, which cleaves the C chain from proinsulin. After trypsin activity, the A and B chains are left over to form active insulin. Proinsulin processing is demonstrated in Figure 1. with the cleavage of the C chain.
Figure 1. Cleavage of proinsulin results in active insulin
Due to the additional processing steps required to produce purified active insulin from proinsulin, increasing the cost of insulin synthesis, we looked for way to diminish this cost by reducing the steps required to obtain active insulin.
Winsulin
Our team decided to design a single-chain insulin, as single-chain insulins have been demonstrated to have higher stability and activity than human proinsulin. Stability in particular was important to our design due to the need to synthesise an insulin that could be transported over long distances without requiring cold temperatures. Crucially, single-chain insulins do not need to be cleaved to be active, requiring less processing than proinsulin.
Figure 2. Sequence comparison of proinsulin, active insulin and Winsulin.
We based the linker peptide of Winsulin (shown above) on sequences and principles tested in Rajpal et al., 2009. This paper found that peptides with a length of 5 to 12 amino acids had the highest receptor binding activity. Importantly, the composition of the sequence is identified as integral in determining whether the single chain construct has activity.
With the above considerations in mind, we designed the linker peptide sequence for Winsulin with the following characteristics:
A further consideration was in ensuring that this single chain construct woudl not infringe any potential patents . With this in mind - we designed our construct to also have 12 amino acids.
Additionally, the C-terminal residue of proinsulin is an asparagine. In Winsulin we substituted this for a glycine to increase the pI of Winsulin to approximately 7.8. This pI is somewhat high, but it leads to the aggregation of Winsulin monomers to form hexamers. This substitution is present in many long-acting insulins currently on the market. Yet, interestingly, our modelling indicates our Winsulin is still a rapid-acting insulin, and dissociates from hexamers more readily than human insulin.
Our Constructs
We designed our expression constructs in order to test winsulin and proinsulin with multiple expression systems."

UC_Chile,2013,Team:UC Chile#Formation_-_-_TEXT.html," we could test the other degradation tags, by modifying induction rates of our constructs.
Thus, when the RuBisCO large subunit joined with the GFP (RubL+ GFP) construct is induced, we can observe the protein in the bacterial cytoplasm. If the same construct is also induced with the Carboxysome formation plasmid, we would observe GFP colocalized with the BMC and nothing in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, if we use the RubL + GFP + ssrA construct, we should not observe GFP in the bacteria's cytoplasm if the protease system is working correctly. Finally, if we induce the Carboxysome formation plasmid, again we should see GFP colocalized with the BMC, therefore this GFP would be protected by the Carboxysome from protease activity.
Diagram of the mecanism of action of the ssrA tag
Right now, we continuing working on the genetic construct of RubL + GFP + ssrA tag. We are working hard to achieve the correct construct for further experiments in order to corroborate the hypothesis about the ssrA tags. For obtaining results, once it's ready the construct, we need to transform E. coli to be induced and see if the tag for the protease is working. In case of a positive result, we will transform E. coli with the construct with ssrA in addition of Carboxysome construct. This is needed, to prove if this particular BMC is capable of protecting GFP from the protease as Pdu did it.
Further Work
One of the limiting steps in the formation of Carboxysome corresponds to the stoichiometry of the constituent proteins. To see if the stoichiometry is correct, you can make a protein extraction and run a gel to analyze the correct expression of the 10 proteins involved in the assembly. This way we can  check that the fusion protein is not interfering with this balance.
Another thing we were planning on doing is to knockout the different subunits of RuBisCO  to see if can obtain a correct formation of the microcompartment but with more available space inside for the metabolic reactions to occur.

Plants as Plants: natural factories producing fuel, plastic, flavoring, and more
Welcome, to the Penn State iGEM wiki page! This year our team took on the challenge of working with plants.  Through several projects we hope to help characterize key plant parts and demonstrate the ability of plants to be used as natural factories.  Below you will find a short description of the our projects, for more information please refer to the ""Projects"" page linked on the left of the screen.
Promoter Project
As plants are still novel organisms for most of synthetic biology, we we are interested in developing methods of control for our projects. Currently the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter is the most widely used plant promoter. In hopes of increasing the availability of plant promoters, our project aims at testing viral promoters due to their relative efficiency, as well as cytoskeletal protein promoters due to their natural abundance.  Testing these promoters in parallel with the CaMV 35S will create a plant promoter catalog which can be used for future iGEMers exploration of plant synthetic biology.
Cas9 Project
A CRISPR/cas9 system is a large protein guided by a self-guiding RNA, which is capable of targeting specific DNA sequences. Cas9 has been characterized previously in bacteria and mammalian cells.  Often targeted to a promoter region, Cas9 acts as highly effective gene repressing tool.  The goal of the cas9 project is to make this regulatory tool available to plant genetic engineering.
Cellulose Synthase (Cesa) Project
Cellulose is the most abundant polysaccharide on Earth and is incredibly valuable for multiple uses including paper, cellophane, and biofuel. Although cellulose in everywhere, we are still limited by the amount of production by the plants and constantly use more. The goal of our experiment is to introduce a secondary cell wall cellulose synthase complex into the primary cell wall to ultimately increase the production of cellulose in plants. Our hope is that if we use a primary cell wall promoter followed by secondary CesA’s (Cellulose Synthases) in Arabidopsis thaliana, we can produce more cellulose and create stronger plants.
Butanol Project
The butanol project’s goal is to synthetically produce the enzymes that make up the University of California’s cyanobacteria pathway to produce n-butanol within physcomitrella. Thereby making a plant directly produce"

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," 30% in stage 4. [25] Early diagnosis allows curative treatment via radical prostatectomy or radiation, whereas metastatic cancer is incurable. [24]
There is currently no screening program for prostate cancer as a reliable enough test does not exist. [26] Some trials report no benefit for prostate cancer screening using a protein biomarker PSA. [27] However, there are factors to explain this; the Sandblom et al. study used a small patient cohort, there were improvements in treatment that occurred during the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial and a different cutoff value was used in these trials to the value used in the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer where benefits were seen. Despite the large European study showing increased survival rates, overdiagnosis and false positives remained problematic. [28] Furthermore, PSA has low specificity for prostate cancer as elevated levels can be caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis and diet alterations. [29] The 3-miRNA method could prevent unnecessary biopsies and aid the detection of early stage, aggressive prostate cancer. [24] The same study also identified a separate urine based 3-miRNA model that could determine the likelihood of prostate cancer recurrence after surgery, which could help inform a therapeutic decision.
Other cancers with miRNA biomarkers include: oral cancer (saliva) [30] , while bladder cancer (urine) [31] and cervical cancer (serum). [32] The possibilities continue to grow as research continues.
MiRNAs have also shown to be potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of other diseases. For instance they have been shown to be indicative of drug induced liver injury (DILI). It is serious clinical problem as liver failure  can present suddenly, without prior symptoms. More sensitive and reliable blood-based biomarkers are needed for rapid detection (i.e. before liver failure). [33] Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is the most common cause of DILI. [34] There is a highly effective antidote, but there can be difficulties in achieving the diagnosis that warrants it. For instance those who have DILI despite having taken the recommended dose of paracetamol would not normally be considered for the antidote. Prescribing the antidote in more potential cases of DILI results in significant costs and unnecessary unpleasant side-effects. Effective biomarkers are needed to assess whether treatment is required. [35] MiRNAs miR-122 and 192 were shown to be a more sensitive measure of DILI than levels"

Today we set up another restriction disest of the KinA pMKRQ synthesised brick using NheI and EcoRI we ran this on an 0.8% gel however we think that this may be too dilute and that I why we are not seeing the two bands ogf the digest which are a similar size.
We also set up another PCR of the ara fragment  as a back up plan for ligation, in case the last ligation did not work as well as we had planned.
We also mini prepped and digested the sac transformations again, and we found that of the 6 samples we had, a few of them had worked!
Just to confirm however we set up 12 more miniprep cultures again for both sac and ara.
Yesterday we did midipreps of Goksels successful sspb plasmid: this was cut with XbaI and PstI ready for ligation into the ara brick (once it's ligated!).
Metal Sensor Team
Introduction
Yesterday's lab session saw the Metal Sensing team ligate the cadA promoter region with the linearised BBa_J33206 BioBrick (BioBrick containing arsR gene and binding site but with promoter absent). The team also attempted to ligate cotC and linearised pMUTIN4. Both of these ligated products were used to transform DH5-alpha E. coli cells.
Today's work will involve the team looking for transformant colonies on the plates and processing them based on observations"
ULB-Brussels,2009,Team:ULB-Brussels#Project#Biological_-_-_TEXT.html," is a hybrid promoter proposed by last yearís KULeuven team and works as follows : it is repressed by c2 P22, (from phage 22), and activated by the complex LuxRHSL.
If there is neither c2 P22 nor LuxR-HSL, then there will be a low background expression of the downstream genes. The activation by LuxR-HSL permits this device to be fully activated. The repression by c2 P22 is provided by the expression c2 P22 which is under control of the cI434 promoter.
This promoter is constitutive. So, as long as there will be no IPTG, c2 P22 will be produced and there will be no quorum sensing and no glue. As soon as IPTG is present, cI434 is produced in order to repress cI434 promoter, c2 P22 will not be expressed anymore and the quorum sensing can take place. Once LuxR and HSL dimerize, they can also fully activate the production of Caulobacter crescentus 's enzymes needed for the glue synthesis. We also added a lux box in front of the cI434 device to ensure that c2 P22 is well repressed when the glue needs to be produced.
Now that the glue is produced, as we are not sure it will kill our bacteria and with the intention of not letting the bacteria proliferate, we intended to introduce a toxin that would inhibit cell growth without really killing the bacteria. We thought about parE which target is E. coli gyrase (1) .  By lack of time, we could not test our circuit. Here under, we describe how we thought to implement it into E. coli.
We would use four different plasmids. The first plasmid would be the cI434/c2 P22 generator depending on the presence or absence of IPTG. The second one would be the LuxR generator, following by the LuxI generator plasmid. The last one would be responsible for the glue synthesis and the ""death"" of the bacteria.
The first plasmid includes a lac promoter, which is a strong promoter (BBa R0011) induced by IPTG and repressed by LacI. The lac promoter controls the expression of the repressor cI434 from the cI434 generator (BBa P0152) consisting of a RBS, the repressor itself and a terminator. As said above we also added a Lux box promoter (BBa R0062).
The second plasmid contains a very strong promoter controlled by the CI434"

To a certain extend, these questions should make the reader aware that they are working with living systems with a certain worth but and make them think about how research may effect the value or perception of life. The ultimate way of applying the reductionist approach could well explain life, consequently have certain implications. Whether this point will ever be reached is doubtful. What is the scientific opinion?
Graph 11.
11. ""Assume that research will show that life is only based on the interactions of atoms (biochemical reactions) with specific properties. Consequently, research shows that life is fully reducible and independent of special, holy, sacred or magical properties."" Would you believe this information?
Yes, and I would not have a problem with it
Yes, but I would like to believe there is more to life
No, I would not believe it, because there is more to life
No, because it would devaluate my perception of life
Other:
This question addresses the personal believes of the survey participants towards the properties of life. Science has meddled with traditional (religious) believes before, for instance when Copernicus proved in 1543 that the Earth is not the center of the universe. This information was not easily accepted. Life is frequently related with special, sacred or magical properties. The participants are asked to assume that research shows that life is based only on biochemical reactions (the interaction of atoms), a scenario that might never be true but some scientists are still searching for.
Although 67% would believe this information, 30% would still like to think that there is more to life.  This means that the hypothetical assumption displayed in the question if ever come true, would be accepted by the majority of the scientific community. Nevertheless, 15% would hold on to their traditional believe that there is more to life. Only 5% would not believe this information because it devalues their perception of life.
The other-answers:
The plurality of the other-voters states that science has already shown this hypothetical assumption to be true, and indicate not to have a problem with it.
Some have never thought about this before and have difficulties answering the question until the situation actually occurs.
There are references to semantics and emerging properties that will make life never fully understandable.
One finds it hard to indicate what people could consider 'special' or 'sacred', and suggests that being sacred and purely biochemical are not necessarily mutually exclusive qualities.
Most importantly, the results demonstrate that most participants will accept the information that life is fully reducible. Further research should"

Expression in a GRAS Organism
Our project focuses on how the GAF proteins can be used as a food colorant. However, in order to bring this protein into the human food system, we need protein expression to occur in a Generally Recognized as Safe, or GRAS organism. Since Escherichia coli has naturally occurring endotoxins, it is not given the GRAS designation. Bacillus subtilis on the other hand is considered GRAS and is widely used in the food industry. For these reasons we explored how we would bring this protein production into B. subtilis and while we did not have the opportunity to complete our experiments, we did establish a thorough experimental setup for the future.
Motivation
The primary motivation of experimentation with Escherichia coli was the scope of characterization available for this organism and its familiarity with the iGEM community. E. coli has a plethora of knowledge base around the organism with many available parts, protocols, and transformation success. E. coli consists of a diverse group of bacteria where most are harmless and are an important part of a normal-healthy intestinal tract (32). However, since E. coli has naturally occurring endotoxins, it is not suitable for human consumption. Bacillus subtilis on the other hand, is considered a GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) organism and is widely used in the food industry. This bacteria constitutes the main component of the soybean dish, Natto, and is widely used by established biotechnically companies like NovaZymes and DSM (18, 19). For these reason, in the future we would like to transfer the CBCR expression into B. subtilis.
Bacillus bacteria are among the most ubiquitous microorganisms present in nature and can be found in water, soil, and in air (as spores). The Bacillus genus consists of Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria. The genome of Bacillus sub"

Reagent share to USTC
iGEM team USTC is working on the CdS based bio-film. They want to know whether CdS nanoparticles can increase the cathode-current as expected. A key component for one of their experiments requires CdS quantum dots, which they cannot generate by themselves.
We provided them the CdS quantum dots sample. They added our sample into the culture to assist bio-film formation onto the surface of a graphite electrode. Theoretically, CdS quantum dots would be attached to the surface of the bacteria as the bio-film was formed.

Figure 7. The hardware that controls the exposing light during bio-film formation.
Then, we put the cathode running and monitored the current. As you can see in figure 8, the strain pMC, which were co-expressing Mtr CAB and Ccm A-H, had a stronger cathode current than the WT strain before the light was given, which perfectly repeated the result we have done in the conduction system section. After the current was stable, we began to give light to the system. The light’s wavelength is 455 nm and the source is a LED light bought from an online shop. The strain pMC with CdS quantum dots on it responded to the light stimulate. It had a stronger current than it was before the light was given. However, those strains without CdS quantum dots on it did NOT respond to light stimulate. Especially, for the pMC group without CdS quantum dots on it, it did NOT have any current change after we give light to the system, which excludes the possibility that the current change was resulted from the Mtr CAB proteins or the Ccm A-H"

Glasgow,2017,Team:Glasgow#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," stronger than J23117 [3] however when we compared them using GFP our relative strengths of expression, although they followed the same pattern, did not match what was previously seen. Additionally to this the pattern of relative strengths didn't match when looking at the promoters when the were paired with B0034 compared to when they were paired with J364100. The same can be said for the strengths of the RBS - with B0034 appearing the strongest in all cases but how much stronger it appears compared to J364100 depends on the promoter it is paired with. One possible explanation for the promoters relative strengths changing between the two different RBS and visa versa is that the promoters and RBS don’t work completely independently and that it is more the interactions between the two that is causing differences in the patterns of strengths.
When the fluorescence was normalised to OD the standard deviations at time point 0 were very high (due to dividing low fluorescence by a very low OD600) and so this indicates that this isn’t a good time point to take base fluorescent measurements on as the results seem to be so variable. Therefore, a time point closer to 4 hours should be used to increase reliability. The location of the sample within the plate can affect the growth rates as the temperature can vary between the outer wells and the centred wells. Ideally, the outermost wells should be left empty and the samples should be randomly placed in the innermost wells to reduce for errors due to this factor [4]
We also found that for the purpose of studies such as the InterLab where a wide range of data will be taken and collated it is important that all research groups use the same derivative of DH5α E. coli and that they ensure that all plasmids are strictly in monomer form as dimers behave unreliably. Full results and explanation for the different strain type and dimer plasmids can be seen on the Measurement page.
iGEM Glasgow 2017 were proud to take part in the 2017 InterLab study and look forward to seeing how the data will look when it is collated from all teams and how this study will impact the scientific world.

pSB1C3 transformation into Enterobacter ludwigii FCP2-01
Our team used the plasmid backbone pSB1C3 in the organism Enterobacter ludwigiiFCP2-01 ( BBa_K2633006 ), and provided the first evidence that an Enterobacter species can be transformed stably with this organism. The clade which our chassis comes from is important medically, agriculturally, and ecologically (Hoffmann and Roggenkamp 2003), and this provides potential to apply this part and many parts in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts to organisms in this group.
Our improvement upon pSB1C3 is by the composite part BBa_K2633000 . A restriction illegal version of this part was used to transform Enterobacter ludwigii FCP2-01, as seen in Figure 1 . The transformed strain was then used to inoculate Brachypodium distachyon by soaking seeds in bacterial culture, and the plant were grown for 5 weeks with images taken at 1 week intervals. Example of FCP2-01 expressing acdS-GFP are seen in Figure 2 .
Figure 1 .  A) FCP2-01 transformed with GFP (left) vs wild-type (right) under blue light with orange filter. B) Transformed colonies on an agar plate.

Results
We drove this survey from July to September 26th.
All data: HumanPractice.xls
Our result is too much to write all on this page. So we write only graphs on this page and upload all result data. We analyzed mainly following points.
compare between arts and sciences(*) in college student
compare between ""genetic engineering"" and ""biotechnology""
compare between people with different jobs
compare between college student and the others
(*)In Japan, classification of arts and sciences is important. Most Japanese students study different subjects since high school due to the classification, because it is a big factor to decide the subjects required in the entrance examination for universities or colleges. This is the reason we predicted that there might be some differences between arts and sciences.

Cytochrome P450 BM3 (BM3)
from Dr. Chul-Ho Yun of Chonnam National University, South Korea
Enzymatic Assembly Line Overview
Earlier this year, research at the Kee-Hong Kim lab of Purdue University had preliminary evidence showing that a trans-stilbene compound, Piceatannol, had an ability to inhibit the development of human adipose cells. The mechanism is based around the idea that Piceatannol interacts with a preadipocyte's (immature fat cell) insulin receptors in such a way that surpresses it's growth into a mature adipose cell. Piceatannol is a metabolite of resveratrol, a compoud currently under investigation for possible anti-cancer properites. Piceatannol differs from resveratrol by one hydroxyl group on one of the aromatic rings.
Piceatannol is currently very costly to synthesize. On the advent of such a discovery, we felt that if we were to engineer a pathway to optimize the production of Piceatannol from cheaper substrates through the utilization of our PUF and RNA scaffold projects, we could show the versatility of our PUF toolkit working with an RNA scaffold.
However, before researchers can begin using our PUF toolkit to produce piceatannol in vivo, we took steps to acquire and characterize the necessary genes for our:

from the 2008 Rice University iGEM team
Cytochrome P450 BM3 (BM3)
from Dr. Chul-Ho Yun of Chonnam National University, South Korea
Design and Theory
The above is our theoretical construct involving the four aforementioned genes. As labeled, the sequence of enzymatic activity begins at TAL, which converts the naturally present amino acid in E. coli, tyrosine, into p-coumaric acid. P-coumaric acid along with malonyl-CoenzymeA are converted into resveratrol by the 4CL:STS fusion protein. Lastly, resveratrol is metabolized into piceatannol by BM3. A substrate could be hypothetically processed by these sequential proteins, resulting in a molecular, in vivo assembly line in E. coli. Such an assembly"

I am in my fourth year of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology PhD program in the Southern Alberta Cancer Biology Research Group at the University of Calgary. The focus of my studies is the cellular response to obstructed DNA replication, and how disturbances to this process contribute to genome instability using the budding yeast model system. This is the second year that I have worked with iGEM and it is has been a great experience for me.  I really enjoy the team approach of taking composite parts to build systems that can perform unique biological functions.  I love the social aspect of being on the team and I especially look forward to attending the Jamborees.

2012.9
Week 1: The majority of Human Practice was started including iGEM dictionary information collection and application making, game design and iGEM Association recruitment. We also cooperated with the radio station of Fudan University to have a brief introduction for synthetic biology and iGEM. At the same time, The part construction continued.
Week 2: Wiki design, poster design and their material preparation were begun.
Week 4: Wiki was completed and we begin to prepare for the presentation and poster session in Asian Jamboree.
2012.8
Week 1: Synthetized the ribozyme and substrate sequence. Then the experiment group started to link the two parts with an interval sequence (about 600bp). The paper-reading group started to look for the design information of yeast intron.
Week 2: We extracted the yeast genome DNA successfully and continued the ligation of the ribozyme-related sequence.
Week 3: Finished the synthesis of 150bp highly repetitive TG-sequence and began to construct the 450bp, 600bp telomere sequence. The intron design was completed.
Week 4: During the week, we amplified the GAL4 homologous arm and TRP1 gene by PCR and got the yeast ADH1 promoter and EYFP (yeast codon-optimized) from iGEM kit. Then this part of construction was begun. The overlong telomere was completed (450bp and 600bp).
2012.6-2012.7: experiment preparation
During the month, we started to prepare our experiments including vectors and parts we may use. Meanwhile, we tried to master some special techniques needed like telomere PCR. The detailed sequence design of ribozyme and its target substrate is also determined by the paper-reading group.
2012.4-2012.5: Brainstorm

Supply Chain
Overview
Zespri have a supply chain which we could potentially model our production on. Zespri supplies the seeds to their growers which grow the product which then goes from the farmers back to the company for processing. The product then moves onto the supplier, mainly supermarkets. Because our seeds must be manufactured, it is likely we would go through a company with the infrastructure to do so. There are four dominant biotech companies we may considering a partnership with; Monsanto, Bayer, Dupont and Syngenta. The Jamboree in Boston would be an enormous opportunity for networking with some of these companies. Many large companies scope out ideas worth investing in through this competition. Establishing a relationship early would assist in the funding and development of this technology. This partnership could take a variety of forms. We could sell the rights of the seed to the producer, who would then sell the seed to growers through a company like Seminis, owned by Monsanto. We could also use a model similar to Zespri by partnering with a biotech companies to make our seed, then selling it to farmers ourselves. To make this decision, further market analysis is needed.
Genetically Modified Organisms have different definitions and standards for human consumption around the globe. This would likely impact the companies we could partner with and the growers we would target. While domestic views of GMOs are slowly changing, the New Zealand Government’s restrictions on growing GMOs would greatly impact the ability to plant GMO crops in New Zealand soil. While GMO crops can be sold in New Zealand, they must be approved by the food safety authority and must comply with labelling laws. In comparison, the USA is far more lenient with GMO cultivation. For example, over 90% of the current corn crop is GMO. There are no independent restrictions on GMOs,  instead the products are regulated with the same standards as conventionally grown crops. The differing perspectives of governments and peoples to the growth of GMO crops will greatly impact the locations where frost intolerant produce could be grown. Further market analysis is required here to assess the extent to which this may limit the growth potential of this project.

Toggle Switch
Toggle Switch
The toggle switch is composed of two repressors and two promoters, each of which is inhibited by the repressor transcribed by the other promoter. We choose pLacI and pTetR as the two promoters, and the repressors are TetR and LacI, respectively. Theoretically, if ratio of LacI to TetR is greater than 1, strong binding of LacI to pLacI repress transcription initiation from pLacI and therefore quantities of TetR will decrease, which in turn relieves its repression to pTet leading to increase of quantities of LacI itself. In this situation, concentration of LacI is far greater than that of tetR, whose expression is repressed at an extream low level and the system enters into its 'LacI' state. Similar analysis will do for TetR and the system will enter into 'TetR' state if its quantity dominates.

BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Collaborations#Blog1_-_-_TEXT.html," right, we definitely copied those definitions from the internet, but this post hopefully adds value to your internet-definition-reading-experience by providing a more in depth explanation of how all this stuff pertains to synthetic biology.
Essentially, a copyright proclaims a written or recorded piece of work (e.g. a scientific paper describing a researcher’s work) as the exclusive property of whoever wrote it.  In essence, you sign your name on the line next to “Author” and BAM, no one can take credit for or use your work in any way you don’t want them to. But here’s the catch: copyright only applies to expressive (creative), nonfunctional (has no functional purpose) work.  This generates problems when researchers wish to copyright DNA sequences or tools they have discovered as opposed to a scientific article.  Furthermore, the U.S. Copyright Statute does not discuss the products of synthetic biology as copyrightable material, meaning that a district court can only copyright synthetic biology products by comparing them to material mentioned in the statute, such as software. In essence, products of synthetic biology are extremely difficult to copyright because they are not explicitly mentioned in existing copyright legislation.
If copyrighting products of synthetic biology wasn’t difficult enough, protecting copyrighted work presents its own problems. To legally have the power to say “don’t use that” to a person infringing on your work, you must file your copyright with the U.S. Copyright Office as proof of your ownership of that work. Otherwise, if someone was using your copyrighted work, you could not sue for infringement. Fortunately, if you decide your synthetic biology product (in this case a scholarly article would work best) is suitable for copyright, registering your work with the U.S. Copyright Office is quite easy; there’s even a three-step WikiHow.  Clearly, copyright works best for the written products of synthetic biology, but not DNA parts.  For protection of genetic parts, cloning processes and other tools, synthetic biology relies on the second of our two definitions, the patent.
In essence, a patent works in a similar way to a copyright, but patents protect functional innovations rather than expressive written, visual or auditory works and are always licensed by the government. To apply for a utility patent, an innovator must prove that his/her innovation is functional and novel, as well as provide a detailed description of all aspects of the invention, instructions for how to make it, an informal drawing, an oath that they are the original inventor, and processing fees.  Right now, you may be wondering “why is the word ‘novel’ bolded?” to which the answer is"

Do you think that our project is feasible?
Your project is definitely feasible because it comes as an answer to the many questions that farming communities had in this ongoing climate change.
What do you see as the biggest obstacles to farmers potentially using our GMO?
The biggest obstacles that farmers will be faced with regarding the use of GMOs will only be how to prevent the negative impact on the environment that come with the benefits.
Lawyers
Dr. Jennifer Carter-Johnson, MSU Assistant Professor of Law
The laws and regulations surrounding GMOs are complicated and complex, but we hoped to better understand them. We took advantage of the law school at MSU, and spoke with an assistant professor. Along with her law degree, Jennifer Carter-Johnson has a PhD in microbiology, which gives her the ideal background for discussing GMO regulations and patents. Team members Jessica and Jordan meet with Dr. Carter-Johnson in person twice to discuss the government regulations and patent laws pertaining to our GM bacteria.
What is the legislation regarding GMOs (federal and state)?
Federal regulation provides a common framework as a group of laws. These regulate the marketing of GMO crops and cover international aspects such as importing and exporting. Everyone must comply with these, as they trump state regulations. State regulations are ad hoc, often covering issues such as when you can spray GM products. There are also new laws on labelling; all GMO food products will have to be labeled as such. This was passed in 2016 but is not in effect of now. THe EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) oversees crops with pesticides, such as BT corn, but your project would not fall under this. The USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) regulates crops based on plant pest; your project would have USDA implications. The FDA (Food and Drug Agency) has voluntary submissions.
How do GMO laws and regulations differ worldwide?
In the US, common thought is that GMOs are all the same; most are thought safe unless found not to be. We have the least strict laws and regulations, and the FDA has voluntary reporting standards. The European Union (EU) takes the precautionary principle. Most of the EU wants to be shown safety of the products first. They take GMOs more strictly.
Would farmers and companies that use our GM bacteria have difficulty selling their crops due to regulations/legislation?
There may be marketing issues, but labelling laws are not in effect yet.

OUC-China,2014,Team:OUC-China#Project Future_-_-_TEXT.html,"al DNA vaccine
WHAT’S DNA VACCINE?
DNA vaccine is also called the nucleic acid vaccine or gene vaccine.It's an eukaryotic expression plasmid DNA(sometimes RNA) which codes immunogen or associated with immunogen. It can enter the animal’s cells through a certain way. After transfecting into the host cell, it will be translated and will express the antigen protein which can stimulate the body to produce two kinds of immune response including nonspecific immune and specific immune response. There by the immune protection takes place. The vaccine has both the advantage of attenuated vaccine and no risk of the opposite at the same time. Because of this the vaccine has got people's attention recently and it is seen as the third generation of vaccine following the traditional vaccine and genetically engineered subunit vaccine.
THE ADVANTAGE OF DNA VACCINES
Plasmid is very stable, easy to be stored and transported, easy to be prepared and used, easy for mass production by a low cost. Gene vaccine preparation is relatively safe and much easier compared with other vaccines, which are toxic and difficult to extract antigen. Plasmid DNA in the host can exist for a long time, antigen expression of genes in the body to produce antigen protein, constantly stimulate the body's immune system to produce long-term immunitye, and the immune effects are reliable. Gene vaccine can not only produce the humoral immune response, but can also lead to cytotoxic T lymphocyte activation and induce cellular immunity. But traditional vaccines only induce cellular immunity by live planting , and it has the danger of the vaccine's virulence picks upPreparation with core protein conservative DNA sequence of gene vaccine against pathogens (bacteria or viruses) of each variant subtypes can produce an immune response, so it can avoid the immune escape caused by pathogens variation.
A plasmid vector can be multiple antigen gene cloning of multivalent seedlings, thus many diseases can be prevented by only one kind of gene vaccine.
Plasmid DNA has no immunogenicity, which is different with recombinant vaccines that can  induce immune response to the carrier, no anti DNA antibody has been reported at least.
THE APPLICATION OF DNA VACCINES.
DNA vaccine application field is very wide, it has been used in at least ten kinds of infectious disease prevention experiments, including viruses, bacteria and parasite adapting just-in-time inventory of various type of microorganisms. Some DNA vaccine are also being used on the part of the treatment of infectious diseases. In addition, it can also be used in the prevention or treatment of certain cancers.

kill switch
In the applications of synthetic biology, people always hold the question of safety of genetic engineered organism. There exists the potential risk of gene horizontal transfer and other issues for organism which worked outside our lab. So, we need to take some measure to guarantee the safety of our bacterial material. Even for technicians who work within lab, it would be convenient for them to terminate organism’s life when they want.
In our project which has designed bacteria to work in gut, a kill switch to control the life of genetic engineered bacteria should be taken into consideration.
Here are many reasons for the necessity to design corresponding kill switch in our project. Firstly, in the complex environment such as gut, where exists many different species, horizontal gene transfer is much more likely to happen. It would be a disaster if we do not take related measures. Secondly, one therapy should be terminated as we hope. Our special therapy use biological material, so it is necessary to design a kind of killer switch, putting the whole therapy under control.
So we decide to use two kind of killer gene, killer red and phi 174 gene E, to terminate genetic engineered bacteria’s life under different condition.
Killer red
Killer red is a kind of protein that could produce ROS (Reactive oxygen species) from water, which could terminate their lifespan, under the illumination of 585 nm light. This protein would not work without the illumination of specific light, so, when in gut, they will not affect our bacteria without our induction. When out bacteria outside, it would die soon exposed to sunshine.
Killer red has a kind of barrel protein domain and owns QYG chromophore which could emit red fluorescent under the illumination of green light (585 nm), producing ROS from water to kill cell.
We have successfully induce the expression of this protein and test it’s efficiency under 585 nm illumination. This picture below showed the expression of"

On June 3 and 4, we hosted the Wellesley team for a two day workshop.  On June 3, the BU team reviewed some fundamental biology and synthetic biology concepts and held a Eugene tutorial.  We went over some famous genetic circuits and wrote Eugene scripts for them.  On June 4, both the Wellesley and BU teams presented their iGEM projects to each other and provided constructive feedback.  The BU team also held a wet lab tour.
On June 14, we traveled to Wellesley's campus to continue discussing our projects.  The BU team broke up into three small groups and met with each Wellesley project team who described their project and tested out some of their initial software.  Later, we held an open discussion where each Wellesley project group discussed the feedback and suggestions they received from earlier in the day.
Throughout the summer, we have kept in contact with Wellesley to discuss Eugene and Eugenie.  We provided feedback on their existing designs and explained how Eugene is intended to be used and how a visual representation would aid someone who does not understand the Eugene scripting code.  We also provided sample Eugene code for some of our experiments so the Wellesley team could have Eugene code to test their prototypes with.  Members of the Wellesley team came to some of our weekly Eugene meetings with the Eugene team.  They also came to BU to present their paper prototypes of Eugenie and get feedback from the Eugene team and the BU iGEM team.  Furthermore, the BU iGEM team took part in user studies for Eugenie.
Purdue Biomakers
We are also working closely with the Purdue Biomakers team this year to work on a standardized data sheet.

Since the research strategy of systems biology is well fit to analyze the biological complex systems. I am applying this strategy on the mechanism of the complex diseases such as cancer and diabetes. My ongoing project is to identify biomarkers in order to detect the progress stages of the diabetes. As a metabolic disease, diabetes-related proteins tend to enter the circulation system, thus the biomarker discovery in plasma has the potential to play an important role in the early detection and treatment of diabetes. We have developed systematic approaches based on proteomics and bioinformatics to analyze human normal and diabetic serum"

About me
I enjoy life when I’m in the wild nature the mountains, on or below big waves. I am fascinated by unbelievable organisms, plants and animals and by the balance and complexity of nature and what we can learn from it. I find gratification by experiencing cultural diversity and new perspectives on life; through people I meet their story, traditions, music and food. I am trying to merge all this into my study to become a biological engineer. I have specialized in biorefinery and bioreactor design, and I’m going to work on Risø-DTU developing a sustainable biorefinery platform, for the future sustainable agricultural and industrial production by microorganism. I am a professional rescue diver, surf lifeguard and climbing instructor. I am fluent in English, French Spanish and Danish.

About me
I am 100% Danish and I grew up north of Copenhagen. I study biotechnology at DTU, and at the moment I’m doing my master degree. I went to highschool in a town called Nyborg where I completed the international IB programme. I have lived in Spain several times, both with my family and alone, and I therefore speak fluent Spanish. I love the Spanish culture, especially the food and the night life. In my free time I like being with my friends, run, bike and play music. I also like to travel and experience the world which is why I spent a semester of my master degree in the US. Professionally, my interests are stem cells, immunology, cell biology and synthetic biology.
