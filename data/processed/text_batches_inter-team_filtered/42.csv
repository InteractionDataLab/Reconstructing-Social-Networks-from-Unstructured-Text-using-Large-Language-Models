USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#Simulation_-_-_TEXT.html,"correlated chains. In other words, some chains that are not connected with others via tree nodes should not be incorporated into other species. The final standalone split species are real products in the system.
We provide an example to illustrate the product-generating procedure. The reactant has two chains, A-B-C and D-E-F. A, B, C bind with D, E, F, respectively. The products are A and C. First we mix chains and trees. Chain A-B-C will not appear in the mixture. Since node B does not appear in mixed chains, tree with nodes B and E will be removed in the trim process. Because part C and F, A and D, are both bound to nodes, the final product should contain A and B both after split processing.
In the example above, there is only one product finally though two product templates are defined in database. What compartment does the product locate in if the two product templates locate in different compartments? A reasonable solution is to halve the quantities of the product and add it into both compartments. Another problem is that the corresponding reverse reaction would never be found because it fails to match two templates to only one species. The source of the two problems is essentially the same: how to describe intra-molecular reactions in framework of MoDeL language definitions. At present, it is not supported. However, supporting intra-molecular reactions is one of our future plans to refine our MoDeL language.

Results are displayed in the figures:  Abbreviations: 2_3F - UnaG under a strong constitutive promoter BBa_K880005  + bilirubin 1_5M - GFP under a medium constitutive promoter BBa_K608011 (control) RFP - pSB1C3 standard backbone with red fluorescent protein insert (control)  PBS - phosphate-buffered saline solution with lysozyme (control) bilirubin - 1mM bilirubin solution in DMSO (control)
Large-scale Expression of UnaG
After observing the small-scale expression results, plans for large-scale purification were designed. Escherichia coli (E.coli) BL21DE3 cells were used in conjunction with T7 promoter-driven UnaG in TB medium to achieve peak levels of expression. T7 expression is induced using IPTG at 18°C for 16 hours. Breaking open the cells was performed using Qsonica Q700 titanium-tip sonicator since lysozyme has nearly the same size as UnaG and would make purification more difficult, as well as just slower and less efficient compared to sonication. It also breaks DNA, reducing overall lysate viscosity. After centrifugation at 4°C and 10 000 g for 1 hour, the supernatant was filtered through 0.2 µM pore filter and loaded to a Ni2+ affinity column, also called IMAC.
IMAC procedure
Figure 3. Setup for IMAC procedure.
First the column had to be packed using Nickel Sepharose Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare). The calculated column volume for this setup was 5 ml. Afterwards the column had to be charged with Ni2+ this is done with a ion binding buffer (50 mM Na+CH3COO-, 300 mM NaCl, pH4). The column was equilibrated by pumping through 5 column volumes (CV) with a flowrate of 0.7ml/min. After the column is equilibrated with ion binding buffer, the buffer it switched out with 0.3 M NiSO4 and a new equilibration step is made with 5 CV’s of ion solution. The final equilibration is done with 5CV ion binding buffer to wash away all of the excess Ni+2 ions. Three other buffers were prepared, having a base composition of 50 mM Na+CH3COO- and 300 mM NaCl. The binding buffer for UnaG contains 10 mM imidazole,"

Construction in eukaryotic cells
Life process in eukaryotic cells is much more complicate, especially when it is related to signal transportation. We choose microRNA to transport cues and Bxb1 to realize the flipping process. Using microRNA can not only simplify the design of the system, making sure the transportation is precise and efficient, but also ensure the independency with other life processes due to the orthogonality of the microRNA and other signals. MicroRNA also has great scalability. Compared to Cre-loxP recombination system, Bxb1 recombination system requires different enzymes to flip back and forth, which makes the whole system more controllable. As shown in the picture, Bxb1 sites and microRNAs are located in the intron of the reporter. If the sequence has flipped, the two exons of Cyan are segregate from each other, and Cyan would not translate correctly. So we can detect whether the sequence has flipped from the expression of Cyan. From the circuit, we can get such truth table and corresponding logical relationship.

SUSTC-Shenzhen,2014,Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"HIV is the trigger of the lethal disease AIDS. It replicates in and kills T cells, weakens human immune system and allows life-threatening opportunistic infection and cancer to thrive. HIV infects vital cells in the human immune system such as helper T cells (especially CD4+ T cells), macrophages, and dendritic cells. As a retrovirus, HIV reverse transcribes its genome and integrated it into the host cell genome after infection. Figure 1 illustrates the schematic structure of HIV virus (Source: Wikipedia).
Figure 1. Schematic demonstration of HIV
Traditional therapies such as drug treatment can control the development of the disease but not eradicate the virus. The chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction caused by long-term chemotherapy and radiotherapy may also lead to non-AIDS morbidity and mortality (Kiem, Jerome, Deeks, & McCune, 2012). The process of reverse transcription is extremely error-prone, and the resulting mutations may lead to drug resistance or allow the virus to evade the body's immune system.
CRISPR/Cas system
CRISPR/Cas (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated system) is originally a self-protecting mechanism in bacteria against external DNA such as virus genome or plasmids. It uses CAS complex to cut the external viral or plasmid DNA and integrating a short DNA segment into the CRISPR loci in the bacteria genome. This short DNA segment will be transcribed into pre-crRNA and bind to another CAS endonuclease called Cas9 with the help of tracrRNA. The Cas9 endonuclease cuts the external DNA in the existence of not only crRNA but also a special recognizing sequence at the 3’ end of the target DNA called PAM (Protospacer Adjacent Motif). When the same external DNA invades next time, the Cas9-tracrRNA-crRNA complex will recognize and cut it in order to destroy its biological activity.  Figure 2 illustrates the mechanism of Type II CRISPR/Cas system in bacteria (Mali, Esvelt, & Church, 2013). The laboratories of Dr. George Church (Mali, Yang, et al., 2013) and Dr. Feng Zhang (Cong et al., 2013) have successfully developed the Type II CRISPR-Cas system for human cells, which lay the foundation for this project.

Background
Area under genetically modified crops in different countries
Worldwide, the use of GMP is very common: 29 countries, 19 of which emerging or developing countries, use mostly genetically modified maize, soy, cotton and sugarcane. With research on other plants, the worldwide use of GMPs is assumed to grow within the next years.
In Europe, over 40 different GMPs are allowed to be used in food for both human and animal. Never the less, the cultivation of GMP is allowed for only two species: maize and starch rich potatoes. Most research was outsourced to other countries for two main reasons: the cost of outdoor experiments and the critical atmospheres towards GMPs: being established 15 years ago; green plant biotechnology is still considered a very modern and mysterious technology in the public opinion. As a paradox, the high demands on safety led to the fact that only a few companies can afford research in GMPs which leads to an undesired monopolization of the field of commercially used GMPs.
Agriculture in Swiss needs to become more efficient, sustainable and ecologically, preferably without an increase of cost, to meet futures demand for food and at the same time maintain a sound environment. GMPs can help to protect nature and environment that can be harmed through extensive agriculture by lowering the use of herbicide and prevent crop failure [2].
Research
The national research program on genetically modified plants focused on many interdisciplinary areas. The research evaluated the relationship between plant biotechnology and environment by looking closer at the impact of resistancies in economic plants, biodiversity and the transfer of genes from GMP to wild type plants. Another focus were political, social and economic aspects that included the role of the media for the formation of the public opinion. Another dealt with the evaluation and management of risks of GMP.
While 5 years are too short to conduct a long term study, the last part was to review published studies on medical issues of GMPs relevant for Switzerland, various aspects of coexistence of natural plants and GMP in crop production and a synthesis of studies on biological issues of GMPs.
Interestingly, throughout the whole project, focus lied also on the communication of the results to the Swiss"

Transcription factors in active form
Formulas described so far are dependent on the concentration of transcription factor in active form. But how can we calculate the amount of transcription factor in active form? Assuming that the transcription factor can be activated or inhibited by a inducer factor (that can be an exogenous input), we can use Hill equation again to calculate the concentration of bound and unbound transcription factor as a function of the inducer factor:
[I]: concentration of the inducer
[T]t: total concentration of the transcription factor
[T]u: concentration of unbound transcription factor
[T]b: concentration of bound transcription factor
K50: dissociation constant
n: Hill coefficient (n>0)
If active form is bound transcripion factor, we are interested in Tb, while if active form is unbound transcription factor, we are interested in Tu.
ODE for protein production
We have to modellize translation of mRNA molecules. We chose to describe it as a differential equation in which protein production and protein degradation are linear:
[P]: concentration of protein
[m]: concentration of mRNA molecule
alpha: translation rate

We considered Tetracycline, IPTG, Arabinose and GFP respectively as CH0, CH1, SEL and OUT signals for Mux, while we considered IPTG, Tetracycline, RFP and GFP respectively as IN, SEL, OUT0 and OUT1 signals for Demux. For all these signals, logic 1 corresponds to the presence of the molecule.
According to the equations described so far, every protein and mRNA is a state variable for the model. Mux and Demux models are described in the next paragraphs.
We considered full ODE models, in which transcription and translation processes are separated. In many contexts, anyway, we can write only one differential equation to describe a ""regulated protein production"", in which trascription process is hidden. In this section we preferred to be general and we considered the transcription dynamic because our aim is to provide a mathematical model for future parameter identification. We"

On Monday, I will be packaging the Enzyme Library into a tool.
Adam z liu 19:12, 7 August 2009 (UTC)
Doug, Bing, and I started porting over the old tools to Clotho II. I worked primarily on the Enzyme Library, making sure highlighting is still compatible with the Sequence View. We discussed how communication should work between tools, and decided that tools will generally call the getData and sendData methods in the core, passing a tool class and a keyword. Tools will all subscribe to a universal set of keywords and not implement their own custom enumeration. This way, the vocabulary will be more controlled and and data requests will be synchronized with database mappings. Keywords can be relied on for fetching universally relevant information, like sequence. For more tool-specific information, like whether the methylated check-box is checked in the Sequence View, tools will have to get the specific tool from the core and call custom getter methods. The necessity for this kind of communication will be limited mostly to the old tools that are highly interdependent. Tool writers in the future hopefully will not need to do this very much. The sendData method will be called to ask a tool to perform a function on the sent piece of data. Functions will vary from tool to tool and will be specified in each tool's operation enumeration.
I also wrote up a translator that converts Eugene to XML. There are still some details that need to be hammered out regarding the format of the XML, but generation basically works.
Next week, Doug and I are trying to meet with Sherine from the wet lab to demo Clotho II and to get interesting constructs for the Eugene paper.

Next Generation Focus
This year, Lambert iGEM continued our partnership with Grace Chapel Church's ""Next Generation Focus"" program (NGF). This program focuses on promoting the importance of education from the very beginning, no matter a child's socioeconomic status. In particular, iGEM focuses on providing engaging scientific enrichment activities for children traditionally underrepresented in the STEM fields. By exposing kids to interesting hands-on activities not offered in their classrooms, we hope to present science as more than a series of facts to memorize and to spark a lifelong love of science. We spent a few Saturdays per semester through the year at NGF, hosting their ""Science Days"" to instill the fundamentals such as cells, anatomy games, and even chromatography. Many of these young students would not have the additional enrichment and educational supplements without NGF, and the high achieving, passionate science lovers that volunteer and drive the program are role models for the kids who might not have academic mentors at home.

Plot of mean values. Not sure what to make of this. All strains clearly had similar growth. However no log phase is apparent. May have started with too high an OD or needed more time. Also, values above the linear range (.4) were taken as measured instead of diluting - thus the linear correlation of OD600 to microbe concentration breaks down at around 160 minutes. Also notable and unusual that the controls grew more slowly than the cells with added plasmids - this is true until 200 minutes even for control 3 which had a higher starting OD.

Characterization of activities of promoters
Parts J23100 through J23119 are a family of constitnutive promoters. The absolute promoter strength of J23100 has been measured by iGEM Warsaw 2010 Team (13,1pg RNA/minute/ug substrate DNA for J23100) and the relative promoter strength of other family members are given here . Our values of forwardPromoterEfficiency could be easily obtained by unit conversion. For example, it is 2.18E-7 /s for part J23100. All values of forwardPromoterEfficiency are listed below to character the activities of those promoters  where the second column is the relative promoter strength for promoter family members and the third column gives the absolute values.
promoter strength: the absolute values are measured as unit concentration of RNA/second/unit concentration of substrate DNA

SCUT-China,2014,Team:SCUT-China#Project#Synthetic TKL_-_-_TEXT.html,"S genes. These genes encode large   enzymes consisting of modules of domains, forming an ""assembly line""   to extend the ketide units to form polyketides. Among the known PKS   genes, the genes coding for erythromycin producing polyketide   synthethase have been extensively and deeply studied, and there are   numerous information sources. Therefore, we chose a truncated   erythromycin-producing polyketide synthase which has been proved to   produce a simple triketide lactone 1B.[2]
Standardization of domains
Figuring Out the Boundary
With the idea of engineering PKS genes to be interchangeable domains,   we firstly develop certain design principles for the engineering of   PKS genes. Although many PKSs are highly modular proteins consisting   of modules of domains, figuring out the boundary of each domain should   be carefully considered because slight changes may result in lost of   function.To achieve this goal, we searched for more information from two   database ASMPKS (Analysis System for Modular Polyketide Synthases:( http://gate.smallsoft.co.kr:8008/~hstae/asmpks/pks_prediction.pl ) and MAPSI (Management and Analysis for Polyketide Synthase type I: ( http://gate.smallsoft.co.kr:8008/pks/ ). According to the resource   provided by these websites, we separated the sequences of DEBS1 with   centering on domains.
Standardization of Interchangeable Domains
Once the boundaries of the domains have been defined, standard prefix   or suffix should be assigned to each end of the domains to make them   interchangeable. The standardization of sufficient numbers of domains   from numerous organisms would allow customized replacement,   rearrangement, and/or recombining of different domains to produce   novel polyketides. In this project, we tested customized synthesis of   triketide lactones by replacing the loading domain and swapping KR+ACP   domains between modules to test the compatibility of the standardized   domains.
The “proof-of-concept” product--triketide lactone 1B
Assemble standardized domains
To validate our proposal we attempted to express the varient --  DEBS1+TE in E.coli. [3] Initially, we tried to amplify the coding   sequences for each individual domain from Saccharopolyspora erythraea genomic DNA by PCR using primers consisting of RFC 23. However, after   laborious work of weeks, we had failed to obtain proper PCR products   due to the high G+C content (≥70%) of"

Stanford-Brown-RISD,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"Figure 6: Biochemical properties and hydropathy of a CBD-HHTC-Re fusion protein. The fusion protein displays significant hydrophobic tendencies. While this was initially thought to be a problem, it synergized well with the nature of the mycelium surface and most likely allowed the protein to obtain a proximity close enough for chitin binding to occur. The simulation to produce the graphs above was done by LifeTein.
We then also produced RFP-CBD fusion protein following a regular His-Tag purification protocol and analogous transformation/cloning steps as our other fusion proteins to stain mycelial material with, and as a cool visual tool/probe. The following images depict purified protein, and liquid cultures of T7 E. coli cells producing the protein, respectively.
The next factor to contemplate was the manner in which the filter could be implemented. Our first thought was to grow fungus inside a syringe on wood chips and treat the mycelium with our fusion protein, and then run water through this. We discovered that the prototypes created, however, were not very permeable, and applying pressure to push water through washed out the mycelium itself, leaving only substrate behind (as seen in the following two images).
The approach that we selected in the end was to make use of filter-based design in which we could take advantage of tangential flow as opposed to direct head-on flow. The following images show the mycelium strips being incubated with purified CBD-HHTC-Re 2x protein for 72 hours with DTT for cleavage (the protocol we designed for creation of the filters). These were realistically implemented by inserting a thin sheet of glass fiber at the bottom of a syringe to prevent any mycelial material from flowing through. The mycelium material could also be shredded to increase surface area for absorption of metal and display of chitin. The strips were then added on top and water could be flown through this setup. The filter strips were cut into 1 cm x 1 cm squares for prototype testing. Various iterations of this process can be seen in the images that follow.
Tangential Flow Prototype Testing: Bulk Surface Adsorption Using Phen Green
The Cu concentration in the initial copper solution was 325 (+/-25) µM Cu. After 30 minutes of tangential flow, interestingly, the untreated mycelium absorbed about 23% of the copper in solution, revealing a fascinating synergy in that the mycelium possesses some inherent metal sequestration properties. The treated mycelium (filter prototype) was able to sequester ~92% of the available Cu in"

Austin_UTexas,2016,Team:Austin UTexas#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"ach
Two potential ways to reduce ethanol content over the course of the fermentation process are to reduce the rate at which yeast produce ethanol or increase the rate at which bacteria convert the ethanol to acetic acid. The first of these methods is the most direct approach, and was the first method tested. We considered UV mutagenizing Lachancea fermentati, a yeast we isolated from kombucha, and then screening for ethanol production using a pH indicator, bromothymol blue (Figure 1). Bromothymol blue is blue at basic pH, turns green around pH 7, and turns yellow around pH 6, and has been used previously to screen for fermentation rate among Saccharomyces cerevisiae colonies (Robillard, 2007). During anaerobic respiration, both ethanol and CO2 are produced, and CO2 reacts with water to form carbonic acid, lowering the pH of the plate and changing the color of the indicator. A variety of problems with this approach led us to abandon it. It is likely that L. fermentati produce other acidic metabolic products, so pH would not necessarily correspond to amount of ethanol produced. This assay also relies on distinguishing differences in color in the agar to qualitatively determine amounts of ethanol production, a process that would be somewhat subjective. Additionally, the ethanol produced is necessary for the production of acetic acid, so slowing the rate of ethanol production would likely have slowed the fermentation of the beverage and could have thrown off the flavor. For all these reasons, attempting to decrease the rate of ethanol production by L. fermentati does not seem like a good approach to lowering the ethanol content during the fermentation.
We next considered increasing the rate at which acetic acid bacteria in kombucha convert ethanol to acetic acid. This would increase the amount of ethanol being used up throughout fermentation, ideally lowering the ethanol content. Two enzymes facilitate steps in this pathway (Mamlouk and Gullo, 2013). An alcohol dehydrogenase (PQQ-ADH) enzyme facilitates the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde, and a membrane-bound aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) facilitates the conversion of acetaldehyde to acetic acid. In order to increase the rate at which ethanol is converted into acetic acid, we propose using Golden Gate Assembly to create a genetic construct in which expression of PQQ-ADH and ALDH is governed by a Tac-promoter (pTac), a hybrid promoter which is inhibited except in the presence of allolactose.  The construct would be transformed into electrocompetent Escherichia coli and"

Apart from this physical containment, we also planned of adding two toxin/anti-toxin systems that would considerably decrease the probability of gene transfer (see project section).  We also thought of including a biological clock that would limit the lifespan of our therapeutic bacterium. Moreover, we planned to use a spo- B. subtilis strain to prevent the bacterium to form spores that would allow it to resist to any competitors and to poor nutriment conditions.

Friendly open source software for the community
Because our project was based on a play           between a predator (our modified bacteria) and a prey (fungi and bacteria), in order to rationalize           our strategy, we have developed a modeling software that would give the optimum ratio between           the two players to get the most efficient rate of killing of the prey. This software is in open source,           therefore available to any scientist (or not) confronted to this kind of issue.

The main purpose of our algorithm is creating a tool to generate an array of sgRNAs necessary to screen for gene doping with our novel targeted sequencing platform. The model works with any input gene . It was tested for the EPO gene, as EPO is our main target for gene doping. We worked with the following information:
Gene cds sequence: Human EPO cds  (GenBank: BC143225.1)
Type of Cas: dxCas9
PAM sequence: NG
sgRNA length: 20 bp of target sgRNA
Off target possibility (seed to target): 10 bp (50 % adjacent to PAM should be identical)
As seen in figure 20, the algorithm detected several PAM sequences close to exon-exon junctions and found the minimum number of necessary guides for each one.
Figure 20. Results from the model to find the possible PAM sequences and the minimum number of sgRNAs needed at each exon-exon junction in the EPO gene coding sequence.
Figure 20 clearly shows that in junction 3 there is the optimal PAM sequence with smallest number of sgRNAs possible. This way, the algorithm generates the sgRNAs and gives an output with the position of such sgRNA. In this specific case, there were two PAM sequences near Junction 3 that had the same minimal number of possible sgRNAs necessary (12 guides each). The algorithm does not ignore one or the other, but outputs both options (or more if available). This array can be used to generate the library of sgRNAs for targeted next generation sequencing of gene doping.
3.2 Gene Doping Model
The concentration of EPO gene doping DNA in blood increases rapidly in the first 1.5 days after injection before decreasing exponentially. Due to the rapid clearance of the adenoviral vectors from the blood and muscle, the majority of the infection events occurs right after injection. As more infected cells die, the number of infected cells decreases. This decreases the amount of doping DNA released into the blood over time, as seen in figure 21.
Figure 21. Concentration of doping DNA in the blood over time after a single intramuscular injection of 141 billion viral vectors. The estimated detection limit of 1000 copies per mL of blood is based on the loss of DNA that occurs during sample preparation and targeted sequencing preparation

Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#KeepFresh_-_-_TEXT.html," plate designed to sit in the corner of a storage room, this design has a groove for the user to slip a strip of latex/cell-coated paper to allow for ongoing monitoring of an environment. A worker can gain an instant reading periodically by taking a photo of the plate using the app designed for this purpose. A fresh strip can be placed into the plate every hour/day/month depending on the need, and the constant groove ensures a consistent placement of the sensor strip in the room. This eliminates the impact of airflow, ventilation and height, meaning the readings will be comparable.
Swing tag
As an alternative design to a sticker, a swing tag could be attached to nets of fresh fruits, such that the customer can gain an average ripeness rating of the bag.
Initial Designs - Visuals
The three most promising designs are the fruit sticker, the plate, and the industrial sticker. The first meets the needs of Avocados Australia; the second could be used by FPA and the third by Zespri. These three products were chosen to be the focus of further product evaluation. Initial designs were sketched and rendered online:
Production
Prototype
iGEM Hamburg 2016 have been working with us in many ways, and one of the main points of collaboration was the creation of a prototype of our plate design. Their nanoscientist, Steffen, rendered our plate design online, and created a 3D printed prototype for us!
Given stickers are a less unique design, and are also not allowed at the Hynes Convention Centre, we did not make a prototype.
Evaluation of Impact
Areas for Improvement
There are some drawbacks associated with this specific design of the technology that should be considered.
Firstly, despite the cells being immobilised in the latex coating, genetically modified E.coli cells are in contact with fresh produce intended for consumption and could potentially be consumed themselves. Due to unease in society regarding GMOs, and also heavy legal restrictions surrounding the release and applications of GMOs, there is anticipated to be a large backlash or consumer concern raised about this issue.
Hopefully outreach events similar to the ones we held, and a growing understanding of synthetic biology will help to diffuse this concern. That being said, regulation of the strength and one-directional permeability of the latex coatings will need to be strict from a biosafety point of view.
Another consideration is the latex allergy. A portion of the population has a non-life threatening allergic reaction to latex. It is unknown whether the quantity or application of latex in this case will trigger such reaction, but it must be noted as a consideration nonetheless.

As we went on with our projects, we tried to consider how our project will impact the world and took the time to create meaningful activities that will allow us to look at our projects from various aspects. By engaging with the potential stakeholders of our project including doctors, patients, and elderly, we were able to approach heart failure from both social and scientific aspects, ensuring our project was addressing the actual needs.
All of the activities were crucial in informing us about the overall direction of the project such as stressing the significance of the project, emphasizing the necessary parts, and overcoming minor lacks. Interactions with people who have a deep understanding of heart failure were very helpful throughout the project, constantly reminding us of ways to improve.
The following are our integrated human practice activities:
1. Webinar Hosted by Promega Corporation
There were several problems with cloning steps.
The problems were as follows.
1) Ligation vector sample was transformed to E. coli DH5-alpha. But no colonies were observed with high-efficiency cells.
2) We checked appropriate insertion of the construct in the vector by gel electrophoresis after reaction with XbaI and SpeI to verify the exact band scale. The digested DNA band was not observed or inappropriate size of the DNA was observed.
To troubleshoot related problems, we asked for advice in a laboratory that conducts the cloning experiment frequently, and they provided various ways to solve the problems. They advised us to use a large amount of DNA in transformation or different ratio of vector to DNA during the ligation process.
Through participating in a webinar hosted by Promega with the help of iGEM, we were able to troubleshoot the issues related to inserting genes into the vector. The following is the screenshot of the webinar, a part where we found a solution to the problem.

Immobilization of dsDNA on paper
Dissolve 10 mg p-Phenylenediisothiocyanate either in 30 ml pure ethanol or in 500 µL dried DMSO and add up to 30 ml with water. (the drying is essential, perform it with 4 Angström molecular sieves at least 24 h)

The optimal concentration required for the immobilization is 20 µM. You can achieve this through hybridization of 2 Primers in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.5. Boil the primers at 98 °C for a few minutes and afterwrds slowly decrease the temperature.
Alternatively, you can perform an conventional PCR with one of the primers aminolabeled. We recommend labeling of the other oligo with a fluorescent dye. This enables detection of the immobbilized DNA on Scanners like the Typhoon or Ettan Dige"

Note
In order to be considered for the Best Software Tool award , you must fill out this page.
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honour such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
If you are working on software as your main project, please join the software track. If you are creating software as an addition to your main project, please apply for this award.
Here are a few examples from previous teams:

NCTU_Formosa,2012,Team:NCTU Formosa#Project-sub5_-_-_TEXT.html," The GC result of the isobutanol yield was 25ppm. Though it wasn’t prominent, it proved that the whole procedures (from cellulose degradation to isobutanol production) were practical. However, we could infer that underneath the toxicity tolerance, we still might acquire isobutanol as much as possible. So we must modify every procedure to enhance the yield of isobutanol. In the future, we will try rice stalks from a farm as cellulose source, hoping that the outcome will give everyone a big surprise!
Figure 27.The simplificative procedures of degrading cellulose to glucose, and then E. coli utilized it to yield isobutanol.
Ingredient Production
Figure 28.Cell-surface display of Cex by means of PgsA anchor protein
Figure 29.
In order to realize our idea to change trash into fuel, we did some research. Therefore, what we have to do is to figure out how to degrade the cellulose. First, we want to get xylose from cellulose through xylanase. Xylanase is a class of enzyme which degrades the linear polysaccharide beta-1,4-xylan into xylose, thus breaks down hemicellulose, one of the major components of plant cell walls. Xylose is a good carbon source. As such, xylanase plays a major role in micro-organisms thriving on plant sources (mammals, conversely, do not produce xylanase).
According to the Journal of Applied Microbiology ( Y.P. Chen et al. 2011), the cell-surface display of Cex, which encodes xylanase from Cellulomonas fimi, was constructed on E.coli using PgsA as the anchor protein.In Figure 29, it shows that Cex do have the activity to catalyze xylan into xylose.
Figure 30.Isobutanol production through consolidated bioprocessing(CBP). There’re 2 types of E.coli in the reactor. One contains Cex-PgsA, which degrades hemicellulose and produces xylose. Another contains BBa_K887002, which turns xylose to isobutanol.
Another advantage of using PgsA fusion enzyme is that it can lead isobutanol-producing enzymes to catalysis through consolidated bioprocessing(CBP) , the CBP in converting cellulose into isobutanol requires combinations of biological events(production of xylanases, hydrolysis of the polysaccharides in the biomass, temperature controlling, and"

Dalhousie,2017,Team:Dalhousie#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,". Beta-xylanase, is a key enzyme in the hemicellulose degradation pathway that cleaves xylose dimers to usable xylose monomers. Using a Coomassie Blue stain for total protein expression, the team was able to show that this novel enzyme is able to be expressed in E. coli in the pET26b(+) expression vector system. The team took a step further and attempted to assess the enzymatic activity of this novel beta-xylanase using a modified version of a cellulase/xylanase activity fluorophore assay (Chen et al., 2016). Using xylobiose conjugated to a fluoro-active molecule, we were able to determine the relative activity of our novel beta-xylanase relative to pet26b(+) alone. We discovered that under the conditions we provided the enzyme was not able to function properly (ie. cleave the substrate), possibly due to the differences in oxidation states of the gut and open air or due to pH differences from the protein’s natural environment.

3 overnights for 3 cultures extracted from plate containing wild type B. subtilis
3 overnights for 3 cultures extracted from plate containing B. subtilis + pGFP-rrnb.
3 cultures (taken on the day) from plate containing wild type Bacillus subtilis
3 cultures (taken on the day) from plate containing Bacillus subtilis along with the integrated pGFP-rrnb insert.
1 x distilled water
Today, the overnight cultures were prepared by getting a total of six test-tubes out and labelled correctly. To all of the tubes, under aseptic conditions, 3ml LB was inserted. Into the first three tubes in the rack, 3 colonies from a plate containing wild type Bacillus subtilis were added and into the remaining three tubes, 3 colonies from the plate containing B. subtilis plus pGFP-rrnb (the plate which had 200µl of cells spread onto it) were added.
The two plates from which these colonies came from were then stored in the fridge for later use. The tubes were inserted into the orbital shaking incubator at 37°C for overnight growth.

Summary
Today we discovered that the transfromations done on the 17th were done incorrectly and there was no growth on the plates we had prepared. We decided to redo the transfromations using the appropriate protocol. We were using the same bricks as Monday: R0062; R0079; C0161; C0179; J44000; C0178; C0062
We carried out the transformations into competent E.coli DH5alpha cells that had been frozen down into the -80 freezer, using the protocol from Phil's lab. We plated the final cultures out onto LB+Amp plates and, following the protocol, prayed.

Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all awards, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!

In the end, we were able to validate three of our parts:
dCas9 BBa_K2361000
dCas9VRER BBa_K2361001
pNisA promoter BBa_K2361009 .
We submitted sequence verified pUSP45 tracrRNA BBa_K2361003
a CRISPR array BBa_K2361004
a CRISPR array containing a 20 spacer BBa_K2361005
a CRISPR array containing a 21 spacer BBa_K2361006
a CRISPR array containing empty spacers BBa_K2361007 without further experimental validation
Unfortunately, sequencing revealed unsuccessful incorporation of the insert during the biobrick construction of two of our parts: p32 BBa_K2361008 and pUsp45 BBa_K2361010 .
Unfortunately, sequencing revealed that the one of the fragments in the CRISPR operon was replaced with something of approximately the same size. Therefore, we were not able to submit our hCas9 part BBa_K2361002 .
dCas9
Construction
For this part we started by making a biobrick compatible version of dCas9 called pSB1C3:dCas9QC. This part was also used for the construction of dCas9VRER. The full length of this part was sequenced (figure 2) and the results confirmed that the sequence was correct. In the notebook (week 18-09) a gel is shown from which it can be seen that the EcoRI site was successfully removed from our dCas9 part.
Although the pSB1C3:dCas9QC was already in the pSB1C3 backbone and contained all the correct restriction sites, it did not contain the suffix. To fix this we restricted the pSB1C3dCas9 with EcoRI and SpeI and ligated it into pSB1C3, which was linearized with primers G69 and G70 (see notebook) and restricted with the same enzymes"
Hong_Kong_HKUST,2014,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#riboregulator#characterization_-_-_TEXT.html," averaged PBAD and absolute promoter activity over the averaged BBa_J23101 absolute promoter activity. R.P.U value of PBAD in different concentration of arabinose is shown. Leakage could be analyzed according to the R.P.U value  that shows the GFP expression of PBAD promoter in the absence of arabinose (0%).
Equation of the RPU calculation is shown below:
Based on this equation, the GFP synthesis rate (dF/dt) for the experiment ( BBa_I0500 - BBa_E0240 ) divided by the ABS (which means the absorbance or OD600) of the cells containing the experiment construct. GFP synthesis rate (dF/dt) for the reference promoter ( BBa_J23101 - BBa_E0240 ) divided by the ABS (which means the absorbance or OD600) of the cells containing the reference promoter construct.
Then, RPU is obtained by dividing the GFP synthesis rate/ABS of experiment with the GFP synthesis rate/ABS of the reference promoter.
Data Processing for data from FACS
1. RPU was calculated by first subtracting the autofluorescence (fluorescence of cells with pSB3K3- BBa_E0240 )
2. Dividing the fluorescence of cells containing pSB3K3- BBa_I0500 - BBa_E0240 with cells containing pSB3K3- BBa_I20260 .
Equation is shown below:
Based on this equation, the amount of fluorescence [F] for the experiment ( BBa_I0500 - BBa_E0240 ) multiplied by the growth rate (μ) of the cells containing the experiment construct. Amount of fluorescence [F] for the reference promoter ( BBa_J23101 - BBa_E0240 ) multiplied by the growth rate (μ) of the cells containing the reference promoter construct.
Then, RPU is obtained by dividing the fluorescence*growth rate of experiment with the fluorescence*growth rate of the reference promoter.
3. For simplicity, we assumed the growth rate of the cells transformed with pSB3K3- BBa_I0500 - BBa_E0240 and cells transformed with pSB3K3- BBa_I20260 had same similar growth rate.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM competition: Chloramphenicol, kanamycin, ampicillin and tetracycline.
Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic commonly used in iGEM and in research in general. However, it is on WHO’s list of essential medicines, which are the most important medications needed in a basic health care system [18] . Chloramphenicol is mostly used in clinics in the developing world, and hould preferably only be used when other drugs are ineffective or contraindicated.
Kanamycin is another antibiotic common in iGEM, and it is also on WHO’s list of essential medicines (18). It is still being used to treat infections also in the developed world - but only if the agent is known to be caused by susceptible bacteria [19] . A third antibiotic used in research is ampicillin. Ampicillin can be used to treat infections including urinary tract infections and listeriosis. Unfortunately, but maybe not unexpectedly, bacterial resistance has been shown to increase the past years why this treatment has been excluded from urinary tract infection treatment in Stockholm, Sweden [20] . Tetracycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used in research and is used commonly in treating, among others, acne and pneumonia (caused by specific bacteria). Also Tetracycline is on WHO’s list of essential medicines [18] .
The past decades, development and discovery of new non-resistant antibiotics has decreased dramatically. “Old and forgotten” antibiotics may have a potential of being more active against resistant pathogens in comparison to currently used ones.The 'old' antibiotics may have potential to be renewed with modern technology. Chloramphenicol, discovered in 1949 is, among others, a candidate for further clinical studies [17] . If the renewal is successful, the usage of it in research may have to be reevaluated.
A variety of antibiotics can be used as selection markers and researchers can often choose between several. We believe that it is preferable to use kanamycin or chloramphenicol, due to the more common use of ampicillin and tetracycline in the clinic for treating infections. However, depending in where on the planet you live, other antibiotics may be more common as treatment. We would like to encourage future iGEM teams to make a quick background check on the clinical-usage-status of the antibiotics where they live. This could help reducing the overlap of antibiotics in research and thereby reduce the resistance-drive.
Replace
Even though antibiotic resistance is still the most commonly used selection marker in biotechnology other options are emerging for both selectable and screening markers [21] [21]"

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#demoOverview_-_-_TEXT.html," MoDeL. It is never a easy problem to calculate degradation rates of proteins since different parts in a fused protein may have different degradation rates and the overall rate is still unknown. What's more, a protein in MoDeL may have different protein chains and it is more complex to determine the overall rate. In the demo database, we assume all proteins with no parts in bound state have a uniform degradation rate. Proteins with more than one chains are considered stable and non-degradable. This idea could be applied easily by writing reaction templates in MoDeL format. The reactant is a general species template with only one substituent-type part (ANYUB) of type ForwardProtein (no reverse reactions happened here). It is similar for degradation of mRNA molecules. Only mRNAs with single chain degrades at the same rate.
For reactions of dilution due to reproduction of cells, quantities of species decrease in a similar way to degradation. The rate of dilution is also similar to the reproduction rate of E.coli:
<math>k_{g}(1-C_{E.coli}/C_{max})C_{species}V_{Flask}</math>
where we only replace the second <math>C_{E.coli}</math> with concentration of species in dilution. To apply this idea, we only need to construct a species with only one substituent-type part (ANY) of no specific type and it will be matched to all species. Among them, only species bound in compartment E.coli will be diluted.
Replication of plasmid DNAs is not as easy as reproduction of living cells in two aspects: first, plasmid backbone with the same replication origin could be found in many species in the system because the original transformed plasmid backbone may bind with other compounds or proteins to form complex; second, the replication of original transformed plasmid DNA molecule tends to be repressed by all species including the same replication origin. However, E.coli cells do not have any effects on the reproduction of other E.coli cells. MoDeL language perfectly support this idea by separating the template reaction into replications and repressions. The first part describes the exponential amplification of plasmids with reaction rate <math>k_{g}C_{plasmid}V_{E.coli}</math>, where <math>k_{g}</math> is the replication rate of a certain plasmid, <math>C_{plasmid}</math> is the concentration of this plasmid, and <math>V_{E.coli}</math> is the volume of E.coli cell."
Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#OurSensor#Prototype_-_-_TEXT.html," the end. Through playing with the components we found that the dragging wick (after the nitrocellulose to pull the liquid sample as far as possible) was not completely necessary, but did seem to aid in covering the nitrocellulose. We believe the dessicator is for long term storage of the device, as it played no discernable role in our bench testing.
To test if our system of using ferritin would give us a readable output from a prototype we blotted prussian blue ferritin onto nitrocellulose. We then enclosed the blotted nitrocellulose in one of the pregnancy tests along with the applicator and wicks that came with it before exposing it to the TMB substrate. Unfortunately we didn't see any change after our first test, but after taking it apart to look inside we found that the solution had only flowed through approximately one third of the device. With that in mind we built our second prototype out of another pregnancy test, but this time we shortened the distace by cutting part of the applicator off. The downside of this modification was that the applicator was rendered useless, so filter paper was used to draw the solution into the device instead. In this prototype, shown below, we were able to observe a change in prussian blue ferritin after the addition of the substrate TMB.
Sample Preparation
In order for our test to work we need the DNA to be accessible for our TALEs. Unfortunately, bacteria keep their DNA contained inside their membranes, meaning that we need to lyse the cells in order for our test to work. Most methods that lyse cells either take upwards of 10 minutes, needs human intervention, or involves the use of larger equipment than the industry wants to use (i.e: requiring an electrical outlet). With that in mind we scoured the literature for an alternate method and discovered a paper where the authors lysed bacteria with a brief exposure to electricity (Besant et al., 2013). With that in mind we designed our rudimentary lysis device, shown to the right, that used the electrodes from a broken elecrophoresis setup to electrocute a sample.
To test the lysis capabilities of this device we took 50 µL of an overnight RFP culture and exposed it to 0, 10, 20, 30, or 40 V of electricity from a power pack for 5 seconds. We then plated the electrocuted samples to see if they were capable of growing, but even before the results came in there was a marked change in the appearance of the sample,"

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Log_-_-_TEXT.html," be seen in the mind map below, the PAF idea was fleshed out and developed in more detail.
We wrote an improved proposal for both of the measurement projects about killswitches and genome integration.
Some of the team spoke to Dr Mark Ramsdale, a fungal cell biologist. He gave feedback on the PAF dea, raising the question as to why we wanted to express PAF in E. coli as opposed to a fungus. Dr Ramsdale pointed out that due to how small PAF was as a protein, using GFP as a tag could affect how it is transported around the cell, and therefore skew the results. He told us about fungi specific promoters in Neurospora crassa which acts as a Circadian Clock using light and heat as inducers.
This prompted a discussion about using a viral vector that contains a killswitch that. The viral vector will insert its genetic information in the host, a strain of Magnaportha oryzae. The  Magnaportha oryzae would breed and the population would be infected with the virus containing the killswitch. The possibility of this being a heat activated killswitch was considered, so during the warmer months when plants grow the killswitch fungi is active to produce PAF.
Some of the team also met with Dr Nicky King, who is going to get us a stand at the Big Bang Science Fair for the South West (29.06.16) and the Britain Needs Scientists fair (06.07.16). She also discussed with us the possibility of writing an undergraduate Synthetic Biology module to be taken up by either Natural Sciences or Biosciences, and seemed very keen on the possibility of this.
We also met with Professor Rob Beardmore to discuss the genome integration idea. He said it sounds interesting but raised concerns about if it would even be possible to mathematically model it. He also liked the killswitch idea and said testing KillerRed and KillerOrange under a gradient of slowly increasing light intensity could be the strongest selector for resistance.
We also experimented with the vlog format, testing out the dynamics of using three people instead of two which we felt it worked a lot better.

Some of the team skyped with the Newcastle iGEM team. We discussed potential for collaboration – they offered the skills of their computer scientists to help us with coding, and we offered the skills of our physicists to help with their understanding of electronics. We decided to Skype again in future and keep in touch with each other, as it seems there’s a lot of potential for collaborating"

Protocol for Lock/Key synthesis
1) From the Lock/key generator, the RNA and DNA sequences are obtained. Attaching the prefix and suffix to the DNA sequence will deliver the new biobrick sequence as show below (example with weak RBS).

2) Double strand DNA synthesis is more expensive than single strand. Therefore in most of the cases the latest is preferred. However, the new biobricks are intended to generate secondary RNA structures which will also be formed in ssDNA (see scheme 1). Therefore the next steps (see also the scheme 2) might be taken into account.

NAWI-Graz,2016,Team:NAWI-Graz#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," the plasmid was cut again by PstI to get a linear fragment and to check the size.
X-Gal plates were prepared for blue-white screening, by adding X-Gal to the premixed agar.
With the rest of the ligation sample a transformation was performed and plated on the X-Gal plates. The next day when checking the plates, there were no blue colonies but also no red colonies (our transformants should be red because of the chromoprotein “red”). Still some single colonies were picked to perform a colony PCR. The next day some red colonies were found, though. So new diluting plating was done. The cells didn’t show colour the next day again.
For this reason, new restriction and ligation attempts were performed. To get a greater chance of correct colonies 3-point-ligation was done additionally. Another try was to use less PCR product. Still no result was as expected.
Week 8 (29.08 – 02.09)
Restriction & Ligation, new ccdB & BioBricks
Over the weekend the diluting plating plates from the week before surprisingly got red. For this reason, we performed a colony PCR, followed by gel electrophoresis, to check the size of the bands. A ONC was also done to do a miniprep and a aliquote was plated (Fig. 19). After measuring the amount of DNA the plasmids were cut by PstI and Xbal. To check if both inserts and the vector were present in the plasmid a gel electrophoresis was done. Only one sample showed the expected results.
Fig 19: Red colonies
As it seemed that the fourth sample was correct, it was sent to sequencing.
The new ccdB from IDT finally arrived and was used for PCR to get a higher amount of the correct fragments and to change the RBS with our new primers. After gel electrophoresis the bands were cut out and the DNA was extracted with GeneJet Gel Extraction Kit from Thermo Fisher. Afterwards pJET cloning was performed as the weeks before. Afterwards the pJET fragment was cut and a gel electrophoresis was run to check if ccdb had the correct size. Sample 1, 5 and 6 showed good results and were sent to sequencing. Meanwhile, for the ccdB_blue clone, a new restriction was performed (directly from PCR product, without waiting for any sequencing results), including ethanol precipitation and blunting, followed by a 3-point-ligation. Afterwards the plasmid was transformed"

We made electrocompetent DH5a stocks, which are marked with blue circles with a line through it. Lastly, we double digested pC13Z and pC13AK with Xba, PstI, Sac, and ApaLI since we were running low on insert DNA. The gel for we ran for the double digestion looked good since we got 4 distinct bands for GFP and mRFP each. Next, we column purified pC13Z and pC13AK double digests and stored them in the freezer for later use. Today we attempted the first day of protoplasting and transforming G. lucidum in the Turgeon Lab. We used both our 3 day old and 1 day old cultures of G. lucidum in this attempt. Our initial pellet of both cultures appeared about the same size, though the younger one may have been slightly larger. We observed that the cells didn’t look like protoplasts, as they weren’t round and were smaller/very few in number. We looked at the solution after filtering and were able to see protoplasts, so it appears that something didn’t work with buffer/centrifuging. We miniprepped and made glycerol stock of the overnight cultures from yesterday--pC13I, pC13AF and pC13CV. We then digested these products. We electroporated for pAK13CS and plated the culture on Ampicillin plates. In addition, the PCR of pC13J worked! The transformations for pC13BC and pC13BV were too efficient, so we had to restreak them out to single colonies.
We are continuing cloning of the carotenoid genes and lox sites. The pC13BN construct looks good. We double digested pC13Z and pC13AK with Xba, PstI, Sac, and ApaLI since we were running low on insert DNA for GFP and mRFP. We began a new attempt at protoplasting, now with the help of members of the Turgeon Lab. We digested the following miniprep products: pC13I, pC13AF and pC13CV. We also electroporated pAK13CS. The PCR of pC13J from yesterday is good!

iosafety
Our goal was to develop a sterile and easily identifiable plant. In order to do this, we created a module in collaboration with NRP-UEA-Norwich which incorporated an RNAse (barnase) under the regulation of a tapetum specific promoter (TA29) and a chromoprotein
Male Sterility strategy was not possible to test in a transient approach, but both components are well documented ( see Biosafety Module ).
The NRP-UEA-Norwich provided us with blue and yellow chromoproteins transcriptional units (TU) and we agroinfiltrated both TUs in N. benthamiana along with a GFP control. Chromoprotein detection was impossible by the naked eye (Figure 1) even though GFP control was expressed (Figure 2). Plants agroinfiltration was correct since GFP was expressed in the leaves.
Figure 1. Plants agroinfiltrated with NRP-UEA-Norwich  chromoproteins. TUs containing Blue (left) and Yellow (Right) chromoproteins were agroinfiltrated in N.benthamiana. None of the chromoproteins could be detected by the naked eye.
Figure 2. Agroinfiltration GFP control. Agroinfiltration control shows GFP expression, indicating that non-detection of chromoproteins is not due to a failure in agroinfiltration.
Nevertheless, identity preservation is an important part of the biosafety module, and it must be happen efficiently. NRP-UEA-Norwich team suggested leaf degreening in order to observe the chromoproteins, but we don’t consider this strategy convenient for our purpose since identity should be easily recognisable in plants without any kind of treatment. As an alternative to chromoproteins, we propose the use of two transcriptional factors to enhance anth"

Highlight
Based on the reference from the WHO, the amount of calorie we consume from refined sugar should not exceed 10% of daily sugar intake.
Refined sugar added in items that can be called “heath food” should not exceed 25 grams, which is half of daily sugar intake for adults. Also, items with more than 50/3 grams of refined sugar should be labeled.
If a product is only to be positioned to a kind of common food, it won’t be required to pass any examination procedures. But, if it is to be a health food warranted by the government, it is necessary that you pass the inspections on food additions and ingredients.
The list of food additions that could be used is now available on the internet. Manufactures are required to hand in their examination result themselves.
The reason why GMO products do not prevail in Taiwan is not related to the regulations. Governing ministries will only require GMO products to be labeled because some people is still suspicious about the safety problems. 
If after 5 years, a new regulation is enacted, and the standard is adjusted, we will examine the product with the new standard again.
Before commercializing, a product could go through either human clinical trial or animal study. 
There is something needed if a product are to be commercialized:
(a.)    The effect of the product must be testified
(b.)    Descriptive data about:
- The bacterial strain used
- How it was grown and preserved 
- How its DNA strand in reconstructed 
- Whether any toxic or allergic reaction is found
Conclusion
As students being unfamiliar with the procedure of law, we understood the inspection standard of laws about health food and GM food after interviewing the section manager, Mr. Chou, which gave us a new angle of sight to reexamine the position of our product. 
FIRDI
Introduction 
The Food Industry Research and Development Institute (FIRDI)is a non-profit research institution in Taiwan. Established in 1965, the main work includes product development, biological resources preservation (gene bank for instance), biological inspection (such as paternity tests).In addition, it also has a section to store umbilical cord blood.
Motivation 
During our last time’s meet-up with NCTU, we told them our plan to consult FDA about Lactobacillus manufacturing. Professor Chen, the leading professor of NCTU IGEM team, said that FDA is an institute offering expertise related to regulations and examination processes.

When there’s no lactose, β-galactosidase won’t be produced. We didn’t use lactose, but we used ONPG. ONPG is a substrate of β-galactosidase and will turn yellow after hydrolysis. The yellow colour is proof of the presence of β-galactosidase. We couldn’t use E. coli in the high-school because of the safety regulations, but we explained the principle of inducible genes and showed the enzymatic reaction with β-galactosidase and ONPG. The students did this experiment themselves and they worked with micropipettes for the first time.
Feedback from the schools
On the 17th of September, Flore and Sabine went to the Sint-Dimpnacollege. It was the first time we gave the workshops and everything went well. We gave the workshop three times to students in the sixth year of science-mathematics and latin-science. The students were enthusiastic and very interested. We got positive feedback from the teachers and students.
On the 23th of September, Lukas and Bert went to the Sint-Lodewijkscollege. These students were also very enthusiastic and interested in synthetic biology and our project. We got a lot of good responses to our workshop.
We also went to a European school. Aurelie and Lukas gave the workshop to a selection of international students. The students were from the Dutch, English and French section. Here we gave the presentation in English. The teachers here were so impressed with our Plexiglas biobrick system that they asked if they could buy it from us (maybe entrepeneurial iGEM competition next year?)!

1. Obtaining the sMMO genes
The very first step of our lab work was to obtain all genes encoding  the six subunits of the methane monooxygenase (mmoX, mmoY, mmoB, mmoZ, mmoD, mmoC) which catalyzes the conversion of the greenhouse gas methane to methanol, a natural intermediate of the cellular metabolism. Unfortunately, even though most of the MMO subunits  are described in the iGEM Registry, most of them were not available in stock. Therefore, we isolated them directly from Methylococcus capsulatus str. Bath via PCR using appropriate self-designed primers. However, the sequence of the initial subunits mmoC, mmoX, mmoY and mmoZ contained various restriction sites within the genes (mostly PstI). In order to receive the RFC10 standard  these were removed by using mutation PCR. We then cloned them into  the pSB1C3 shipping vector to put them at disposal of  the community of all future iGEM teams.
For detailed information, take a look at our Lab notebook → E. 1 Isolation of sMMO genes from M. capsulatus .
2. His-tagging
Now that we had successfully isolated the genes for all the MMO subunits,  our next goal was to proof that we were able to produce all of them in the well characterized and easily manageable model organism Escherichia coli. In order to check for expression later on,  we added a His-tag  at the C-terminus of each subunit  by using appropriate PCR-primers. Afterwards, we put them under control of the inducible lac-promoter (R0011), a weak ribosome binding site (B0032) and a double terminator"

A statement is not considered as an argument if it is recognized as fact. A point of view is considered provided if it contains a viewpoint from a professor, an institute, a stakeholder …etc. A point of view is not made if the author doesn’t provide the source right in the sentence, we didn’t consider the reference as the source in this part.                     iGEM wiki are less likely to make an argument, in comparison to Newspaper and Magazine. We mentioned several situations confronted in assessing iGEM wiki, we discover that iGEM wiki is more likely to state a truth or recite what is in a paper, and then share their ideas.
Sufficiency—Attribution of responsibility
We consider an attribution of responsibility is provided if there is an issue, a conflict or a phenomenon with multiple reasons or attributions. An explanation of a truth, or an argument back up with truth is considered as attribution of responsibility.                     Generally speaking, Magazine demonstrate more attribution of responsibility, the Newspaper often present less than two attributions of responsivity. We discover that it is magazine that is able to investigate into a topic in detail and more carefully, making the article complete. We also discover that iGEM wiki shows little retribution of responsibility, we thought GEM wiki are less likely to make an argument, in comparison to Newspaper and Magazine. We mentioned several situations confronted in assessing iGEM wiki, we discover that iGEM wiki is more likely to state a truth or recite what is in a paper, and then share their ideas.
Sufficiency—Additional reading
We discover that Magazine provide much more additional reading, enabling the audience to search for more interesting information. Newspaper and iGEM wiki both provide little additional reading.
Understandability—Illustration or infographics
We discover that both media perform well in this part.
Understandability—Definition of technical terms
Newspaper provide less definition of technical terms, since most of the gene-related words are easy to understand. As for iGEM wiki and Magazine, more technical terms appeared and they are more likely to come up with definition or explanation,
Understandability—Alternative language for technical terms
In this section, nearly all technical terms are appeared with an alternative language (mostly English). And the rate is quite high

Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#Notebook#Summary_-_-_TEXT.html," strongest promoters (J23100, x2547 and J23104, x1831) had the biggest radius. The halo of  J23106 (x1185) showed the smallest radius, although this promoter has the third stronges activity. Chemotaxis could be observed for every strain.
With these various promoter constructs in hand, a swimming assay was performed. This experiment revealed promoter J23100_TAR_QC in pUC18 background giving the best swimming abilities (data not shown). To generate a chemoreceptor library our method of choice requires the absence of the BsaI restriction site in both, the insert and the vector backbone, of the cloned plasmid. Since pUC18 contains a BsaI restriction site in the plasmid backbone within the selection marker bla gene, this vector is not appropriate for targeted saturation mutagenesis. Thus, the construct was cloned in the BioBrick vector pSB1C3.
The promoter constructs in the new vector backbone were tested in chemotaxis assays for swimming towards L-aspartate (Fig. 10). Thereby, all eight tested promoter constructs were dropped around in the same distance to an octahedron Whatman paper soaked with L-aspartate. As a control serves the strain BL21 transformed with Tar_QC under the control of the eight promoters. ∆Tar was complemented with Tar_QC. As expected, the strongest promoters (18C = K777001, 18K = K777002) show the strongest movement. It was not possible to evaluate 18O (K777004). All in all, the complementation worked, but not to the expected extend.
Further proof came from a SDS-PAGE using where we observed an additional protein band in lysates from cells producing tar from one of three strongest Anderson promoters. The results were consistent with the previous swimming study (data not shown). The construct J23100_TAR_QC gave the best results in these experiments and was therefore used in all further experiments.

The blue bar indicates the measured expression rates for our constructs (J23100, J23104, J23105, J23106, J23109, J23112, J23113, J23114) and the red ones those for the literature values represented in the parts registry.

Constructs for bacterial surface display are hereby already well known in the field of protein engineering of therapeutic proteins, such as antibodies. There, they are used to screen libraries of different antibodies concerning their affinity towards a given therapeutic target.
We based our design on the autotransporter EspP [23] .
The autotransporter system itself is established and functional (see Fig. A [24] ), and here we ""bricked"" it down into RFC[10] and RFC[25] BioBricks. At first we tested different inducible bacterial promoter systems (e.g. ""TetR repressed GFP""; BBa_K577893 ) that are available in the parts registry, but when we saw that two of the available systems did not work in our own hands, we decided to built the system on our own. We used the Tet-Repressor generator that was available on the distribution plates ( BBa_I739001 ) as we believe that it is very important for the standardization in SynBio to use available parts. Downstream of this repressor generator we designed and fused a BioBrick ( BBa_K2170141 ) that encodes a double Tet-Operator (Tet-Repressor binding site together with a bacterial promoter and an signal peptide of the outer membrane protein A (OmpA [25] ) from E. coli that has a 3' RFC[25] restriction site, allowing the protein fusion of proteins that are secreted into the bacterial periplasm when expressed with this BioBrick. As a protein fusion, we then assembled a protein cargo domain that is generally exchangeable for any protein that is so small in size that it can be transported through the outer membrane by the EspP autotransporter. In our project we used the same extracellular domains as for the eukaryotic receptors: enhanced monomeric Avidin (eMA; BBa_K2170204 ), single-chain Avidin (scAvidin; BBa_K2170205 ) and a composite part composed of a N-terminal Biotinylation acceptor peptide (BAP) and a C-terminal NanoLuciferase (together shown as BAP; ; BBa_K2170118 , see Fig. B). Further downstream our design features a A3C5-epitope tag that can be recognized by a high affinity Fab-fragment and is generally used to detect and quantify the surface display of the cargo domain [26] . Further downstream of this affinity tag we fused the BioBrick for the EspP aut"

Biofilms: Degradation of July 9 Biofilms and Reculturing of July 9 Biofilms
Names: Sydnee Calhoun, Tiffany Dang, Dinula De Silva, Ronja Kothe, and Kieran McCormack
Objective: Continue to degrade biofilms using the household cleaners brought into lab for testing and to see if we can successfully reculture the biofilms.
Procedure: Degrading the July 8 Biofilms
The biofilms created yesterday successfully grew. To degrade the biofilms, Fantastic and Lysol solutions were used that had previously been created. Water was used as a control. 300 μL of respective cleaning solution added to each well. 30 mins after the solutions was added, they were disposed of in the biohazard waste.
Procedure: Reculturing the July 9 Biofilms
To culture the biofilms from yesterday, 300 μL of LB media was added to one well for one of microtiter plate that had been degraded with cleaner. The media was then pipette up and down to mix with any remnants of the biofilms. The media was then pipetted back into the 5 mL tube of LB media. 5 μL of KAN was added to the 5 mL tube of LB media.
Process was repeated for the remaining two plates that used different cleaners.
Cultures were left to grow 24 hours in 37˚C"
Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#NRPS_-_-_TEXT.html,") domains are the carrier domains of the monomers and the growing peptide chain. The transfer of phosphopantetheine from coenzyme A to a conserved serine in the T-domain is essential for non-ribosomal peptide synthesis as the thiole residue is necessary for monomer binding. b) The adenylation (A) domain selects the amino acids and covalently binds it to the T domain. It catalyzes two reactions: First, the activation of the monomer by ATP-binding and second, the acylation to the downstream T domain. c) Chain elongation is catalyzed by condensation (C) domains. The C domain enables peptide bond formation between the monomer (acceptor) and the growing peptide chain (donor), resulting in a translocation of the peptide chain to the acceptor T domain (all adapted from [13]).
Termination of NRP Assembly by Thioesterases
In order to terminate the NRP assembly, a thioesterase (TE) domain is located at the end of most NRPSs. TE domains act in two steps. They first bind the peptide to their own conserved serine residue and in a second step this bond is attacked by a nucleophile  [21].  The functionalities of the TE domains can roughly be classified into i) product cleavage [22] and ii) macro cyclization [23]. Those TE domains  belonging to the former group cleave the thioester bond between the product and the enzyme complex by allowing for a nucleophilic attack with water. TE domains of the second group introduce a macro cycle into the product by an intramolecular nucleophilic attack [21]. This macro cycle can either connect the two peptide termini (yielding a closed ring structure such as tyrocidine [23]) or introduce any other peptide bond based cycle  (yielding partially circularized NRPs for instance bacitracin [24]). In addition to those integral TE domains, independent but cluster-encoded thioesterases are known to function as a rescue protein for stalled NRPS [25].
Monomer Modifications
NRPS can incorporate more than 500 different monomers. These monomers include proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids as well as arylic acids. The latter lack the amine residue and are thus only suitable for chain initiations [11].
Incorporation of D-Amino Acids Is Facilitated by Epimerisation Domains
The most basic derivation is the introduction of D-amino acids into NRPs. Their incorporation is achieved by epimerisation (E"

We did ligation within using pET45-b vector that digested with the same enzymes. Following ligation, the resulting plasmids were transformed into BL21 competent bacteria which have T7 RNA Polymerase that we know.
We did colony PCR in order to check the accuracy of cloning with using T7 promoter forward and T7 terminator reverse primers. If the clonning resulted negative expecting band would be 360 bp. On the other hand if we succesfully clonned these parts, for DAMP-Pex. Expected band would be 699 bp, for TEV Protease it would be 1041 bp.
After colony PCR consequences we have put the positive resulted clonnings 16 hours liquid culture  after that we isolated plasmid DNA with miniprep plasmid izolation method. We make cutcheck to our attained plasmid DNAs for put a second control step. Our restriction enzymes those we used are BamHI and XhoI.

After we clonned to pET45-b succesfully we showed our aim proteins production via western blotting with using His-tag which lacate in N-terminal of these proteins.

RESULT FOR TEV Protease
PColA- DAMP-PEXIGANAN CLONNIG:
We demonstrated that DAMP-Pexiganan and TEV Protease proteins synthesing succesfully within clonning to pET45-b plasmid. We thought that we should insert both two genes(DAMP-Pexiganan and TEV Protease) at the same time to same bacteria to show TEV Protease breaking linker chain (to releasing active free pexiganan) that is between DAMP and Pexiganan. We have seen with the same origin in two plasmids can not be found in a bacterium simultaneously due to origin incompatibility process. For this reason, we decided to clonning one of these two gene sequences into pet45-b plasmid which have ColE origin and one of the gene sequence clonning into pColA plasmid which have ColA origin which also we designed it.
Before that we achieved to clonning both of two gene sequences into pET45-b vector. Therefore, clonning only one of these genes would be enough for us. We decided to locate TEV Protease gene sequence into pET45-b because our essential want to"

This likely explains why the gateway reaction of pENTR/D-TOPO-CMV and pENTR/D-TOPO-PCZ-mODC into pRRL didn’t work.  The cells must remain in temperatures below -50C to remain competent.  Since they were left in the -20C overnight so that we could perform the transformation over the weekend (we don’t have access to the -80), they likely lost competency.  After gatewaying and transformation, nothing grew on the positive control, the negative control, or the actual gateway reaction.
5.     We can try to salvage the MDS cells (restore their competency) by adding calcium chloride.  You do an overnight culture at 30C and then grow them up at 20-23C because growing them up slowly makes them really competent.  Essentially, you repeat the process of spinning the cells down and resuspending in calcium chloride.  Dr. Sarkar has never done it with this particular strain of cells, but he has done it with others and it has been successful.
6.     Another option would be trying to clone directly without using the gateway procedure (but this would alter a lot of what we’re doing). Dan is (possibly?) going to give us an aliquot of HB101 competent cells so that we can try it in parallel to see if it works
Next step: gel restriction digest of PCZ, and if this is successful, continue with HB101 and MDSrecA
7.     Someone needs to begin working on the iGaussia.  We need to remove the N-terminus secretion signal.
Next step: find secretion signal and design/order primers to cut this part off. Is Sarkar giving us the vector for this?
8.     We should transfect cells with the PCZ-mODC vector and then lyse the cells to access the coelenterazine, and combine this with the gaussia supernatant to see if it glows.
9.     We should characterize the channel rhodopsin
10.  If PCZ doesn’t work, but add CZ to all of the media, the project doesn’t fall apart and this way we are able to characterize/induce expression of aequorin in the sender cell.
11.  The output from the receiver cell can be anything if we’re not going to daisy chain the sending/receiving cells together.  The sender cell could have gaussia which is good because it has higher expression.

Goettingen,2016,Team:Goettingen#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,", however, is equipped with a thioredoxin fusion protein which increases the rate of expression, but prohibits the physiological function of our protein. For this reason, we designed primers for an autarkic Synporter protein. In order to test the dependence of the expression system on the B12 export rate, we also decided to use different other vectors.
For vector ligation, we used a standart ligase reaction, for the pBAD202 expression, which works without ligation but topoisomerase reaction, we followed the manufacturer's protocol.
Fig. 1:Our Synporter genes torA-btuF and torA-glmS cloned into the pBAD202 plasmid, separated from the thioredoxin fusion protein.
3. Transformation and Cultivation
For our transformation experiments, we used electroporation for all our self prepared competent cells. For the heat competent E. coli Top10 cells provided with the pBAD202 expression system, we used the manufacturer's heat shock transformation protocol.
For vector multiplication, E. coli cells (Top10 for pBAD202 plasmids, DH5alpha for all other plasmids) were transformed with the constructed plasmids. After the transformation, the cells were cultivated on LB Medium. Transformants were selected, and the respective clones were picked, cultivated in LB medium, and plasmids were extracted.
The Plasmids were then introduced into the production strains Raoultella planticola ATCC 33531 and Shimwellia blattae ATCC 29907.
For the expression experiments, the all cells were cultivated and the expression induced in RM medium under aerobic conditions. As S. blattae and R. planticola are known to produce Vitamin B12 only under anaerobic conditions, the expression was induced under anerobic conditions in MM medium.
The induction was performed using different concentrations of l-arabinose and different induction time spans.
4. Expression Test
To test for the expression of our Synporter protein, the cell lysates of the expression cultures we submitted to an SDS-PAGE. From the SDS Gels, Western Blots were performed using anti-Poly-Histidine-tag antibodies.
In order to test the translocation of our Synporter proteins, the cells were fractionated into Periplasm, Spheroplasts, and Cytoplsma (gained by French Press cell disruption) as a control.
5. Vitamin B12 Assays

In summary, the function of feedback inhibition of cGMP changes the relationship between cGMP-NO and sGC-NO into a lower state which is consistent with many research results.

In order to study the effect of sGC on cGMP, we need to find out the curve of the experimental group. Since the coordinates of the starting point in the coordinate system is (180,11) and the growth rate of cGMP with the increase of sGC concentration is more and more fast, we might as well set up the relationship between y and x as:
y=a+bekx
By using ‘lsqcurvefit’ function in Matlab, we got the value of a=8.3573, b=0.6748, k=0.0093.
figure.11
From the image above, the bigger the concentration of sGC is, the bigger the concentration of cGMP, and the growth rate of cGMP is increasing. However, the concentration of cGMP can't increase without limit in the cell, but it will reach to a certain level of stability. This data is only from the experimental group's exploratory experiments which only reflects the change of cGMP in a certain range with the sGC. In order to draw a more accurate conclusion, more sophisticated experiments should be done.

iGEM experimental group used Lentivirus in the experiment. Lentivirus is gene therapy vectors which are developed on the basis of HIV-1,but so far, scientists have not researched the details of the HIV infection, integration, replication and so on clearly, it also means that lentivirus mechanism is not very clear. But the macro and micro mechanism of the exploration of Lentivirus is indeed attracting lots of people interested involved in the study.

The Sortase Package is a generalized solution, designed to enable conjugation/immobilization of any protein of interest to a fusion partner with an exposed glycine residue.
The Sortase A package consists of three key parts:
Sortase A BioBrick: A BioBrick encoding for Sortase A.
Linker-tag (LT) sequence: A custom designed linker-tag sequence encoding for the Sortase A recognition motif, LPETGG, and a histidine tag for purification purposes (Figure 1).
Protein primer design solution: A primer designed to anneal downstream the protein coding sequence with a BamHI overhang.
Sortase A BioBrick - BBa_K2144008
This BioBrick encodes for a truncated version of the transpeptidase Sortase A, fused with the Protein G B1 domain (GB1) acting as a solubility tag.
Linker-Tag - BBa_K2144101
The linker-tag sequence has a BamHI restriction site upstream its sequence. Digesting the BamHI and standard suffix PstI site enables a ligation of the LT sequence with any protein of interest when used in combination with the “protein primer design solution” and the vector's suffix PstI site.
Figure 1: An illustration of the main features in the custom designed linker-tag sequence
Protein Primer Design Solution
Designing primers for use with our vector containing the LT sequence might be easier with a few pointers:
The forward strand of your protein should be coding so that the C-terminus of your protein is fused to the linker-tags. Sortase A conjugates C-terminal LPXTG to N-terminal poly-G sequences.
Make sure to avoid including the stop codons or terminators typically used at the C-terminal of coding constructs as they will interrupt translation of the LT downstream of your protein.
The primers have to be carefully tested since some of them require the insertion of an extra base before the BamHI restriction site in order to avoid a frameshift between protein and LT.
Include a few extra bases on the 5’ end – BamHI does not digest efficiently at the very end of DNA molecules.

RHIT,2013,Team:RHIT#Project.html_-_-_TEXT.html," this promoter sequence, then we should be able to make yeast dependent on E. coli.  We used the gene encoding for His3p (Imidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase), and hooked it up to this promoter, thus making the yeast dependent on the binding of its complementary mating factor.
In order to make the yeast dependent on E. coli, we needed a way to have it express the mating factor on its surface.  Using the Ice Nucleation Protein-based surface display presented by the Penn iGEM team last year, we had a way to have the E. coli display the protein on its surface.  We decided it would be best to constitutively express the mating factor on the surface of the E. coli.
To make E. coli dependent on the yeast, we could approach the auxotrophy from the same direction.  Since there exist strains of E. coli that are mutants for the hisB gene, an analog to the HIS3 gene in yeast, we could complement the gene in the same way; we only needed to find an inducible system for its expression.  In the registry, our team found a part that would allow growth on glucose, and be activated by lactate.  Using this promoter, our team designed this portion of the E. coli construct to be dependent on lactate to live, unless supplemented with histadine.
We found papers describing the expression of Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) in yeast, and its subsequent production of lactate.  With constitutive expression of LDH, we could cause the yeast to produce lactate, making the E. coli dependent on it.  With this dependence, we hypothesized that the E. coli would undergo chemotaxis in order to reach the yeast, following the increasing lactate concentration, allowing us to promote the two organisms coming together.  This leads to the following genetic system.
E. coli Construct (2479 bp)
E. coli construct composed of: constitutive promoter, ice nucleation protein linked to mating factor alpha with glycine-serine linker – used to induce FUS1 promoter, termination sequence, lactate sensitive promoter – induced by lactate produced by LDH, HIS3 gene complementing hisB mutation, and terminator.

Unfortunately, we were not able to prove the principle of our project regarding tyrosine in the pro-peptide cleavage site, as it seems to be not essential for the proteolytic activity. Thus, exchanging tyrosine against ONB-tyrosine will not influence the activity of the enzyme.
Photoclevage
This part of the project was dedicated to the actual photocaging of the protease. Unfortunately, we were not able to execute all of the experiments that we planned due to a lack of time. But as we were able to prove the concept of our project, we will not only show our progress so far but also our plans for the experiments that we weren't able to conduct.
Irradiation
Day 1
To characterize O-(2-nitrobenzyl)-L-tyrosine (ONBY), we decided to test the photocleavage with the light box provided by the iGEM team Düsseldorf 2016 and to analyze it, using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). To achieve this, we dissolved 5mg of ONBY powder in 100µl pyridine and incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes. Then, the analysis was executed via GC-MS with the following conditions:
Injection Temperature: 80°C; Holding Time: 2 minutes
Final Temperature: 250°C; Temperature Ramp: 8°C
The sample was then exposed to UV light of intensity 14.8 mW/cm2 with different exposure time of 1, 3, 5 and 10 minutes using the light box and then analyzed using the same GC-MS method described above. The exposure resulted in photocleavage, and produced 2-nitroso benzaldehyde which has a molecular weight of 132.122 g/mol. Compounds with similar molecular weight have an elution time of 5.3 minutes.

Colony PCR
Colony PCR
Colony PCR is a standard PCR with whole cells used as a template for verification purposes, for example to check if transformed cells contain the desired insert. Primers flanking insert are used.
Cells can be scraped directly from agar plates (using e.g. sterile tips or sterile wooden stick) and placed directly into the reaction mix or they can be suspended in water and 2.5 ul of it can be transferred to the reaction mix. Try to take a half of the colony by sterile tip, transfer it to the PCR mix in PCR tube and transfer the other half of the colony for a new plate (use flame!), which will contain all transformants choosen to be checked by colony PCR. Let the colonies transferred on a new plate grow during time and in the temperature optimal to your organism and after that keep it in the fridge until the result of colony PCR is known. If colony PCR will show positive colonies you can pick the positive transformant from this plate, inoculate liquid medium and save the successful transformant with glycerol at -80 °C.
Prepare a reaction mixture, or master mix if you plan to check many colonies, according to the procedure:
1x recipe for a 25uL PCR reaction
5uL HF buffer
HF buffer should be 5x or adjust volume so final conc. of HF is 1x.
0.5uL dNTP's
This can vary depending on conc. the final conc. should be 0.2mM.
1.5uL of forward primer
1.5uL fo reverse primer
The primer volume can differ quite a lot depending on which conc. you have them in. The final conc. of the each primer should be in the range of 1uM to 0.1uM but this can also be hard to generalize.
0.25uL of polymerase
This again depend on the unit per microliter conc. of the polymerase. Use approx. 1.75U per reaction.

Overview
What's our project about?
Neglected diseases have their importance in public health system, causing millions of deaths every year (MOREL, 2006). In Brazil dengue stands out; a disease which afflicted more than 1,350,406 people in 2015, according to data from the Brazilian Health Ministry epidemiological report. The microorganisms responsible for these diseases are usually transported by insects, thus, repellents represent a good strategy to fight these microorganisms (STEFANI et al., 2009; SORGE et al., 2007; FRADIN & DAY, 2002).
Besides the problem previously reported, it is interesting to highlight the toxicity associated to high concentrations of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), which is the molecule currently used on market. (CHEN-HUSSEY et al., 2014; ROBBINS et al., 1986; OSIMITZ et al., 2010; MCGREADY et al., 2001).
Repellents extracted from natural oils are an alternative to toxicity, but they have a shorter lifespan compared to DEET, necessitating more topical applications; between natural molecules with proved efficiency we highlight the D-limonene, that besides being safe to human skin it is also a GRAS (Generally recognized as safe) product (SUN, 2007; KARLBERG et al., 1991).
With the objective to prolong the duration of the natural repellent based on D-limonene, the use of synthetic biology to promote its continuous production was proposed in this project. However, previous efforts to produce D-limonene in bacterial chassi were not efficient due the insolubility of limonene synthase, enzyme responsible to convert geranyl pyrophosphate to limonene.
To make possible the production of D-limonene, the construction of a genetic circuit with three modules was proposed. The first module has a promoter responsible to different stresses (UspA), which induces the production of limonene synthase. The stresses"

☑ Integrated Human Practices
We conducted a survey for both farmers and other citizens to get their views of the current treatment of straw and clean energy. We found that the phenomenon of burning straw still exists and utilization rate of it is particularly low. Besides, citizen's attitude toward clean energy is friendly but they are still not willing to use it. After understanding the basic situation of straw treatment and clean energy, we have communicated with professionals from Biogas Institute of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs to understand the current research progress in this field so as to improve our design. We got more information about obstacle in current research of reusing straw, as well as analysis of advantages and improvement in our project. After those above, we consulted biologist in our project to further optimize the pathway and experiment design in a more professional perspective.

Discription
Secretory invertase
I. Background
RafD, which is primitively from the raffinose operon of E. coli, can express a β-fructofuranosidase. It can hydrolyze raffinose into fructose and meliose, and sucrose into glucose and fructose. HlyA is a secretory protein in bacteria, which can be secreted through the recognition of its signal sequence at the C terminal by a transporter constructed by HlyB, HlyD and TolC. This part is designed to produce a secretory invertase, which can hydrolyze sucrose in media to feed the bacteria without invertase.
II. Experimental design
Figure 0. The genetic circuits of the secretory invertase
As is demonstrated in the genetic circuit, RafD is ligated to the signal peptide of HlyA. The plasmid can also express HlyB and HlyD, but the expression is controlled by PBAD. Besides, TolC originally exists in the genome of E.coli. Thus, the RafD enzyme is able to be transported to the media and hydrolyze the sucrose outside the cells.
Because the promoter of HlyB and HlyD requires arabinose to work while arabinose is a carbon source, an experiment to test whether this part or the arabinose added to activate the PBAD is what bacteria live on becomes necessary. We used two test parts, Secretory invertase and Pcon_mRFP_TT. Each of them are transformed into E. coli MG1655"
