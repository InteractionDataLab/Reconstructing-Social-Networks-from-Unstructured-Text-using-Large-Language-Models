Modeling Engineered Cas9 PAM Flexibility
CRISPR-Cas9 is one of the most significant advances in genetic engineering in the last several years. There are multiple examples in nature of a CRISPR-Cas9 system being used for as a defense against infection. All of these use their own variant of the Cas9 protein to perform nuclease activity in a region dependent on the presence and location of a system-specific protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence. From these, it has been observed that naturally occurring PAM sequences can be quite different from each other. For example, S. pyogenes uses a PAM sequence of NGG while S. thermophilus has a PAM sequence of NAAGAW in its CRISPR1-Cas system and NGGNG in its CRISPR3-Cas system.
In current genetic engineering technologies, it is mostly the S. pyogenes CRISPR-Cas9 (spCas9) protein which is used.
However, one limitation of spCas9 is the NGG PAM required for binding to the target DNA site. While the 20bp protospacer can be easily specified with different sgRNAs, the PAM is essentially hardcoded into the Cas9 protein structure of the PAM-interacting (PI) domain. This limits the number of possible targets in a given genome, and thus the possible uses of spCas9 for genetic engineering. However, attempts to selectively modify Cas9 to bind new PAMs, specifically by changing two amino acids thought to bind directly to the PAM DNA sequence, failed.
Kleinstiver et al. recently demonstrated modified spCas9 with altered PAM specificity. Cells were transformed with a plasmid bearing a toxic gene and an NGA adjacent protospacer, as well as a spCas9 gene with a randomly mutagenized PAM Identification Domain. Only cells capable of binding the NGA PAM sequence were able to cut the plasmid,"

Presented about
1. Plasmid in which the gene will be incorporated
2. Promoter Tac = hybrid of E.coli's trp and lac operon
- Strong promoter of gene expression
3. Induction can be done by the addition of IPTG(isopropyl-beta-D-1-thiolgalactopyranoside)
- IPTG is a derivative of lactose and is used as an inducer to operate the promoter.
4. Repression can be done by the expression of lac1 protein, which is a type of repressor
- lac1 protein is a DNA-binding protein involved in the metabolism of lactose.
- Promoter mutation: intracellular concentration of lac1 repressor is increased, leading to stronger repression.

Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Project Chemotaxis Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," Results and discussion
3.3.1 Baterial chemotaxis in lab
Under laboratory conditions, the chemoattractant continuously diffuses from the source, hence the distribution pattern of chemoattractant changes with time. In this case, the error function (Equation 2) was used to describe the non-steady state chemoattractant distribution.
For chemotaxis wet lab experiments, a user interface was designed to test the feasibility of experimental protocols. Initially, an experiment was designed as placing certain number of bacteria 6 cm away from a chemoattractant source with different concentrations. A simulation of chemotaxis of 100 bacteria placed 6 cm away from a 5 mM malate source is shown in the movie below. And this MATLAB program has a graphic user interface (GUI)(Fig.4), which can be used by the wet lab students to simply type in parameters and generate static graphs or animations.
Figure 4: Matlab graphic user interface for our chemotaxis model. (Made by Imperial College iGEM team 2011).
The video above shows that the chemoattractant takes 14000 seconds to diffuse to the bacteria colony. During this time bacteria will replicate everywhere on the plate. Thus from modelling, we can deduce that these experimental results may not be able to clearly demonstrate chemotaxis (a result that was seen in our wet lab). Therefore, a new experimental set-up was designed as the chemoattractant is kept in the capillary tube and placed into well with bacterial suspension; attractant diffuses into the well setting up the concentration gradient. Bacteria swim up the concentration gradient into the capillary, after given time, capillary is removed and number of bacteria in the capillary is counted. The whole experimental design is shown demonstrated in Fig.5. This new model integrates our experimental results, which  has refined it. This refinement in turn is further informing the design of our assay which will result in more accurate data, thereby creating a refinement loop between modelling and wet lab of the Phyto-Route module.
Figure 5: Demonstration of experimental setup of the capillary assay. (Diagram by Imperial College London iGEM team 2011.)
The chemoattractant distribution profiles are different in capillary and well. Therefore two chemoattractant distribution profiles were derived, for details of derivation please download here . The distribution equation in capillary is shown in Equation 3 and Equation 4 shows the chemoattractant distribution in the well.
Again, a user interface was designed that enables"

Pipet 10 μl QIAGEN Protease (or proteinase K) into the bottom of two 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.
Add 500 μl sample (plasma or serum) to the microcentrifuge tubes.
NOTE: It is possible to add QIAGEN Protease (or proteinase K) to samples that have already been dispensed into microcentrifuge tubes. In this case, it is important to ensure proper mixing after adding the enzyme.
Add 500 μl Buffer AL to the sample (the same amount as the sample). Mix by pulse-vortexing for 15 s. It is a quite syrupy consistency. To ensure efficient lysis, it is essential that the sample and Buffer AL are mixed thoroughly to yield a homogeneous solution.
NOTE: Do not add QIAGEN Protease or proteinase K directly to Buffer AL.
Incubate at 56°C for 10 min. DNA yield reaches a maximum after lysis for 10 min at 56°C. Longer incubation times have no effect on yield or quality of the purified DNA.
Briefly centrifuge the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube to remove drops from the inside of the lid.
Add 500 μl ethanol (96–100%) to the sample (the same amount as the sample). Pipet it into the tube via the side of tube. This will let the foam of the centrifugation go away. The ethanol will let the proteins precipitate. Mix again by pulse-vortexing.
Carefully apply 600 μl of the mixture from step 6 to the QIAamp Mini spin column (in a 2 ml collection tube) without wetting the rim (pipet via the side at the top of the tube). Close the cap, and centrifuge at 6000 x g (8000 rpm) for 1 min. Discard the filtrate en place the QIAamp Mini spin column in the same 2 ml collection tube. Repeat this 5 times untill the 3mL of the mixture is used (split over 2 1.5 ml microcentrifugation tubes). After the last time centrifugation place the QIAamp Mini spin column in a clean 2 ml collection tube (provided), and discard the tube containing the filtrate.
Close each spin column to avoid aerosol formation during centrifugation. Centrifugation is performed at 6000 x g (8000 rpm) to reduce noise. Centrifugation at full speed will not affect"

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#project-t_-_-_TEXT.html," [ 20 ]. The homodimeric FlhC protein is able to bind DNA, while the FlhD homodimers are not. The formation of the FlhDC complex however, stabilizes and increases the DNA binding ability [ 21 ]. The transcription of flhDC is heavily regulated by nutritional and environmental conditions. Flagellum synthesis is inhibited at high temperatures, at high salt concentrations, at extreme pH or in the presence of carbohydrates, low molecular alcohols or DNA gyrase inhibitors, as these conditions stimulate growth as opposed to motility [ 22 ]. Because the flagellum synthesis is so energy consuming, the process is not started unless the environment calls for motility rather than growth. In fact, in situations where nutrition is plenty over a long period, the bacteria will focus on growth and over time lose the ability to synthesize the flagellum, as seen with the E. coli strain MG1655 localized in mouse intestines [ 23 ].
Figure 4: Overviews cascade of the flagellum synthesis.
Figure 5:3D structure of the FlhD4C2 hexamer.[ 23 ][ 24 ]
The FlhD4C2 hexamer acts as a transcription factor for the Class II genes, which encodes the basal body, that is embedded in the cell membrane as well as hook proteins, which are transported to the cell exterior through the basal body. Another Class II gene is the σ28 transcription factor, which is responsible for the transcription of the Class III genes. This includes fliC, which encodes the flagellin subunit that composes the flagella “tail”. To ensure that the Class III genes are not transcribed before the assembly of the basal body and the hook is complete another Class II protein FliM acts as an anti-sigma factor and bind σ28, thereby preventing the transcription of fliC.
Several studies regarding the motility of E. coli has shown the expression of the flhDC operon to be crucial [ 23 ][ 25 ]. These focused on insertion sequence (IS) elements upstream of the flhDC regulon. IS are sequences that can be inserted randomly within the DNA and therefore serve as an important factor in the plasticity of the E. coli genome as well as in many other organisms. Generally they do not encode any genes apart from those responsible for their movement within the genome, however, they can also serve as activators of neighboring genes, by disrupting repression or by the formation of hybrid promoters [ 25 ]. In the beforementioned studies, bacteria containing an activating IS upst"

We were lucky enough to be able to collaborate with a team rich in iGEM experience like Manchester Team. As we got quite a few tips on how to strive on iGEM, we also would like to share those tips & tricks with fellow iGEMers. We therefore initiated a collaboration project with Manchester Team in the form of a mini-booklet project which consists of basic tips and tricks to compete in iGEM. The mini-booklet was developed by us with a very generous help from iGEM Manchester Team. Our aim is to provide Indonesian future teams and many more teams internationally with necessary tips and tricks from a more experienced university. This goal resides with our iGEM Booklet Vol.1 vision, to inspire Indonesian future teams. We plan to distribute this mini-booklet alongside the iGEM Booklet Vol.1."

TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Human Practice#Panel Discussion_-_-_TEXT.html,", in which the students themselves can experience Molecular Biology. Students should learn that DNA and proteins are ordinary tools of biologists. The students have seen, by what means organisms are changed and what safety standards prevail in an S1 laboratory. In a final discussion students could ask about synthetic biology.
A second important area in Germany is the elder generation. Demographic trends in Germany go on towards an elder society. Traditional and often conservative thinking restricts the development and especially the exploration of new technologies. For this reason, the iGEM team of Darmstadt took part in a senior session of chemists in order to elucidate the elder generations about the new technologies. Often, the elder one has to face with fear of things, they do not even know. The team has tried to take the fear and tried an open and honest talk about opportunities and risks of synthetic biology. The enthusiasm of the team was also well received by the elderly.
Another aspect is mainly the industry, because they are interested in most cases for new technologies. The iGEM team from Darmstadt got the opportunity to present their project to an economic audience at the ACHEMA. It attended quickly that the questions about the project were very different. Even at the ACHEMA the team had to made persuasions to the company and also informs about the new technology of synthetic biology. Risk management plays a special role, as the technology is in contact to the product and further with the consumer.
Another area in which it should be informed and discussed is the scientific field itself. The CAS Conference - Synthetic Biology offered a good place especially for discussion about pros and contras of Synthetic Biology. Here got the team from Darmstadt the opportunity to present their project to a consortium of scientists. Discussions quickly immersed themselves in tiny scientific details
Probably the most important section are people from everyday life. To achieve these people, the iGEM team had organized an interactive panel discussion. Here were the residents of Darmstadt informed about the project and of course biotechnology and also Synthetic Biology. Guests were able to actively participate in the discussion and remained a few hours even after the end. At the event day, that has been initiated by the eleven German iGEM teams in Berlin, the team was able to take part at an ""Umweltbörse"". This gave the team an excellent opportunity to address the people on the street to interest in the project. Since the project of the iGEM team dealing with environment and recycling, it fits well in this event day of the city of Darmstadt. It's a long way for synthetic biology to be accepted as normal technology in"

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,".2 \times 10^5}{4^{10}}) = 11$% in a 2 BabbleBrick system
$\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\approx \big(\frac{10^8}{4^{15}}) = 9$% in a 3 BabbleBrick system $P_C$: Maximum probability of the same checksum occuring after any number of mutations
$C_{max}$: Frequency of most common checksum
$F$: Frequency of possible unique bits of information
Therefore, it can be predicted that for an average sentence containing 9 words the maximum     probability of the same checksum occurring will be of the magnitude of 1%. The probability     should decrease marginally when adding BabbleBricks due to the slightly increased range of     checksums that become available. This value can be optimized by altering the method of the     checksum to utilize a greater range of values and to spread out the frequency more evenly as     to reduce the maximum probability of the same checksum occurring.
Currently one BabbleBlock has 4 BabbleBricks dedicated to storing the checksum, giving a maximum     10$^4$ possible values. The first step in determining a ‘CheckMethod’ is to ensure that all checksums     for a suitable amount of BabbleBricks can be stored without going over 10$^4$. It is also important    to not use operators that will result in negative numbers or decimals, therefore limiting the     possible checksum values to integers up to but not including 10$^4$, this rules out operators such     as subtract and divide. For this example, a suitable number of words in a sentence and therefore     BabbleBricks in a BabbleBlock shall be 20. All simulations will be carried out on 3 BabbleBrick     systems due to computing limitations.
Checksums are non-directional, for example a BabbleBrick of bases [2,2,2,2,2] would have the    same checksum as [2,1,3,2,2].  To alter this a checkmethod will incorporate the position     of the base in to the calculation. At each point the digit is multiplied by its position     in the BabbleBlock, where the first BabbleBrick has digit positions 1 to 5 and the last     BabbleBrick (20$^{th}$) has positions 96 to 100. A scaler $\alpha$ has been included to     increase"

Overview
USTCers believe that scientists must take the responsibility of science and technology propagations among the public. Our iGEM team established a club in our university called Encoding Life Association (ELA), especially for the popularization of science among children in China.
This year Team USTC, along with ELA, delivered human practice activities for the public. In our human practice section, we combined general biology, molecular engineering and synthetic biology with public health, policies, art, public engagement, education, biosafety, environment and society.
In our minds, human practices are not only to clarify what is our synthetic biology, what is our daily work or the common phenomenon of scientific reason, but also to take people into a more in-depth thinking.
If a human practice can encourage people to think further, lead them into a new field of scientific research, or even make they become the new scientists, the human practice would seem more precious. Human practice works can also climb up to the highest level of science hall. In fact, it reflects more scientific issues.
Poster Presentation and Survey
During the Science and Technology Week of our school, we introduced iGEM and synthetic biology to public and our schoolmates by showing posters about the iGEM projects that Team USTC had done, and we also conducted a survey about synthetic biology at the same time.
Team USTC members and Team USTC-software members worked together to give presentations to the public, including  professors, students, children and the citizens. Everyone showed great interest to our projects, and we had lots of discussions about the cutting-edge research of biology.  During the presentations, we surveyed the public about their knowledge of biological science, gene engineering, bio-safety  and in particular, synthetic biology.
Before holding the presentation, we had done a lot of research and"

AcCELLoMatrix for Team Freiburg
At the iGEM meetup in Munich in May, members of both of our teams realized that our projects share a common objective: Analyzing 2-dimensional, visual signals. For the following months, we stayed in contact and developed a concept to encode information in 384-well plates in the form of data matrix codes.
At the beginning of September, Michael spontaneously took a train to Freiburg and we met face-to-face for several hours to exchange details on our cooperation and general iGEM experiences.

Data Matrix Masks
We decided to use masks to locally induce the cells in 384-well plates in a data matrix pattern. To enable us to quickly design masks for different data to be encoded, we wrote a software to easily generate SVG-files for a laser cutter.
Making a datamatrix mask
Upon entering a string, the software predicts if the datamatrix will fit into a 384-well plate.
After a string has been entered in the designer, an SVG-file can be saved and used for laser cutting the mask:
Cut Lines
This AcCELLoMatrix mask can be lasercut and placed below a 384-well plate.
Get the DatamatrixMaskDesigner to make you own AcCELLoMatrixes! (requires Windows 7/8)
You can also download the full source code and compile or modify it with Visual Studio (Express) 2013.
For the first experiments, we cut two different data matrix patterns from polypropylen foil. The masks can be used to cover the plates from the top or from the bottom.

aGEM Conference/competion
After a week of preparation for aGEM, the team was on their way to the Banff Centre. The poster presentation began at 8:00pm  for all three Albertan teams: UofC, UofA and UofL. The University of Calgary students arrived early and set up the iMacs for the Second Life tour, set up the posters and had hand-outs ready to be distributed.  The team members took turns visiting the other teams' poster presentations and made sure that there was always someone by our poster to address any questions or concerns that visitors and/or judges should have.
I also had the opportunity to speak to the analyst from iNOVIA Capital, Laura Montes, who I had met at the Dragon's Den earlier this year. She was interested in the marketing and outreach part of the project and was astonished to find out the progress that the University of Calgary's students have made with marketing, media and outreach this year. I also distributed the Human Practices handouts and addressed the relevance of Human Practices to the iGEM 2009 project.
Later that evening, the team got together and helped the presenters prepare for the powerpoint presentation on Saturday.

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," The DNA embedded with catalytic activity information (in a form of incorporated reference to catalytically converted nucleotide ratio) was extracted and sequenced with the nanopore. By applying data preparation and analysis pipeline, the mean methylation scores arising from reference nucleotides for each barcoded mutant DNA template were filtered and extracted. The collected data was normalized over Wild Type enzyme version and K227R mutant (it had the lowest activity).
Figure 1. Comparison of In bulk and CAT-Seq measured esterase mutant relative activity. In silico generated Esterase mutant library was subjected to catalytic activity sequencing. The mean methylation scores for each barcoded mutant DNA template were filtered and extracted. The collected data was normalized over Wild Type CAT seq Esterase and K227R mutant (lowest activity). The relative activity, extracted from the mean methylation score of each mutant read is compared to in data gathered in standard sized reactions (in bulk).
The relative methylation score (reference nucleotide count) of each mutant read corresponds to the activity of the enzyme it encodes. The higher the activity of the expressed enzyme, the lower methylation score is assigned, due to the catalytic conversion of substrate nucleotides. The comparison of the results, gathered with CAT-Seq catalytic activity sequencing approach and standard sized reactions (Figure 1) conclude the viability of CAT-Seq as a biomolecule activity to reading method. The activity reading, extracted from the DNA sequence correlates with the kinetic measurement data perfectly. The activity of each Esterase mutant is measured accurately and is assigned to the corresponding DNA sequence. These results prove that CAT-Seq approach enables to screening the activity of millions of enzyme variant sequences and accurately assigns the phenotype of each variant to the genotype it arises from.
RBS strength determination
The constructed Ribosome Binding site library ( BBa_B0030 , BBa_B0032 , BBa_B0034 , BBa_K2621038 with a downstream CAT-Seq esterase gene BBa_K2621000 ) was subjected to catalytic activity sequencing method and DNA, embedded with catalytic activity information was prepared. Then mean methylation scores (reference nucleotide count) for each barcoded DNA template, housing different RBS were filtered and extracted. The activity collected data was normalized to BBa_B0034 data and is shown in Fig. 2.

Warwick iGEM
We mini prepped and PCR’d part BBa_K314110 and sent it to the Warwick iGEM team after they had used up their own supply of the part from the iGEM kit plate. We were not using the part ourselves, so it was an ideal match.
Look through Ria's process of preparing the sample.

Team member Lychee went to Taiwan to spend some time helping NCTU_Formosa in the lab by running a colonies PCR and gels, and by assisting with translation/improving the quality of English on their wiki.
He also visited iGEM NTU in their lab and gave them human practices advice based on some of own outreach ideas: school talks etcetera.

We distributed and collected responses for their project questionnaire as part of their human practices.
Trinity College Dublin
They have helped our outreach and media reach a wider audience through the creation of iGEM Academy: a youtube channel intended as a central hub for past, present, and future iGEM teams to share their videos.
The youtube channel has a lot of intresting videos, check it out here.
UCL
They hosted us in London and filmed us interviewing the public on the shared issues surrounding our projects - since both of our teams initially planned to work with free-living engineered bacteria inside people. We had productive discussions of these aspects of our projects and this helped us refine our ideas going forward.

Objective: Continue to degrade biofilms using household cleaners brought into to the lab to see if we can successfully reculture the biofilms.
Procedure: Degrading the July 13 Biofilms
The biofilms created on July 13 grew successfully. The solutions used to degrade the biofilms were Mr. Clean, Lysol, Tilex, and Fantistik. Water was used as a control. 3200 μL of solution was added to each well and Petri dish. 30 mins after the solutions were added, they were disposed of in the biohazard waste.
Procedure: Reculturing July 13 Biofilms
To reculture the biofilms from yesterday, 200 μL of LB media was added to two of the wells in the 28-well plate and to the Petri dishes that had been degraded with cleaner. The media was moved around the rim to where the biofilm had formed. Then the media was pipette back into the 5 mL tube of LB media. 5 μL of KAN was added to the 5 mL tube of LB media.
This process was repeated for each of the cleaners and the control listed above in the procedure for degradation of the biofilms.
The Petri dishes and the 28-well plate were left to air out on a sheet of paper towel.
Procedure: Creating Biofilms
Biofilms were made in 5 35x10 mm Petri dishes and 4 wells in a 28-well plate by putting 3000 μL of LB media, 3 μL of KAN, and 20 μL of RFP in to each Petri dish and well.

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#test#human practices#emoji report_-_-_TEXT.html," as, “What if they evolve and attack our cells” and, “I suspect this is how super-phage take over our body.” This highlights that there is concern over the negative effects and potential risks of phage therapy, thus why people are suspicious about receiving phage therapy.
💔 Broken Heart
This emoji is defined as a broken heart, indicating aching and loss.7 In this context, it links to the idea of death and loss as a result of phage therapy. This is reflected in comments such as, “SO I’M GONNA DIE?!?!” and, “CANCER?”. This highlights a clear mis-information on the topic of phage therapy, as some people are jumping to conclusions that there is a link between phage therapy and cancer/death. This suggests the need to have more accurate information available to the publics regarding phage therapy.
👏 Clapping Hands
This emoji is defined as two hands clapping, indicating applause.8 In this context, it indicates praise and applause towards the idea of phage therapy. This is highlighted in comments such as, “That [the phage therapy concept] was amazing!” and, “WOW!”. This reflects that some people in this sample are incredibly impressed and positive towards phage therapy, suggesting they would like to learn more about it and see the introduction of phage therapy on a wider scale.
🔫 Pistol
This emoji is defined as a pistol, indicating violence and killing.9 Similar to, “Face with Medical Mask”, “Pistol” is also an anomaly and is not an emotion, but rather a discussion around the themes of violence and killing. This is reflected in comment such as, “Phage- a simple yet deadly organism- this could change everything!” and, “Could the phage evolve so much that they could kill us”. This highlights that a key concept that people see in phage therapy is the phage’s ability to kill. This can be seen as positive, if it is killing harmful bacteria, but also suggests fear that as the quoted comment mentioned, the phage could kill humans.
🎶 Musical Notes
This emoji is defined as musical notes, indicating singing or music.10 Again, like, “Pistol”, this is not an emotion, but rather an expression of opinions through music. While it may seem odd that this theme is common in a phage therapy video, our analysis suggests that people use song lyrics to convey their feelings and emotions towards phage therapy. Examples of this include, “ What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” in reference to"

From their questionnaire responses, we learned how expensive contraception methods are, and how many women’s husbands don’t respond positively to them using birth control. As with the other questionnaire responses, more of the same rumors were brought up; specifically, that birth control can cause cancer or infertility. We also learned that Uganda is a heavily Catholic country. According to one of the Buhangan women participants, many Catholic churches discourage women from using birth control and compare it to killing (similar to opinions on abortion). No other groups have mentioned religion in their responses, so we were very grateful that the Buhanga Women informed us of this discouragement. We hope the brochure our team is working on will address many of these rumors.
Promote Africa Foundation:
We discovered the Promote Africa Foundation through the Joy Women’s Group. The Promote Africa Foundation is a united women’s group that runs programs related to female reproductive health and women’s rights. According to Evelyn Lewsley, the leader of the PAF, they “encourage women to space their children because most children are abandoned by families who fail to provide for their children”. The Promote Africa Foundation encourages birth control methods throughout the Kasese District, and they’re currently encouraging birth control injections, but struggle to get women to participate since injections may cause bleeding. The Promote Africa Foundation is excited to work with us as they hope our birth control method will be safer for the women in Uganda.

We are currently working on updating information. We will update as it becomes avaliable.
Rita Women Development Association:
The Rita Women Development Association resides in the Rwenzori region of Western Uganda. This group empowers women in their community and prevent the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases. Through the recommendation of Kabugho Beatrace of KUWA, we made contact with the Rita women. Masika Vicky, the chairperson of Rita, informed us that there is a lot of stigma on contraception use (primarily condoms because they are the only contraception available). Currently, their group is working on an anti-HIV/AIDS campaign because there is a high rate of people affected by the virus in the Rwenzori region. The spread of HIV/AIDS stems from the stigma on contraception use; according to Masika Vicky, 98% of people fear to buy condoms in public and therefore have unprotected sex despite the outbreak of HIV/AIDS. This stigma also correlates with the high birth rates, similar to those seen in the Kasese Municipality where KUWA resides. Masika Vicky relayed that “Ug"

Overall it was an amazing day where we educated kids all about synthetic biology! The parents feedback to our team was incredibly posititve and the kids loved the activites. This was our first outreach activity and we think it was a massive success at engaging kids with iGEM and synthetic biology at such a young age!
School workshops
The Nottingham iGEM team visited 3 local Nottinghamshire schools; The Becket School on the 28th September to hold a workshop to a group of 30 year 11 (ages 15-16) students. On the 8th October we also visited 14, year 13 (ages 17-18) students at the Nottingham University Academy of Science and Technology (NUAST). Finally on the 11th October we visited 15, year 12 students (ages 16- 17) at Bluecoat Academy.
We split our workshop programme into 3 parts: 1) A presentation, 2) DNA extraction from fruit and 3) Research and presentations by the students. We organised it in such a way that it was representative of a typical university course. The presentation represented lectures, the extraction represented laboratory practicals and the research and presentation represented seminars.
We gave a 15-minute presentation titled ‘An introduction to synthetic biology’ in which we introduced synthetic biology concepts and talked about iGEM and our project. We invited them to ask questions throughout the presentation and after it concluded, and we were pleasantly surprised by how much the students were engaged and the knowledge they previously had. In addition to questions about our presentation. They asked us questions about the university life and about what options they were considering for their A-levels and Universities. It was inspiring to speak to a group of students who were thinking of pursuing higher education and perhaps, becoming future researchers themselves.
After the presentation, we invited the students to extract DNA from strawberries and encouraged them to use their knowledge from their classes to understand why each step was necessary. For example, we explained why detergent and salt were needed in the extraction and why ethanol was used. The students thoroughly enjoyed the demonstration and had positive reactions when watching DNA precipitate. At the end of the experiment, students raised their hands and asked what the purpose of DNA extraction was in the ‘real world’. Using the example of the ever-popular DNA testing for ancestry and ethnicity, we told them of the importance of getting DNA samples to test for similarities between individuals. We also talked about its importance in genome wide studies for human disease and major projects such as the Human Genome Project.
Finally, we produced a list"

Our Solution: Curdlan
What is Curdlan?
Glucan molecules are polysaccharides of D-glucose monomers linked by glycosidic bonds and one of them is called Curdlan , a (1→3)-β-D-glucan. This molecule is a linear homopolymer which may have as many as 12,000 glucose units. It is naturally produced by Agrobacterium sp. ATCC31749 which uses it as an Extracellular PolySaccharides (EPS) in it's capsule [1]. The capsule formation is correlated with cell aggregation (floc formation) and it is suggested that the capsule and floc formation together function as protective structures in cases of Nitrogen-starvation of the post-stationary phase. The protective effects for the bacteria are due to the fact that Curdlan forms a capsule that completely surrounds the outer cell surface of bacteria.
« Ok and how will Curdlan be useful to you? »
« Let me explain our purpose. »
Curdlan belongs to the class of biological response modifiers that enhance or restore normal natural defenses. For example, it can have antitumor, anti-infective, anti-inflammatory, and anticoagulant activities (see other properties of Curdlan). In particular, this (1→3)-β-glucan can stimulate plant natural defenses.

More precisely, applied to grapevine plants, sulfated ß-glucans induce the accumulation of phytoalexins (organic antimicrobial substances) and the expression of a set of Pathogenesis-Related proteins . In plants, the fact that oligosaccharides must carry crucial sulfates for their biological function suggests that chemical sulfation of oligosaccharides can improve their biological properties. In recents studies, compared to Laminarin (ß-glucan), its sulfated derivative triggered an enhanced immunity against P. viticola in V. vinifera and a stronger immunity against TMV in Nicotiana tabacum. The results indicate that the chemical modification of an elicitor, such as sulfated"

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E"

Our outreach this year consisted of two different collaborations. Although we don’t have details ready for the wiki (as we are meeting with them a few days before the competition, well after the wiki freeze), several members of our team are planning to have an extended meeting with several leading experts in sleep medicine to exchange ideas and get feedback on our overall project idea. Organized with the help of Prof. Eve Van Cauter from the Sleep, Metabolism, and Health Center (SMHC) and director of the Sleep, Chronobiology, and Neuroendocrinology Research Laboratory at the University of Chicago, the session will include a presentation by Dr. Rachel Markwald, a sleep research physiologist from the Naval Health Research Office in San Diego, a presentation on current human melatonin research by Prof. Kathy Reid from Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine's Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine, then some time for presentation of our own project. We hope to be able to report back with updates on this interesting collaboration in our presentation at the Jamboree.
 
Additionally, we helped provide mentorship and feedback to a high school team from Our Lady of the Snow Catholic Academy in Alberta, Canada (check out their wiki here: https://2015.igem.org/Team:OLS_Canmore_AB_CA ). This year, they are pursuing a project to express keratinase similar to our project from 2013, and so we provided them with guidance on difficulties we encountered in our project, molecular mechanism of the keratinase, the process of chemically digesting the bonds, and ideas for making the keratinase-based father waste digesting process economically viable for chicken feathers. We also discussed different approaches that could be used to either produce pure keratinase on a large scale in bacteria or yeast or produce bacteria that could secrete keratinase on a large scale with no need for lysis.

UCAS-China,2018,Team:UCAS-China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," our project,  E. coli needed light and sound as inputs to produce color and odor as outputs. The process was mainly divided into three parts: sound to light, light to color, and light to odor. The light-color and light-odor conversions were achieved with the RGB system[2] which was based on the phage RNAP system as a resource allocator. As for the sound-light conversion, we developed a software that allowed users to upload their own music to generate their unique dynamic pictures, with which people could color and ‘ensoul’ their own roses.
LIGHT TO COLOR
Firstly, we introduced the RGB system to stain our rose using light. The RGB system mainly consists of four modules: a sensor array, circuits, a resource allocator and  actuators. The sensor array combines 3 light sensors, Cph8*, YF1 and CcasR, which can respond to lights of different wavelengths. CcasR can sense and be switched on by green (535nm) light. Cph8* is switched off by red (650nm) light, while YF1 is switched off by blue (470nm) light.
To activate gene expression, the signals from the red- and blue- light sensors need to be inverted, which is done by connecting them to NOT gates in circuits.
The resource allocator which connects the circuits and actuators, is based on a split-RNA polymerase system. In the system, the sigma fragments activated by light sensors can combine with the constitutively expressed non-active ‘core’ fragment to form complete RNA polymerases, then activates the expression of actuators accordingly. For more information on the circuit design, see LIGHT TO COLOR .
.
The actuators we chose were three kinds of color protein: fluorescent protein, chromoprotein and enzyme which can produce colorful products. Although more and more fluorescent proteins and chromoproteins are edited to generate more and more colors, the number of colors produced by organisms is still limited by the number of the kinds of proteins. Once a new color is needed, researchers have to modify the chromophores of the proteins, which takes much time and effort.
So how do we create more colors in a reasonable and convenient way? Here, we put forward a new concept—mixing color into bacterial cells! Unlike the mix of different bacterial cells which produce different colors as the previous iGEM teams have done[4], we used tandem expression and RGB system to control the ratios of the expression of different colors in bacterial cells, to achieve mixing color in bacterial cells, and stain our roses with more bright colors.

We are from a technical university in a small country where innovation is in focus, so have been encouraged to think outside the box throughout our entire studies. Although, since we are just a group of young, blue eyed students coming from the comfort of the university, we learned a lot by investigating how our idea fit into real life settings and exploring the viability of basing industrial biotechnological processes on waste streams.
Throughout our project, from the initial development of the idea to finalizing the lab work, we have been in close contact and collaboration with the industry. We started out searching for abundant waste streams in Denmark by contacting and visiting local factories. Afterwards we presented our idea to players in the biotech manufacturing companies, and the feedback we recieved from them made us more aware of the challenges our technology is facing and it ultimately led us to a more feasible project.
Investigating local industrial waste streams
We started investigating one of the classical examples of a waste stream today, glycerol, and came in contact with local biodiesel producers, Perstorp and Emmelev A/S. We investigated their waste streams with the perception that glycerol was an abundant waste product from their productions and thereby a by-product, they would be more"

Waterloo,2012,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," for expression under specific conditions (eg. IPTG induction), allowing some control over in vivo recombination.  The caveat to using any recombination system to generate fusion proteins in vivo, is that translation of the leftover recombination site sequence or 'scar' can shift codon readings, and/or disrupt protein folding (Fig 2) We propose, therefore, to flank a recombination site, such as the loxP sequence, with a self-excising ribozyme sequence, to create 'scarless' fusion proteins (Fig 2).
Fig 1. Schematic of Cre-lox recombination (from (2))
Fig 2. Schematic of recombination products a) with a remaining 'scar' and b) with the scar removed from between two fusion protein segments, PL and PR.  Failure to remove the lox scar may result in disrupted protein folding or mistranslation of the second half of the protein, PR
2.2 Group I Introns
Self-excising ribozymes are an ancient class of introns that can remove themselves from RNA constructs, including mRNA and tRNA (3).  The Group I introns are a subset of these self-excising ribozymes, and are widely distributed through simple eukaryotes, fungi, mitochondria, chloroplasts, bacteria and bacteriophage (3).  Group I introns are not yet known to provide a specific biological function, save to excise themselves from important RNA sequences, and thus prevent host death.  One hypothesis is that they are ""selfish"" remnants of an RNA world (4).  Some Group I introns, for example, code for DNA endonucleases that help them migrate to new sites (3).
The Group I excision mechanism relies on a reactive 'core' rich in RNA secondary structure that conducts two successive transesterifications (5).  Some introns require proteins to help stabilise them, while others are completely independent (5).  The first transesterification involves a nucleophilic attack on the 5' end of the intron, by the 3' OH of a guanosine nucleotide (5) (Fig 3).  Structural rearrangements bring the the 3' end of the exon into proximity with the 3' end of the intron, allowing the second transesterification to occur (5) (Fig 3).  The intron is usually then degraded by the host, while the resulting mRNA is translated.

Self-protection from subtilin
Of course, the producer needs to be immune against the antimicrobial agent it produces. B. subtilis ATCC6633 protects itself against subtilin by two mechanisms that both act independently and confer some level of resistance, however full resistance is only achieved when both mechanisms are active. SpaI is a membrane-anchored lipoprotein. It is suggested that it binds the antimicrobial peptide and by this keeps it away from the membrane. SpaFEG is a LanFEG-like ABC-transporter that works by exporting subtilin from the cytoplasmic membrane to the culture supernatant. [4 ] [5 ]
Dual regulation of subtilin biosynthesis and immunity
Fig. 3. Dual control of subtilin biosynthesis and immunity. [6 ]
Subtilin biosynthesis and immunity in B. subtilis ATCC6633 are subject to a dual control mechanism.  To begin with, subtilin production is positively regulated by sigma factor H (SigH). SigH itself is repressed by the transition state regulator AbrB during exponential growth phase. Thus, subtilin production is highest at the transition to stationary phase. Moreover, when a threshold level of subtilin concentration is reached in the extracellular space, the peptide acts as a pheromone. Subtilin activates the two-component system SpaRK, consisting of a histidine kinase and a response regulator, which in turn induces expression of spaBTC, spaS and spaIFEG. This dual control mechanism allows the coordination of subtilin biosynthesis with the physiological state of the cell.

He also recommended ordering the most promising candidates via gene synthesis and stated that creating a library is very useful, but on the other hand also very time-consuming. Lastly, he clearly stated that ROSETTA only provided theoretical results, while in reality, yields might be very different. He then went on to demonstrate the ROSETTA protocol and its outputs to give us an impression on how to make use of the input lines. In conclusion, his encouragement and expertise greatly helped us to theorize and plan our modeling project in such a way that we were able to model the evolution of synthetases to non-canonical amino acids.
Talk on single molecule real time sequencing
One of the problems we had to face when dealing with unnatural bases was how to detect them in sequence analysis.  However, there were many different sequencing methods that we had to consider. One of these is the single molecule real time sequencing  that for instance is offered by pacific biosciences. For this purpose, we invited representatives of the company to introduce the method as well  as data analysis patterns to us. The 5th of September, 2017, at 5pm,  Mr. Cong Luan Nguyen as well as Mr. David Stucki   gave a talk on “Single Molecule Real Time Sequencing with the Sequel System and an outlook in data analysis”. This talk was attended by  our team as well as many interested colleagues. It was concluded with interesting discussion   featuring different aspects of the technology. The talk highlighted why this system is good to be used with unnatural base pairs   but also showed advantages of a general usage at the CeBiTec.    Therefore, all in all, we gained some more insights into sequencing with the new technology and possible usages for our project.

TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Policy Practices#Human Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html,". The opinion and input from people not that closely involved in synthetic biology is important for researchers within this field of science. The evening started with drink and of course a presentation. We began with a broad introduction about DNA and the process of DNA, mRNA and finally the translation of proteins. After this brief introduction, we continued with telling the crowd about the science of synthetic biology and what the possibilities are when modifying DNA. Building on this information, we introduced the enthousiastic group to our project, COMBs. We explained that we created a bacteria with one extra protein that made the bacteria capable of detecting any molecule in its environment. Subsequently the future perspectives on how the bacteria could be used for several societal purposes were adressed.
After some time to process all this information, the crowd was divided into three smaller groups to discuss different application scenarios. Each of these scenarios was based on one of the applications described by the TU Eindhoven 2015 team. We asked the people to give their opinion and input about the use of GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) under the given circumstances of the application. We also challenged them to come up with different ways to overcome problems that could occur and for possible interventions that could be done to reduce the risks of using GMOs in the given scenarios.
We found that the opinions were divided when it came to the use of GMOs.
Discussing GMOs in the human body
The group considering the case where GMOs were used inside the human body was quite open minded about this specific idea. Nevertheless, several people emphasized that the bacteria should have a crucial role in treatment rather than detection alone if it is to be prescribed to a patient. It was opted that at least the advantages of using the GMO should outweigh the disadvantages. If a patient is in a bad condition and the use of the GMO could help in treating the disease/reducing pain, it could be accepted. However, they considered it unnecessarily risky to use GMOs solely for diagnosis.
In general, most people were not opposed to the idea of using living organisms in treatment and said that certain conditions should be met. First of all the device should be significantly tested and pass all the imposed examinations for all diagnostic methods. If necessary a kill-switch should be added. If these requirements are met, they would trust the opinion of the doctor subscribing them this specific therapy. Considering these requirements, the reference to the use of E-numbers and bacteria in food was easily made and discussed afterwards. After an interesting conversation about the application, they would leave the decision making to the patient whether or not to make use of GMOs.

From early childhood, I’ve always loved knowing exactly how everything works. Around the age of five, I realized that the questions that were the most interesting were the ones my parents didn’t know the answer to, so I gave up on my dream of being an artist-veterinarian-doctor and decided to become a mad scientist.
Now I am a senior studying neuroscience and cognitive science with a minor in computer science and am quite content. My interests include playing violin and reading books, but mostly brains.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," RFP as reporter gene in the presence of different concentrations of their corresponding ligand. The results for the vitamin B12 riboswitch are shown in Figure 5. As can be seen here, RFP production increases with increasing vitamin B12 concentration.
Figure 5. E. coli with the vitamin B12 riboswitch coupled to a RFP output was grown overnight in the presence of different concentration vitamin B12. (a) The fluorescence divided by OD over time is shown for different concentrations vitamin B12. (b) The relation between the fluorescence divided by OD after 12 hours incubations and different concentrations of vitamin B12.
The second regulatory system uses quorum sensing . A quorum sensing mechanism enables the bacteria to regulate their expression based on their density. We adopted the lux system originating from Vibrio fischeri and demonstrated this system’s functionality using a newly constructed GFP reporter (Figure 6). When cell density increases, the cells will sense each other’s autoinducers. This induces production of more autoinducers and GFP.
Figure 6. Fluorescence and absorbance data for E. coli quorum sensing strains. The continuous lines represent the fluorescence divided by OD600. The dashed lines represent the absorbance at 600 nm. The red and green lines represent quorum sensing strains, the purple strain has a reporter plasmid only. For both strains every value displayed is the average of at least three technical replicates, and for each the line displayed is one of three biological repeats of which all show a similar pattern.
When the cell density is high enough, the quorum sensing system ensures that more and more toxin is produced. The downside of this is that high toxin levels will likely kill the BeeT population. This is because the Cry toxin will lyse BeeT when produced in very high concentrations. It would be beneficial to divide the population of bacteria in toxin producers and non-toxin producers, to maintain a subpopulation of healthy bacteria. These cells will be able to initiate a new growth phase after death of the toxin-producing cells. This requires that cells respond to the stimuli at different times despite being genetically identical. To create such a system, we used two proteins: one encodes for the protein that inhibits the toxin expression, whereas the other promotes toxin expression. Depending on which protein is more present, toxin production is either on or off. Both proteins are encoded behind the same promoter. However, one of the proteins has a higher turnover rate. The trick is to find the “sweet spot” of the translation rates at which in some cells one protein takes the upper hand ,and"

This recombination results in the reverse of the sequence between attB and attP, changing the two sites to attL and attR at the meantime. This inversion can be reversible by appropriately controlling the conditional expression of integrase and an excisionase in Bxb1 named gp47 at certain ratio. We change start codon ATG to GTG for a appropriate expression quantity.
The second one contains a switch, two reporters, two RBS and terminators. At first, the plasmid expresses GFP, when gp35 is expressed, the switch will turn around and RFP on the other side of the plasmid is going to be expressed.

The second gene circuits we built for BNU.
Map of those two circuits are shown above. And figures below show us circuit 1 and 2 using Agarose Gel Electroporesis.
We performed experiment to see whether our circuits work. From the figure above, we can find out that when only circuit 2 is transformed (A), GFP is expressed, when both of the two circuits are transformed, the switch turns and RFP is expressed.

Calibration of fluid flow velocity
To visualize the flow profile, rainbow beads (SPHEROTM Rainbow Calibration Particles, Cat No. RCP-60-5, Lot No. AB01, diameter: 6um [1] ) were dissolved in the cell culture medium, which contained some dead cells. A series of pumped flow rate(5μl/min, 15μl/min, and 45μl/min) were applied to generate a steady fluid flow. The length of the streakline (shown as a gray line in picture) represents the total traveling distance of the beads during the exposure time of 100ms . Fig. 1 shows a typical image of a bead trace(fastest microfluidics channel with the flow rate of 5ul/min). To minimize hydraulic effects of the PDMS walls, the pictures were taken from the midplane of the channel providing the maximum flow velocity. Note that the traveling direction of the beads was left. Each streak was measured separately, and the average length of all streaks in one particular channel divides the exposure time was regarded as the maximum flow velocity of this channel. [2]
Fig.1 Bead Trace in The Fastest Microfluidics Channel with The Flow Rate of 5ul/min
Experiment
To minimize the error, we took pictures on fast microfluidics channel when pumped flow rate was 5μl/min; on mid microfluidics channel when pumped flow rate was 15μl/min; on slow microfluidics channel when pumped flow rate was 45μl/min, considering that fluid flow velocity is proportional to pumped flow rate.

Introduction
In our project, we eliminate algal bloom by designing E. coli to secrete proteins that can lyse the cyanobacteria. To make our project feasible in future applications, we have to find ways to enhance the killing effect. As our model indicates, binding our E. coli to the cyanobacteria can help us achieve this goal. So we searched for proteins that can bind to the targeted M. aeruginosa cells and we chose to work with microvirin (MVN), a mannan binding lectin in Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806, since of its high specificity to the cyanobacteria and its availability to our E. coli. Microvirin is a protein consisting of 108 amino acid residues and it has one mannan binding site which can bind to the LPS of the M. aeruginosa cells [1]. In our project, MVN was displayed on the surface of E. coli cells using a kind of truncated INP (INPNC). By this way, we could bind our E. coli to M. aeruginosa and thus help us increase the overall killing effect.
However, cyanobacteria are usually floating in the surface water due to its gas vesicles and colony formation in the field. So we also equipped our cells with gas vesicles to deal with the problem that E. coli cells mostly sink to the bottom when put into water. This will increase the opportunity for an E. coli cell to approach a cyanobacteria cell and enhance the killing effect too.
Design
To make our genetically engineered E. coli bind to Microcystis aeruginosa, we used a kind of truncated Ice Nucleation Protein (INPNC) to display microvirin (MVN) on the surface of our E. coli. We also used GFP as a reporter to make the binding effect ""visible"".
INPNC is a kind of modified INP with truncation of the entire internal repeating domain. We chose to work with INPNC because it has been reported to be an excellent surface display system used in E"

Another approach will be to freeze dry the extracted protein and rehydrate it in a extremely small amount of water. This approach could run into issues because it has been documented (http://www.pharmtech.com/freeze-drying-protein-formulations) that in the process of freeze drying proteins that have been buffered in a phosphate salt solution, pH changes can occur to damage the proteins. As a result, only a small amount of the extracted protein will be freeze dried to ensure that this isn't a problem for our protein.

Additional tests on the cellulose binding domain on the fusion protein will be conducted next week. According to  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10962023, the paper from which the sequence for the cellulose binding domain obtained from the iGEM registry originally came from, the cellulose binding domain has stronger binding capabilities when they incubated proteins and cellulose together overnight at 4 °C in 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.0 containing 10 mM CaCl2. After 6 days, they saw that the cellulose was permanently bound to their cellulose binding domains. This will be attempted next week to ensure that the protein is properly bound.
●
Further tests on the UV resistance and pH sensitivity of the AE blue-CBD fusion protein will also be conducted next week.
●
20 uL of the concentrated AE blue-CBD protein was placed in a PCR tube and heated for 5 minutes at 75 °C then for 5 minutes at 80 °C. While no color change was seen at the 75 °C heat treatment in the thermal cycler, the 80 °C treatment turned the protein green.

After being at 75 °C for five minutes (note there are now bubbles in the tube because I turned the tube on its cap in order to try to take a picture similar to those taken on previous days this week, but the protein was too dilute and did not remain at the bottom like the cell lysate does, resulting in the formation of bubbles--there was no observable color change.)

Restriction Enzyme Digestion for Verification
After the PCR mutation we have to do a restriction enzyme digestion to test whether the mutation is successful. The reaction system is as follows:
1.  Prepare the control reaction as indicated below:
Total: 10μl
+ 0.5μl of Pst I restriction enzyme
+ 1μl of 10XH buffer
+ 1μl of plasmid DNA
+ 7.5μl of ddH2O

+ 1.0μl of 0.1% BSA
+ 6.5μl of ddH2O
After the reaction, do an electrophoresis to see the 2k bp cyclic plasmid DNA change into linear. The process is as follows:
3. Prepare electrophoresis gel by adding 0.6g agarose to 60ml TAE (1% solution,1X,diluted from 50X TAE). Pour on conical flask and cover the Conical flask sealing surface with silver paper to avoid the loss of water vapor. Place in the microwave and microwave on middle for 1 minute at a time, pulling it out and swirling until solution is homogeneous again, then repeating (BE CAREFUL to watch the solution closely when swirling–it superheats and can boil over and cause severe burns). Continue until solution is seen clear and homogeneous with no exsistence of solid.Add 3 μl of ("

In the last step, they experienced the outcome of their endeavours by seeing or smelling the phenotype that they selected for in step one.
Soon after the festival doors opened at 8 p.m., the first group of visitors entered our lab. We took them along on their own synbio trip. Although somewhat uneasy at first, we soon got a hang of how to engage people, spark their interest and make them aware of what they were doing.  Throughout the evening, our lab has not lacked attention. Our team was giving tours constantly and it was not unusual for visitors to stand in line because our entire team was occupied.
Idea box
Over the course of the evening many people left video messages in the idea box, and they all seemed to have a great time while doing it. Unfortunately, we haven’t analyzed the results just yet.
The Poster Game
Unfortunately, the overwhelming attention we got for the lab tour meant that we had no time (or need) to walk around with posters and try to spark peoples interest with them. Because of this, the whole poster game never worked out as planned. However, we did hang A0 sized versions of our posters (attached below, partly in Dutch) on the wall outside our improvised laboratory. Throughout the night, they attracted a lot of attention from the crowd. Apparently, the concepts of synthetic biology and its use as a solution to the world’s problems appeal to a wide audience. We were very happy to observe this.
Communication Science
Unfortunately, it will take Paulien a lot longer to analyze all the data we provided her with and write a solid report about it than we had time to wait. However, she did provide us with a first impression . She also said she had a great time observing us and she is very happy with the resulting data.
Conclusion
The attention and enthusiasm that we encountered amongst the public exceeded all expectations. Although this overwhelming attention somewhat hindered our ambition to address the festival visitors outside our own lab, it also showed that this wasn’t really required. Overall, we regard our participation in this festival as a great success!  What’s more: The same is true for the teams that visited the other festivals!
Attached below are the ‘synthetic biology posters’ that we made. To appeal to a wide audience, we tried to make them as diverse as possible in both style, level of detail and language.

We                             reflect on                             whether the concentration of DMOAP in the experiment has an interference effect on the                             experimental results. Since DMOAP plays a role in inducing the vertical alignment of liquid                             crystals in the experiment, the reason for the analysis may be that DMOAP leads to the                             failure                             to obtain ideal experimental results. So we chose 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8% DMOAP                             concentration,                             and the antibody concentration was still 500 ng/mL. The DMOAP concentration was different,                             and                             the number of bright spots in the parallel light image was different (Fig. 4). From 0.8% to                             0.2%                             concentration, the main body of the image is black, but the number of bright spots is                             significantly increased. The number of bright spots is much higher at 0.2%; the number of                             bright                             spots on the image is less at 0.8%, which is equivalent to the previous 1%                             concentration.

Since the experimental results are not ideal, we consider re-selecting the experimental                             protocol.                             After consulting the literature and discussing with the professional researchers in the                             field,                             we decided to use the competition method. The following is the experimental plan.

Production
To evaluate an ideal hydrogel, various compositions were tested, like pure chitosan or chitosan in combination with agarose, agar or alginate. The commercially available high-molecular weight chitosan was provided by Sigma-Aldrich (Munich, Germany). Due to their compounds, the hydrogels we wanted to create are not toxic, biodegradable, biocompatible, while at the same time being low-cost and simple manufacturing processes. They are easy to produce in different shapes and thicknesses. While being flexible they will not dissolve or disintegrate, which makes it comfortable for patients to wear. In addition to that, it is easy to manufacture, handle and use on patients.  We were focused on working with basic laboratory equipment. For the preparation of chitosan hydrogels, an acidic environment is usually required to dissolve chitosan. Thus, the pH-level of our hydrogels are easy to regulate. We manufactured our chitosan containing hydrogel in aqueous acetic acid.
A long time of continuous mechanical stirring (6 h) is required to dissolve the chitosan in the acetic acid-deionized water solution. Under continuous pH measurement it needs mechanical stirring for 12 h. This solution needs to rest for at least 12 h for further processing.

The alginate/quercetin solution was poured into a mold and then liquid-frozen. The 2.2 % chitosan solution was then poured onto it and streaked out to the certain thickness, covered with the alginate/quercetin solution and placed into the 37 °C incubator for 24 h.
After the solidification process the arisen solid hydrogel was rinsed with ultrapure water.

Introduction
The use of Mighty Coli in the society does not raise too many questions: genetically modified microorganisms (GMM) are already used daily (and safely) in the pharmaceutical industry.
However we realized that few people were aware of it, and still mingled GMM with genetically modified crops, which have a terrible reputation in western Europe. Although, Mighty Coli would be welcomed in the industry, we feared that if for some reason we had to ask the authorization of the public to use it, we would only face fear, incomprehension, and eventually refusal. Since the use of synthetic organisms is an important ethical and societal issue, we think that the general public should be included in the debate. But we also think that it should be properly informed about the nature of synthetic organisms and the way they are used. Hence, we decided to organize popularization events on the subject.
Popularization events
After discussion within the team and with our friends and families, we decided that the themes of our popularization events would be synthetic biology, the use of GMMs in research and industry (and the role that Mighty Coli could play in it), and the means and perspectives of genetic manipulations.
We settled on a kind of popularization event that would bring us a maximal visibility, but that would also allow us to interact"

Safety Assistance From Advisors
Figure 2. Biowaste dispose process
Talking to safety advisors and professors asking for more practical help were designed as a part of our lab safety education. Professor Yuan took us into his lab and introduced operating cautions about some equipments. For instance, we need to clean our hands before using super clean bench in order to avoid contamination from environment. Besides, detail operations, such as how to use a spectrophotometer or running gels are acquired from senior students.
We also have regular safety checking from advisors. All of our attempts are trying not only to guarantee our safety, but also to make everyone safe.
Researcher Safety
Organisms used in our project belong to category level 1, which are unlikely to cause human or animal disease. Although none of organisms is harmful, still, all of our team members need to be trained and tested strictly before experiments based on the Biosafety Manual. Regular safety precautions such as wearing gloves, glasses and a lab coat to protect us are implemented. Besides, we envisioned that the engineered bacteria would be equipped with safety system aiming to protect human’s health
Figure 3. Super clean bench cleaning process.
Public and Environment Safety
With all of our attempts to cut off the interactions between engineered colony and natural species together with the fact that all of bacteria we used are biosafety level 1, therefore, our project unlikely to have a remarkable influence on the public environment safety. In case any laboratorial bacteria would escape into outer environment, all infectious materials or bacteria  like our engineered E.coli, Bacillus subtilis and Shewanella oneidensis should be decontaminated, autoclaved or incinerated within the laboratory.

In order to provide further helps for future iGEM team, we designed a diagram about how to implement universal safety control during their project. As a common strategy, future teams can design their own Safety Control Diagram via adding their favorable features based on this. For example, this year, safety training was used along with safety test and this feature gave us a deeper impression on the safety awareness. We hope that this design will evoke public concern of biosafety and thus make the world better.

Takeaways
Using the plethora of information we received from this interview series, QGEM has made several considerations on how we would implement our project into the real world as scalable, effective, and safe method of oil spill bioremediation. Several factors need to be taken into consideration, which include the design of an appropriate bioreactor to ensure a controlled growth environment for our biofilm, safety precautions to ensure the prevention of environmental contamination, ways of optimizing hydrocarbon exposure for M. hydrocarbonoclasticu, and methods we can use to assess the functionality of our biofilm.
Some considerations for our bioreactor design include:
Providing the optimal growth temperature, pH, and nutrient level to support the growth of both E. coli and M. hydrocarbonoclasticus
Using suitable material to build our bioreactor to avoid environment-related damage (M. hydrocarbonoclasticus may prefer halophilic conditions; this would mean avoiding the use of metals)
Balancing the amount of control vs cost for bioreactor design
Other design additions that could be made to our biofilm to ensure optimal functionality include:
Addition of a quorum sensing system to regulate the expression of CsgA-AFP vs CsgA-SpyTag (after reaching a certain population density, allows for increased binding of M. hydrocarbonoclasticus for increased oil degradation)
Increasing the presence/secretion of solutes to prevent cell desiccation if biofilm is growing in a cold environment
Applying oil dispersants to break down oil slick into smaller micelles, making oil droplets more accessible to biofilm bacteria by increasing surface area
To test our biofilm and ensure that a reduction in petroleum compounds occurs, we could:
Use CYP1A cytochrome P450 expression and activity as a biomarker to test for poly-aromatic hydrocarbon toxicity in marine organisms with and without treatment using our biofilm"

Before we obtain the result of the simulations, we are required to set the values of biological parameters and set the initial state of the system. That, is another story…
2.4 Setting the Parameters and Initial States
How do we acquire the parameters we need to simulate and validate our model? Estimating all the parameters based on our experimental results is not realistic, due to the large number of parameters"

How Our System Works
All of the parts that we created this summer are designed to be fusion proteins with Aga2, a yeast protein involved in mating. Aga2 disulfide bonds with Aga1, a membrane embedded protein, such that anything fused to Aga2 is displayed on the surface of the cell.
Interaction of Aga1 with Aga2-fused protein of interest leads to Yeast Cell Surface Display
By displaying a protein that would have strong interactions with itself (or another protein), we wanted to be able to control whether or not two cells would adhere or interact with one another. An example of how two proteins would lead to cell-cell interactions is shown below:
Data For Our Favorite New Parts
Cadherin Parts Registry - Extracellular Domain of E-Cadherin BBa_K644000: when expressed on the surface of yeast cells, the extracellular domain of E-cadherin caused the yeast cells to stick together and form large clumps, visible by microscopy. The addition of calcium to the media caused larger clumps to form and these could be disrupted with the addition of EDTA.
Hwp1 Parts Registry - Hwp1 BBa_K644001: when expressed on the surface of yeast, Hwp1 caused the cells to stick together in small biofilm0like formations similar to those made by C. albicans
Data For Pre-Existing Parts
Experience - Mgfp-5 - Mussel Foot Protein Mgfp-5 BBa_K197018 (Berkeley iGEM 2009): when expressed on the surface of yeast cells, mgfp5 caused the cells to stick together and form small clumps.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Results_-_-_TEXT.html," to the samples prepared in LB. For the samples prepared in LB, the boiling was long enough to break open the cells. This indicates that the boiling method can be used for gram-positive bacteria in LB. For milk on the other hand, 10 minutes in boiling water was not sufficient. We dove into literature again and found out that milk interferes with DNA isolation methods. We did not experience this when we boiled gram-negative bacteria in milk. However, gram-positive bacteria have a thick peptidoglycan layer in the cell wall, making it harder to lyse the cells. Therefore, for future experiments, we would recommend to boil for at least 15 minutes and immediately put samples on ice for 15 minutes before centrifuging as described by Ribeiro Junior et al. 2016 . Another possible method was explained by Parayre et al. 2009 , which involves the resuspension of the pellet in lysis buffer and the consecutive incubation with proteinase K. This means however, that an extra hour of incubation time needs to be considered and extra pipetting steps.
Developing an inexpensive and user-friendly centrifuge
For the DNA isolation, a centrifuge step is required to spin down the cell debris. We tried to build a centrifuge out of a hard drive, by making it spin on its own. Additionally, we made a hand-powered centrifuge out of a string and around-shaped hard plastic. The hard drive has a default speed which cannot easily be overridden, so we wanted to find out whether the default speed exceeded our ideal speed. For this simple speed test, we broke open the hard drive and marked a certain part of the disk. We filmed the spinning and analysed the video with VLC media player. We subtracted the frame rate (which was 24 Hz) and tried to determine in how many frames the mark would make one round.
Unfortunately the hard drive spun so fast that the mark already made a whole round in one frame. This means that the hard drive would spin with a speed of at least 24 Hz $\times$ 60 = 1440 rpm, exceeding our ideal speed of 1000 rpm. To be able to control the speed of the hard drive, we need a sensor less brushless motor driver (ESC) to drive the special motor of the hard drive and control this speed with an Arduino. We decided to discard this idea and we continued with our hand-driven centrifuge.
We started with a preliminary test, to check whether or not we could spin down our suspension of cells by using our centrifuge. By centrifuging for less than"

p68 was digested with AsiSI for 2 hours and afterwards nicked with Nb.BstI for 1 hour. The vector and each of the promoters were then mixed in a USER reaction. Prior to transformation of A. nidulans the plasmids were cut with NotI to obtain a linearized DNA fragment to make HR possible and thereby increase transformation efficiency. The nkuAΔ transformants containing PalcA::lacZ and the nkuAΔ transformants containing DMKP-P6::lacZ will be referred to as nkuAΔ-IS1::PalcA::lacZ::TtrpC::argB and nkuAΔ-IS1::DMKP-P6::lacZ::TtrpC::argB, respectively.
Qualitative analysis
First, the promoters were evaluated qualitatively by inoculating nkuAΔ-IS1::PalcA::lacZ::TtrpC::argB and nkuAΔ-IS1::DMKP-P6::lacZ::TtrpC::argB onto minimal media plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-D-galactoside (X-gal). A functional promoter allows the expression of the lacZ gene and thereby production of β-galactosidase, which  results in blue colonies on X-gal plates.  The blue color is produced because β-galactosidase cleaves X-gal into 5- bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl (blue) and D-galactose. Thus, blue colonies means that the transcription of the lacZ gene has occurred. It should be noted that the X-gal plates used for the PalcA transformants contained glycerol as carbon source and ethanol and threonine to induce the PalcA promoter.
The plates contain two positive controls that express lacZ from the constitutive promoters PgpdA with two different lengths, PgpdA 0.5kb and PgpdA 1.0kb (nkuAΔ-IS1::PgpdA 0.5kb::lacZ::TtrpC::argB and nkuAΔ-IS1::PgpdA 1.0kb::lacZ::TtrpC::argB) that are used"
Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," very important that we design it not only to be extremely easy and quick to use, but also so that it will be completely safe for the person using it as well as the environment it will be used in. We incorporated safety into our design in a number of ways. First of all, we decided to use an in-vitro system. Although we are engineering our bacteria to contain our genes of interest, we are using purified proteins from the bacteria in our actual test. This not only allows us to make use of a small, test strip that is able to be stored for long periods of time, but it ensures that our genetically modified bacteria will not be released into the environment no matter what happens to the strip system. This will allow for easier disposal of the strips as well as increased safety for the user.
Figure 2. Design of test strip for our system
Our next safety concern was surrounding the functionality of the prototype. Although we would not be using any actual bacteria in it, it was important to have something in the strip that would allow for a positive control, similar to what we see for pregnancy tests. In that system, one blue line appears in the test window in order to tell you that the test is working as it is supposed to, a sort of 'positive control' for the flow of the liquid and for the reagents. In order for our system to achieve similar reliability, we need the same thing. For our strip, the best way to ensure that our test is working the way we expect it to would be to have an actual positive control. In our system this would obviously need to be the shiga toxin gene, in order to verify in each test that our TALEs are binding as expected. Now this poses a problem for us. Not only is this not something that we could amplify from the genome ourselves or get synthesized by a company, but it is not something that we would really want to drench our strips in to sell to users. As such, we needed to find a safe way to do this. So we went and consulted with Dr. Glen Armstrong, a researcher at the University of Calgary who studies pathogenic E. coli.
Dr. Armstong had a number of suggestions for us in terms of refining our TALE binding sequences. He advised us to consider looking for multiple strains of E. coli, essentially creating a multiplexed system. To that end, he helped us to restructure our system to incorporate two different target sequences, as we had initially planned on using only one target sequence for the TALEs. This would allow us to detect a greater breadth in the"

Note
In order to be considered for the Best Model award , you must fill out this page.
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.
