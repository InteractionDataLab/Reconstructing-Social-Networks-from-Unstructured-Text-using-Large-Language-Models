Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified"

MODELLING
        In our project, we have constructed a series of SRRz based heavy metal ion detectors. The gene circuits can be summarized as one circuit shown in the picture.
1.Heavy metal ion detection part[1,4,5]
        In the center is a bidirectional promoter Pmer , which can be regulated by MerR homodimer and metal-combined MerR homodimer.
        Under normal condition, MerR dimer binds with Pmer and recruits RNA Polymerase for the left part to transcript. While the right part, because of the wrong span between -10 box and -35 box which cause them located at different sides of DNA helix, is silent.
        But when metal ion binds to MerR dimer, things come different. MerR dimer changes the configuration of DNA, repressing the transcription of the left part and recruiting RNA Polymerase for transcription of the right part.
        On the left side of Pmer, we have put a MerR coding sequence here, which can be expressed constitutively when there is no metal ion. For this part, the model is shown in the flow chart.
        Then on the left side is the SRRz lysis gene, which is the responding module in our system. This part is a competitor for Pmer against the former part. The flow chart describes the regulation of MerR dimer and metal and the expression of SRRz without the former part.
        Up to now, the metal ion detection and reporter protein expression part is done. The whole process is shown in the following figure. The competition between two directions is obvious.
2.Cell lysis part[2-3]
        In this part, we constructed our model by hypothesizing that the permeability of cells can be estimated by degradation rate of compound composing the cellular membrane and cell wall. Besides, there should be a cellular membrane repairing mechanism that is in proportion to the degradation rate. Therefore, we built up the following model to describe the process.
3.Reporting part
        Because cell lysis process usually happens extremely fast, we set a threshold that when the"

Advisors
Name: Medina Cuellar Raul Guillermo
Height: I'm tall; Weight: It's a secret! Belongs to the tetp group.
This is the fourth year Raul involves in iGEM, yet his second year as an advisor. Being the most experienced advisor, he contributes most of his spare time to assisting our project works despite his heavy burden from his final year project. He is very popular in the sense that we always flock to him whenever we get our results failed. Besides, He is the most noticeable person in the lab, his distinct scent of cologne always catches your nerves at the very first moment he walks in.
Name: Eric Ming Fung Cheung
Height: I'm tall; Weight: It's a secret! Belongs to the tetp group.
The lab psychopath. Eric is the team leader of last year’s iGEM team and a first-time advisor this year. He would always question us on our interpretation of our lab results, regardless of if they are positive or not, but that’s just because he wants us to think critically. He may seem difficult to get along with at first due to his constant poker face. However, he does show a quirky side once in a (long) while. His advice is generally helpful and often helps add onto our knowledge. He is crazy in the way that he will only have lunch if his experiments fail, what a lab maniac!

Debrecen-Hungary,2010,Team:Debrecen-Hungary#project_-_-_TEXT.html," best viewed as transcription factors which can be activated by extracellular cues, are unique in their ability to allow direct remote PoPs titration (both activation and repression). These receptor classes bears high homology to each other throughout the animal kingdom and are modular into distinct domains. All of these features attracted our attention to find a way to incorporate these tools in the parts registry, and characterize them in standardized methods.
Many nuclear receptors, are among the primary targets of drug discovery because of their diverse biological actions. Nuclear receptors bear high homology to each other and are modular into distinct domains: N-terminal regulatory domain, DNA-binding domain (DBD), a Hinge region, Ligand binding domain (LBD) and a C-terminal domain. The LBD (click to find out more about LBD's) is the segment of the receptor which changes its conformation upon lipophilic ligand binding; this also causes the exposure of a powerful transcriptional activation domain (which attracts the transcriptional machinery). This was our segment of interest since it links ligand binding with transcriptional activity.
Our team has generated a library of ligand binding domains for the rational construction of synthetic titrateable transcription factors.  In our model hybrid receptor, this LBD was fused to a Gal4 DNA binding domain.  The sequence to which Gal4 binds is CGG-N11-CCG, where N can be any base. Although Gal4 is a yeast protein not normally present in other organisms it has been shown to work as a transcription factor in a variety of organisms such as Drosophila, and human cells, highlighting that the same mechanisms for gene expression have been conserved over the course of evolution.
The examination of these chimeric receptors was through a version of the two hybrid assay (click to find out more about the two hybrid assay). For a more detailed description of our experimental system, please visit our ""Minimals"" page.
Results
First we had to generate expression vectors that can be used in mammalian expression systems. The cloning work of Team Debrecen-Hungary resulted 18 basic parts in pSB1C3 and 13 composite parts in pSB1C3 or pSB1A3. All of them have been tested by restriction enzyme analysis and by sequencing. Furthermore, some basic and fused parts have been ligated into pCDNA3.1 containing a specific adaptor by which RFC-25 compatible parts can be inserted into this expression vector. pCDNA3.1 results constitutive expression of the inserted part in the cells so the investigated part can be tested at functional level.

“Creating a strain that is optimized for efficient production of high quality protein material is of high value for the drug discovery process.”
this was the view of Dr. Serghei Glinca, the Chief Executive Officer of CrystalsFirst, a company that is specialized on protein-crystal based applications in drug discovery. Click here to learn more about our Integrated Human Practices project. The functionality of the T7 system in V. natriegens was already demonstrated and additionally it is pointed, that V. natriegens yields higher amounts of soluble protein than E. coli (Weinstock, Hesek et al.,2016) .
But how is the commonly used T7 system working?
The T7 system
The system is based on the bacteriophage T7 RNA Polymerase, that shows a very high activity and synthesizes RNA at a rate several times that of E. coli. Besides, it is highly selective for its own promoter. Combined with the ability to inhibit selectively the host RNA polymerase with rifampicin (Hartmann et al., 1967) , it allows the exclusive expression of genes under the control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter (Tabor S., 1985) . Due to these advantages, the gene of the T7 RNA Polymerase was integrated into the E. coli BL21 genome and is controlled by a lacUV5 promoter (Moffatt et al, 1986) , (Jun Lee et al., 2015) . The gene of the desired protein is introduced into the cell using a vector with a T7 promoter (e.g. pET vector, commercialized by Novagen). Incubating the cells with IPTG leads to the expression of the T7 RNA Polymerase. Finally, the Polymerase recognizes the T7 promoter and the expression of the desired protein is enforced (Figure 1) (Steitz et al., 1999) . To maximize the produced protein amount, proteases like Lon or OmpT can be knocked-out (Dunn et al., 1988) .
Figure 1:The T7 expression system. Here the function of the T7 expression system is described. IPTG is inducing the expression of T7 RNA Polymerase that is encoded on the bacterial genome. The T7 RNA Polymerase is recognizing the T7 promoter on the plasmid and the expression of the desired protein begins.
The Lon protease
The Lon protease derives its name from the phenotype of E. coli lon gene mutants"

Furthermore, 100% of respondents indicated they would use a database like this to browse and download protocols, and over 85% indicated they would upload and maintain their own protocols if such a site existed ( click here for a complete list of results ). With these data and interest in hand, we set out to build ProtoCat.
Aims
The aims of this project were threefold:
To start an iGEM software team at the University of Michigan and populate it with a diverse population of students.
To construct useful software for laboratory scientists. We designed the protocol database project based on our own and other's frustrations in identifying reliable and effective scientific protocols.
To use our basic project idea to survey a wide range of scientific students and professionals to determine exactly what the best iteration of this project would do and adapt our goals as such.
Methods
Our project is based on Django, a free, open-source web framework, written in Python. Django allows us to create a simple, database-driven website which:
• can be hosted on any server (or locally).
• is modular and can be molded to specific individual needs.
• is built on a well-documented , easy to learn framework.
Our web application can be downloaded from Github and easily installed on any computer with Django/Python. Our implementation uses an embedded SQLite database, although a number of databases can be used.
Success
- Formed a brand new iGEM team! On top of that, we all learned new languages for this :)
- Reached out to and engaged the scientific community to create awareness for the problem and prioritize the development of a solution.
- Created ProtoCat, a functional registry for laboratory procedures.
Future Directions
- Variable protocols with integrated calculators: Our next step is to allow users to create calculator functions for specific tasks, and embed them with the protocol.
- vendor information: allow direct linking to reagents, materials, etc. from vendors.
- in-app purchasing: allow users to directly purchase reagents, materials, etc. that are included in the protocol, through third-party vendors.
- protocol timer
-As far as the team goes, we plan to reach out to more people next year; as fun as this smaller group was, we want to ensure that we have a greater variety of skillsets and thought processes to contribute to the best project possible

Yuxian Zhang, Longjing Pan, Jianzhe Yang were mainly responsible for human practices and Jianzhe Yang, Changyu Li, Yinsong Xu, Xiang Zhou and Qi Wang also make contribution to it. They had made the following contributions ：
Support project：
Longjing Pan and Yuxian Zhang carried out a variety of questionnaires to survey the current situation of treating straw and citizen’s attitude toward clean energy. To make our project more practical, they interact with expert in Biogas Institute of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs to learn more information about agricultural waste and bioenergy. They also interviewed synthetic biology expert, Dr. Junbiao Dai to optimize our pathway.
Public Engagement：
Yuxian Zhang and Changyu Li organized a large event of Education of Public Engagement called “Gene go”, interacting with more than 300 families in Sichuan Science and Technology Museum. They are also making effort in high school students, inspiring their interest in synthetic biology. There are other team members designed some product such as “Gene Card” online programed by Xiang Zhou and Qi Wang, Crazy Lab designed by Yinsong Xu and Plasmid Rubik made by Longjing Pan. Collaboration and meet-up is in the charge of Yuxian Zhang and Jianzhe Yang to combine universities to solve the problems that was hardly solved by themselves.
 Modeling
Zijian Wu was mainly responsible for modeling. In order to maximize the production of butanol and hydrogen, it is necessary to optimize the fermentation of butanol and hydrogen. He first screened out the significant influence factors of the fermentation reaction. Next, he used response surface methodology to establish a functional relationship between the product and the significant influence factor. He used Box-Behnken to design test points to get the data he needed. He finally found the optimum conditions for the fermentation reaction.

This means, that the plasmids for both our expression system and the tRNA/synthetase-pair have the same origin of replication and therefore are competing against each other in terms of which of them will be replicated. Therefore, we weren’t able to use the BioBrick BBa_K1416000 for our experiments.
Fortunately, we were able to contact members of the former iGEM team Texas, Austin from 2014 who originally created the part BBa_K1416000. They sent us the ONBY-tRNA/synthetase pair in a backbone that carries a gentamicin resistance and is replicated with an ori that is not part of the same incompatibility group as the ori of pSB1C3.
Figure 1: Schematic representation of the recieved tRNA/synthetase pair in its backbone. Graphic obtained through iGEM team Texas, Austin 2014.
This allowed us to use the ONBY-tRNA/synthetase pair that is described as BBa_K1416000 without the need of cloning it into a different backbone.
Moreover, the experiments to test the incorporation efficiency of the ONBY-tRNA/synthetase pair showed that this pair is also able to incorporate DMNB-serine to a certain degree. This is why we decided to try to incorporate DMNBS in our SDM 4-modified enzyme with this tRNA/synthetase pair.
Day 1
We received the ONBY-tRNA/synthetase pair from team Texas, Austin 2014 as dried DNA on filter paper. At first, we cut the marked region from the filter paper, put it in a 1.5ml tube and immersed it in 100µl Tris-HCl pH 8.0. After incubation for 10 minutes, we used 2µl for a transformation in E. coli BL21 and in parallel transformed the usual controls.

Convertion Module
Convertion module is constructed to create an E.coli that able to survive the present of toxic agent, such as ethylene glycol that being introduce in the system. The module consist of two enzymes, glycoaldehyde reductase and glycoaldehyde dehydrogenase. The enzymes are responsible in metabolising ethylene glycol in E.coli strain BL21 (DE3). The first mentioned enzyme is responsible to catalyse convertion reaction of ethylene glycol to glycoaldehyde while the second one is responsible to catalyse the reaction of glycoaldehyde to glycolate. This intermediate will proceed the next step of metabolic pathway of E.coli and finally ends up on TCA cycle. This process will create an energy (ATP) that can be used by bacteria as carbon source, thus assuring us that ethylene glycol will not pollute the environment.

Paris_Saclay,2014,Team:Paris Saclay#Project#Lemon Scent_-_-_TEXT.html," To copy the plants' strategy, we chose to add the MEV pathway to our engineered E. coli in order to produce higher quantity of GPP and thereby obtain a stronger lemon smell. The figure below is a scheme of the MEV pathway:
To tackle the problem of the low GPP bioavailability in E. coli, the Taek Soon Lee’s research group designed and constructed a plasmid with a complete biosynthetic mevalonate pathway for the production of GPP [3]. Then they expressed the Abies grandis (S)-limonene synthase (LS) gene in the same plasmid, called pJBEI6409. With this construction, they were able to produce 400 mg/L of (S)-limonene.
We decided to use their construction for the production of (R)-limonene, β-pinene and citral in E. coli. We thank the team of Taek Soon Lee for the gift of the pJBEI6409 plasmid.
Principle of our Constructions
For our project, we need to replace the (S)-limonene synthase (LS) gene by the (R)-limonene synthase gene (BBa_K762100), the β-pinene synthase gene (BBa_K517003) and the geraniol synthase (GES)- cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) genes.
However, pJBEI6409 was constructed using a 3A assembly method, meaning that no restriction sites flanking the LS gene exist. We therefore decided to replace the (S)-LS gene by an apramycin resistance cassette surrounded by PacI and SalI restriction sites using double homologous recombination. Then, the resulting plasmid (pPS1) will be used to clone various genes (limonene synthase – β-pinene synthase – geraniol synthase and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase).
Construction of pPS1
Replacement of the LS gene by an apramycin cassette
The first step of this sub-project is to replace the (S)-limonene synthase (LS) gene by an apramycin-resistant cassette. This cassette is flanked by PacI and SalI restriction sites to make easy the cloning of the different genes.
The (S)-LS starting gene is replaced by the apramycin cassette by PCR targeting.
PCR amplification of the apramycin cassette with oligonucleotides iPS70 and iPS71 that contain the restriction sites PacI and SalI."
UCSD_Software,2014,Team:UCSD Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," never happen more than O(m*V) times, which is the bound for the number of unique species in the system. For the following step, the search for species activating all operons on this increment will have a time complexity of O(m), but it will never happen more than O(V) times, which is the bound for the number of unique operons in the system. Therefore, for a full iteration of these two steps in the traceback algorithm, it will be bounded by the time complexity of O(V^2*mV + m*V). This traceback step will happen until the depth of the entire path generated from the LSAS step has been explored, which is bound by O(V). Thus, the time complexity for the traceback of a single path is O(mV^4+mV^2). Then complexity of the path generation is added for a complexity of O(mV^4+mV2+V^2). Now consider that this path generation and traceback happens for every single activated transition by the input species, which gives O(m*(mV^4+mV^2+V^2))=>O(m^2*V^4).
Figure 3 - Operon representation of a simple circuit and a potential output from NLSAS search algorithm where species from multiple operons are required to activate the next operon. This path could not be captured by the LSAS algorithm because the incorporation of multiple species to activate one operon is not possible.
Figure 4 - Petri Net representation Figure 3 where multiple species nodes are required to activate one input transition. First two species nodes activate each of the three initial input transitions, which in turn activate three separate operons. The output of each operon is an output transition which points to a species node that contains all output species produced by that operon. The three species nodes in the center of the graph trigger the final input transition, triggering the final operon, and producing the final species node. This expansion would add an additional layer of complexity to the NLSAS algorithm that is unnecessary given the previously explained linearity of the operon nodes.

c = 60 µM
M = 150.13 g/mol
m = 1.8 x10-6 mol
m = c * V * M = 0.225 mg Arabinose to each culture.
Measure was canceled, because we had not important results. We had a permanent growth and had not added the Arabinose at the beginning.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," MLA and this can worsen our competitiveness. We consider this as a possible risk with major consequences.
Market related risks
There is always a probability that our product will not be accepted by a part of our possible customers. However, since we have done an extensive customer research, we consider this risk to be small.
An additional possible risk is that our product does make use of a genetically modified organism. The real risks of these organisms are considered to be small, but it is possible that the perception of the risk among the public is different. For example, negative media attention about the use of genetically modified organisms in our product could have a negative influence on the sales volume of our company. The consequences in that case are expected to be moderate. However, since our product is not a food and it is a part of a final larger product, it is considered to be unlikely that there will be negative attention. Furthermore, together with all the iGEM teams and many other companies and organizations we are working hard to improve the acceptation of synthetic biology among the public. This will help the acceptance of our product as well.
The risk of a (new) substitute is also a serious risk. For example, the general chemically synthesized MLAs could become cheaper and more attractive therefore. It is also possible that a totally new alternative will be developed in the future. Therefore it is important to keep investing in R&D in order to keep our product “up-to-date”. We do expect that it is possible that there will be new competitive substitutes for our product, but because of all these measures we expect that the consequences will be moderate for a longer period of time.
Finally, it is also possible that the total market changes. In an extreme situation this could for example result in no need of encapsulation layers any more or an extreme increase of efficiency of solar cells, which make our specific MLA encapsulation layer useless. This could be catastrophic for our company. Fortunately, we expect a radical change like this will be unlikely.
Product and operational related risks
There is a risk that we may not actually be able to deliver the product to the market within the resources (time, money) that we have available. Furthermore, there is always the risk that our product may not work exactly as well as promised or envisioned. It is for example possible that some technical challenges may be greater than initially assumed. We try to minimize the consequences of these risks by doing solid theoretical research and by building prototypes in an early stage. This will limit eventually the extra time that is required.
Unforeseen scale-up problems are also a risk that we have to take into account. For"

RNA Logic Control Gates & Recombinase

After a long period of development, the traditional logic gates in iGEM comes up with a series of limits, such as a usual plasmid that cannot hold a big system of its size, and when applied to another species, there are always lots of bugs, and the number of interaction between DNA and protein used as logic gate is not enough to allow us to build up a system big enough to imitate natural logic gates system.
Considering this condition, apocalyptoed by the interactions of proteins in eucells, like the G protein signal passageway, we come up with the idea that we can use items that are “of all the same” as elements in the logic passageways,for future of our project.
Prototype
As is well known, RNA is considered as the start of life. Also, there are reports about using programmed DNA strings as calculation elements to compute Tic-Tac-Toe game. Thus we came up with the idea that use nucleic acid as elements, being more specificly, we chose hammerhead ribozyme which tends to cut itself at special cleavage site when its activity center is of right secondary structure.
Fig.1 The structure of a sort of ribozyme.
Inspiration
The pattern of our project was from two elite works: the paper of Robert Pankovsky. From the first one we established the strategy of controling the activity of a ribozyme by a short RNA. After cleavage, the short RNA resulted from cleavage can also be used to modify another ribozyme. After calculation, the sequence is determined,and four basic types of gates(AND, OR, NO, YES) are formed, thus forming the basic pattern of our project. Another is the theory that if a ribozyme is assembled in front of a sequence that codes protein, the coding sequence can still work if there is a spacer. However, after cleavage, for the coding sequence lost the protection in front of it, it will be digested by nucleic acid exonuclease faster and the expression of"

I plan to continue on to pharmacy school next fall where I will truly miss being a part of such an amazing iGEM team. Outside of the lab I try to get lost in nature, hiking and bicycling.
My greatest achievement in life is having the same Meyers-Briggs Personality type as Michelle Obama.

I am a senior cell and molecular biology major with a minor in chemistry and this is my third and final year on our team! During this year’s project I assisted Jack with administrative duties as well as performing minor laboratory protocols as needed. I also helped build the presentations for our different events and presented at the “Let’s Talk about That: GMOs” event. After graduation I hope to go onto either a position in the pharmaceutical industry or work in a medical research laboratory. In my free time I enjoy watching Netflix, playing cello, and playing rousing games of ping pong against Troy.

Explain why you believe the part iself is not dangerous
Internal ribosome entry sites are widely used as a means to accomplish polycistronic expression in eukaryotes
Since it was partly engineered, the parts itself is not dangerous in a way that it is connected to Streptococcus pyogenes. The fusion product tag-catcher itself is not dangerous but this depends on the proteins tag/catcher are fused to
the part is based on the plasmid pGADT7 AD from Clontech, so the NLS is a commercially available and widely used. We therefore consider it not dangerous
Why do you need to use this organism/part? Is there an organism/part from a less dangerous Risk Group that would accomplish the same purpose?
Without IRES we would have to put a promotor in front of every protein we want to express which would make cloning of large constructs much more difficult. There are IRES elements found in cellular mRNAs (e.g. in Fibroblast growth factor) however, they are not as established in expression systems
Part is needed for posttranslational fusion of our effectors to membrane receptors. There is no part from a less dangerous risk group that would accomplish this purpose this well
Part is needed to target the nuclease of our killswitch into the nucleus of our moss. Without a localization signal, the killswitch would not work. The NLS from SV40 is used in almost all commercially available vector systems and has been in use for a long time which is why we chose it
Is the organism/part listed under the Australia Group guidelines, or otherwise restricted for transport?
No
Please describe the BioSafety Level of the lab in which the team works
The lab we work in has BioSafety Level 1 and we are not using organisms with a BSL level greater than 1
Toxicity of degradation products
None of the transgenic plants that we have created is able to produce a toxic substance. However, degradation products of hormones, antibiotics and other pollutants could be potentially toxic. Therefore, the reaction products will be monitored using LC/MS analysis. For example for EreB, the transformation products of erythromycin possess no endocrine and mutagenic properties [ endetech ]. In general, it is very difficult to find data on the toxicity of these degradation products.
Additionally, the substances used in bioaccumulation (Glutathion-S-transferase, Proteinphosphatase 1) are not harmful themselves, but moss that"

HP Overview
Silver
The value of foundational advance projects always lies in their application, whereas there's still a long way to go from lab experiments to fully functional products. For instance, it's the researchers' responsibility to consider the safety issues raised by the interaction between the application and the human society. Considering the possible application of our project, we decided to conduct an investigation on the perception of average customers held towards the biosafety issues on common biological enzyme preparation. Besides, we participated in a series of academic conferences, during which we exchanged our ideas with other participants and sought out for chances of collaboration.
Gold
The goal of our project is to develop the yeast surface display system. For this purpose, we've contacted a lot of experts, companies in related fields to acquire information on the prospects, potentials and weakness of this technique. Throughout these interviews and investigation, we've developed a profound understanding on the interaction between our project and the society, which in turn has enlightened the evolvement of our project.
Public Engagement
As an iGEM team rooted in the Chinese society, we consider it our duty to engage in propagating the brilliant idea of synthetic biology and iGEM to the rest of the community. To start with, we designed an investigation project to dig into the past developmental process and present stage of the Chinese iGEM community, and how its vivid atmosphere has affected the individuals in it. The focus of this investigation was fixed on the motivation and learning strategy of iGEMers. Meanwhile, we exploited the resources we had as a leading university in the area of education and teaching. We launched a four-week introductory course series in Beijing Bayi High School and three other high schools, hoping to inspire the kids there and sum up our experiences to improve the method on the education of synthetic biology. What's more, to spice up the user experience of our site, we created a user-friendly desktop assistant system as a compulsory part, which users can interact with and access the knowledge and information of our project and synthetic biology from. We believe that this cute desktop assistant will win over the hearts of our viewers and fulfill its mission of spreading the idea of synthetic biology.
Collaboration
Lab safety have been brought up as one of the major issues of consideration since the very beginning of our project. However,"
Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html," busy in the lab this week, we also kept the community outreach portion of our project in mind and began preparations for our next event; painting with fluorescent bacteria.
Week 9: June 23-27
We continued with the restriction digests of our integration vectors from last week, digesting the thrC, amyE, and sacA vectors with the ScaI enzyme. After running a gel, we luckily saw the proper bands in the right places. However, we also noticed a single band around the 800 bp range, and after contacting iGEM HQ, we concluded that it must have been the RFP generator. We decided to contact the LMU team to discuss our findings. Following the restriction digests, we proceeded to cut two of the vectors with BsaI since the ScaI enzyme cut out the bla gene.
Figure 1: ScaI was used to linearize the thrC, sac A and Amy E vectors. An unexpected 1000 bp product was present in all of the samples. Amresco 1000Kb ladder was used inorder to determine the size of the bands.
The team met one of it’s largest project goals this week, having finally transformed supercompetent B. subtilis with a plasmid we designed.. Unfortunately, our first set of transformations failed and we witnessed a “lawn” of bacteria on our plates. After reviewing various papers, we realized that our antibiotic plates only had a chloramphenicol concentration of 5mg/L, when the optimal concentration was actually 100mg/L (of?) and 5mg/L of chloramphenicol. We also suspected our antibiotics to be defective, but nonetheless decided to attempt a second set of transformations on 30mg/L chloramphenicol plates.
We successfully transformed B. subtilis with select vectors (we observed red colonies, which means that the vectors integrated since it includes RFP in its backbone).
Figure 2: B. subtilis was transformed with the thrC vector, the sac A vector and the amyE vector. All three of these vectors carry the RFP cassette.
Week 10: June 30 - July 4
This week we attempted to optimize our B. subtilis transformations by using fresh B. subtilis cells containing the comK gene in lieu of frozen samples. Unfortunately, working with fresh B. subtilis cells resulted in no viable transformants. Last week we were able to successfully transform frozen B. subtilis cells with all three of our integration vectors, however each plate yielded only a handful of colonies and many of these"
DTU-Denmark,2014,Team:DTU-Denmark#Achievements#Medal fulfillings_-_-_TEXT.html," team we participated in a workshop on ethics hosted by the UNIK_Copenhagen iGEM’14 team. This led to an essay dealing with the several questions on ethics within our project.
What ethical issues should be considered regarding our project and synthetic biology in general?
How can these issues be approached?
Furthermore we have been dealing with laboratory safety since we find that essential for a good project. We have chosen to make a checklist on how to maintain good laboratory safety. This is targeted towards our defined Policy and Practices target group (Danish elite high school students) since they do not yet have well developed laboratory safety routines.
Gold medal requirements
3 of the 4 Gold medal criteria have been achieved
Demonstrate a substantial improvement over the state of the art in cost, efficiency, precision, resolution, and/or other relevant capabilities of your measurement technique.
Today promoter activity is measured with the use of GFP which entail several complications, including bleaching effect and uncertainty associated with measuring on protein level. The method developed through our project exterminate these issues by using the spinach RNA-aptamer expressed from the promoter of choice. This allows measurement performed at RNA level thereby eliminating several uncertainties faced when using GFP. With our experimental work and our developed PoPS calculator we have enabled a new way of measuring promoter activity on RNA-level with the use of Spinach.
Increase the ease of accessibility and portability of methods to other laboratories of a new measurement technique of your choosing.
We have transformed Spinach2.1 into the standard iGEM backbone so it easily can be placed behind any optional promoter. Thereby making a easy, fast and standardized protocol to measure promoter strength on RNA level. With our calculator we have developed a fast and easy way to convert fluorescence signal into a absolute PoPS value for promoter activity.
Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution.
One of our first achievements was hosting a BioBrick Workshop in May for the other two danish iGEM teams SDU-Denmark and UNIK Copenhagen. We shared our knowledge within USER cloning and arranged a programme covering three days of workshops with relevant presentations and lab introduction. Thereby helping other teams by giving them some skills, knowledge and techniques useful when developing a great iGEM project. It also served as a good way to start up the projects with the great opportunity for idea development and knowledge exchange among the teams.

Today we tried to finish off a mutagenesis procedure.  We found that our new T4 WT Keltzie phage stock produced plaques down to between 10^-6 and 10^-9.  I used 1 mL of this lysate to start the mutagenesis procedure, adding it to 25 mL of bacteria that had an optical density of 0.155.  However, after 4 hours the bacterial cultures looked more like they had been cleared, rather than getting more turbid due to a superinfection.  Adding chloroform confirmed this--if anything, the 5 mL sample we removed and added chloroform to got more turbid rather than clearing.  This is the first time we've seen actual clearage in a liquid culture.  All of the other times we've created superinfection conditions.
We added 0.5 mL of overnight bacterial culture to each flask to see if we can restart bacterial growth in the flask in superinfection conditions.  We'll let this incubate overnight and harvest it tomorrow.

These mutants contain insertion mutations that produce a thrombin cleavage site on the exterior of the cage. In the presence of thrombin protease, these mutants are cleaved at the thrombin cleavage site, inducing disassembly of the cage and theoretically releasing an encapsulated molecule.

Talking to experts
We talked with experts from different universities and research centers in the fields of biology, genetic engineering, biological modeling and cyanobacterial research. Many of these experts gave us much appreciated information and new aspects to our ideas that have guided our project towards what it is today. As the information has had a significant effect on the design of our project, it will be presented more deeply in integrated human practices section.
Finnish Environment Institute SYKE
In order to gain more insight into the problem of cyanobacteria in Finland, we contacted the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. They guided us to the Finnish Environment Institute (Suomen ympäristökeskus, SYKE), where we got to discuss the cyanobacteria problem and our project with experts.
We talked to Jari Silander, Senior Research Scientist specializing in monitoring and cost-benefit analysis, as well as Juhani Kettunen, Program Director responsible for modernization of environmental monitoring activities. We introduced our project and briefly talked about synthetic biology. They found our approach interesting and promising since they have been trying to deal with the blue-green algae problem for many years now. They described the full extent of algae detection problem in Finland and all the strategies used in the past and at the moment to deal with it both in research and industry.
They also discussed with us the business aspects of our project and gave us good advice on how to build our business strategy if we are to bring our algae detection and degradation methods to masses.
Meetings with companies
As we were looking for funding and contacting different companies and organizations, we got a chance to visit a few. We told them about our project, discussed synthetic biology and the use of biotechnology in Finland. We talked with ThermoFisher, Algol and LAL (Luonnontieteiden akateemisten liitto), and they showed great interest in our project, even helping us with the funding. In addition, ThermoFisher generously sent us various lab kits. We will visit some of them to give the final presentation about our achievements after we return from Boston.
Interviewing people on the streets of Helsinki
We decided to make a little survey on the streets of Helsinki. The goal was to find out what people actually knew about synthetic biology and cyanobacteria. We wanted to see what kind of need there was"

In order to get a clearer picture of UDCA-contained drug’s manufacturing circumstance in China,                         our team visited Tianjin Pacific Chemical & Pharmaceutical Company to interview the experts                         about current chemical producing methods. According to Mr. Xing Ruwen and Mr. Li Jinlong, the                         most popular method of producing UDCA-contained medicine in the market mainly focuses on                         chemical pharmaceutical procedures. Yet this approach has disadvantages including relatively                         weak efficacy and potential harm to health of the workers. He praises our aim to produce UDCA                         medic in biopharmaceutical procedure and consider it very promising. Furthermore, he encouraged                         us to cut off cost so that our method can be accepted by the market and the patients. This                         suggestion helped us to clarify our future goal.
Mr. Xing Ruwen
Mr. Xing Ruwen is the chief engineer in Tianjin Pacific Chemical & Pharmaceutical Company. He is                         an experienced manager who has been working on Chemical method of producing UDCA-contained drugs                         for years.
Mr. Xing introduces us the traditional chemical procedure to manufacture the UDCA-contained drug.                         Also, he leads us to visit the processing workshop and teaches us many valuable knowledge about                         drug production.
According to his opinion, chemical method of producing UDCA-contained drug basically has two                         disadvantages: the first one is its high risk; the second one is related to profit, a factor                         that influences manufacturing the most. For its potential high risk, Mr. Xing conveys that it                         comes from the utilization of metal sodium. Sodium is well-known for its highly-reactiveness; it                         is able react violently with water, which at the same time release large amount of heat and                         might cause potential safety issue to the workers. He praises our thought of avoiding the                         dangerousness and very much acknowledges our method.
Mr. Li Jinlong
Mr. Li Jinlong works as the production manager and he also participating in marketing                         department’s work in Tianjin Pacific Chemical & Pharmaceutical Company.
Mr. Li patiently answers our questions related to marketing. Analyzing its cost, demand and also                         profit, Mr. Li helps us to determined our minds on trying to solve the problem step by step. He                         informs that currently the successful UDCA synthesis rate is not hight enough and requires                         repeating measures to increase its purification"

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html," for friendships across different teams.
Our second meetup, the Nordic iGEM Conference was hosted by the University of Copenhagen, UCopenhagen, and took place in June. The main focus of this meetup was the traditional mini Jamboree. Participating in this  meetup gave us useful feedback from both the judges as well as from our fellow iGEM teams. This helped us greatly to shape and develop our project for the better.
To celebrate the beginning of our iGEM summer, we went on a road trip to attend the European Meetup, hosted by the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Here we discussed ideas regarding our project at a poster session, and learned about all the other great iGEM projects. We also made new friends from all over Europe.
Further Collaboration
In regard to our project, we have been in contact with the iGEM teams from Bielefeld and Imperial College, who helped us by sending crucial parts, relevant to the execution of our project.
As our project revolves around global warming and green sustainable energy, we were thrilled to hear about the iGEM Goes Green initiative made by the TU Dresden iGEM team. Following their guidelines, we have calculated the carbon footprint of our laboratory work and travelling. We have, in part, tried to make up for our carbon footprint, by changing our travelling and eating habits in our everyday lives. Furthermore, we have reduced our daily electricity consumption, our wiki became CO2 neutral, and we made an effort to sort our waste. The full report can be scrutinised here. Due to our team being the most green dream team, TU-Dresden asked us to lead the iGEM Goes Green project in year 2018.
We sought expertise from the Macquarie Australia iGEM team, who has worked with the implementation of photosynthesis in E. coli since 2013. We had an interesting Skype call with their team, where we discussed the particular challenges their previous teams had experienced throughout their projects.
We were also able to help the Stony Brook iGEM team by facilitating communication with members of the SDU iGEM team from 2016.
During our project we received several questionnaires from fellow iGEM teams. We were delighted to help the teams by answering their questionnaires. These included from:
Waterloo - regarding 3D printing of lab equipment
Dalhousie - regarding the common conception of science literature
University of Washington - regarding communication platforms used by teams
Vilnius-Lithuania - regarding cotransformation
Nanjing-China - regarding a whole-cell sensor for formal"
BIT,2016,Team:BIT-China#Killing Mechanisms_-_-_TEXT.html,", C, D, E and X). The hokD gene, formerly known as relF, is encoded by the third gene of the relBEF operon. This gene does not contain upstream regulatory elements and lacks the sok gene. Thus, the hokD locus probably constitutes an evolutionary relic of an ancient hok-homolog.
Application in our project
Since we just need a killer gene to realize the suicide procedure, only the toxin protein is needed.
In early stage of our project, according to the document literature, considering protein stability, dose relationship, accessibility and theoretical lethal efficiency or some other factors, mazF (theoretical lethal efficiency reaches to 95%)and hokD(has a relatively clear quantitative relation with Lon protease which can hydrolyse hokD’s corresponding antitoxin) are chosen as our candidates of killer gene from the frequently-used TA system.
After constructing the circuits of killer device and testing the efficiency of mazF and hokD controlled by pBAD, which can be induced by arabinose, mazF finally become our final choice for having better lethal effect and will be applied in our final circuit.

UVR8
UVR8 is a plant protein first identified in Arabidopsos thaliana.  UVR8 is a photoreceptor and a crucial part in the plant stress response to UV-B (280-315 nm).  In absence of UV-B the protein occurs as a dimer. At the dimeric interface it contains tryptophane residues which absorb the UV-B light and thereby changing conformation of the protein  which results in the dissociation of the dimer. The monomeric UVR8 is then able to initiate downstream reactions that trigger the transcription of proteins needed for the stress response.
We want to make use of this photoreceptor by incorporating this protein as an transcription factor in bacteria. Since UVR8 is not able to interact with DNA by itself we are fusing it with a TetR monomer, a known repressor. We make use of the fact that the Tet repressor is only active when it binds as a dimer to the DNA. The fusion of a UVR8 unit with the DNA binding domain of TetR  should result in a repression when UVR8 is a dimer and a activation when UVR8 and therefore also TetR is a monomer.  With this we would be able to activate the tet promoter upon UV exposure, which causes the dissociation of the UVR8 dimer. 
Fig: UVR8 as a symmetric homodimer. Upon UV-B exposure the the dimer dissociates into to monomers.

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," different ways, which we noticed when visiting different plants. However, they all have the common goal of reducing organic material (BOD/COD), nitrogen and phosphorus. You will find a summary of the different steps of cleaning water in this section, as well as a comparison with the different plants we talked and met with.
Every wastewater treatment plant has a grid that takes away big objects that could cause damage to the machinery. Influent matter that is separated from the water is cleaned, compressed and put in containers to be used as landfill or to be burned. Sand capture will collect incoming sand from old, eroding concrete pipes. Some plants utilize a finer grid to separate the water from bigger matter further, while some plants utilize aeration, keeping the sludge floating while separating the sand which sinks to the bottom - a step called pre-sedimentation.
Phosphorus will then be removed using ferrous sulphate, which precipitates the phosphorus. The iron extracts the diluted phosphorous compounds which are present in the sludge. Iron makes the sludge heavier, and the sludge will sink to the bottom and pumped away. Ferrous sulphate can pose difficulties to the treatment step since it has to be mixed with oxygen to work. The production of air is expensive, and sometimes unoxidized iron will continue further in the treatment and get oxidized in the biological treatment. This leads to the uptake of unnecessary space in the treatment process.
Biological treatment with bacteria and other microorganisms will in the next step transform nitrogen to nitrogen gas. Nitrogen present in the aquatic environment works as a fertilizer leading to increased algae growth in seas. This poses a threat when the temperature is low, but during summer at a water temperature of 20 °C the biological treatment works properly. Anaerobic and aerobic bacteria will work together to transform ammonium nitrate to nitrate, and nitrate to nitrogen gas, which is removed by ventilation. During winter, methanol is added to increase the efficacy of the bacteria. Excess sludge is removed and pumped back to the pre-sedimentation.
The steps used after biological treatment depend on the plant. For example, flotation by using polyaluminium chloride can be used. Another example is sand filters or lamella sedimentation. Flotation is achieved by mixing compressed water with air. The bubbles inside the tank will collect the flocks floating to the surface, separating them from the water. If the flocks are not big enough, polymers can be added. In the case of sand filters, the water is filtered through sand to remove fine impurities from the water. Lamella"

BBa_K1139201
We improved a phosphate sensor part since the existing phosphate sensor part (OUC-China 2012, BBa_K737024 ) did not have sufficient data.  We constructed this part by amplifying the phoA promoter from E. coli (MG1655) and ligating it upstream of GFP part. Compared to OUC-China’s phosphate sensor part including phoB promoter (Fig. 5-1-5), our phosphate sensor part shows a clearer result (Fig. 5-1-4).
A sensor of phosphate concentration is valuable for various studies in synthetic biology.  Therefore, our improved part will be useful.

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Concept2Fr_-_-_TEXT.html," capside mature, cela laisse le choix quant au placement de la protéine de fusion. Cependant des études menées en Nter et en Cter ont montré que la fusion en Cter apportait de meilleurs résultats. Cette protéine d’internalisation, nommée polypeptide de type III, est issue de la base du penton des adénovirus. En plus de permettre au vecteur cellulaire d’être internalisé dans la cellule d’intérêt, elle induit sa sortir de l’endosome.
La base du penton est une protéine pentamérique insérée stratégiquement au niveau des douze sommets de la capside adénovirale. Son monomère d’environ 60 kDa (571 aminoacides) est présent en 60 copies dans les virus. En plus de son rôle structural dans la capside, la base du penton possède une propriété fondamentale : elle contient un motif RGD (arginine - acide aspartique - glycine) conservé, responsable de l’interaction du virus avec les intégrines αvβ3 et αvβ5. Ce motif est situé à la surface de la base du penton et se projette vers l’extérieur de la capside. L'exposition de 5 motifs RGD portés par la base de penton (molécule pentamérique) permet l'association simultanée de plusieurs molécules d'intégrines, initiant l'entrée de l’adénovirus par endocytose, principalement au sein de vésicules à clathrines.
Le phénomène d’internalisation nécessitant le regroupement des intégrines via les motifs RGD, soit plusieurs monomères de polypeptides de type III, peut soulever un problème. En effet, la protéine D n’étant fusionnée qu’à un seul monomère de polypeptide de type III, l’endocytose peut ne pas avoir lieu. Cependant, d’après une étude cristallographique, la distance entre deux motifs RGD sur une base du penton est de 5,7nm. La distance entre deux protéines D étant similaire (5,1nm), le regroupement des intégrines peut avoir lieu et induire l’internalisation et la sortie de l’endosome.

Today was an exciting day!  We went down to Stanford for a meetup with iGEM teams from UCSF, UC Berkeley, and Standford/Brown. With the little time we had before our road trip, we were able to miniprep C0080 and digest the mutant LacI promoter. Once at Stanford, we discussed our projects and our strategies for approaching them and talked with each other to share information that could be valuable to each other's projects.  The UCSF team is very impressive being mostly comprised of high school students who seem very sharp.  After a bit of mingling, we all headed to a different part of campus where SB5.0 was happening.  We were lucky enough to be able to attend the poster session which was great!  There were so many posters which all presented interesting things that were similar to things we have worked on or were interested in working on.  A few notable posters showed mutating one domain in an efflux pump that were aimed at pumping out biofuel.  One poster which we were interested in was one that raised the idea that DNA could be made with a different backbone which could possibly introduce another mode of isolating synthetic systems in a complex cell.  No doubt there would be a boatload of work involved with building artificial machinery to do the basic functions which have evolved for millions of years in nature.  Perusing the posters gave us some ideas and really motivated us to do work on our project.

Fudan,2014,Team:Fudan#pro_-_-_TEXT.html," 2006, scientists can only get mammalian cells of totipotency by obtaining the stem cells in the embryonic period during which stem cells get full totipetency. Experiments can be done with animal embryonic stem cells, but
obtaining embryonic stem cells from human body is never allowed. It causes serious ethical and bioethical problems. In 2006, Yamanaka and his colleagues successfully make fibroblasts (somatic cells) reprogram into iPSC (inducible
pluripotent stem cell) by stably transfecting four transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc) with the help of lenti virus. This achievement not only made him get Nobel prize in 2012, but also arouse a new trend in researches of stem
cell therapy, since severe bioethical and ethical problems avoided. What’s more, iPSc technology made the road of regenerative medicine more bright, for it could successfully solve the immunological problems too. What a great biological
technology!
However, Things were far more than we expected. iPSc technology, limited by itself, not only for it needs lenti virus, which may be harmful to cells or organism, to help cells get four transcription factors stably overexpressed, but also for c-Myc, a strong oncogene, which made oncologists headache for many years, will also be powerfully overexpressed in this system. Unfortunately, iPSc did cause tumors successfully according to some recent reports. What’s more, iPSc also cause many teratoma’s formation, as a result of which makes iPSc not be safe anymore. Then many scientists decided to work on the project which can make cell conversion avoid of becoming tumors or causing cancers. They began to be focused on the research on direct somatic cell transdifferentiation or cell reprogramming to multipotent stem cells such as iNSc (inducible multipotent neural stem cell) etc. These two methods apparently are safer than iPSc technology. For direct somatic cell transdifferentiation, what we got were just well-differentiated cells, such as neuron, myoblast, which almost do not have any self-renewing ability. For cell reprogramming to multipotent stem cells, some reports insisted that these cells almost have no oncogenicity [1] .
For the reasons we talked about above, we Fudan iGem team tried to make a new kind of machine for cell conversion. Many choices for cells’ fate will be offered with the help of our machine “iGEm"

Quorum sensing bacteria produce and release chemical signal molecules called autoinducers (AI) that increase in concentration as a cell density (cell aggregation) (Fig.2) [3]. The high concentration of AI after the aggregation of cells in EcoTanker causes the expression of genes for lysis proteins. The regulation seems to be severe control of autolysis. Quorum sensing device include two proteins, LuxI and LuxR derived from V.fischeri. LuxI is Athyl homoserine lactone (AHL; is one of the AI) synthetase and LuxR is AHL receptor. The complex of AHL and AHL receptors induces expression of the downstream genes as lysis device.
How does this device work in EcoTanker?
In EcoTanker system, the lysis and quorum sensing device works with the device cording plasmid shown in Fig. 3.
Lysis device works as disruption of E. coli, and quorum sensing device works as the trigger of the lysis function. After the aggregation step in EcoTanker, the cell-population density and AHL is higher before the step. Then, the complex of AHL and AHL receptor are formed and the downstream genes cording lysis device can be expressed.
Progress
We had already constructed the device cording genes, (A) and (B) shown in Fig.3.
Construction of BBa_K317037-K317039 (Fig.3 (A))
At first, we did PCR.to amplify DNA fragments shown below from BBa_F2621. Then, we confirmed the DNA fragments length by electrophoresis. After that, the purified DNA fragments were ligated with digested pSB1C3 and pSB1A2- Lysis (BBa_K112808) and we did transformation of DH5α with these ligated samples. Plasmid extraction from obtained colonies and sequence analysis was done. Obtained plasmid were registered, BBa_K317037 and BBa_K317038, respectively (Fig.4).
Second, we ligated the digested BBa_J23102 and BBa_K317038 by 3A assembly. And more, we did transformation of DH5α with these ligated samples. Plasmid extraction from obtained colonies and sequence analysis was done. Obtained plasmid were registered BBa_K317039 (Fig.3 (A)).

Study
To simulate an environmental contamination by GEOs, we introduced a bacterial culture grown in LB without any antibiotic in our environment samples. Indeed, in case of an accidental dissemination, what could happen to our strain if we spill a bacterial culture into the wild? We chose to use the same protocol for each environment, except an additional step of water dilution for the soil sample.
Protocol experiment : survival of E. coli:
We prepared a 15mL culture of our three different strains (E. coli 1320, 1693 and 1696), in LB medium, without antibiotic the day before starting the experiment.
The first day (D0), we measured the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) to evaluate “concentration” in bacteria , and we plated on MCK with the appropriate antibiotic a sample of each culture to count the  CFU.
We put then 1,5mL of each of the three cultures in each of the eight experimental environments (15mL for liquid environment, 15g for soil), and shake it to make a homogeneous mix.  Negative controls (-) are environmental samples without culture contamination. All experimental samples were left on the bench, at room temperature, in a 50mL closed falcon tube.
Each day, we took a 1mL sample of each contaminated liquid experimental environment and prepared dilutions of this sample from 10-1 to 10-8 in isotonic water. For the soil environment, we took 1g of soil, which we diluted in 5mL of sterile water, and after one step of shaking and of 15 min decantation, we pipetted 50 µL of the supernatant and diluted it in 950 µL of isotonic water. This allowed us"

INTEGRATED HUMAN PRACTICES
After choosing our topic of healthy ageing we spoke to various researchers in the area. We especially valued the opportunity to speak to Aubrey De Grey, an author of books such as 'advocate for an indefinite human lifespan' and 'ending ageing'. He is the co-founder of SENS research and is renowned in the field for his research. We were particularly looking forward to discussing the idea of a antioxidant probiotic with him following his interest in the free radical theory of ageing and his positive view that ""Ageing is emphatically not an inescapable destiny"".
In conversation with Aubrey de grey, it was suggested to us that our lycopene probiotic would need to be controlled. This is because reactive oxide species are useful in important signalling processes which act to protect the cell. Taking on board this advice, we considered a method to  control lycopene expression.
 
 
To achieve this we decided to look through the registry at existing promoter which would select lycopene expression only in 'high stress' conditions which mimic the imbalance of stress within the cell. Hence, we decided to combine lycopene with a stress sensitive promoter which would only release lycopene when cells are stressed. This promoter was NarK. We are very grateful to Aubrey for his insight and enthusiasm for our project, and also thankful that he took time to speak with our team and influence our project in a positive way.

OXIDATIVE STRESS
Early in our discussion of what we could target in ageing, we spoke to various academics, including Dr. Max Yun, a Senior Research Associate in the UCL’s Division of Biosciences who recommended a paper to us - ‘The Hallmarks of Ageing’. This highlighted not only is ageing a complex, multi-faceted problem, but also that it wouldn’t be possible to target all hallmarks, instead, we chose to focus on reactive oxygen species (ROS) which underpin some of the hallmarks (1) of ageing.
For instance, endogenous damage caused by ROS leads to DNA lesions including telomerase shortening(1). These lesions essentially lead to genomic instability (1). Ageing in this instance is caused by imbalance between DNA damage and DNA repair, for instance insufficient repair mechanism or excessive DNA damage promotes ageing (1).
Oxidative stress can also cause proteins to unfold and aggregate, again leading to ageing (1). We found greater strength in this argument when we were shown data from research undertaken at Imperial University showing oxidative stress to have a detrimental impact upon protein"

Purdue,2014,Team:Purdue#The Solution#Project Development_-_-_TEXT.html," complexity? Could we benefit plants with just one microbe or a cocktail?
We dived into the literature on the rhizosphere and the use of nitrogen fixing bacteria as a safe and well known practice. We asked ourselves if there are microbes that could aid the uptake or bioavailability of nutrients in the soil. We realized that modern Ag practices focus heavily on the supplementation of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. But what about other nutrients like iron, calcium, sulfur and manganese?
We then came across an article by Scientific American titled, “Dirt Poor: Have Fruits and Vegetables Become Less Nutritious?” We found the article startling and looked into what deficiencies were most prominent in people and plants. We found that iron deficiency manifested in iron deficiency anemia was a huge problem. Now that we found our nutrient, how could we go about helping plants absorb more iron?
Plants uptake iron by 2 main mechanisms: non-grass plants reduction strategy; lowering the pH  of the soil around them making Fe3+ to Fe2+, and the grass plant chelating strategy utilizing  phytosiderophores or scavengers of Fe3+. We decided to exploit the biochemical pathway responsible for phytosiderophore production because bacteria naturally produce their own siderophores and plants can utilize them in iron-starved conditions. However another strategy we considered is using bacterial localization to roots circuits (used by imperial college auxin project 2011) and overexpression of membrane proton pumps on bacteria to decrease the pH of the soil and  increase the bioavailability of Iron.
The question then became what microorganism would host our phytosiderophore producing circuit? We ultimately decided on Bacillus subtilis because it is a common soil microbe around the world and its sporulation stage allows for effective transport.

Communication
As an interdisciplinary team, we quickly realized that we needed to find effective ways to communicate complex concepts and ideas from each of our disciplines - biochemistry, engineering, biology, chemistry, and law - to other members of the team with no more than a lay background knowledge. Doing this enabled us to take advantage of our different knowledge and perspectives, bringing a new angle and fresh approach to the work in each of our fields, and allowed us to use our combined knowledge to tackle problems which we would not have been able to address individually.
This sharing of knowledge and ideas is essential not only within successful iGEM teams: our interdisciplinary group is, in this regard, a microcosm of society at large. Dialogue between scientists and non-scientists must be two-way, understanding and willingness to listen on both sides; the lack of this mutual communication has caused massive problems for areas of science, biotechnology foremost amongst them, in recent years.
The so-called 'knowledge deficit assumption', according to which public objections to science are based on lack of understanding and misinformation, is no longer an adequate explanation to brush off widespread concerns about synthetic biology. In the 21st Century, scientists have to take some responsibility for education and explaining science in an accessible way, avoiding psychobabble without dumbing down ideas. If this has been achieved, there is then a responsibility to take the views and concerns of the public seriously - as we found on a small scale within our team, in a society of individuals with a wide range of different expertise can offer different perspectives and may be able to spot flaws or potential problems in the bigger picture which a re"
Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," German Institute of the Blind) to facilitate equality and accessibility in Science. In the following paragraphs, you can see for yourself.
Self-experiment - Dinner in the Dark
Since Marburg is known as the “capital for blind people,” the bar Caveau is offering a dinner in the dark named “Finstaverne” (engl.: Sinistavern). Here you get the opportunity to experience one evening in total darkness, enjoying some food and drinks with your friends or colleagues. Compared to other such evenings the only difference is the complete absence of visual impressions. The iGEM Marburg 2018 team used this opportunity to get a feel for how everyday situations, like having a dinner, in the absence of visual impressions is affecting us.
In small groups, a waiter guided us into a room without any light sources. The first challenge was to find your place on the table without pushing anyone or anything. Because we all often rely exclusively on our eyes, the first moments without them were unfamiliar to us. Once we were sitting, we started to wonder, how big the room could be, how many people were there and which team members were sitting on the tables next to us. All these questions we tried to answer by acoustic and haptic clues alone.
Then it was time to order food and drinks. Therefore, most of us had to ask more than once what food selection was available. Some of us decided to order something that could be easier to eat without seeing it rather than soup or spaghetti. They thought eating a sandwich could be more manageable. We realized that eating any kind of food was the key challenge of this evening for most members of our team. The ones who ordered sandwiches were wondering how they lost all the toppings while eating.
After several hours, it was time to leave. Here comes the last challenge of this evening. How to pay without knowing how much money you have in your hands? Some Members were well prepared and assorted the money bills in their wallet, beforehand. Most of us did not think about that before entering the dark room and had to guess if they had picked the right bills and coins. Fortunately, the waiters were very kind and trustworthy. Being more experienced than us they were kind enough to help us with the payment.
Team iGEM Marburg late at night after our Dinner in the Dark we head home we new impressions
We had a lot of fun and enjoyed our dinner on that evening. At the same time, it was impressive how you experience basic things like your food and drinks differently, if your only judge is what you feel, smell or taste.  Your perception of a bar changes if you"

Evry,2013,Team:Evry#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," (Do It Yourself Biology) initiatives, partakes both of this “user-friendly” dynamic, even unwillingly. We should be vigilant about this: all simplifications of use are not safe.
Conclusion
This philosophical experience highlights several important points. First of all, we confirmed a converging ethical awareness of all the members of the team: the purpose and the meaning of experiments in synthetic biology is never and for nobody insignificant.
Unsurprisingly the team could not agree with the philosophical hypothesis that technique is intrinsically bad and/or alienating. This philosophical statement was made in another context, and it seems a bit naïve today. Despite this disagreement, it seems that a relative consensus exists in the team around the necessity for synthetic biology not to be used for toyish purposes. Experiments are no game, and creating is not playing.
The team globally agreed with the concept of technical culture: some of the members particularly liked the role given to creativity and invention, some were more interested in the technical understanding of science. It seems that this concept still describes our scientific and technical reality. The analogy with computers underlined converging fears about loosing control on genes’ manipulations through too much technical automation.
It appeared also that there is a kind of circularity from the first critics about alienation and the last ideas about the importance of openness. The respect we have for technical objects goes along with understanding, thus technical culture really appears to be the key element both against alienation and fears. It should also enhance the safety of biotechnologies. Technical culture can belong both to specialists and to average citizens, excluding nobody, creating a common language to communicate. But the condition for this culture to happen is, that the openness ideal remains: secrets and abusive protection of intellectual property only increase fears and incomprehension. The openness ideal and the DIY-Bio initiatives must fight against both the “user-friendly” dynamics and obscurantism.
Last but not least, this experience of embedded philosophy proved that scientists and philosophers can think together and benefit of this cooperation.

How does it work?
In the General View of the program we represent a layer of the cytoplasm of an E.Coli specimen, with a thickness of 5 nm. The actual dimensions of an E.coli have been obtained from the CyberCell Database , a fantastic information source. We have considered the next measures to model the bacterium:
E. Coli schematics measures
To use these dimensions in the “NetLogo’s patch world” (where the world is made of a grid of stationary agents called patches) we have taken as reference the size of a standard protein (5 nm (Guo,2006)) and adjusted the sizes of the world so that every patch has the same size of a protein. This way, the whole world is made of a grid of 400 x 160. As we have taken a layer with a thickness of only 5nm, we have scaled the typical ammount of several molecules in a E. Coli (like ribosomes or RNAps) accordingly (we do that by dividing the numbers by 120, corresponding with the number of patches that theorically would measure the high of an E.Coli).
Once we click setup, we can see several molecules. To initiate a simulation just click on go.
What can we see?
On the left we can see several genes (one couple of genes by default), represented by lines.
The longer genes are LacI genes (Repressor 1), while the shorter ones represent c1ts genes (Repressor2). From now on we will use the terms LacI/Repressor1 and c1ts/Repressor2 indistinctly
Both genes are to scale. In the real bacteria they both would appear in the same plasmid and completely twisted. They both have a"

Hello, dear reader! Today we made plasmid DNA extraction from the amplified colonies (8 and 11) in PSB1C3 our BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation.
Electrophoretic plasmid DNA extraction’s profile:
1 – 3: BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3 extracted from DH5a colony 8.
3 – 6: BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3 extracted from DH5a colony 11.
To confirm that we’re really with all our bio bricks BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation, biobrick BB_Essential and biobrick BB_Bioremediation (done previously) in PSB1C3, we will cut with EcoRI and PstI to analyze the fragment’s size that will be released and the vector. We kept the same digestion systems of previous days for 1:30 hours at 37°C.

Summary
Milk samples from cows that have mastitis but are not cured by certain antibiotics are not always sent to the lab for test, because it costs time and money (2-3 days). Sometimes farmers thus already register other antibiotics not knowing if it might work. When the milk sample goes to the lab, the untreated milk is plated on different agar plates. When colonies have grown, the microorganisms are often colored and examined through the microscope. Also, biochemical tests are done to see which compounds the bacteria can convert. When a cow has clinical mastitis (visible symptoms), it is most likely that one type of bacterium is the cause. There are 6 types of known, common pathogens for mastitis. Engeline tells us that farmers would like a on site test for which antibiotic can or can not be administered. She thinks that within several years whole genome sequencing will be the golden standard.
We asked Engeline what is the most appropriate sample for detecting antibiotic resistance. She tells us that feces contains too many bacteria, blood is supposed to be"

Lessons about iGEM
To let the applicant get a deeper understanding of iGEM ,the leader hold two group meeting introducing more details about iGEM and synthetic biology. Many senior were invited to talk with us . we themselves also refer to many golden team in the history of iGEM ,and share it with each other by giving a presentation .
Week 4
The  team leader read all the application letter ,and reject some that don’t have  time or treat the carelessly . then to let the applicant  get a deeper understanding of iGEM ,the leader  hold two group meeting introducing more details about IGEM and synthetic  biology . Six people of us also referred to one excellent team in previous years  ,and introduced it to all . Through the official website of iGEM ,we learn a  lot about iGEM quickly .
Brain-Storm
Week 5 and 6
After we know what iGEM and synthetic really is , we decided if we want to go on . Those left were divided into 6 groups . Then all people had brain-storm and chose at least 1 good idea . We have two weeks to choose a proper project and consult related papers to complete the project . We just require concept but not experiment design .
Week 7
We hold a group meeting for all group to present their idea . Each group give a 20 min presentation ,then questions were asked . we gave each other advise on their project , especially on feasibility . Most group thought out more than one idea ,so we had plentiful ideas .
Further research
In the spring holiday ,we contact with each other on the internet . We do further research on our interested project and try to design how to achieve our goal by experiment .
Week  8
Our winter holiday last from week 8 to  week 9 . During this period ,we researched different part respectively and  communicated on the internet . In week 8 , we divided the project into  different models and each was responsible for one . We researched in iGEM  official website and many database to see if our idea has been realized .
Week9

Figure 13: Comparison of growth patterns of BS-nitred and BS-control in 150 ug/ml metronidazole in anaerobic cultures. Initial OD600 was extracted and error bars are standard error of the mean.
The results in aerobic cultures are promising since nitroreductase-containing cells have not grown while the control cells are growing. Once we obtained the BioBricked version of nfsI, we proceeded to testing this construct to show that it has similar activity to the gene in the BlueScript vector. Transformants and controls were incubated overnight in LB bottles containing either no, or 150ug/ml, metronidazole and OD readings were taken the following day. These results can be seen in Figure 14 below.
Figure 14: Comparison of growth between cells transformed with pSB1C3 plasmids containing either nfsI or control. 150 ug/ml metronidazole was added to bottles that contain it.
Citrobacter freundii characterisation
We tried to see whether this construct would work in Citrobacter freundii , but we did not find a metronidazole concentration that inhibited its growth (we tried adding metronidazole up the concentration of 350ug/ml but this still gave an OD reading of 0.766).
We have measured nitroreductase activity in the nfsI and control transformants and have found that the specific activity of nitroreductase was 14U/mg in the nfsI transformant, which is much higher than the specific activity we found in E. coli this is consistent with the finding that the Lac promoter is much stronger in Citrobacter freundii , as it is unregulated.
Since the nitroreductase enzyme itself seems to be working fine, it could mean that Citrobacter freundii is inherently resistant to activated metronidazole, so this is not a good counter-selectable marker option for Citrobacter freundii .
This is not necessarily a problem, as we have shown that our other counterselectable marker, sacB works very well in Citrobacter freundii , so that gene could instead be used for counterselection in this organism.
Conclusions
We successfully cloned the nitroreductase gene and inserted it into the BioBrick vector.
We extensively characterized the nitroreductase gene on plates and in liquid cultures.
We troubleshooted the Plac-lacZ'-"

UNIK-Copenhagen iGEM Team
Our main collaboration project was working with the Copenhagen iGEM team in their effort to create an instructional video database called Bricks of Knowledge. Each Brick in the database contains a short instructional video giving instructions, advice, tips, and tricks on a specific topic helpful to other iGEM teams. The hope and goal of the database is to provide a means of sharing experience and expertise in the specific areas that teams excel in. Such a database not only helps share knowledge between current teams, but will provide an invaluable resource for new teams as they enter into the iGEM community.
We decided to create a Brick of Knowledge on how to work with bacteriophage in a research capacity, and specifically in the context of iGEM. The video covers what a plaque is, picking a plaque, spot tests, making plates, and top agar.
NRP-UEA iGEM Team
We worked with the Norwich Research Park of the University of East Anglia iGEM team on their project to create a library of antimycin producing bacteria isolated from soil or sediment. While their main focus was on the filamentous Actinobacteria, they hoped to find several new and interesting antimycins.
On July 18, we received an initial request from the NRP-UEA team for soil and sediment samples from our local area.  We quickly responded to let them know that we would be happy to help and requested more specific information on the type of sample that they needed. On July 22, we collected soil and sediment samples from the bank of the Provo River. These samples were kept refrigerated until they were shipped out the next day.
We contacted the NRP-UEA team to let them know the requested samples were on their way, and see if there was anything else that"

Elan_Vital_Korea,2015,Team:Elan Vital Korea#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," education and public awareness-related human practice at Korea Youth Expo and the Korea Science Fair, we have become keenly aware of the need for educating students and young generation about the synthetic biology.  As our survey result and our on-site interview show, very few youngsters knew about synthetic biology, and none heard about iGEM before. Against the background, we have adopted a few strategies to facilitate our efforts to educate general public particularly focusing on younger generation about synthetic biology and iGEM. First, we have decided to establish an extensive network with teachers and education institutions in the field.  After searching multiple options and reaching out possibilities, we were able to establish a cooperative network with the National Association for Science Teachers(http://k-sta.or.kr/), a nonprofit organization established in March 2003 with the purpose of encouraging science teachers of primary and secondary institutions to enhance expertise in the cutting edge technology and of motivating them to provide better science education. We have sent our information brochure, DNA extraction experiment equipment and  videos that can be used for the science teacher to work with their students in the field. We have created Youtube videos explaining synthetic biology and MRSA, which was the starting point of our project and still has urgent need to teach school aged children what is MRSA and how to protect themselves from getting infected by the antibiotics-resistant bacteria.  In addition, We have decided to make public our blog which had been used by only internally to store data and resources until then. Our homepage www.elanvitalkorea.com is under construction and will be finalized mid November. We have committed to provide basic education on synthetic biology whenever requested. We believe that making full use of existing network of YMCA would be very much beneficial to promote public awareness initiative, because YMCA has extensive network comprising all ages  from high school students to senior citizens. Our role there is to provide information including brochures and video and, if requested, to visit nursing homes and long term care centers for senior citizens to inform them of the dangers of antibiotics-resistance and of the measure that should be taken to reduce the infection.

Outreach
Outreach
We decided early on that we wanted to engage as much as possible with the society and especially high school students and children. The youth of the society are the upcoming in the field of science as well as the ones that will be most affected of the antibiotic resistance and plastic pollution. We believe that the more awareness of these problems the better - the same goes for general knowledge of synthetic biology and GMO’s.
We have raised awareness of iGEM, synthetic biology, bioethics and research ethics. The forms of engagement range from participating in official events at our university to a theme day both in the laboratory and in the classroom at high schools.
Research day
Every year in April the University of Southern Denmark (SDU) arranges a whole day filled with workshops, lectures and talks. This year the faculty of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology had a big workshop area with the theme “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” : the probiotic bacteria, the pathogenic bacteria and the multiresistant bacteria. With our focus on antibiotic resistance we fitted right in. We spend the entire day discussing, explaining and teaching - we had so much fun and learned a lot both about how the concept of synthetic biology is perceived in the society, but also how we should communicate it.
High School talks
We have talked several times before an audience composed of high school students.
BioOL
Our first attempt was the Danish participants for the International Biology Olympiad . They were the perfect audience, asking a lot of critical questions, which made us think twice about how we made our presentation. We altered to make it less focused on what iGEM is and more foused on the community aspect and the problem of antibiotic resistance.
KOLD College and Odense Tekniske Gymnasium
We also had the pleasure of presenting our presentation and a talk about bioethics for two technical high schools in Odense: Odense Technical High School (OTG) and KOLD College . At KOLD College we had an entire theme day where we helped the students in the laboratory and entertained them in between with details of our project. This included the preliminary presentation, which we will bring to Boston and theory about the experiments they had to do in the laboratory. We also had our movie, which explains our project with us as well as a collective brainstorm for the prospects of our"

Welcome to the Stanford Team Wiki for iGEM 2009
Stanford iGEM is a student-run, faculty-directed research group at Stanford University . The objective of our interdisciplinary group is to design and build novel engineered biological systems using standardized DNA-based parts to submit to the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) competition, held annually at MIT. We will be competing for the first time in 2009! On this website you will find detailed descriptions, results, and analysis of our project.  For more information about our organization on campus, please visit: igem.stanford.edu
Just in from iGEM 2009. Stanford has been awarded Best Health or Medicine Project. Congrats to the team and all of its supporters!
Immuni-T. coli: A Probiotic Approach to Diagnosing and Treating Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
The 2009 Stanford iGEM project is focused on creating a device that will detect and respond to imbalances in two specific subpopulations of T cells: Th17 cells , a branch of helper T cells that promote inflammatory responses, and Treg cells , crucial for the generation and maintenance of localized immunosuppression.  Distinct populations of Th17 cells and Tregs cells coexist and are reciprocally regulated in healthy tissue, and imbalances in the ratio of these lymphocytes have been implicated in a wide rage of autoimmune disorders.  The Stanford team has selected to apply its synthetic system to sense and correct the T-cell populations in individuals suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
Our goal is to create an Escherichia coli-based bacterial device that polarizes the differentiation of lymphocyte precursors along either the Th17 or Treg lineage.  Our device will consist of two parts.  The first part, our anti-inflammatory device , will control dangerous localized inflammation in the gut by detecting a byproduct linked to Th17-driven inflammation, nitric oxide, and excreting retinoic acid, a marker that inhibits the generation of Th17 cells.  Likewise, the second, anti-immunosuppressive device , regulates Treg populations by detecting an analog of tryptophan, a target substrate of an enzyme involved in Treg immunosuppression, and secretes interleukin-6, a cytokine that inhibits Treg development.

Cell Viability & Fatty Acid Quantification
Cell Viability
Cell Culture and Transfection
We cultured HEK293FT cells following the American Type Culture Collection’s standard procedure, except that we have used DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin for our culture medium. For transfection, we followed the manufacturer’s protocol of LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen). We used serum-free and antibiotics-free DMEM to form a DNA-lipofectamine complex.
Cell Line
In our project, two mammalian cell lines were used: human hepatoma cell (HepG2 cell) and human embryonic kidney 293 cell (HEK293FT). HepG2 cells were used for characterizing inducible promoters and glyoxylate systems. For higher transfection efficiency, the characterizations of mitochondrial leader sequence and constitutive promoter CMV were conducted using HEK293FT cells.
Cell Culture
HepG2 and HEK293FT cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 50ug/mL penicillin, 50ug/mL streptomycin at 37℃in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were transfected in petri dishes and multi-well plates with different construct Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen; Carlsbard, CA) according to manufacturer’s protocols. Any GFP signals were observed under fluorescent microscope or under confocal microscope if necessary.
Cell Viability
We designed to introduce an inducible system that allows tunable fatty acid uptake by sensing fatty acid concentrations. Fatty acids uptake was to be quantified to compare the activities of wild type cells and cells expressing inducible glyoxylate shunt.
To facilitate expression of inducible glyoxylate shunt in human"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#toolbox#photoswitching_-_-_TEXT.html," Photoswitching on the Lycopene Production
To investigate the influence of photoswitching on the lycopene production, we cultivated three biological replicates of the three variants (LP, TAG318, TAG353), one for each of the AzoF conformations for 24 hours in a 6-wellplate at 37 °C and 400 rpm. The media was supplemented with 1 mM of AzoF and then split in two charges. Both were irradiated for 40 minutes and 100 % brightness, one with 367 nm and the other with 465 nm to photoswitch the amino acids. After the cultivation, we measured the OD600 of each sample (Figure 8). The growth was not influenced in a noticeable way by the different AzoF variants since the error bars overlap each other.
Figure 8: OD600 of three biological and three technical replicates of two crtI variants after cultivation.
We then extracted the lycopene from the cell pellet and quantified the lycopene (Figure 9). It can be seen that the TAG353 variant with the trans-AzoF has the highest lycopene production, followed by the TAG353 with the cis-AzoF and TAG318 with the trans-AzoF. The TAG318 variant with the cis-AzoF shows the lowest lycopene amount.
Figure 9: Absorption spectrum of the four samples of the crtI variants. Cultivated with AzoF supplemented to the media, photoswitched to cis- or trans-conformation.
The absorption at 476 nm was measured and normalized to the OD600 of the samples. The relative lycopene production of each crtI and AzoF variant is shown in Figure 10 compared to the unmodified lycopene producer, measured previously.
Figure 10: Absorption at 476 nm (indicator for lycopene) normalized to the OD600 (indication for the cell density) to calculate the relative lycopene production of each crtI variant cultivated with AzoF in cis- and trans-conformation.
Figure 10 shows the effect on the lycopene production based on the incorporation of photoswitched AzoF. The trans-conformation seems to favor the binding activity of the active site, while the cis-conformation seems to reduce the binding activity. The highest difference in the lycopene production is present at the TAG353 variant. Here the sample shows a lycopene production similar to the unmodified lycopene producer when cultivated with trans-AzoF while the productivity is reduced to nearly a"

Pedro L. Dorado
I am Pedro, a buffer guy and a third year biotechnologist.
I am eukaryotic since I was born, but I have a prokaryotic memory.                                  I am a clueless guy who does not like to miss any plan. I would need longer days to do all I want to do. I like opening and closing the                                  laboratory and talking to my bacteria.                                   I entered iGEM in order to meet people who share my interests and because I love synthetic biology.

Alba Iglesias
I am Alba, a first year biotechnologist.
I am not talking constantly, but my lab mates say that whenever I speak I say something important.      I think I am hard worker and a good person. I like reading, playing football and cooking.
I entered iGEM because I had never worked in a lab and I was eager to learn.      What I like about the iGEM is to have met people with my same interests.

Maria Marín
Hya! I’m Maria, a recently graduate Biologist and a future Geneticist.
I’m unhinibited but formal, direct but polite, planner but cheeky and ambitious but rational. People use to think my face is like an open book and so you are’re      invited to flick through it in the  iGEM presentation!
I love meeting people from around the world and that’s one of the main reasons why I joined the competition and why I’m so looking forward to be there!
