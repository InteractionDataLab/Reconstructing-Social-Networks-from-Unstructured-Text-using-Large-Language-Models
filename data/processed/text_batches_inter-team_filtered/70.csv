WashU_StLouis,2014,Team:WashU StLouis#Project#nif_-_-_TEXT.html,". The general objective is to adjust parameters of environmental conditions to show nitrogen-fixing activity in E. coli strains and eventually adapt to the light-controlling promoter system from the side of our team.
Overview
Our project consisted of three different phases.
Phase 1: Electro-Transformation of plasmid pNif51142 into E. coli strains
Phase 2: Determine the optimal conditions for cell survival with plasmid pNif51142 in E. coli
< Phase 3: Measure nitrogen fixation activity under determined optimal conditions in E. coli strains
Phase 1: Electro-Transformation of plasmid pNif51142 into E. coli strains
Figure above: nif cluster of Cyanothece sp. 51142 containing all the necessary genes for nitrogen fixation
Due to the large size of the plasmid pNif51142, 37,630bp, it was very challenging to transform it into E. coli strains.
 
To successfully transform pNif51142, we used Electro-Transformation, also known as Electroporation.  Electroporation provides a method of transforming E. coli to efficiencies greater than are possible with the best chemical methods. By subjecting mixtures of cells and DNA to exponentially decaying fields of very high initial amplitude, we were able to deliver the plasmid into all of E. coli strains that were tested in the project.
Results:
According to the gel running and antibiotic testing, bands in the gel and the survival of all strains transformed in antibiotic Kanamycin (there was an cluster of Kanamycin-resistant marker gene in sequence of pNif51142) both prove that the Electro-Transformation was successful.
Phase 2: Determine the optimal conditions for cell survival with plasmid pNif51142 in E. coli

Uppsala-Sweden
We also collaborated with the team Uppsala-Sweden. Below, you can see their feedback on our project, the software: M4B: Mining for BİoBrick.
""The METU-BIN_Ankara team provided us their software which they developed for their project to test it if we can use for our Project. We examined the software by searching the parts that have been used during our Project.We used red,blue and green lights as input which activate  red sensor(cph8), green sensor(ccaS) and blue sensor(YF1). We are aiming to get three colours as output which are blue output(amilCP), red output(mCherry) and green/yellow output(amilGFP).
However, we got no result for our specific input - output relations but, the software has some of the inputs and outputs.
This software is very helpful to search the parts and check if the parts are in the standart registry database and decide which parts work effectively with eachother as well.That  provides an easy start to constract the parts and give more efficient results.
We appreciate METU-BIN_Ankara team to create that software and believe that it will be a very helpful software which will solve the problems that we or another teams faced up in the beginning.
The software can be improved further by adding more parameters.""
We are happy to see that they use and have positive expressions on our software. As we got the information about their project, they are adding some of the bioparts of their modified device newly into the Registry. Because of this, and since our software has 2011 spring distribution in its database, it's normal to get no results for their specific device. However, when they'll add them and our database is updated, finally our software will be able to find that specific result.
At the same time, our team has given a feedback on the Biosafety document of the team Uppsala-Sweden, you can read it on this page .
See our software, it's online!

What we chose is the commercial shuttle vectors, pDEST32 and pDEST22[fig.1], where the DBD and AD is actually Gal4 BD and Gal4 AD respectively, and the Gal4 AD shall specifically bind to the upstream activating sequence(UAS), locating in the promoters of several reporter genes in the yeast strain genome like lacZ, HIS3 as well URA3.
Fig.2 The map of our two plasmids: pDEST22 and pDEST32
Since we have obtained CRY2 and CIB1, what we do next is to induce both of them into their vectors with the technology named Gateway, constructing two new plasmids, pDEST22-CIB1 and pDEST32-32 as below[fig.2]. Then we transform the plasmids above into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell, AH109, screening by Leu and Trp auxotroph.

IIT_Delhi,2015,Team:IIT Delhi#abstract_-_-_TEXT.html,", SOx, CO, CO2, and soot.
Our approach was to first synthetically construct a strain of E.coli bacteria which can convert harmful components of exhaust gases coming out of chimneys of various industries and car exhausts into harmless by-products.
Secondly, our goal was to build a working prototype which will utilise our modified bacteria in a small reactor so as to process incoming harmful exhaust to safe derivatives.
Our Innovative Solution:
We have successfully cloned five BioBricks which convert Nitrite (NO2-) to Ammonium (NH4+), Nitrous Oxide (N2O) to Nitrogen (N2), and Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S) to Sulphur (S).
We have characterised Nitrite Reductase, and improved BioBricks submitted by previous iGEM teams.
We have designed a prototype which converts Soot, NOx and SOx to harmless products.The prototype is in working condition.Our aim is to scale down the size of final device.
We are actively collaborating with the Delhi state government. We are hopeful to commercialise this prototype for market starting with application for diesel generators and car engines.
We have compiled a pollution booklet on India, that provides state and city wide information and statistics on pollution
Keeping social context in mind, our team interacted with various stakeholders including students, government officials, research agencies, urban and rural publics in order to build awareness on the issue and seek potential solutions.
A critical barrier to achieve optimal result in this construct is the regulation of heme protein production in E.coli, a problem which remains unsolved. Our team has found a crucial regulatory pathway that can be manipulated to increase heme production and activity levels of heme protein. We have modelled this pathway, which we hope will prove beneficial to future iGEM teams to reliably carry forward research on the issue of heme protein regulation.

Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

The produced TX-TL went through further quality control checkpoints consisting of measuring  protein content, as well as an activity assay via expression level analysis. The protein concentration was determined by using a commercial BCA protein assay kit. Compared to the commercial TX-TL, our home-made TX-TL shows a similar protein content of about 16 mg/mL.
However, a distinct and functional quality control requires the determination of the protein expression rate. This was done by expressing fluorescent proteins (GFP, YFP, RFP, CFP) and recording the corresponding signal using standard lab equipment like a plate reader. Extending the mRNA of the fluorescent protein mTurquoise2 (mTQ2) with the sequence for the malachite green aptamer (MG), we planned to determine the transcription and translation rate in parallel. Unfortunately, we could not express a functional fused mTQ2-MG and instead measured the transcription and translation separately by using the single components on two different plasmids.
Fluorescence curves of the different fluorescent proteins in cell extract. Proteins analysed were GFP, YFP, RFP and mTQ.
Analysing early results, we observed that functional GFP was expressed, but the measured signal did not show a coherent trend. This phenomenon was due to several autofluorescent metabolites produced in the cell extract 3 . Therefore GFP had to be excluded from further measurements.
Moreover, mTQ2 showed the fastest maturation time and lowest signal-to-noise ratio of the tested fluorescent proteins. Due to its long fluorescent lifetimes (> 3.7 ns) and high quantum yields (> 0.8) it delivers significant results for the quality control of the translation performance of our TX-TL 4 .
The expression of mTurquoise2 showed a five times higher fluorescent signal in our home-made TX-TL than in the commercialized TX-TL and therefore confirms that our optimized protocol produces cell extract of high translation efficiency. Although the overall protein expression rate can be observed with this method, the transcription rate has to be determined using a different approach.
Transcription Efficiency
For an excellent quality control, the transcription efficiency of our home made TX-TL was analyzed separately. We used a plasmid containing a malachite green aptamer downstream of a T7 promoter.  The malachite green aptamer, a small RNA transcript, is able to bind a specific ligand, malachite green and enhances its initial fluorescence >2000 fold 5 .
By observing the fluorescence signal over time the transcription levels of different TX-TL batches can be"

Project Description
Streptococcus pneumoniae infection is a leading cause of many pneumococcal diseases such as meningitis, septicaemia and otitis media. According to the World Health Organization, pneumococcal diseases are estimated to be responsible for 1.6M deaths every year. According to National Institutes of Health, 40% to 70% infected children are killed or disabled by this disease in developing countries. To provide an affordable solution to combat pneumococcal diseases, our team came up with ""Pneumosensor"", an engineered E. coli designated to work inside an in vitro diagnostic device that would detect S. pneumoniae.
Pneumosensor achieves its function by making use of quorum sensing pathway components in S. pneumoniae. S. pneumoniae secretes an autoinducer molecule known as Competence Stimulating Peptide (CSP), which activates the comCDE signal transduction pathway and increases the uptake of extracellular DNA during the log phase of bacterial growth. Our team is migrating and rewiring this quorum-sensing mechanism into E. coli to sense and report populations of S. pneumoniae. Alongside this track, we are thoroughly cataloging and characterizing existing riboregulators submitted by previous teams. We believe that this will be useful for other synthetic biologists.
In summary, our team hopes to alleviate the health complications caused by S. pneumoniae by designing and constructing a whole-cell biosensor that can detect S. pneumoniae. Moreover, we are curating existing RNA devices for the benefit of other future iGEM teams and those working in the synthetic biology field.

The Genspace team is made up of community members.
There are four adults on our team, all from various walks of life and none with advanced degrees in biological sciences. None of them had ever heard of synthetic biology prior to joining Genspace, and they have learned the science through our classes and through iGEM participation. There are twelve students from local high schools on the team. They came to Genspace because their schools could not afford to support high school teams and they really wanted to learn synthetic biology and be part of iGEM. None of them had any prior independent hands-on research experience. Genspace has a mission to provide for students like this so participation was on a first-come first-serve basis. The final four team members are college students spending the summer in New York, all of whom are majoring in the sciences. We consider all of these people part of the New York community we serve.

Overview
One of the fundamental bioparts of this project is the aiiA gene, it codes for an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of N-Acyl homoserine lactones, which are quorum sensing autoinducers. The part was registered on iGEM's Parts Registry in 2013, but until now, it's not known whether this gene can be expressed in Erwinia amylovora or not. Two types of aiiA were used in this project: the one uploaded in iGEM's catalog, and the one that we synthesized thanks to sponsorship granted by IDT®. The sequence of the first mentioned is reported as being putative, while the latter's confirmed to codify for our protein of interest; nonetheless, no information is known about the expression of either in Erwinia amylovora. The contribution of this characterization to the existing part (BBa_C0060) as a bronze requisite is supported by the results of the project. In the end, it was concluded that our composite BioBrick (BBa_K2471000) that expresses the Registry's aiiA, successfully works in Erwinia amylovora.
Characterization of BBa_C0060
The characterization of BBa_C0060 was carried out, first, by creating a composite part (BBa_K2471000) capable of expressing the biopart of interest; this was done by the addition of a T7 promoter and RBS (BBa_K525998) and a T1 terminator (BBa_B0010) to the basic part. The design was first done in silico utilizing SnapGene®, where the program indicated that the plasmid would have a length of 3,010 base pairs. After verifying the feasibility of creating this BioBrick, the part was synthesized using the 3A assembly method. Agarose gel (1%) electrophoresis was performed to ensure that the obtained molecular weight"
ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#blog_-_-_TEXT.html," under control of a pluxR promoter, hence it will be transcribed in the presence of LuxR and Lux. To assess crosstalk and leakiness we conducted multiple experiments: after adding one of the three AHLs to the cultures we analyzed the raise in sfGFP production using a microtiterplate reader. In a first step we measured the dose response of constructs with different ribosomal binding sites (RBSs) and with or without riboregulator. We could observe differences not only in sensitivity, but also in leakiness; some strains expressed GFP even without AHL induction. To give an example: we evaluated the sensitivity of the siG0024 strain to different concentrations of 3OC6-HSL (LuxI product) and compared its characteristics to  those of other constructs. Additionally, we measured the sensitivity of siG0024 to 3OC12-HSL (LasI product) and C4-HSL (RhlI product). Indeed, we could observe the induction of sfGFP transcription by comparably low levels of 3OC12-HSL. Crosstalk can be observed between the Las and the Lux system. To simulate a situation most similar to the final experiment, we added the diluted supernatant of AHL producer cells to the test cultures. However, we could not detect any GFP production as reaction to the supernatant. We assume that the AHL concentration is not high enough to induce transcription. By constructing stronger RBSs on the producer plasmids we aim at increasing the AHL production. All these informations we will use to design a system tailored to our plans.
Summary of cross-talk experiments results
The figure shows the dose response of xxx to 3OC12-HSL, 3OC6-HSL and C4-HSL. Both 3OC12-HSL and 3OC6-HSL induce production of GFP, although at different concentrations. This is an example for cross talk between the lux and the las system.

Cry4Aa4 + Extended FMDV
FAFU-China
jacarandasmile@163.com
Cry4Aa is cloned from Bacillus thuringiensis BRC-LLP29. It shows specific toxicity to Culex by bioassay. The Cry protein is consisted of three functional domains. Domain I is a seven α-helices bundle. It can insert itself into a membrane by using its hydrophobic helices α4 and α5 to insert into the phospholipid bilayer. The pore formation occurs on its α3 helix. Domain II and domain III are two β-sheets which are involved in the receptor interactions. Domain II contains extremely variable loops, which are the binding site of the receptor. Domain III has the function of stabilizing the toxin. Cyt proteins have a single α-β domain which do not bind to receptors but can directly insert into the cell membrane and then form a pore causing cell death. Although Cry and Cyt proteins are two big families of δ-endotoxins, they are far related.Cyt1 and Cyt2 are two types of Cyt proteins found in Bti.. Generally, Cry proteins are believed to exert toxicity by interacting with the proteins on the brush border membrane and then insert into the membrane which takes multiple steps. At the beginning in mosquitoes' gut, the crystalline inclusions are cleaved at the disulfide bond to release the Cry pre-toxin. Then the soluble proteins are activated by being cleaved again by intestinal protease. When toxins reach to the brush border membrane microvilli, they bind to the proteins, or known as receptors on the membrane. The binding process takes two step. Firstly, the monomeric Cry toxin binds to cadherin, resulting in the formation of pre-pore oligomer ，Then the oligomer binds to a GPI-anchored APN or ALP. Secondly, the previous binding induces the oligomer insertion into the lipid rafts membrane. A formation of ion permeable pore is followed by the insertion which allows small molecules to pass through the membrane. The membrane potential inevitably changes greatly, causing the swelling of cell and finally breaking down. When the cell lysis reaches to a certain degree, the midgut necrosis and epithelial denaturation follow. Then, the alkaline hypertonic inclusions in midgut enters into hemocoel and the pH of haem"

Solution
In order to combat excess fluoridation of water in third world countries, we envision solutions that utilize the recently discovered fluoride riboswitch, a structured piece of RNA that kind interact with fluoride and regulate the expression of a downstream gene. We envision technologies utilizing fluoride riboswitches that can be used to sequester, bioremediate, or detect fluoride in water. We think these strategies can be used in cell-free and cell based systems. However, before we can work on developing these technologies we first needed to better characterize the responsiveness of fluoride riboswitches and develop a way to select for riboswitches with a higher responsiveness to fluoride.
Introduction
The Impacts of Excess Fluoride:
Fluoride is present in all bodies of water. Within the oceans, rivers, lakes, and groundwater, the mineral is existent and the extent to which fluoride is present depends on the amount of sediments or volcanic rocks being eroded in the area. It is when fluoride concentrations are at the toxic level when health concerns can arise. The FDA recommends that fluoride concentrations in water do not exceed 0.7mg/mL, while the World Health Organization (WHO) limit is 1.5mg/L, and the Environmental Protection Agency designation for contaminated water is 4 mg/L. Fluoride concentrations at or above 1 mg/kg of body weight are deemed poisonous. Ingesting this amount in one sitting requires immediate medical attention. While constantly being exposed to 10 mg/L to 6 mg of fluoride everyday can lead to dental and skeletal fluorosis, in which the teeth and bones decay and deform. More severely, doses above 4.5 mg/kg body weight can cause developmental and reproductive concerns. Therefore fluoride concentrations can affect the growth and the IQ of people. In countries like China, India, and Sri Lanka, water sources are decentralized and residents in some areas experience concentrations of fluoride as high as 30 mg/L (Figure 1).

Waterloo,2013,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," to experts in 3 key industries that use synthetic biology in their processes: Agriculture, Health and Pharmaceuticals.
Bridge the level of discomfort a scientist has in regards to business.
To encourage entrepreneurship within the scientific community by delivering resourceful content from industry experts.
The event promoted open panel discussions of emerging technologies in biotechnology and other advanced biological fields within the 3 industries. Students got a chance to see how synthetic biology is the connected to entrepreneurship, innovation and commercialization. They learned about the industry perspectives and barriers faced by biological companies at different stages in their business model. This talk also encouraged entrepreneurship within the scientific community by delivering resourceful content form industry experts. Each speaker gave a 20-minute mini lecture on topics including: Clinical Trial Drug Development, Commercialization of Biomass and Energy Products and Entrepreneurial Barriers for Biotechnology Companies.
Steve jobs once said, “I think the biggest innovation of 21st century will be the intersection of biology and technology. A new era is beginning, just like the digital one…”. Through sessions such as Intent to Invent, Waterloo iGEM hopes to enrich the experience of science enthusiasts as well as those just curious about synthetic biology and it’s potential. By connecting these students to industry experts, we were able to gage their interests in an innovative and entrepreneurial aspect of science. Many students showed interest in learning more about the bridge between science and business in the future. iGEM received good feedback regarding Intent to Invent, as many students felt that the information they learned was very valuable. Waterloo iGEM provided many students the appropriate connection and information they need to start connecting the scientist in them with the businessman/businesswoman in them.
VeloCity Science
How do we inspire young people to eliminate the gap between science and business? The conventional education system does not provide for this overlap. There is a job unemployment crisis throughout North America, and from the past experience, this is the perfect time to turn to entrepreneurship for solutions. It is time to do what we have done to the IT industry back in the 80s, but with biotechnology  this time. The perfect storm is brewing. Economic downturns have proven to be the best time for entrepreneurship. The Canadian government has seen this and supports entrepreneurial initiatives like these. And most importantly, we have bright young people hungry to make changes to the world.
And that’s why VeloCity Science has been started, an entrepreneurship program that brings together the right business resources (networks, mentorship, legal and financial services, etc.) and the right technical resources (wet-lab space, consumables and equipment) to create kick-ass biotechnology"

Moreover, we have to find the weakest link in the diagnosis process. For now, we should fully develop one case first and then compare it to the next case and adapt the application. We did that by making a roll-out plan for African Sleeping Sickness in Congo and then compared it to the case of Zika virus in Brazil. Also, we could try to develop future scenarios: a best case scenario,  in which everything works out well,  or one in which everything is performed badly.

Implementation
We looked at the future perspectives of our device via SynBio scenarios. Here, we focused on the drawbacks of an open-source iGEM project.

Experts in emerging infectious diseases, One Health, Wageningen University & Research
They endorsed our project and suggested us to look into patents. This includes both existing patents as well as the possibility of patenting Mantis. Moreover, they questioned the robustness of a whole-cell biosensor compared to cell-free. Following this conversation we talked to an intellectual property (IP) expert and looked further into the robustness.

One Health is an initiative which entails a number of Dutch universities and institutes which aim to improve the health in various ways all over the Earth; one of their subjects is the battling of emerging infectious diseases. We discussed our project with three experts. They liked the setup of our project, but also had some concerns: normally antigens and antibodies are screened next to each other. With Mantis, we do not test for antibodies, which might influence the reliability of the test. Furthermore, they thought that bacteria are not always robust enough, and felt like a cell-free system could be of interest for us. They suggested that we look into patents and patenting our new diagnostic test.
► We looked at patents by talking to ir. Paul van Helvert (Intellectual Property manager of Wageningen University & Research). After this conversation we decided that patenting our device would not be feasible at this point due to costs and the open-source mindset of the iGEM competition. Also, we looked into the robustness of a whole-cell biosensor compared to cell-free systems. More can be read in the roll-out plan .

Annexin-Alexa 488 purified

After incubation of the antibody coated beads with the respective bacterial strain or control, we observed our beads using the microscope.
Results
First thing we did was to check the positive (Alexa-488 and beads with antibody and Alexa-488) and negative controls (beads without antibody). We found out that there was no green fluorescence in the positive control, confirming again our fear that the anti-Annexin antibody we are using is not binding as expected. Neither of our samples presented fluorescence from the secondary antibody either. We therefore concluded that the antibody was not very effective to detect annexin bound to another molecule. We came back to our Western blot (see Figure 11), where we used the same antibody, and saw that there were some unspecific bands at about 55 kDa. Also, the expected bands were very weak.
As can be seen in Figure 12, no difference can be seen in fluorescence levels of the beads. Moreover, bacteria have a similar size to bacteria (2.8 µm and 2 µm, respectively), so they would be seen in the microscopy picture if they were there.

INP-Annexin V functionality
Overview
A properly expressed and exported Annexin V protein is the first step towards a bacterial apoptosis detection system. However, the validation of the functionality of Annexin V in this construct is also crucial. We therefore tried several approaches to prove functionality of this construct regarding binding to apoptotic cells. For easy monitoring of our bacteria, we introduced an RFP construct into the same plasmid carrying INP-Annexin V. We published this construct in the registry to allow future iGEM teams to use our bacterial apoptosis detector (BBa_K1847015) for their project.

Cambridge-JIC,2016,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"RNA-Cas9 complex formed. In our proposed chloroplast transformation method, these are both expressed from the same “driver” cassette, introduced into the chloroplast by a transformation method such as biolistic transformation with a gene gun, but under individual promoters (the psaA promoter for the gRNA, and atpA promoter for Cas9). The Cas9 and gRNA then diffuse randomly through the chloroplast until they encounter one another, at which point they form a Cas9:gRNA complex. A further isomerisation reaction must then take place for this complex to become capable of cleavage. This process is modelled in the following 5 equations:
Eqn. 1
Where:
NgRNA is the number of gRNA strands in a single chloroplast
NCas9 mRNA is the number of mRNA strands coding for Cas9 in a single chloroplast
NCas9 is the number of Cas9 molecules in a single chloroplast
Nintermediate is the number of inactive, pre-isomerisation, Cas9:gRNA complexes in a single chloroplast
NCas9:gRNA is the number of active Cas9:gRNA complexes in a single chloroplast
Ndriver is the number of driver cassettes introduced into the chloroplast by a given transformation method
The various k values represent first or second order rate constants
The various δ values represent degradation rates
rc[i] represents the cleavage rate of the ith target site on the chloroplast genome
2. Cleavage rates
Once the Cas9:gRNA active complex has been formed, it is free to diffuse through the chloroplast until it finds a site on the genome. Cas9 uses no external energy source for binding, relying solely on the bound state being an energetically favourable configuration. It will only bind to the site if it “recognises” the PAM – i.e., if the binding of Cas9 to the PAM is energetically favourable (notably, this does not require a perfect match).
Once the site has been “recognised”, Cas9 moves down the genome, unwinding it nucleotide by nucleotide, displacing the complementary DNA strand, and allowing the gRNA to bind in its place (by Watson-Crick base pairing). This is known as R-loop formation. Each mismatch between the gRNA and genome carries an energy penalty. Enough mismatches will make the interaction energetically unfavourable, causing Cas9 to dissociate from the genome and diffuse freely, until it finds another site. If the interaction is still energetically favourable once the R-loop has been formed along the full length"

Human Practices - Gold Award
The Gold HP section is covered in more detail in the Integrated human practices section which can be found here.
In essence we looked to integrating our human practices in two distinct ways - Integrated: Kill Switch and Integrated: Equality and Diversity.
Integrated: Kill Switch
We wanted to integrate Human Practices concepts into our lab work, by interviewing researchers from academia and industry, to see what their ideal kill switch would be, in order for us to embed this into the design of our project. We initially spoke to Dr Tom Ellis of Imperial College London who informed us that kill switches are both correctly classified in Biosafety and they have the capability of being an effective bio-containment measure. He believed that multiple kill switches in one system would have applications in academia because it could reduce the error rates to “less than one in a billion”. Consequently, our idea for an operon of kill switches, with KillerRed and KillerOrange in the same system, was well grounded. Furthermore, this influenced our initial idea for a CRISPR based kill switch as we initially hoped to test the effect of targeting multiple essential genes in the host genome. However, when speaking with Markus Geshater of Synthase Ltd. he argued that multiple kill switches in one system, or even one kill switch in a system, would reduce the efficiency of the protein or molecule they were trying to produce. Consequently, we moved our idea from testing multiple kill switches, to testing whether kill switches themselves can be effective measure in industrial or academic use. We further spoke to Professor Richard Titball who said: “Realistically it is going to have to be a genetically determined biocontainment system”, however he was skeptical of whether kill switches could be made reliable. He did say however that the public should be involved in discussions about assessments for the safety of genetically modified organisms, which prompted us to engage the public with synthetic biology to include them in the debate. Professor Rob Beardmore discussed with us how there would be a functional loss of the kill switch, due to a high selection pressure, which would seriously affect kill switch longevity. Consequently, we set up experiments using the ministat to test the effectiveness of kill switches. More information on their page can be found here.

We decided to model the species (either complex or simple species) using two data structures:
ChainList is used to describe chains of DNA, RNA or Protein molecules. Small molecules are
also of such structure with only one element on one chain.  Tree structure is used to describe binding state of elements of different chains. Children
nodes bind with each other and form their parent node. Thus, other than chains, a species has
its binding state forest, which composed of many trees mentioned above.

Models
Cells in a local population have a wide range of responses to a given stimulus. This variation in cell response may be due to differences in immediate extracellular environment or intracellular molecular makeup. Nevertheless, in spite of local differences in cellular or environmental conditions, cellular systems often hinge on their component cells’ ability to coordinate and respond in a concerted way. For example, all T cells in a lymph node respond to an antigen, yet only those with a strong initial reaction proliferate and activate an immune response [ 1 ].
This phenomenon is also exhibited in quorum sensing by the bioluminescent bacteria V. fischeri. Through symbiosis with the Hawaiian Bobcat Squid, V. fischeri live in light organs at high cell densities. In these high densities, the V. fischeri bacteria can change the concentrations of certain chemicals in their local environment and activate bioluminescence in the entire bacterial population.
In some cases, the decision reaches consensus, and all cells respond the same -- a phenomenon seen in quorum sensing by V. fischeri, for example, where gene expression is coordinated based on signals sensed at particular cell densities. In this example, cell populations somehow overcome the intrinsic biological noise found in all cellular populations and are able to respond in a concerted fashion. Alternatively, decisions can also favor the success of one individual in the group, namely the behavior of T cells in the human immune system. Again, intrinsic biological noise is suppressed as a coordinated and specific response is delivered by the population.

1. iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.
Sustainability: we believe that this is one of the most important issues for software project. So we start with the following three aspects to address this key task:
(1) Exchange ideas with insiders;
(2) Communicate with the people around us;
(3) Outreach synthetic biology to everyone (Game).
In this process, we found a lot of people are interested in our project and we have set up a communication group. After the game, everyone can join the development and maintenance of software by GitHub.
Social justice: we introduced our project and software to others by meet up, activities, and internet. People, which include teachers, students that are from various countries, developers and so on, communicated with us. They thought our software and game are both amazing, meanwhile gave sound advice to us. Thanks for their recommendations to make our project better.
Security: Our server programs can prevent SQL Injection Attack. Besides, all opening API of server only use GET requests to obtain data. So it is security to server host.
For more details, please see human practice page .
2. Address a problem that you would like to co-develop with a wetlab team. This should be a collaboration where the wetlab team posts a problem they are having and your team addresses the issue by creating an online software solution.
The iGEM team SCU_China wanted to study how to reuse the strong SD sequence, and they met two problems: how to find out SD sequence in DNA and analyze the strength of the SD sequence that affects translation issues. Following their collaboration request, we developed an online software based on browser, which is named SD Finder, to address this issue. For more details, please see collaboration page .

The plasmid was linearly amplified by PCR and blunt-end ligation was performed. The ligation was then transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells. Colonies of this transformation were screened with colony PCR which gave a positive result for colony 1 (Figure 4). Plasmid DNA from colony 1 was purified and sent for sequencing, see Figure 5 for the results.
Figure 2: PCR amplification of the ligated part 2 (P2) and part 3 (P3). This was achieved using primers IG0030 and IG0023 . The sequence should be around 1800 bp, which is in line with the picture.
Figure 3: PCR amplification of the whole plasmid (7.7 kb). Primers IG0055 and IG0056 were used. The Gibson assembly mix was used in different dilutions and in duplo. The dilutions 1:10 have bands of the right size.
Figure 4: Colony PCR of colony 1.Primers IG0007 and IG0004 (1.5 kb) were used. Colony 1 seemed to contain plasmids with an insert of the right size.
Figure 5: The alignment of the sequencing results.This image shows the alignment of the sequencing results of plasmids from colony 1 with the original insert design in SnapGene. The blue rectangles indicate deletion sites.
The construct was successfully assembled, however two deletions were present. These deletions that are present in the coding sequence of the Cas13a gene caused a frameshift, resulting in a corrupted transcription of the gene. For further experiments, the Cas13a was purified from a plasmid received from the authors of Gootenberg et al. 2017 . This protein is structurally similar to our envisioned BioBrick, except that our BioBrick is codon optimized for bacterial expression instead of mammalian expression and that the CRISPR array lays downstream the Cas13a coding sequence. Please see the details of our construct on the Cas13a design page .
The CRISPR array with the interchangeable spacer was made a composite and basic part ( BBa_K2306013 and BBa_K2306015 ). This array can serve as the template for future Cas13a BioBricks. Thanks to the two BsaI restriction sites at each end of the spacer, any guide can be easily be made by restriction ligation"

Paris_Saclay,2013,Team:Paris Saclay#ellen interview_-_-_TEXT.html," they use bacteria to clean oil out of  … There are certain industrial practices that produce oil and there is water, and there is oil, and they put them in big vats and they’re trying to dispose of it. And before they dispose of it the bacteria eat the oil, they get to the point where they don’t have any more food and they die, and that’s one stage of the purification process of the material before it can be put in a landfill or whatever. So, if you’re going to do something like that, what’s the problem? That’s a lot different than releasing live organisms into the environment. Anything like that has to be monitored. No one, that I know of, is advocating releasing live GMOs into the environment without any testing or studying of what the consequences would be.
Team Paris Saclay :The last question is about bioterrorism. With open source we could find for example the sequences of dangerous viruses on the internet. Do you think we should be afraid of bioterrorism?
Ellen :Well, there‘s always  going to be somebody out there that wants to do bad things. There are people that are a lot smarter than I am, namely the United Nations and international community, that have looked at this and have made the decisions to release that information. So I am not going to pretend to be smarter than they are.
Team Paris Saclay :Thank you very much, Ellen.
Our conclusion
Thanks to this interview, we learned more about genspace and about the motivation of people who participate to this movment. People from a large diversity of backgrounds can experiment, can learn more about synBio, and design innovative projects. Experiments are controlled and secured. This is an important difference in comparison with biohakers working in their garage. We think that this reglementation shows a mature reflection about the open source in synthetic biology : everyone can make it, but security is the most important thing. After the interview we discussed about the question of DNA property : what are the consequences of putting personal DNA on the internet, can we modify every DNA or can we talk about DNA property (can DNA or its sequence belong to someone or a company)?
We would like to thanks Ellen for answering to our questions. It was a great moment.

Both of the BBa_J61002 and psB1A2 plasmid backbones were also found to have different origin of replications (ORIs).
Table 4. Table outlining the properties of our candidate constitutive promoter variants (CP), including: (i) variant 1 (CP1, BBa_J23100 ) (ii) variant 2 (CP2, BBa_J23119 ) (iii) variant 3 (CP3, BBa_J23110 )
Before we characterised our constitutive promoters, we tried to clone our CP2 promoter into the same BBa_J61002 backbone as CP1 and CP3.  However, after several unsuccessful cloning attempts we decided to proceed with our project using only CP1 and CP3.
Figure 6. Schematic representation of plasmids consist of constitutive promoter (CP) variants: (a) variant 1 (CP1; BBa_J23100 ) (b) variant 2 (CP2, BBa_J23119 ) (c) variant 3 (CP3, BBa_J23110 ) adapted from SnapGene. CP1 and CP3 are present in the BBa_J61002 backbone that contains mrfp1 gene downstream of the promoter and have ColE1 origin. CP2 (BBa_J23119) , is present in the psB1A2 backbone which mrfp1 gene is absent downstream of the promoter and has pMB1 origin.
We performed an mRFP quantification by comparing three technical and two biological replicates of CP1 and CP3. Cultures were first normalised to an appropriate OD and then 200µl of the culture was added to each well. This was to ensure that the initial cell density is uniform for all samples.
An anhydrotetracycline(aTc)-inducible Keasling vector [7], pBbB2k-GFP, was used as a positive control. The vector was induced at mid-log phase at OD600 = 0.4 by adding 50nM/µl of aTC.

Las Embrionarias, como se menciona antes, son obtenidas de un embrión cuando tiene entre 4-5 días de edad.

The experimental methods used for generation of plasmid constructs containing IGEM parts registry promoter (insert name here) as well as the phsABC thiosulfate reductase gene and the terminator are described as follows. The vector containing phsABC was provided to us by the Keasling Lab. This vector underwent two successive single digestions in which each digestion was allowed to proceed overnight. This deviation from the standard double digestion was necessary to insure successful cutting of the phsABC insert out of the provided plasmid. Following these digestions, the DNA components in the digestion reaction solution were analyzed via gel electrophoresis and the dna band that corresponded to the length of the phsABC insert was excised from the gel and gel purified. Plasmid pSB74 which has been shown to posses the highest activity, was also digested and purified in a manner similar to what is described above for the insert. These purified dna segments were then combined in a ligation reaction that used T4 dna ligase to combine the sticky ends of the degenerate restriction sites, allowing for the formation of phsABC insert containing pSB74 plasmid. The resultant plasmid was sequenced and then transformed to increase its concentration. The transformed cells were then miniprepped using the Qiagen miniprep system.   (sequencing) (resistance) This plasmid then underwent an very similar series of steps to insert the promoter and regulatory biobricks. Plasmid Production for Thiosulfate reducase PHS gene: Important part of anaerobic bacterial respiration/metabolism • Studied since 1970's; several plasmids found (ie: phs pEB40, pSB103, pSB77, pSB107 etc) • Thiosulfate reductase is a transmembrane protein involved in the second step of the Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria pathway of thiosulfate reduction. Thiosulfate reductase catalyzes the dissimilatory reduction of inorganic thiosulfate to hydrogen sulfide and sulfite. • 1995, phs locus of Salmonella"

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Project#FRET Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html," to the LasI promoter in front of the protease gene, these autoinducers activate the expression of the TEV protease. This way, our biosensor provides a fast increase in fluorescence intensity by cleavage of GFP-REACh-constructs.
Schematic model of our novel biosensor
Expression of the TEV protease is induced by HSL. The protease cleaves the GFP-REACh fusion protein to elicit a fluorescence response.
Advantages of the novel biosensor:
When P. aeruginosa is detected by our cells, the reporter protein has already been expressed and only waits to be activated. The cleavage reaction catalyzed by the TEV protease is a faster process than expression and correct folding of GFP. Therefore, our sensor cells provide an exceptionally early response.
While a certain concentration of homoserine lactone will produce the same number of gene read-outs and the TEV protease is about the same size as GFP (~27 kDa), one TEV protease can cleave many GFP-REACh constructs per time than fluorescent protein molecules could be expressed and go through fluorescence maturation. Through this additional reaction, we introduce an amplification step into our system. Hypothetically, the TEV protease will enable the production of a much stronger signal in a given time interval.
In parallel, we worked on a model of the respective biosensor system, in order to confirm our hypothesis of a faster and stronger fluorescence response than a conventional biosensor would povide.
The FRET (Förster Resonance Energy Transfer) System
Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), sometimes also called  fluorescence resonance energy transfer, is a physical process of energy transfer. In FRET, the energy of a donor chromophore, whose electrons are in an excited state, is passed to a second chromophore, the acceptor. The energy is transferred without radiation and is therefore not exchanged via emission and absorption of photons. The acceptor then releases the energy received from the donor, for example, as light of a longer wavelength.
In biochemistry and cell biology fluorescent dyes, which interact via FRET, are applied as ""optical nano metering rules"", because the intensity of the transfer is dependent on the spacing between donor and acceptor. FRET can be observed over distances of up to 10 nm. This way, protein-protein interactions and conformational changes of a variety of tagged biomolecules can be observed. For an efficient FRET to occur, there must be a substantial overlap between the donor fluorescence emission spectrum and the accept"

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

The fragments will be frozen and later purified.
We still have not succeed to make BioBricks pyrG and pyrG-DR (used as a marker in fungi), despite different PCR attempts with a high annealing (59°) and low (56°) temperature.
Work for iGEM Copenhagen team
We have established collaboration with the iGEM team from Copenhagen University. We will costumize a number of their BioBricks to use with our Plug 'n' Play system. This is a great way of showing how easy it is to costumize the Plug 'n' Play system for any application, and the Copenhagen team will save a lot of time.  Today we transformed competent E.coli cells with some of the standard biological parts from iGEM, BBa_R0010 , Bba_B0015 and BBa_J52034 , and later we will make them fit the Plug 'n' Play with DNA system.

Simplified summary of the steps to run the algorithm
1. Initialization: Initialize the number of molecules in the system, reactions constants, and random number generators. 2. Monte Carlo step: Generate random numbers to determine the next reaction to occur as well as the time interval. The probability of a given reaction to be chosen is proportional to the number of substrate molecules. 3. Update: Increase the time step by the randomly generated time in Step 2. Update the molecule count based on the reaction that occurred. 4. Iterate: Go back to Step 2 unless the number of reactants is zero or the simulation time has been exceeded.

Imperial_College,2013,Team:Imperial College#Templates#buttons_-_-_TEXT.html,"sulfonate (EMS), which introduces random mutations to a population, the scientists learned that the main contributors in the degradation were propanediol oxidoreductase and glycolaldehyde dehydrogenase. These two enzymes are expressed at low levels in MG1655 but not at all in DH5α. We worked to overexpress these enzymes in MG1655 through directed strain engineering, and also clone the enzymes from MG1655 for more control, by performing our own directed evolution, EMS, rational engineering, and site-directed mutagenesis experiments.

Pathway Goals
<article> Since ethylene glycol (EG) is a potential toxin to any mammals that consume it, we worked to break EG down as efficiently as possible so that none of the ethylene glycol is released into the environment. We have engineered our E. coli to degrade ethylene glycol so that no human intervention is necessary.
Our main goal is for the E. coli to be able to live off PET as the sole carbon source. In order to do this, it must be able to sequester the carbon into its metabolism. In the diagram below, the ethylene glycol binds to the glycolaldehyde reductase to form glycolaldehyde. After, the glycolaldehyde attaches to the glycolaldehyde dehydrogenase to form glycolate. The glycolate goes in to the metabolism via further reactions with glycolate dehydrogenase and malate synthase. The (S)-malate is the final product that is incorporated in to the citric acid (TCA) cycle. As the citric acid cycle propagates, more energy is made for the cell, allowing growth and self-sufficient development on PET.

Our Strain
<article> We wanted to assemble reductase and dehydrogenase to allow a modular system for simplified testing and use when compared to chromosomal testing. In addition to the use of the modular system, the sequencing of Strain E-15 EG3 shows us the other mutations in the chromosome that allow it to utilize ethylene glycol"
Copenhagen,2011,Team:Copenhagen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," p450's theoretically should absorb at 450 nm in their active state, it is in some cases possible to have an active enzyme without observing the peak at 450 nm.
As the CO-measurement shows, there is no peak at 450 nm for the User assembled B1, but we did observe an oxime, indicating that the p450 in fact was active.
We have included a spectrum of an active p450 below. This is what we would have liked to observe. The different lines, are measurements at different times. It takes a little while for the dithionite to reduce the cytochrome. This is why there is an increase in the absorbance at 450 nm. Accordingly there is a decrease at 420 nm, as the cytochrome shifts to absorbing at 450 nm. Also, there is an increase and decrease at 420 and 450 nm, respectively, at the latest measurement. This is due to the enzyme being oxidized and returning to the inactive state.
A1 the iGEM way
After a lot of hard work we lost our A1. The sequencing supposed to confirm the insertion of A1 in the shipping plasmid showed that the gene was not alone. Part of our host bacterias own genome had been inserted as well (or we supposed that that is what the random sequence disturbing our A1 was). Due to limited time we were forced to give up on A1.
Killing fungus
We have prevented fungus growth with oximes.
To qualitatively test whether oximes could prevent fungi from growing, we applied purified oxime to a fungi growing in a culture dish. Water was also applied as a negative control.
The result is shown below, the spot indicating where oxime was applied.
The human Cyps
After extensive research on the topic we were finally able to uptain physical human CYP DNA that was kindly sent to us from Dr. Guengerich from Vanderbilt University in Nashville. Unfortunently we never recieved the sequence information. A few rescue mission was performed: we attempted to sequence the CYPs ourselves with information found on ncbi.com and we then attempted to assemble the device with help from the DTU-2 team But we were under time pressure and even though we actually got the device for human CYP1A1 and CYP2C9 assembled, we have not had the time to produce a prober BioBrick and test it's function (with an A-YES-Assay). We still believe in the project and it has been heartbreaking to accept that we couldn't get it done in time.

St_Andrews,2012,Team:St Andrews#Omega-3-synthesis_-_-_TEXT.html,"algae produce less ω-3 desaturated fatty acids and more saturated fatty acids, as desaturated carbon chains cause a lower melting temperature in membranes (Garwin, Cronan, 1980). Thus, the combination of declining fish stock and a decrease in overall ω-3 fatty acids is making the supply for human nutrition a relevant issue.
Harvesting algae directly is costly and ineffective (Borowitzka, 1997). There is much potential in expressing a metabolic pathway for ω-3 fatty acid synthesis in E. coli, which is cheaper and more accessible.
Recreating the pathway
Figure 4: ""The metabolic pathway to ω-3 fatty acids""
Figure 4 shows the elongation and desaturation enzymes necessary to convert an 18:1 fatty acid, into an poly-unsaturated fatty acid.
modified from Livore et al., 2006
E. coli naturally synthesize unsaturated fatty acids up to a carbon chain length of 18, with a single desaturation (18:1) (Marr, Ingraham, 1969). Valuable ω-3 fatty acids require a double bonds at the third carbon from the end of its carbon chain and can have >20 carbons.
In order to have E. coli synthesize ω-3 fatty acids, we needed to introduce enzymes that could elongate and desaturate fatty acid substrates (cf. Fig. 4).
The genes for Δ12, Δ15 (ω6) and Δ6 were obtained from Synechocystis sp., a cyanobacterium. The trypanosomatid Leishmania major provided the DNA for the ELO 6 gene. Additionally, we used Trypanosome cruzi as a secondary source of Δ12.
However, our first successful ligations of Δ12 did not provide us with the expected 18:2 fatty acid. We hypothesized that E. coli’s inherent 18-carbon chain fatty acid might not be suited as a substrate for Δ12 – the double bond is in a different position, the 11th. Therefore, we ""fed"" our cells with suitable 18:1, to then observe 18:2 fatty acid, and ultimately ω-3 desaturation, in the mass spec results!

The government of the United States of America is the federal government of the republic of fifty states that constitute the United States, as well as one capital district, and several other territories. The federal government is composed of three distinct branches: legislative, executive, and judicial, whose powers are vested by the U.S. Constitution in the Congress, the President, and the federal courts, including the Supreme Court, respectively. The powers and duties of these branches are further defined by acts of Congress, including the creation of executive departments and courts inferior to the Supreme Court.

iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.

For example, a DNA coding sequence is linked not only to its product, the translated domain, but also to its origin (organism, plasmid etc.) Additionally, a coding sequence can also be connected to another coding sequence. This ‘parent’ sequence is a predecessor of the stored sequence that already underwent biosynthetic modification. On the domain level there is an upstream link to the coding sequence but also to the specific type of domain (e.g. thioesterase or the condensation domains). Some Domains, such as adenylation domains, also point at monomers, based on their substrate specificity. Subsequently, for these substrates we store their chirality, modification and if they are proteinogenic or not, e.g. histidine or ornithine (see Fig. 2 ).  To enable the NRPSDesigner to use information from outside of the database it is equipped with global identifiers. For organisms we saved the NCBI taxon id, while for BioBricks the unique identifier in the Parts registry. To integrate the content with other databases, we created for every layer a linkout entry that consists of a type and specific identifier. The linkout type includes a description of the corresponding resource, as well as a URL, which in combination with the specific identifier enables the cross-linking of each database entry to other resources. The most common linkout types are Norine and Pubchem IDs for the substrates, PFAM IDs for the domain types and GenBank identifiers for the coding sequences.
For visualization of the NRPS domains and the chemical structures of the substrates by Open Babel [12] we added a JSON representation of each domain, based on the Pfam Graphics library and the SDF (structure data file) format, respectively.

Introducing Synthetic biology & BioWatcher at Hsinchu Girls Senior High School
Bringing the innovative projects in lab to the pubic is a step forward to adapting the ideas into reality. On one hand, practicality of the project is examined. On the other hand, it’s extremely exciting to spread the fun and the possibility of solving the unsolved using biology. Hsinchu Girls Senior High School collects top students in this city. With passion, we help the clever youngsters to get a glimpse of the amazement synthetic biology brings and hope to bring enthusiastic new bloods into the field.
On August 14th,we introduced synthetic biology, how it affects the world, how biobricks are built in lab, our project—BioWatcher and iGEM to these brilliant students. Upon the discussion about BioWatcher, the students were so excited and many questions were raised.
Since our project highly concerns health issue, we aim to raise public awareness about the importance of early diagnostics and early treatment. At the end of the session, we gave a quick survey about their blood test frequencies. It turned out that, as expected, only a few of them get blood tests regularly in hospitals and further confirm the necessity of BioWatcher.

In high-[Tet]-high-[TM] condition, sequence between two loxPs is inverted and both CMV and pTRE are ready to transcribe their new down stream neighbor. Transcripts of C are then knocked down by Tet-induced shRNA, leaving D as final reporting signal.
Where should we add MCS_A into this 2-input-3-output sketch? We can simply put MCS_A ahead of pTRE, where it can be transcribed initially until CMV is inverted and face MCS_C.However, it is reported that polymerase collision may have effect on transcription, and this is what exactly going to happen in high-[Tet]-low-[TM] condition. To avoid polymerase collision, we designed a “plan B” by adding an orthogonal loxP variant, namely lox2272.
In planB, MCS_B and MCS_A is placed between one loxP and one lox2272 right downstream their corresponding promoters, theoretically avoid polymerase collision. Cre recombinase will execute an inversion followed by an excision when TM is added, presenting new neighbors to both pTRE promoter and CMV promoter.
 
Application
Here we have the circuit and next step is to figure out how to use it. The main feature of this circuit, whether in form of remove-model or inversion-model, is that it can make different response to 4 different permutations of 2 orthogonal input signals, namely separate 4 different input states. This feature will be very useful when operate properly.
The very first idea come to us is to make it a multi-output parallel logic gate. As described in [Design] section, the only thing we need to do to construct a single-output logic gate, such as an AND gate, is to insert target reporter gene into expression cassete D and do nothing to all other cassetes. Base on similar law, almost every common logic gate can be constructed. If we use some linker in expression cassetes, such as T2A linker, to produce multiple output reporter signal within single expression cassete, then we will get a circuit performing boolean calculation for multiple output simultaneously within only one layer.
Inducible cell differentiation:
As the “2 inputs and 4 outputs” logic circuit is completed, it will be applied to make a cell conversion machine named “iGemage”. In that machine, we replaced Gene A with OSKM(Oct4,Sox2,Klf4 and c-Myc), the four genes that can induce somatic cells to be reprogrammed into"
TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Model#Off Targeting_-_-_TEXT.html," Delft computer clusters for simulating the off-target effects of our crRNAs on the genomes of different relevant organisms (genomes retrieved from NCBI): Escherichia coli BL21 (4.5 mln basepairs (bp)), Staphylococcus aureus (2.8 mln bp), Staphylococcus epidermis (2.5 mln bp) and chromosome 27 of the domestic cow (Bos taurus, 45 mln bp). E. coli BL21 is a commonly used lab strain, which was the strain containing the tetracyclin resistance-conferring (TcR) plasmid that we designed the crRNA for. S. aureus and S. epidermis are common pathogens in mastitis , while genetic material from the cow itself may also be present when detecting sequences in cow samples, for example milk. Scanning the entire genome allows to investigate if tiny local off-target effects together influence the reliability of the output signal.
In Figure 6, we present $P_{FP}$ for our crRNA sequences for the different genomes/chromosome. In general, we find off-target cleavage probabilities below 1 in 100.000 for the bacterial genomes. As expected, the $P_{FP}$ is generally larger for the Bos taurus chromosome 27, which is approximately tenfold larger than the bacterial genomes, but reaches a maximum of 1 in 1000. As such, we conclude that the probability of a false output is low and likely does not compromise the usability of the Cas13a-mediated detection system.
In Figure 6: Off-target cleavage probability (relative to on-target) for crRNA 1 to 4 on the genomes of four organisms.$P_{FP}$ for different crRNAs and genomes of four organisms ($\Delta C = 0.25, \Delta I = 2.5$). For crRNA 3 and 4, the off-target cleavage probability on the
Bos taurus<\it> is highest, which we could have expected as it has the most basepairs and therefore most sites for potential off-target activity. Despite the size of the genomes, ranging from 2.5 to 45 million basepairs, even the cumulative off-target effects do not result in a high probability of a false positives output.
The simulations so far indicate the detection system to be reliable, i.e. have a low probability of yielding a false-positive output. However, insufficient data are available to accurately determine the model fit parameters. In addition, experimental validation is lacking. As such"
UCSD_Software,2014,Team:UCSD Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," below), and the search algorithm can create an operon path using either or both of the activation methods. This search algorithm continues until either: the search algorithm concludes that there is no operon path that can lead to the production of the output species; or an operon path producing the output species is found.
Linear Successional Activation Search (LSAS)
The search algorithm uses linear successional activation search (LSAS) to generate an operon path in which the output species of a preceding operon produces all of the required input species for the succeeding operon. LSAS extends an operon path by adding only operons that can be activated by the species produced by the last operon in the path. Thus, for each potential activated operon by the input species, LSAS uses a tree data structure in searching an operon path. From an input species (or multiple input species with an AND relationship), LSAS builds a tree, and if an output species is found in the process of growing the tree, the path from the root operon to the leaf operon that has produced the output species is returned as a resulting operon path. Finally, this resulting set operon paths is used to construct a Petri net path including all of the input species, input transitions, input transition logic, operons, output transitions, output transition logic, and output species.
Nonlinear Successional Activation Search (NLSAS)
An operon may not produce all of the input species required for an activation of another operon. Yet, multiple operons may together produce all of the required input species for the other operon. Here, each of the activating operons produces some, but not all, of the required species for the activated operon. The search algorithm captures such operon activation mechanism using nonlinear successional search (NLSAS) in building an operon path. As LSAS, NLSAS also uses a tree data structure, but appends an operon whose input species, or activation requirements, are produced by any of the preceding operons in the path. While NLSAS assumes no degradation of the species in the system, it allows for a wider range of operon sets that could produce our desired output from our given input. As a result, each resulting operon path can be linear or nonlinear. Since a NLSAS result captures operon activation in which a single or multiple preceding operons produce species required for the activation of a succeeding operon, LSAS result is a subset of a corresponding NLSAS result.

Georgia_Tech,2012,Team:Georgia Tech#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," was successful for both primers. EMBOSS Needle was used to align sequencing results to the expected sequence for the part (see attached sequencing data).
The sequence from VF2 from bp 331 to 1099 aligned with the expected sequence from bp 1 to 752 with 92.2% identity. However, it was noted that the region from 332 to 404 bp on the VF2 sequence aligned imperfectly with the expected sequence for that region (1 to 75 bp in the expected sequence for the part).  This region is supposed to include the sequence for the PLlac 0-1 promoter (R0011)
However, a comparison between the expected sequence (aattgtgagcggataacaattgacattgtgagcggataacaagatactgagcaca) against the VF2 sequence (agttctggcaggtttggccgcgggttctttttggtacacgaaagc) reveals very little identity (43.1%). This leads us to believe that the promoter region (R0011) for LasR expression is missing and that the part will not function as expected. A BLAST search the VF2 sequence suggests the part does contain the LasR coding sequence (C0079). Directly upstream of the LasR coding sequence is the ribosomal binding site (B0034) which appears to be the correct sequence. However, upstream of the ribosomal binding site, the VF2 sequence BLASTs to the P. aeruginosalasB gene starting at 247 bp. Upstream of lasB appears to be vector sequence. Nowhere in the sequence is the PLlac 0-1 promoter region (R0011).
The VR sequence (reverse complement) from 1 to 939bp aligns with the expected sequence from 1059 to 2047bp with 97.7% identity. There appears to be no significantly misaligned region. The VR sequence appears to contain the correct sequences for the LasR+PAI promoter (R0079), the ribosomal binding site (B0032), GFP (E0040), and the transcriptional terminator (B0010 and B0012).

Contact with Veterinarians
Cataracts affect millions of people’s lives as a result of aging and diseases; however, many pet owners come across the problem of their pets suffering from cataracts as well. To alleviate this problem, we investigated if the potential benefits of our solution can be applied to domestic animals as well.
As we continued to develop our project, we also hoped to treat cataracts in animals. We consulted with veterinarians at clinics around Taipei. We visited two veterinarian clinics, (Nicholas Animal Hospital and Tai Pu Veterinarian Hospital) and asked various others about the viability of our project. From these interviews we learned that there are already commercial eye drops available, which are prescribed for pets, but that these are not very effective. One of the drugs developed is called Ocluvet(R), which we purchased and used in our experiments to compare to our own treatment design.

Contact with Science Researchers
Researchers’ firsthand knowledge, regardless of how many papers one reads on PubMed, provides a better understanding on specific topics of research. Thus, in order to gain a better understanding of specific areas of our project, we contacted researchers to learn more about 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) and Chitosan nanoparticles.
Dr.  Jason Cyster is a professor of Microbiology and Immunology at University of California, San Francisco; School of Medicine.
Dr. Jason E. Gestwicki is an associate professor in the Department of Institute of Neurodegenerative Diseases at University of California, San Francisco; School of Medicine.
Our questions were primarily focused on how 25HC works on the molecular level. We asked questions such as: what are the current researches conducted that uses 25HC?  To what extent is 25HC responsible for reversing protein aggregation? And what are effective methods for 25HC storage?  Both professors gave thorough responses on these questions, which we then used in our experiments. One response that was particularly helpful from Dr. Cyster was his suggestions on effective ways to store 25HC, in which he provided us with a recommended storage temperature. Dr. Gestwicki also provided us with two published papers that helped us understand the mechanism by which 25HC reverses cataract formation and this helped elucidate our understanding of 25HC.

Biodegradability
Introduction ● Methods ● Results ● References ● BioBricks
Creating a biodegradable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) will reduce collateral waste, lightening the footprint of unmanned science missions on planetary environments and micro-ecosystems. Since we are using Bacterial Cellulose Acetate (BCOAc) for the construction of our UAV, we investigated in nature to find organisms that can naturally break down Cellulose Acetate. We found out that Niesseria sicca uses cellulose acetate as its carbon source by producing two genes that break down cellulose acetate. The first gene is Cellulose Acetate Esterase which de-acetylates BCOAc, and the second is Endo-1,4-beta-glucanase, a cellulase that breaks down the glycosidic linkages in cellulose to produce glucose monomers.
Figure 1. This image describes the degradation process, with the esterase enzyme de-acetylating cellulose acetate, and the cellulase enzyme breaking down the cellulose into glucose monomers.
In order to trigger the onset of degradation our UAV at specific conditions, we investigated pressure-sensitive promoters for their abilities to stimulate degradation upon impact and time-sensitive promoters that will control the amount of time the UAV should fly before it degrades. After a series of experimentations, we chose to use quorum sensing as a time delay mechanism to control the length of time our UAV can fly before degradation enzymes are produced.
Approach & Methods
We extracted the esterase and cellulase gene sequences from Niesseria sicca and transformed them in E. coli. Since the genes were synthesized with a T7 promoter, we induced the expression of the proteins by adding IPTG to the cell cultures. The Esterase was successfully purified and its presence was confirmed by observing a band at 43kDa when a protein gel was run. The activity of the Esterase enzyme was tested by soaking in blue stain reagent and testing for intensity of the stain. As for cellulase, we are currently working to express the cellulase in E. coli so as we can purify it and test its activity.
In addition to working with the degradation enzymes, we created a mechanism where quorum sensing can cause a needed time delay for degradation so that our"

We first check the growth curve of E coli containing our biobricks with various tetracyclin concentration. We grow them in Luria Broth (LB) and measure them continuously using plate reader. The data is shown in biobricks section. With gradually increasing in tetracylcin concentration,the growth is slowing down and eventually turning negative.
We then check the growth curve of E coli containing our biobricks with various Nickel ion concentrations. We grow then in Luria Broth (LB) and measure them continuously using plate reader. The data is shown in biobricks section. With gradually increasing in Nickel ion concentration,the growth is slowing down and eventually turning negative.
We fit the growth rate to the exponential growth phase of each sample  with 10 ug/ml tetracyclin and plot them against the mean GFP level, which representing the tetA level. It is shown in the left figure below. It clearly shows the positive correlation between growth rates of E coli and the levels of tetA, an transporter that pump tetracyclin out of E coli. This is what we expected. We then fit the growth rate to the exponential growth phase of each sample with 4.5 mM Nickel ion and plot them against the mean GFP level, which representing the tetA level. It is shown in the right figure below. Most of the biobricks fit the negative relation between tetA and growth rate with Nickel. However, the trend is not as robust as with tetracyclin. In addition, even with lowest tetA level, there is still toxic effect with nickel, which reduced the significance of tuning growth rate via tuning tetA. We will try to find out why.
We use a zeocin resistant gene and external zeocin to tune the cell growth rate. The common antibiotic resistant genes are reserved for plasmid backbones. GFPuv is used to monitor the expression of zeocin resistant gene. In addition, zeocin resistant gene allosterically inhibitor the effect of zeocin, makes it easy to be quantified and mathematically modeled.
From the data we can see that when the concentration of zeocin is less than 5000ug/ml, the number of the cells is large enough and increase slowly. But when the concentration of zeocin is more than 5000ug/ml, the cells’ number decrease rapidly. It means that when the concentration of Zeocin is not too high, the cells can grow well.

Azobenzene is an organic molecule which responds to light and selectively photoswitches from an extended Trans conformation to a more compact Cis conformation.
Background
In the dark, at equilibrium, azobenzene is >99% trans. Irradiation at specific short wavelength causes ~90% to switch to the cis isomer. Irradiation at longer wavelengths and/or thermal relaxation causes the molecule to return to the trans isomer.
Figure1: Photochromism of azobenzene derivatives and energetic profile for the switching process.
iGEM new azobenzene synthesis breakthrough
Most azobenzene-based photoswitches use UV light for photoisomerization. This limits their application in biological systems, where UV light be harmful to the cell. Substitution of all four ortho positions with methoxy groups in an amidoazobenzene derivative leads to a substantial (~35 nm) red shift. This red shift makes trans-to-cis photoswitching possible using green light (530-560 nm). The cis state is thermally stable with a half-life of ~2.4 days in the dark in aqueous solution. Reverse (cis-to-trans) photoswitching can be accomplished with blue light (460 nm), so bidirectional photoswitching between thermally stable isomers is possible without using UV light at all. Our team synthesized this azobenzene molecule by ourselves.
Bacteria-azobenzene connection
We attached the azobenzene molecules to the bacteria's modified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the outer-membrane. Azobenzene reacts with the Kdo sugar of the LPS giving stable amide bonds of azo-bacteria connections. Amide bonds cannot form at room temperature. To overcome this we used an EDC catalyst. EDC is used to form amide bonds between peptides. We could not find any information about how much EDC molecules are safe for E.coli so we performed a series of experiments to check the concentration range of EDC that is safe for a bacterial culture and used it to attach the azobenzene to the E.coli's LPS.
Diagram A: azobenzene attaches to KDO sugers
We run a concentration gradient of EDC along with Top10 bacteria, 1 is the highest concentration of EDC, 2 is the lowest concentration of EDC. As you can see in the tubes 1 and 2 we did not get a bacterial growth, but in 3"

We would also like to thank IDT for their support providing us with the free g-blocks of the parts we used in the lab work. Without the quick arrival of the DNA, we would have been unable to complete our lab work efficiently.
Human Practice Advisors:
Module-
There were various people who helped us and gave us advice on creating a synthetic biology module for second years. Thank you to Dr Mark Ramsdale, Dr Caitlin Kight and Dr Nicky King for advice in the initial planning stages of the module and further to Dr Paul James and Professor John Love for championing our module at later stages to ensure we have the best possible chance of getting it implemented. A special thanks to all the lecturers we met and frightened by proposing they become module coordinator for the module!
Board Game-
As the board game was the longest running project, there are many people we need to thank. First of all to Ms Hayley Andrews and those at The Judd School who allowed us to test the first prototype of our board game, and later for her advice about getting it distributed to schools across the UK. We also want to thank all those who helped us design and make the initial and later prototypes of the board game and to Damien Riddle of Edexcel, who gave us backing to create a Stretch and Challenge tool for students and teachers. Dr Mark Ramsdale deserves a big thank you as he provided us with the funds necessary to print off board games and cards for widening participation activities. Dr Alice Mills was essential, both in the early stages and the late in helping us find schools to test our board game in. Dr Caitlin Kight also provided some good advice on how best to distribute the board game and ways we could make it more accessible. On the same note, we would like to thank all those who came up with brilliant ideas on improving our board game design and implementation, like Dr Sara Burton. We are especially grateful of Colyton Grammar School for agreeing to have us for a less and testing the latest version of BioMech as well as Tyrone Middle School in Florida and Bishop Wand C of E sixth form.
Public Engagement-
We would like to thank all the people - academics, researchers and public figures - who were interviewed or recorded Desert Island Science podcasts with us; we wouldn’t have had a public engagement human practices without you. Dr Caitlin Kight, Ben May, Duncan Sandes, Grace Williams have all been influential at one point in improving our interaction with the public and students, especially Ben May in helping set"

HokkaidoU_Japan,2015,Team:HokkaidoU Japan#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"MOs in Japan
In Japan, our home country, some specific kinds of GM crops are allowed to go on sale by the government. In addition, food corporation needs to specify “This is GM Food” only if the foods meets two condition.
A GMO is used as top three of builders’ weights.
A GMO is accounting above 5% of total weight.
This means that Japanese consumers may be putting GMOs in their mouth without recognizing it.
The Unfair Recognition to GM Food in Japan
If you’ve learned biology, you must know that foods which we eat are digested by some kinds of enzymes step by step. Of course, DNA contained in our foods we eat is also digested, and they become too short to exert their function, for example, expressing proteins. From this fact, we can say that modified genes itself cannot affect us badly by eating.
Though there is still a possibility that the proteins expressed from modified genes become unknown antigen for human beings and affect badly, there has not been a report that says anyone got any illness or died from GMOs in the two decades after initiation of GMOs' production. Following this background, in North America and China, large amount of GM crops are produced and consumed every day. On the other hand, Japanese people still have intense aversion to GMOs and tend to reject it.
Problems
As above, Japanese consumers tend to avoid GMOs without any specific reason and evaluate them unfairly without considering the benefit of them. We thought that it is a very big program since GMOs could be a solution for upcoming food crisis expected sometimes in the future.
Survey
This year, our team conducted a survey to research the reorganization of GMOs among Japanese consumers. We took our survey in Sapporo, Hokkaido, around our university campus and Odori Park.
Actual questionnaires are shown on below as pdf file.

Prospect
Do you know what GMO is?
In Japan, people not likely to think of ""genetically modified organisms"" or ""genetically modified foods"" when hearing  the term “GMO”. It may be because “GMO” is the abbreviation of English words, and they are  unfamiliar for us, Japanese. However even we ask about “Idenshi kumikae (gene recombination in Japanese)"", nobody was able to explain it well.

This part is likely to work well when combined with the Kozak sequence from the same gene (<partinfo>BBa_K792001</partinfo>, see above), as the natural 5' end of the MFα1 transcript is reconstituted. Also, because it is a yeast gene, it can be used as is, without any optimization.

our contribution
Trojan peptide
Trojan peptides are short (15aa) sequences that penetrate through the plasma membrane inside the cell without the need of any receptor or endocitosis process [Derossi 1998].  We want to use them to increase the efficiency with which the payload enters the target cell. Ideally, they should not contain Trp or His, as those are the relevant amino acids for exportation. Two good candidates are the penetratin from the HIV TAT protein, and polyarginine [Jones et al 2005].

This proteins are not from yeast, so we needed to retro-translate them and codon-optimize them for expression in yeast. To do this we used the R package geneGA , that takes into account codon usage and messenger secondary structure in the optimization process.

Payloads
The payloads are the elements of the synthetic gene that code for the “amino acid rich” region of the secreted protein. By “a.a. rich” we mean, rich in the amino acid we want to export, Trp or His in our case. These domains should be soluble enough not to cause precipitation of the protein, and should be relatively stable not to be degraded before they are actually secreted from the cell.
We have used and contributed 4 new payload biobricks.
