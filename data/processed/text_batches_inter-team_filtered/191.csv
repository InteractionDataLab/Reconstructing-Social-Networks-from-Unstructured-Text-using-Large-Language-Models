Today, I did a colony PCR of the construct of E1010-B0015 and a gel electrophoresis of the colonies on the plate. The gel results came up as shown to the right. The bands that appeared were approximately 400 bp in size. The expected size was approximately double that of the size that appears. This indicates that the construction was unsuccessful or the PCR was unsuccessful. It should be redone. I also made overnight cultures of the colonies of E1010-B0015 before knowing that it was unsuccessful. These will be Miniprepped tomorrow and run on through agarose gel electrophoresis to check once again if it was successful or not.
Alex, Patrick, Raida
We did a new gel electrophoresis of the cpxP promoters that we isolated from the PCR product yesterday. The bottom half turned out quite dark, so we did an ethidium bromide stain of the gel, which made the image much clearer. The pieces are approximately 200bp long, where we expected approximately 161bp. Thus, we did a PCR purification of the product. We obtained two tubes with concentrations of 13.2 and 14.6 ng/μL.

II. About the project itself
It really encourages us that the interviewees are surprisingly supportive of our theme. Nearly all the interviewees think highly of our experimental design, of which about 90% are willing to support us financially. Apart from this, they would also follow our Wechat official account and use products made by the decomposed cyanobacteria as well.
Analysis of the online and offline research
After the offline and online research, we gained lots of insights on how to improve our experiment design and increase people's awareness on the problem. First of all, we learned that a large proportion of our citizens have no idea about synthetic biology in general and the problem of cyanobacteria pollution: to help with such problem, we subsequently set up our official wechat account hoping that the articles we post within could help remove such ignorance and indifference. Moreover, people's concern about the environmental cost, effectiveness, efficiency and repeatability of the method pushed us to make our experimental design more suited to fulfill the public's requirement.
A ""cyanobacteria-eliminating"" system with our device
Through our painstaking experiment, we were able to create a prototype of the device, equipped with multiple environmental factors best suited for the full functioning of the immobilized lysozyme. Even though due to limited time we had, we were not able to fully test the subsequent processing(high speed centrifugation, components' self-precipitation, etc) of the end products including chemicals, buffer, and cyanobacteria components, it is thrilling enough to know that we are able to integrate a cyanobacteria lysis enzyme into a system that would fully lyse the formidable cyanobacteria into its valuable components. The full potential that the integrated device could achieve is up to future study and research to decide.
（Our integrated device: 1. Immobilized enzyme(lysozyme processed nickel beads, cross-linking or entrapment; 2. Pump; 3. Reaction mixture reservior including cyanobacteria）
As we have stated before, the problem of cyanobacteria pollution is a complex issue, and existing methods could resolve some, but not all, parts of the problem. Since our device could resolve the particular issue of unprocessed salvaged cyanobacteria and turn them into valuable components and metabolites, we could add our model into the design of a well functioning cyanobacteria- eliminating system. This system, as indicated in the diagram below, is composed of the human regulation on the disposal of chemicals into the water, the addition of diverse fish species"

Description
6th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference
Date: Jul. 30 – Aug. 2, 2018 Location: National Chung Hsing University
On behalf of my team, great thanks to every participant who shares their values and exchange opinions with us. Also, all thanks to NCHU to host such a wonderful conference for all of us!
After the lecture of TAS-Taipei team, which is at the same age as us, we were extremely shocked by their expertise as well as confidence when answering tough questions from the public. Every member knows their project and experiment well and in depth. They could clearly clarify their project!
Therefore, we know we still have a lot to learn and improve. Actually, we have no more than 2 months to finalize our project. Although it takes time and effort, we'll try to pursue our goal!
The following are some point of views from other teams or experts: 1. Biosafety: Consider the safety on how you design your product and ensure every step is carefully decided. A good survey could help you check out whether your prototype convinces people. 2. Questions: - Does the mosquito digests HIV quickly? - Do you rear the mosquito and modify its genome when it's at birth? - Or do you inject the DNA into its guts? How about the stability? 3. Comments in PPT presentation: - Images speak louder than words! - control body language on the stage - Slide numbers are important - design a flow in presentation slides - present your idea in a story-telling way Reflection:
It's a great honor to be a co-organizer of Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference, which was held in National Chung Hsing University by team NCHU-Taichung. Through listening to other teams’ presentation, we learned more details about"

GMOs‘s regulation in France
Our collaboration with the team Valencia_UPV started in August. We discussed about our projects over a Skype on the 3rd of August. Due to the different application areas, it was complicated to set up an experimental or model collaboration, but we could help each other on our Human Practices projects.                        We asked them to inform local winemakers and viticulturists about our project and get their opinion on our project’s potential impact using the survey we created. They contacted three winemakers from Utiel-Requena (Valencia) and La Rioja; they presented our project Softer Shock and asked them their opinion.  See feedbacks here LINK (to our wiki).                       On our side, we answered to the few questions they had to complete their Human Practices project.                      These questions helped them to have an overview about how their project will be seen in other countries depending on the regulation.
""The collaboration has helped us to define a part of our Human Practices. We wanted to know the social opinion about GMO crops and the current situation about their human consumption in each part of the world. That's important for us because our project depends on it social acceptation.""

Bioethics & Synthetic Biology opinion by experts
Our collaboration with Team Greece began with a mutual interest in our projects, which we discussed over a Skype call on October 16. Due to the completely different application areas there was little room for an experimental or model collaboration, but we could help each other on our Human Practices projects.                      We asked them to inform local winemakers and viticulturists about our project and get their opinion on our project’s potential impact using the survey we created. They contacted three winemakers from Krini and Trikala and another from Thessaloniki (Greece); they presented our project Softer Shock and asked them their opinion.                       On our side, we presented their project “pANDORRA” to some of our human practices contacts and forwarded their surveys, one to bioethics experts and regulators and another to synthetic biology experts.                     These surveys helped them get an overview of how regulation linked to their project works in France and also to have information about synthetic biology related to their project from French experts.

Professor Miha Mraz, one of the instructors  of 2010 iGEM Slovenia team from University of Ljubljana, visited Peking  University on June 17th, 2011. At the Center for Theoretical  Biology, He gave a talk on the introduction to Slovenia and University of  Ljubljana, the experience of previous iGEM Slovenia teams, and modeling and  bifurcation analysis of biological systems. Prof. Miha Mraz’s visit has surely  promoted the link and communication between Slovenia team and Peking University  team.
 
IGEM CHINA 2011 Held in Hefei
Four team members of Peking_R team, along with the instructor Haoqian Zhang, attended iGEM 2011 China Meetup at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) on July 30th-31st, 2011.        The Meetup invited several professors and graduate students to give us talks on current status, challenges and prospects of synthetic biology. Besides, each team gave a brief introduction to its project, and all the attendants participated into discussions and giving suggestions. Our instructor, Haoqian Zhang, gave a talk on forward and reverse engineering approaches in synthetic biology. Shuobing Chen, our team leader, gave a brief talk on our project, softcoding design in synthetic biology.        After this two-day Meetup, we have learned a lot from other iGEM teams from China, and we hope we can have more discussions with them in the following summer!

2.5 uL of forward oligo
2.5 uL of reverse oligo
1 uL of 10 uM dNTPs
1 ng of template DNA

- 15 seconds per kb at 72 degrees/
- 10 minutes at 72 degrees - 1 cycle
The PCR products of both the insert and the linearized plasmid were then combined in equimolar amounts and a CPEC was done on the combination.
Transformation:
5 uL of each of the CPEC reactions were then loaded onto Millipore (type VSWP) drop dialysis film with 0.025 μm on ~40 uL of ultra-pure Milli-Q water for desalting over the course of one hour. 2 uL of dialyzed DNA along with 30 uL of electrocompetent DH10B cells for half and BLR cells for the other half were transferred to Bio Rad 0.1 cm gap Gene Pulser cuvettes for electroporation and kept chilled. Electroporation was conducted with a Bio-Rad MicroPulser Electroporator set to pulse on the bacteria setting. After electroporation, the cells were immediately transferred to 200 L of TB and placed in a 37° incubator to recover for an hour. The cells were then added to LB agar plates with kanamycin and spread with ~10 sterile glass beads per plate. The beads were then dumped into 70% ethanol and the plates were allowed to dry in the incubator at 37 degrees for 30 minutes with the lid side up. The plates were then flipped lid side down and incubated at 37 degrees overnight.
Checking for colonies and sequencing:
The resulting plates yielded very few colonies (1-3) for the BLR strains that did have colonies and the DH10B strains with too many to count. A colony from each plate was selected and grown overnight in 2 mL culture tubes with kanamycin. The cultures were then miniprepped with the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit and sent to Eurofins for sequencing. The colonies from the BLR strains showed rec"

METU_Turkey,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software_-_-_TEXT.html," the main graph has been presented on the right     hand side of the diagram. These features classify our graphs as disconnected     graphs [1].
Fig. 3: A zoomed in screenshot showing two sub-graphs within     the disconnected graph.
""Semi-Simplicity""
A simple graph is a graph in which no more than one edge contains     the same set of nodes. So, in a simple graph it is not possible to find     more than one edge with the same source and the same target. Additionally,     an edge with the same source and target, forming a loop is not allowed.     But, in synthetic biology it is possible to construct a device consisting     of devices or bio bricks of the same species or type. Accordingly, our     graphs are simple graphs with an exception of possible self-containing     loops, where the edge starts from and ends on the same node. Our graphs     have an exception of having loops and due to this permitted flexibility     our graphs are ""semi-simple"".
For general information about graphs refer to:

Results
In order to develop BioGuide algorithm, there was a need to      reorganize and normalize parts information database in partsregistry.org.      Information of the parts was processed and developed from partsregistry.org      which includes the PartID, PartName, RFC values, etc , designer      and contact information and parameters to build a standardized template      for our algorithm to run smoothly.
Database standardization is done by analyzing iGEM Spring 2010      distribution and collecting information needed for the standardized      parts. Also new parameters are assigned according to parts input-output      model like : Inducer, Activator, Repressor, Inhibitor
For each promoter we have assigned their inducers or repressors      as input and for protein generator parts we have assigned generated      proteins as output which maybe activator or repressor of other devices.
iGEM devices are depicted in pictorial forms called flowcharts,      encapsulation of implementations , decision branching and direction      are milestones of our algorithm. Following flowcharts are the high      level representations of our algorithms developed for the BioGuide      software.
We run our algorithm on the real combination dataset in order      to build our input/output relations graphs. We also collected the      subpart assembly order, such as 1st: promoter, 2nd:rbs, 3rd:coding      seq, any internal parts and the Last: terminator. Each specific      Biobrick type has been assigned a number as a unique image ID from      1 to "

Collaboration with Team WPI-Worcester
This data is a result of our collaboration with Team WPI-Worcester. They gave us two copies of the same construct, in different antibiotic resistant backbones. This construct expresses BclA-YFP , a cell surface targeted protein that expresses YFP on the cell surface. Our intention was to compare BclA expression with expression of our internal YFP control (J23104+BCD2+YFP+B0015). As evident from Figure 4, the Internal YFP has an expression of over 2 * 10^4 MEFLs, while none of the BclA constructs have expression more than 10^4 MEFLs. This data is, however, inconclusive as the internal YFP is in a Kanamycin resistant backbone and as we have shown, different backbones can lead to greatly varied data.

Below are the micrographs team WPI-Worcester took for us. They used confocal microscopy to view cells containing tandem promoter + RFP testing constructs. These constructs were also tested using flow cytometry as described above. For details on experimental setup, click here . Both constructs expressed RFP for 100mM arabinose (on state) and did not express RFP for 1mM. While we did not test 100mM in our previous flow experiment, the confocal microscopy shows the same trend that we would expect for arabinose. For atc, the confocal experiment differed from our flow cytometry results because we expected an on state for 1000 ng/mL. This will require further investigation and a repeat experiment. It is possible that we mixed up the media that we gave to WPI. Likewise, the presence of GFP in some of the cells suggests we may have gave them a mixed culture since we didn't see GFP for the same constructs when we ran flow cytometry analysis.

Our collaborations
The availability of new technologies has facilitated the exchanges worldwide and so promoted multidisciplinarity and collaboration in science. Collaboration is a key part among iGEMers. Indeed, collaborations help to achieve goals that would not be fulfilled alone. This year the Sorbonne U Paris 2018 team has been collaborating with 9 iGEM teams from all over the world. Herein, we detail the nature of all of our collaborations with these awesome teams with whom we shared great moments for which thank them a lot!

MethotrExit: a HeteroGenious Cleaning Factory
Abtract
Cytotoxic anticancer drugs are among the harmful chemicals found in hospital wastewater at high concentrations. Degradation processes through physical and chemical methods exist but are often inefficient, unsustainable or expensive. We propose MethotrExit, a bioreactor-based approach to tackle this problem. We focused on the biotransformation of methotrexate (MTX), a widely used anticancer drug. We designed synthetic cassettes encoding a new biotransformation pathway using a heterologous carboxypeptidase in Escherichia coli. In only five hours, MethotrExit drastically removes MTX from the media. However, anticancer drug degradation products and/or the biotransformation pathway itself might be toxic for E. coli. To overcome this issue, biobricks generating heterogeneity in enzyme expression were built to ensure survival of a subpopulation. Modelling of this system highlights the interest of a division of labor between “cleaning” and “stem” bacterial cells.

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified"

After iGEM was an extension to our National Congress of Science. The event consisted of a networking session with the participation of iGEM Ambassador Camilo Chávez, iGEM Instructor Heber Torres, ex-iGEMers, iGEM judge Carolina Elizondo, Scintia co-founder Minerva Castellanos, ETH Zurich graduate Mercedes Vázquez, Student Association of Genomic Biotechnology (AsEBioGen) and an attendance of approximately 50 undergraduate and graduate students from STEM majors.
We aimed to spark interest in biotechnology and synthetic biology projects by conducting a panel of discussion and a networking event with iGEM alumni.
AfteriGEM opened up as a space where attendees had the opportunity to interact with each other and create bonds between projects and teams. During the event, the iGEM community at Tecnológico de Monterrey helped and assessed students on creating their own iGEM teams at their institutions.
National Educational Tour 2018
Dates: April-September 2018
The children´s right of quality education is a foundational element for the development of a country; sadly, in our country it is often seen as a privilege rather than a right. We wanted to create something that would contribute to change that, that´s how the iGEM National Educational Tour 2018 was born.
Most of us, coming from small towns and knowing first-hand what it is like to not have a lot of opportunities for personal and academic development, felt the social commitment and responsibility to share the knowledge we were acquiring with as many students as possible all around our country.
We took the challenge and visited five states of Mexico where we imparted conferences and workshops for high school and undergraduate students. We accomplished the goal of extending our passion for science, research and its applications and to ignite interest among students that if it was not for us could have not learned or understood about synthetic biology.

When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

WashU_StLouis,2015,Team:WashU StLouis#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," Single and Double Gene Knockouts
When a gene is knocked out in a cell, a metabolic flux redistribution can result.
A wild type cell, with normal flux distribution.
Flux is redistributed in the mutant cell.
Thus, our goal in performing knockouts is to take advantage of flux redistributions, directing metabolic flux through pathways which produce more of the metabolites we desire.  Optimally, we aim to couple metabolite production with biomass -- that is, in order to grow at all, the cell will need to produce more of the specified metabolite.
Nitrogen fixing E. coli is already ATP-limited (the cell has already redistributed flux as much as it can to produce the most ATP).  Therefore, we focused most on looking for knockouts that couple reduced flavodoxin production to biomass.
The E. coli genome. [6]
By knocking out every gene in our model (there are 1367), as well as performing all non-essential double gene knockouts (a total of 1,236,544 possible combinations), we can comprehensively assess the effect any single or double gene knockout has on intracellular biomass, ATP, and flavodoxin production. Unfortunately, while we did discover knockouts where maximum flavodoxin increased due to compromised biomass, we did not find any instances of coupling between flavodoxin and biomass.
Our Python workflow for assessing single gene knockouts can be found below
Create a list of all genes, constructed from the provided GPRs in the genome scale model.
Create lists of reactions that will be deleted for each gene knockout. This is done by evaluating each reaction GPR for each gene. If a gene is essential to a given GPR, the reaction is added to the list of reactions which will be deleted for that knockout.
Given a list of deleted reactions for each gene, FBA is run iteratively for each gene knockout. Running FBA will determine maximum biomass, max and min ATP values, and max and min flavodoxin values.
The FBA results are collected and outputted for further analysis.
OptKnock
OptKnock outputs a list of potential reaction knockouts to couple a growth function with the production of a specified compound. We were specifically looking at knockouts that couple maximum biomass with reduced flavodoxin. After running potential double and triple reaction knockouts, however, we found that none of the proposed knockouts were coupled with reduced flavodoxin- i.e. the maximum biomass, ATP, and reduced flavodoxin levels were identical to our original nitrogen-fixing figures.

sfGFP-SpyCatcher
Using BBa_K1321337 (sfGFP in Freiburg format) and BBa_K1650037 (SpyCatcher), we make the fusion protein sfGFP-SpyCatcher to be expressed on the gas vesicle surface after fusion to GvpC.
Choice of BioBricks
BBa_K1321337 (sfGFP in Freiburg format) was chosen because superfolder GFP exhibits intense bright green fluorescence (making it easy to assay) and folds easily into an extremely stable structure — its half-life for unfolding at room temperature is estimated at 28 years! BBa_K1650037 (SpyCatcher) was chosen as it possesses a 6xHis tag near the N-terminus, which allows the fusion protein to be easily purified using a Ni-NTA column.
Our Modification — BBa_K2319002 (GGSGSGSS linker)
Between the sfGFP and SpyCatcher protein domains, we have inserted a short (8 aa), flexible, hydrophilic linker comprising Gly and Ser residues that allows sfGFP and SpyCatcher to fold independently of each other. Serine, like threonine, has a hydroxyl group that contributes to stability by interacting with the aqueous cellular environment. Glycine, again due to its small size, maintains flexibility of the linker.
This linker region also contains a BamHI restriction site (G\GATCC) whose in-frame translation is Gly-Ser. This BamHI site is used to link these two protein domains during assembly of the fusion construct.
mCherry-SpyTag
Using BBa_J18932 (mCherry RFP) and two well-designed oligos, we plan to produce mCherry-SpyTag.
Choice of BioBricks
BBa_J18932 (mCherry RFP) has an interesting flaw: an internal ATG near the N-terminus has a RBS-like sequence preceding it; this hidden translation start site leads to ~50% truncation of the produced mCherry protein!
Our First Modification — Improved mCherry
Using an in silico analysis of RBS strengths using an online RBS Calculator, we modified the nucleotide sequence preceding the translation start site to become a far weaker RBS while maintaining the same amino acid sequence. This inhibits translation initiation at that position by almost 75% (predicted) and so reduces the truncation of the protein.

There are approximately 350 000 horses is Sweden (2016) which gives Sweden a larger horse/person ratio than many other European countries [19, 20].  A large amount of money is spent on horses within and without the borders of the EU, so this is clearly a global problem.
Even though all the available data points at a high demand for our product, more data is needed  to predict how an eventual new GMO product would be perceived. That is why we are working on market analysis and economics modelling. The result from these decides if the eventual solutions will be possible to implement.
Our Outreach Mission:
For the future of iGEM
We plan on making our project useful for future iGEM projects by producing informative media for iGEM teams.  We plan to provide a Youtube channel explaining scientific concepts, have lectures at local schools and have a public forum discussion in order to better educate the public on what exactly GMOs are! We also plan to publish a booklet outlining how to avoid burnout, and the effects it has on the biotechnology industry.
Collaborations
We are stronger together so when possible we are striving for collaboration with other iGEM teams. So far we are in contact with the teams of Aalto Helsinki, National University of Singapore (NUS), Lund Technical University (LTU), the team of Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan (KTH) and with all other nordic teams at social events and channels. Besides collaboration with teams we also keep a close collaboration with Vidilab, a veterinary diagnostic company.
Vidilab
Besides collaborating with other teams, iGEM Uppsala 2018 has a very close collaboration with Vidilab, a company that works with the current veterinary diagnostic tools. They are offering us usage of parts of their lab and equipment during the summer and potentially during the fall. With Vidilab’s help we have also had the opportunity to collect tissue samples and feces samples for our research.

The device will be designed for local populations. Thus, the goal is to set up a system as suitable as possible to their users for the purification of water contaminated with cholera.
Organization of the project
This project is run by a group of nine students from different universities: Paul Sabatier University (Toulouse), INSA Lyon and INSA Toulouse. It is supervised by Stéphanie Heux and Brice Enjalbert, researchers at LISBP (Toulouse), assisted by eleven other researchers. The team was formed in January 2017 and will work on this project until November 2017, date of the final restitution at the MIT, Boston.

Functional specifications
Detection of Vibrio cholerae
Description
Our system must detect the presence of Vibrio cholerae in water so that the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are spread in flow only if it contains Vibrio cholerae. In fact, the production of AMPs has to be controlled for two reasons. On the one hand, if water is drinkable, there is no need for AMPs production. On the other hand, other microorganisms (either from the user microbiota or the nearby environment) won’t develop peptide resistance.
Constraints
To develop the disease, the minimal quantity of V. cholerae cells a human being must ingest  is about 104 cells, in one dose of water
1, 2. The constraints are the following:
to detect this concentration of cells
to activate AMP production for water purification only starting from this concentration
Priority
Detection is not the top priority of our system. Purification could work continuously but the implementation of this function is better for safety reason. Moreover, according to the testimonies, the detection function of our system is a new and strong point in the treatment of water contaminated with V. cholerae.
Purification of water
Description
The other aim of our project is to wipe V. cholerae out of water. The system has to produce antimicrobial peptides when water is contaminated with V. cholerae, i.e. when water contains amounts of microorganism superior to the minimum toxic concentration (about 104 cells in one dose of water1). The AMPs used for the project have a broad spectrum of action against microorganisms, but they are particularly efficient against V. cholerae (Leucrocine I : MIC = 0.156 µg"

Dundee,2016,Team:Dundee#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"ive. The livestock produce can now pass the food security standards without impacting global antimicrobial resistance and land safely on the consumer’s fork.
Figure 3. Colicin structure showing the three domains of a colicin. Possibility of interchanging the toxic domains (Warheads) at the multiple cloning site of bacteriocin structure allows for less chance of resistance and more specificity.
...And From Beak to Bum
Our idea was to create a feed for livestock (in this case we focused on chickens), which is coated in our synthetic colicin producing bacteria. This is BactiFeed. The concept is simple; the chickens eat BactiFeed, as the bacteria travel through the GI tract of the chicken they begin to produce these synthetic colicins. The colicins are not active when expressed in the host cell as the host expresses a corresponding immunity protein to the colicin. In order to release the colicins to allow them to target unwanted bacteria the producing cells must lyse.
Figure 4.Illustration of our proof of concept. Our bacteria producing our synthetic toxins will be expressed in the presence of low pH and then the cells will lyse and release the synthetic toxins in response to bile salts.
Starting from the beak lets follow the journey of our BactiFeed. After ingestion the bacteria reach the chickens stomach. In a chickens case there are two stomachs called the proventriculus and the gizzard. These have a low pH environment so we decided to begin our plasmid construct with a pH sensitive promoter to induce production of our synthetic colicins. Throughout the following 20 minutes (or less depending on the individual chickens digestion speed) the bacteria begin to synthesise colicins that build up within the cell. The next stop for our bacteria is the intestine, at which point they encounter bile salts produced by the chicken’s liver. Naturally the next part of our plasmid design included a bile salt induced promoter with a lysis cassette downstream of it. This lyses the cells releasing the colicins to travel to their targets and kill them. The journey has now come to an end and the chicken’s faeces contain no live genetically modified bacteria.
Figure 5. Schematic shows the initial pH sensitive and bile salt sensitive promoters used for characterization purposes. Our final aim was to achieve a construct which would produce our colicin immunity protein and synthetic colicin in response to pH when it enters the chicken stomach. In order to release the synthetic colicin our cells would lyse in response to bile salts allowing the colicins to"

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

Adding Biobricks to the Parts Library of Shanghaitech
We provided our three promoter parts constructed this year for Shanghaitech, helping to build up their parts library of input and output biobricks. Shanghaitech is aiming at creating an intercellular connection between bacteria containing different input/output circuits. We are looking forward to more data showing the performance of our input elements working with their system.

Offering Biobricks to RDFZ-China
Biobricks to an iGEM project is like bricks to a skyscraper, without which a project cannot even start. This is why when RDFZ-China asked us for some essential biobricks, we offered without hesitation. This year, RDFZ-China is paying attention to helping solve the petroleum leakage issue in the soil. Rather awesome!

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

Queens_Canada,2012,Team:Queens Canada#Notebook#Week17_-_-_TEXT.html,". After combing through some literature, we developed two different protocols for isolation of flagella: one involving shearing the flagella with a Waring blendor, and the other involving removal of flagella from cells by heat. We tested a culture of nFF GFP (no linker full fliC) + J04500 in pSB1AK3 as well as a culture of just J04500 in pSB1AK3 as a control, and managed to get fluorescent flagellar pellets in just our GFP construct. However, due to the possibility that there might still be cell debris contaminating the flagellar pellet, we ran SDS-PAGE on some protein samples. There was a distinct band at 70 kDa (the size of our protein of interest, a GFP-flagellin chimera) in our test sample that was not present in our control sample. Unfortunately, after all this characterization work, we discovered that our GFP construct had an illegal cutsite in it.
We also worked on PCR overlap extending metal binding proteins such as SmtA and fMT into the variable D3 domain of fliC, but were unsuccessful.
September
Our lab work continued into the fall semester, where we were hoping to build our ideal construct of a super chimera of five different proteins: flagellin, combined with a cohesin domain, bound a by a dockerin-enzyme-secretion tag combo. If it works, that’s five different proteins, each with a different function, from three different organisms. After realizing the illegal cutsite of GFP, we switched our focus to RFP. We managed to insert cohesin into the variable D3 domain of fliC through PCR overlap extension, as clone secretion tag+RFP+dockerin. Next came the task of ligating this construct under the B0034 (RBS) and J04500 (RBS+promoter).
Other parts that we PCR overlap extended parts into the D3 variable domain included: Rv2579 (dehalogenase), LinB (dehalogenase), RFP, GFP, xylE, and mgfp-5 (mussel foot binding protein for adhesion). We also managed to do a ligation of RFP replacing the D3 domain (our RFP deletion construct).
We converted some of our parts into the BB-2 standard using PCR (such as the two constant domains of fliC on either side of the variable D3 domain), but were unsuccessful in ligating them into the submission plasmid. Other things we worked on included xylE characterization using catech"
Johns_Hopkins,2011,Team:Johns Hopkins#Project#Violacein_-_-_TEXT.html," make a full construct such as the one above.
The flanking XmaI and SphI sites were added for the easy insertion of the ORF into a vector double digested with XmaI and SphI. In addition to the Vio ORF's, the 12 promoters and terminators have flanking BsaI sites as above.  The flanking BsaI sites on the ORF are designed for addition of the promoter and the terminator in the right spot, thus creating a viable Violacein gene expression cassette designed for yeast.
BsaI is an off-site restriction enzyme, which allows the design of a synthetic sticky overhang of your choice. For further details, we have added a Request for Comment (RFC) dedicated to a form of BsaI gene assembly called ""Golden Gate Assembly.""
Violacein loxPsym Integration
The design of the violacein 'expression circles'. A promoter, violacein ORF, 3'UTR and loxPsym linker can only attach in the correct order due to the sequence of the overhangs. URA3 is added to allow for screening of synthetic DNA uptake by yeast.
We are also taking advantage of our collection of Golden Gate Assembly-compatible yeast promoters, 3'UTRs, and violacein ORFs by efficiently creating a combinatorial library which will then be integrated into the yeast genome by Cre-Lox recombination. Our promoters, ORFs, and 3'UTRs have custom overhangs such that following digestion with BsaI, they should only ligate in the correct sequence, along with a loxPsym linker. This means that we can combine our 12 promoters, 5 ORFs, and 12 3'UTRs together with the loxPsym linker in one tube to form 720 (12x5x12) possible expression casettes that have violacein ORFs paired with promoters and 3'UTRs of varying strengths. These expression cassettes will then be transformed into a yeast strain containing synIXR, a synthetic right arm of chromosome IX that contains 43 loxP sites where, in the presence of estradiol, the Cre-EBD fusion protein will catalyze random shuffling of DNA between loxP sites. The end result should be yeast with varying levels of violacein expression.

Popularization of Biology
Introduction
Nowadays, Synthetic Biology is a real challenge in the scientific world, and we are all affected.       However, as a new field, concerns arise from population and the need to understand is becoming essential.       Aware of the need to communicate and share about Synthetic Biology, a new team has been created this year: IONIS Paris.
IONIS Paris team, gathers students with different backgrounds in order to propose a new way to popularize biology and synthetic biology.       Scientists, computer engineers, scientist communication managers and designers have taken the challenge and propose a double project based on the popularization of science.       This will of IONIS iGEM to popularize Biology and Synthetic Biology gathers several proposals and projects which are presented in the following parts.
Popularization of Biology & Synthetic Biology in Elementary and High Schools
New generation of biologists is coming!
According to IONIS iGEM main goals, the team has organized some introduction courses for elementary schools on DNA, the living organisms (using the tree of life) and as all the little students were really interested and excited, the team also scheduled to perform a little experiment in order to extract banana's DNA.      Another course was scheduled for High School students regarding Synthetic Biology, iGEM and human genetics.     These events at the elementary school of Yvris and the High School of Flora Tristan allowed not only an exchange of knowledge but also a human experience for our team.

Making a mobile application
BactMan adventures
The mobile application that IONIS iGEM designed is available on all Android mobile phones.        We designed this application in order to communicate and popularize Synthetic Biology.
BactMan Adventures is a mobile application popularizing science through educative mini-games around the life of a bacteria.        With it, you can discover key notions of biology through several mini-games, developed with an Open Source game engine to pursue iGEM's philosophy of openness and collaboration.        The application is developed for Android phones in Java, using the AndEngine game engine to build the different games available through the application.        The development process took care of devices specificities and incorporated local translation to aim at being available for the widest audience available.
Apart from the mini-games, the application offers information about our team, the iGEM, and synthetic biology : introduction of iGEM and of the BioBricks, presentation of the IONIS iGEM"

LA JOLLA LIBRARY LECTURE
As part of the La Jolla Riford Library’s San Diego Wet Lab initiative, our team discussed the implications of synthetic biology, particularly GMOs, in additions to its many applications and usefulness in the status quo. We presented an abridged version of our project, focusing primarily on its selling aspects, or the entrepreneurial aspects. Additionally, we advocated iGEM and discussed the competition, making sure to emphasize the uniqueness of such a competition and its impact on the future of the biotech industry. After our presentation, we spent about an hour answering questions from the audience and took some time to explore the Wet Lab opened by the Salk Institute.
CONGRESSMAN SCOTT PETERS MEETING
We met with Congressman Scott Peters’ senior field representative Sarah Czarnecki on August 26th. During the course of this meeting, we focused primarily on agriculture, particularly the impact of the California drought on agriculture in the Central Valley region and small farmers. Not only did Ms. Czarnecki inform us about the Farmer’s Bureau, a farmer’s organization based in San Diego, but she also discussed with us, at great length, bioethics and the use of our proposed project in the status quo. As a result of our discussion, we received valuable insight into the minds of those working in Washington D.C., as well as our neighbors, with regard to pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides. In fact, this insight into the public’s reaction to GMOs inspired our team to discuss and dispel rumors about this sensitive topic.
CURRICULUM
The purpose of our curriculum is to foster people’s interest in synthetic biology in our community. Prior to this year, our team was the only high school iGEM team in the entire city of San Diego. As a result, we created “How To Make An iGEM Team” videos in order to provide other high schools a resource to create their own teams. Through our videos, we have influenced the formation of iGEM teams at Canyon Crest Academy and San Dieguito Academy, both local high schools in San Diego. This year, we have compiled a general guidebook and a guide to basic lab protocols and procedures to assist new iGEM teams.  Beyond our mission of increasing"

The Team
This year, our team consists of 13 students who have dedicated their summer to work on the iGEM project. The numerous late night meetings organised were the perfect opportunity to create an optimal atmosphere to discuss the possible iGEM projects and to boost the team spirit. The team consist of students from 5 different faculties with different backgrounds, perspectives, nationalities and languages. The diversity of the team gives us the strength and widens our horizons. We are all bound by our enthusiasm for science and research. Additionally, we are supported by previous iGEM’mers and employees from different levels of the KU Leuven University. The previous KU Leuven teams have set high standards to benchmark ourselves against. We will do our best to carry on this trend in the 2015 iGEM competition!

Our Advisors
We would like to extend our gratitude to our mentors, Katarzyna Malczewska(Kasia- as we fondly call her) and Prof. Johan Robben. From the very beginning Prof. Johan has always been ready to help solve complex issues, share his scientific expertise or direct us to the right person. We could have never imagined someone better than Kasia to be our supervisor. Be it a scientific question or a silly doubt she is always ready for all our endeavours. We would fail in our duty if we forget to mention our advisors who have helped during various stages of our project, with special mentions to Oscar Torres, for helping with the gene knock outs, Iris Govaerts for helping us find solutions in the lab, Yves Peeters for sharing his knowledge, Veerle De Wever, for her expert advices and all the ex-iGEM’mers for attending our pizza meetings and giving their valuable opinions.

One other important aspect is, that at the beginning and at the end of every wiki page, your have to link to so-called template pages that contain all your styling and layout of your wiki. Please ask your team member in charge of the wiki to add these lines to your new page, or take a look at an existing page.
Adding content to a wiki page
Before you start adding a lot of text into the wiki page please make yourself familiar with the Markup language of MediaWiki. MediaWiki offers a very intuitive way to mark headings, pictures, etc. As the Wikipedia is also based on MediaWiki, might already be familiar with these commands. However, you still want to take a look at the Wikipedia help page or the MediaWiki documentation .
MediaWiki features a powerful history. You can undo any changed to a page or any replacement of a file. Make sure you are familiar with this feature.
Uploading files
In case you have to upload a picture or any other file you should be aware of some aspects. To upload a file you can scroll down on any wiki page and click on ""upload file"". Alternatively you can link to a picture on your page before you even uploaded it. MediaWiki will no show a red link at the corresponding page. Clicking on it will also get you to the upload page.
For security reasons, the iGEM wiki does not accept any type of file. Refer to the upload page to see a list of allowed file extensions. Make sure whether you can upload a file in advance, before you spend time generating files that you cannot send to the iGEM server.
Another iGEM-specific aspect, is that all teams share one common pool to upload pictures and other files. Your team should agree on a prefix that you add to all your filenames. In case you upload a picture named ""team.jpg"", chances a high that by accident another team will replace your file. Use ""OUR_COLLEGE_20xx_team.jpg"" instead!
Editing your navigation bar
As the navigation section is the same for all wiki pages, it can be stored at one central page. In case your wiki was created according to this tutorial, the computer expert in your team can give the name of the corresponding page where you can edit the navigation. In this page you will find entries similar to ""{{:Team:xxx/Templates/Button | text=Home | link=/}}"". Each entry resembles one button or link to a page. Please note, that your team members might have changed the exact spelling. In the above example, you can just add a new button to your navigation by copying"

York,2014,Team:York#Judging_-_-_TEXT.html," difficult to predict with 100% accuracy how our bacteria would behave and react to certain environmental factors. Taking in cadmium in large quantities can lead to high toxicity levels in the bacteria and making phytochelatins can be energetically costly, so the microorganism could be rendered inefficient by selective pressure.
Answering our Question and how the answer influenced our project
Public support is of utmost importance when it comes to our project, as the topic of GMOs is highly controversial outside the scientific community. A lack of transparency on our part and incorrect understanding of our organism on the part of the public would only harm our chances of going forward with our project. From our surveys we found that the public would only support release of GMOs into the water systems if it was done in a highly controlled manner. We decided the best way to use our bacteria while also addressing the worries of the public was to release our microorganism in a system that it would not be able to escape that also has a water permeable membrane, so that the water purification process can take place. Our research has found that a hollow fibre bioreactor would be the perfect system to house our bacteria. The cells would be fixed in the fibres of the bioreactor and water is allowed to flow through, making it possible to collect the cadmium from wastewater with minimum risk of our bacteria being released from the system. In the unlikely event of an accidental release, the bacteria would have a built-in kill switch so that surviving in conditions other than those in the bioreactor would prove impossible.
We believe that by adopting this mechanism we will show the public that we are willing to take their views into consideration and that our project is safe and beneficial to the environment. From looking at and comparing the impact of the bacteria and that of cadmium on humans and on the environment, it is difficult to reach a definitive conclusion on whether releasing the bacteria would be ethical or not. However, in our view and based on our research, the advantages of going forward with our project far outweigh the disadvantages. When taking into consideration our hollow fiber bioreactor system, the risks of our project having a negative effect on human health or on the ecosystem become minimal and our approach becomes preferable to the alternative.
How our bacteria could be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM).
This could be a valuable resource to other iGEM teams and companies wanting to work with GMOs in the environment. Our human practices surveys and data analysis shows that the ways in which GMOs are handled can greatly influence public opinion, which in turn can be a decisive factor in the"

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," through traditional media. However, we gained a large coverage in Finnish Chemistry magazine, Kemia, which provided us with a three page entry on their paper. The magazine has over 10 000 subscribers. Moreover, in September we were contacted by a local radio station, YLE Radio Suomi. This resulted in a live radio interview about our project.
The articles we collaborated on:
Story on Chemistry magazine (15.10.2014)
Story on Aalto University website (1.7.2014)
Story on Finnish Chemistry Industry Association blog (8.7.2014)
Story on Aalto Entrepreneurship Society blog (28.7.2014)
There we are on the pages of Finnish Chemistry magazine!
A Website for the General Public
At the very beginning of the project we wanted to create a website that we could link to our friends, new acquaintances and potential sponsors. It included basic info about us and a general overview of the project. We started developing it rapidly and it actually got into a presentable shape fairly fast. We launched the website on 23rd of May.
We expected to attract sponsors with the page, but the most important function turned about to be for media to use as a basis for a story and for our Facebook fans to get a more in-depth introduction to us. It was also really good practice for making the wiki. Using GitHub together with several people was a new experience and sometimes it was difficult to find out why things weren't working as we thought they should.
This is how the first plan of the ""sponsor website"" looked like. We developed it further during the project. A replica of the website (click here) should be available also in the future.
Creating the Wiki
Making a good wiki was important to us. It had to be simple and well formatted but also nice to look at and informative. We wanted it to represent our team well, so we took our time with it and developed it with care. We started early and proceeded to create our wiki steadily, step by step. It turned out amazingly well. It's completely responsive so it looks good on any platform: phones, pads, desktops. We also hope that you can effortlessly find everything you'd want to, and that scrolling through the content is a pleasent experience for every visitor.
Figuring out the best way to present ourselves in the wiki was a tough problem to solve. We thought about many options but ended up having a similar clean layout that we had used in the website for the general public. Having a navigation bar on the side seemed like a fun idea at first but we gave it up to"

However, the results of the western were proven to be inconclusive BL21 cells that were frozen on Monday were defrosted and prepared to run on a protein gel. The gel was then stained with coomassie blue. Colony PCR was done in order to test Pt and Pd transformations. Colonies which showed positive results were grow n up and a miniprep was done. Minipreps were used to transform BL21 expression cells.
""ω-3"" Weekly Summary
This week we have been, once again, puzzled by science. After insertion of our Synechocystis delta-12 desaturase into our vector, we sent it off for sequencing. Result? Nothing. However, while waiting for sequencing results, we did some protein expression and analysed the lipid profile of BL21 cells containing our desaturase. Protein expression showed that the desaturase was overexpressed in BL21 cells, and these cells also showed a different lipid profile than background BL21 cells, with clear indication of desaturation. Thus, even though we have shown the protein is being expressed and having its own desaturase activity, we are not able to submit a BioBrickTM because, according to sequencing, we have nothing.
We have also started working with pET-duet vectors. We have ligated 3 of our 4 genes into specific cloning sites in this vector, hoping that we will be able to insert 2 genes simultaneously in the same vector in the future.

""ω-3"" Weekly Summary
“Week 9! ...Wait, what?  Week 9? Already? ” For some reason, we are unable to obtain a clean PCR of our Elongase 6, unlike in the first few weeks. Because we are already in week 9, and because this is the last gene to be used in our pathway we decided to forget about it (at least for now).  We ligated Δ12, Δ15 and Δ6 into our duet vectors."

HUST-China,2012,Team:HUST-China#Modeling#GM_-_-_TEXT.html," In the end, the hydrogen ions’ concentration gradient can be constructed in the water channel.  The formulation can be listed below. Supposing that the length of water channel may be $d$ The y-axis is along the gradient, while the x-axis is perpendicular to y-axis. When the concentration is steady, we shall assume that the concentration close to acidic water is a, and the concentration close to alkaline water is $b$.  Hence, concentration $C$  $$C(x,0,t)=a$$ $$C(x,d,t)=b$$  The diffusion is defined by   $$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t}=-D\nabla ^2C$$ $$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t}=-D\left(\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial y^2}\right)$$  When the concentration is steady, differential of C by t is zero. The equation is as followed：  $$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t}=0$$ $$\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial y^2}=0$$  The marginal conditions can be deduced as followed:  $$C(x,0)=a$$ $$C(x,d)=b$$  The equation can be solved as followed:  $$C(x,y)=a+\frac{(b-a)}{d}\times y$$
Simulation
Take the first two terms of the complementary error function after Taylor series expansion as the approximate number: As a quick approximation of the error function, the first 2 terms of the Taylor series can be used: $$C\left(r,t\right)=C_0\left(1-\frac{x}{\sqrt{Dt\pi}}\right)$$ We can get the image as followed: Fig.1 The plane distribution of protons in the culture medium
We divide the wasted water into two parts, the acid one and the alkaline one. Since the diffusion channel is quite small compared to the source of wasted water, we will not take the channel into our consideration. Thus, under the assumption of pH=6 in the acid part and pH=8 in the other part, and taking the source into consideration, we can get a new equation when t tends to infinitely great:  $$C(r,\infty)=\lim_{t \to \infty}C_0\left(1-\frac{r}{\sqrt{DT\pi}}\right)=C"

Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them.

Antimicrobial peptides were and no template controls were expressed over 4 hours at 37C using our in-house prepared cell-free reaction mixture. A culture of BL21 E. coli was raised overnight in LB and then diluted to apx 1*10^8 CFU/ml. 90ul of the dilute culture was combined with 10ul of each AMP reaction mixture and then placed in a plate reader shaking at 37C for several hours. Cell-free reaction mixtures that had no template DNA were also added to several wells as a growth control.  OD600 was measured every 15 minutes.
AMP Bacterial Killing by OD600 Specific Investigation
The first bacterial killing assay had shown several AMP candidates which potentially had a bacteriostatic effect. To verify this effect in a more rigorously controlled experiment with replicates was conducted. The AMPs most consistent across promoter type and presence or absence of methionine aminopeptidase were: ISGCock_Contig05_0593 ( BBa_K2431011 ), BP100 ( BBa_K2431016 ), and Micrococcin C7 ( BBa_K2431010 ). These AMPs and additional Methionine aminopeptidase ( BBa_K2431018 ) were re-amplified from their respective G-blocks and subsequently purified using the same process detailed above. Antimicrobial peptides and no template controls were expressed in triplicate over 4 hours at 37C using our in-house prepared cell-free reaction mixture. A culture of BL21 E. coli was raised overnight in LB and then diluted to apx 1*10^8 CFU/ml. 90ul of the dilute culture was combined with 10ul of each AMP reaction mixture and then placed in a plate reader shaking at 37C for 18 hours. Cell-free reaction mixtures that had no template DNA were also added to several wells as a growth control. OD600 was measured every 15 minutes.
AMP Bacterial Killing by Plate using PURExpress
The goal of this experiment was to use the PURExpress system to produce the AMPs of potential effect in the initial broad OD600 investigation. Evaluate microbial killing effectivity of a droplet of the expression rxn on a BL21 bacterial lawn in order to check whether or not the in-house preparation of the cell free reaction mixture was effective at expressing AMPs.

What’s really positive is that the Scottish and UK governments have agreed to what’s called the ‘Edinburgh Agreement’, so that means that the legal process for having the referendum has been agreed between the UK and Scottish governments, so that the decision will not be questioned by either side, and part of that agreement says that if Scotland votes ‘yes’, then the two governments will sit down and agree on an orderly transition from the current arrangements to allow Scotland to become an independent country.
[Going back to the issue of post-independence access to UK research funding], the argument that the Scottish government is putting forward is that Universities will continue to be able to access UK funding following independence. Professor Sir Ian Diamond, who’s the principal of Aberdeen University, has said, and I quote, that ‘there would be no question that Scotland could remain part of research councils within the UK should Scots vote yes in next year’s independence referendum’, and by Scots we mean people who live and work in Scotland, whether they are ethnic Scots or not is not important.
A: Yes, though it wouldn’t feel right for me to vote for someone else’s independence.
JE: Well I think that you’re entitled to vote; you should weigh up the arguments for and against and come to a position. My definition of a Scot, because I am sometimes asked on the doorstep as an SNP candidate why an English person should vote SNP, is that if you live in Scotland, if you work here and pay your taxes, as far as I’m concerned you’re as Scottish as I am, and you’re as entitled to have a say on the future of Scotland as anyone else who lives hear.
J: Very opened minded.
JE: It is, its civic nationalism. So going back to research, Professor Diamond is also a former chairman of the Research Councils UK Executive group, which means that he comes at this issue with a background of expertise and knowledge and understanding of the issues, the reason that I’m not able to be as definitive as I’d like is that his report has not yet been published. But once that has been published it will inform the white paper. He’s also pointed out that there’s a precedent for single research areas across national boundaries, so this is absolutely doable, if the will exists to do it. And it’s in the interests of researchers south of the border as well, to access the good networks of research and collaboration. There’s reference to a single research area that operates across Scandinavia, so there is a model there that Scotland can seek to emulate. And also Universities are currently involved in research partnerships at Scottish, UK,"
TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Project#Bioaccumulation_-_-_TEXT.html,"COX-2)[ Gan,2010 ]. Its necessity and importance in medicine research confirm e.g. the development of diclofenac patches for topical treatment of acute impact injuries [ Predel et al.,2004 ] and the main studies about safety and efficiency of the analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties of diclofenac [ Morgan et al.,2001 ][ Chan et al.,2004 ][ Pavelka,2012 ]. The possible resulting vicious circle (see Figure 1) shows the poisoning tragedy in 2005 which led to mass mortality and decline of vultures species especially Gyps bengalensis, Gyps indicus and Gyps tenuirostris across the Indian sub-continent. Based on the consumation of diclofenac by animals, vultures have an abnormally high intake in this drug by eating the cadavers of contaminated animals.
Current solutions
The fate of degradation products with their toxicity character and the development of antibiotic resistances plays a major role of the research on the effect of diclofenac in the aquatic environment. Because of the lack of analytical standards and the complex matrix of organic molecules in environmental samples, the degradation products have not yet been identified regarding molecular structure or concentration in aquatic fauna and flora.
The degree of the problem becomes visible in HPLC analysis, which shows in addition to the fast degradation of diclofenac over the irradiation time, a phytotoxicity increase of the increasing degradation product concentrations and a weak inhibition of cell growth.
To reduce the existence of PhACs such as diclofenac, one possibility is the usage of sewage treatment plants (STPs). Their removal efficiency depends on the sludge retention time and on the characteristics of the pharmaceutical molecule. Other strategies are the adding of an additional stage to the STP. Another approach is treated in the publications [ Westerhoff et al. (2005) ][ Huber et al., (2005) ][ Ternes et al., (2003) ] which confirm a high removal efficiency up to 95% for these additional stages. Currently developments are the nano-filtration, ozonation and power activated carbon. The importance of knowing the transformation products before applying a new technology is again demonstrated by the fact that ozonation reduces the parental substance diclofenac but cannot mineralize it.
To sum it up, biodegradation of diclofenac introduces several new problems as degradation products are toxic and pose new harms to the environment.

A MTT test allowed to quantify the effect induced by the p53 wild type expression into infected cells.
Figure 3 : AdCMV.p53 effect on cell survive. Control and AdCMV.p53 infected cells were incubated in serum-free media after 1h of infection.
In serum absence, non-infected and ßgal infected cells continue to proliferate. In contrast, for p53 infected cells, proliferation is stopped and followed by an important fall of population. After 72h, nearly the totality of p53 infected cells were dead (figure 3).
According to this study, it appears clearly that to bring a p53 wild-type version into the p53 mutated cell population induces the apoptosis phenomenon and decreases significantly the tumor population.
Similar results were reported in the study leaded by Corrado Cirielli (in 1999) by using similar analyses on a U251 cancer strain from a glioma.

We were able to directly measure the effect of our constructs on toxin production and toxicity of the C. difficile supernatant. We cloned the constructs into a plasmid vector suitable for transforming C. difficile. Supernatant cytotoxicity was compared between C. difficile containing the vectors with our constructs (coding for the asRNA) and wild-type C. difficile using African green monkey kidney epithelial ‘Vero’ cells. Supernatant samples from C. difficile cultures over five days were obtained for specific times points and the sterile supernatants applied to the Vero cells. Cytotoxicity was estimated using a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. Our results suggest that ‘asRNA Construct One’ reduces the rate of toxin production by 80% whilst asRNA Construct Two reduces it by 85% over wild type.
Cytotoxicity of C. difficile supernatants.The graph shows supernatant cytotoxicity over a period of 120 hours. There is considerably less toxin production by C. difficile containing asRNA construct 1 and C. difficile containing asRNA construct 2 than by wild type C. difficile.
Rate of toxin production.C. difficile containing asRNA construct 1 and C. difficile containing asRNA construct 2 exhibit a significantly slower rate of toxin production than wild type C. difficile. Here we see an 80% reduction in the rate of toxin production by C. difficile containing asRNA construct 1 and an 85% reduction in the rate of toxin production by C. difficile containing asRNA construct 2.

SIMULATION & ANALYSIS
We chose the Gillespie algorithm[12] to get the stochastic simulation of coupled. The stoichiometric matrix and constants obtained above were inputs of our MATLAB program.
Firstly, we simulated the theoretical curves at mRNA level. Theoretical curve of Circuit 9 at mRNA level was showed below, where the stem loop free energy ∆G=-20.0kcal/mol and terminator’s free energy was ∆G=-19.10kcal/mol. From the figure below, we can see the trends of GFP mRNA and mCherry mRNA are similar, which proves that the free energy has the relationship with mRNA.

Then we simulated the theoretical curves at protein level. Theoretical curve of Circuit 5 at protein level was showed below, where the stem loop free energy ∆G=-51.4kcal/mol and terminator’s free energy was ∆G=-19.10kcal/mol.

What kind of roles do you have in your project?
What were your expectations for combining modeling with biology? Was there something surprising?
What guided your model construction? (Your own prior knowledge, a team member's prior knowledge, your own research (research articles etc.), advisor's prior knowledge, other (please specify))
What challenges were there in terms of collaborating between fields?
How did you approach the collaboration challenges? Did you feel your approach worked? Why, why not?
What kind of communication was there between modeling and laboratory practitioners? Were there any challenges in this communication?
How did the modeling efforts have an effect on the wetlab work? If there was no effect, why not?
Do you think that your models depict the real phenomena, or do you treat them rather as mere mathematical tools?
Now that you know better, is there something you would have done differently?
Comments
We kept the questionnaire open from July 22nd to August 6th for a total of 15 days. The questionnaire was first published on our Facebook page and Twitter account. We also advertised the questionnaire during the Nordic iGEM Conference. Furthermore, we contacted 7 iGEM teams through Facebook and 41 teams by e-mail and asked their individual team members to respond to our questionnaire. In total we personally contacted 48 iGEM teams: 22 from Europe, 7 from North America, 4 from Latin America and 15 from Asia.
iGEM team compositions
We went through iGEM teams from 2014 and collected their fields of study. We chose to study approximately one third of the 250 teams registered with geographically proportionate amount of teams. The majors of participants were derived from individual team wikis. Similar fields were categorized according to table 1.

Welcome to iGEM Göttingen
iGEM is an international competition hosted by the MIT in Boston, USA, for undergraduate students of disciplines related to molecular biology. iGEM stands for International Genetically Engineered Machine competition. One the one hand, it targets to combine aspects of education and social collaboration among undergraduate students, on the other hand, it provides a library for standardized and interchangeable parts which can be used in living systems, particularly in model organisms like E. coli. Student groups from all over the world will receive a requested kit of biological parts, also called ""biobricks"", and work over the summer on an individual research project. Every year, the ""Registry of Standard Biological Parts"" is upgraded with further biobricks by the participating iGEM teams. These biobricks will be accessible to the iGEM community in the following years in order to use these parts for their own projects.
The iGEM competition started in 2003 as a course for students of the MIT only. 2011, already 165 universities from all over the"

As Figure 2 showed, the intensities of AOX activity were significantly and linearly correlated to the concentration of ethanol in a dose-dependent manner. The results indicated that LO-AOX enzyme we produced has a functional enzyme activity and reacted with alcohol concentration dose-dependently, implying we can use this assay to measure the unknown sample of alcohol.
Figure 2: AOX protein analysis. SDS-PAG and Coomassie Blue staining were used to observe protein expression level. Lane 1: wild-type E. coli as a mock control; Lane 2: LO outer membrane protein [ BBa_K1991007 ] (17 kDa) expression in E. coli; Lane 3: LO-AOX fusion protein [ BBa_K1991009 ] (91 kDa) expression in E. coli.; Lane 4: AOX protein [ BBa_K1991003 ] (79 kDa) expression in E. coli.
The following is the message from iGEM team NCTU-FORMOSA:
“To test the enzyme activity of AOX protein, which catalyzes the oxidation of alcohol and generates H2O2 products, produced by iGEM Team Mingdao, we performed HRP-TMB assay. TMB (3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine) is oxidized and changed to a deep blue color during the enzymatic degradation of H2O2 by horse radish peroxidase (HRP). The concentration of H2O2 can be determined by checking the color change, indicating TMB assay can be used to examine the enzyme activity of AOX with the substrate of alcohol.
We cultivated 3ml of the E.coli DH5α carrying the Mingdao iGEM team’s biobrick (i.e., Pcons-RBS-LO-AOX/pSB1C3, BBa_K1991009 ) in the LB media supplemented with Chloramphenicol. And we prepared another one as the control which didn’t have any plasmid. The next day, we centrifuged 1mL of bacteria expressing LO-AOX enzyme followed by being suspended in PBS. The control group was adjusted to the OD values at the same level of the LO-AOX group. After mixing bacterial samples with ethanol, TMB was added as a substrate of HRP and incubated in the dark for 3 min. The color of solution was significantly changed to blue at an OD650 of 1.51 compared to 1.21 in the control group"
Dundee,2016,Team:Dundee#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," at the debate, however the winning argument was that ethical concerns over profitability of GMOs do not outweigh the number of lives saved due to the improved performance in agriculture.  Secondly, we addressed ethical concerns by explaining the benefits of GMOs to parents and teachers at the science centre and we found that most people objected to GMOs due to a lack of knowledge.  We provided information to the people we spoke to and informed them of where to get more information to educate themselves."

Ethidium bromide and Sybr Green dyes selectively bind DNA and were used in various experiments for band observation.  Select PCR, plasmid, and ligation products were excised from agarose gels for purification and further processing.
Promoter PCR products were obtained through gel electrophoresis and a DNA purification kit. The image below shows a gels used to isolate these promoter regions.
GFP Correlation
After some deliberation, it was decided to use Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) as the PHB marker.  Two methods were proposed to carry this through.  The first method would involve ligating the GFP gene into the PHB operon, thereby allowing simultaneous transcription of the PHB-biosynthetic and GFP genes, regulated by the PHB-induction machinery.  The second method would involve separate PHB-biosynthetic and GFP regions – either by bacteria containing two plasmids, one with the PHB operon and one with the GFP operon, or by using a plasmid containing both operons but in separate locations on the plasmid. In order to test for the most effective regions of the PHB promoter, five regions of the promoter were targeted for PCR (see PCR section). It was decided to then test these promoters using the iGEM promoter testing kit, testing for GFP expression in the pSB3K3 plasmid. A spectrofluorometer was used for fluorescence measurement.
PHB Promoter Testing
PHB promoter testing was planned according to the iGEM promoter testing kit instructions.  Briefly, this kit contains three identical GFP-containing plasmids which only differ in their promoter strength (dubbed ""weak,"" ""medium,"" or ""strong""). The kit outlined a method of preparing a promoterless  GFP gene in a Kanamycin-resistant plasmid (pSB3K3).  Our objective was to ligate our BioBrick promoter regions into this plasmid and compare them to the weak, medium, and strong promoter standards using a spectrofluorometer.
BioBrick Part Assembly
After performing PCR using suffix/prefix-containing primers, PCR products were digested with EcoR1 and Pst1.  The samples were then run out on an electrophoresis gel, and the correctly-sized bands were cut out from the gel.  The DNA was extracted using a Qiagen gel-purification kit.  These inserts were then ligated into miniprepped pSB1A"

Anti-LPS
Anti-LPS
Lipopolysaccharide  (LPS),  or endotoxin,  is  the major mediator of septic shock, a serious complication of Gram-negative  bacterial  infections in humans. Molecules that bind LPS and neutralize its biological effects or enhance  its clearance could have important clinical applications. Limulus anti-LPS factor  (LALF) binds LPS tightly,  and,  in animal models, reduces mortality when administered before or after LPS challenge or bacterial infection. The  wedge-shaped molecule has a striking charge distribution and amphipathicity that suggest  how it  can insert  into membranes. The binding site for LPS probably involves an extended amphipathic loop, and it has  been proposed that two mammalian LPS-binding proteins will have a similar  loop.  The amphipathic  loop structure  may be used in the  design of molecules  with therapeutic properties against septic shock.
Horseshoe crabs  (Limulus polyphemus and Tachypleus tridentatus) are  ancient arachnids that possess a primitive circulatory  system, the hemolymph, containing only one kind of cell, the hemocyte. Exposure  of hemocytes to bacterial endotoxins [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] results in the  activation of an intracellular coagulation cascade (Iwanaga et al., 1986), a  defense against microbial invasion. The system consists of several proteins,  including one that may inhibit the cascade, called anti-LPS factor(Morita et  al., 1985). Limulus anti-LPS factor (LALF) is a small (101 amino acids), basic  protein (Aketagawa et al., 1986; Muta et al., 1987), which binds and  neutralizes LPS (Wainwright et al., 1990) and has a strong anti-bacterial effect  on the growth of Gram-negative R-type bacteria (Morita et al., 1985)(22). Our  interest in determining the crystal structure of LALF arose from its potential  in designing molecules that would have therapeutic properties in humans. It"

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Project#Xenobiology_-_-_TEXT.html," to kill bacteria when needed or that hinder genetic information to spread among different organisms. Our biosafety strategy is exploring the regions outside of Biology, with the ultimate goal of bringing Biology to a parallel domain where it does not interact with our own one. Why tinkering with our same Biology when we can create a new on, at the same time biology and technology, that we can control at a much higher level?
Biological Strategies
The biosafety mechanism is added to the system as additional layers of protection, the most explored are:
Restriction enzyme systems: autodestruction of the transformed plasmid when task ended
Semantic containment: different meaning of stop codon, other bacteria will read as stop e.g. amber codon
Auxotrophy: knock-out of biosynthesis of a key naturally produced compound that needs to be provided in the media
Suicide system: bacteria die when finished its task/changes environment e.g. toxin/antitoxin where the bacteria stops producing antitoxin when triggered hence dies
Xenobiological Strategies
The safety mechanism embedded is into the system on three different levels:
Genetic Firewall: Use of XNAs, incompatible with other organisms and synthetic nucleotides not found in nature
Semantic Firewall: Genetic code has a different meaning than the natural code, all the codons code for a different amino acid from the standard table and could code for non-natural amino acids as well
Metabolic Firewall: A Synthetic auxotrophy that uses a xenobiotic compound as key cofactor/amino acid which the bacteria is unable to produce or find in the natural enviroment
Designing Xeno-Coli
We aim to engineer the bacteria to utilise the synthetic dyes - a completely xenobiotic compound - as the key cofactor in respiration, substituting quinones in the electron transport chain.
Our X. coli will therefore only be able to survive in the presence of azodyes, a particular environment only found in the wastewater of the textile indutry that it is aimed to degrade. The biosafety strategy is embedded into the system, and tighly linked to the survival of the xenobiological organism.
Choosing an Essential Co-Factor
In order to create a xenobiological organism with a metabolic firewall we decided to try to design cofactor that would be essential to E-Coli metabolism that could be derived from our Azo Dye waste products. This cofactor would need to be functionally similar to an existing molecule in the E-Coli metabolism.

March 2011
Kick-Off of METU-BIN iGEM Software Team: As new members from different disciplines joined, our team got more powerful. Then, we started to know more about each other to understand how to determine our strategy to be successful in iGEM competition.
Reaching out to our Potential Sponsors: The content and organization of our sponsorship package is discussed and all information is pulled together into one package for easy presentation. Also, we have practiced on how to present our project to specific companies and thus worked hard on basics of synthetic biology. In order to raise some funds for the team, we have entered into the Hacettepe Technopolis Innovation Project Competition “Teknovasyon 2011” with a scientific project on synthetic biology. Our project was about MRSA biosensor modified by synthetic DNA technology.
All team members prepared presentations on iGEM and synthetic biology and these presentations helped us to open up the communication between the team members coming from different fields and educated us on different aspects of iGEM competition, synthetic biology and software development. As a software field, we had to have a good understanding of molecular biology, genetics, synthetic biology and computer sciences. Thus, we created an environment where people in every field, could provide useful and innovative advice.
Towards the end of March 2011, we got a little more into the competition, and Yener who was a competitor at iGEM 2010 talked about his experiences and explained the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. This was the key moments because, as  a software team programming a software that integrates the Registry, we should know and understand the Registry completely.
April 2011
In Turkey, synthetic biology and the opportunities it presents is not a well-known even within the academia. We, as an iGEM team, had the responsibility to spread the word and introduce the field of synthetic biology. Thus, we decided to organize a roundtable discussion at HIBIT’11 conference and inform researchers whose domain is"
Northwestern,2017,Team:Northwestern#integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," environmental signals and hazards. Currently, Dr. Levy is studying the efflux of the Tet Protein and Tetracycline use.
Dr. Levy thinks that the fight against antibiotic resistance should be multifaceted. Treatments to aid conventional antibiotics should be developed, as well as new antibiotics. From his knowledge, Dr.Levy thought that are proposed gened editing therapy was feasible and that ""young individuals should be able to try out new techniques"". As an afterthought, he mentioned that a easy way to fight antibiotic resistance is swap out your toothbrush multiple times a year, especially after sickness.
Our interview with Dr.Levy gave us confidence that our project could potentially be feasible. Dr.Levy was very encouraging and supportive of the scientific process. However, he gave us advice to do failure analysis on our solution. Often times, treatments improve in some areas over their predecessors and fall short in others.

INSA-UPS_France,2017,Team:INSA-UPS France#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html,", Vibrio harveyi can detect V. cholerae but cannot produce AMP because of self-lysis issues. Pichia pastoris cannot directly detect V. cholerea but can produce efficient molecules to eradicate it without self-lysis. The consortium interest is therefore to combine advantages from both components.

Prevention criteria
No prerequisite to use our technology
Regarding ethical matrixes ( see Integrated Human Practices ), the consortium solution presents important advantages:
It meets the environment well-being values defined by the ethical matrix since the AMP production is accomplished only when triggered by V. cholerea (i.e, it does not create a selection pressure).
It fulfills the prevention criteria, as water treatment decrease the risk of spreading the pathogen by human vectoring.
The system is based on the detection of communication molecules meaning that no contact is required between the bacteria target and the effector. This is very important because it validates biosafety requirements of the ethical matrix since the system can be contained in our validated 0.1 μm membrane ( see  Results ) and still be functional.
There are no prerequisite to use our technology:  no need to add chemical molecules, no need to monitor, no need to gather combustible or electricity to produce energy for thermic or filtration treatment.

Fig. 8: evolution of our prototype design through our engineering process. Enlarge
How we came up with a prototype?
Design evolution evolved mainly with the use and the user. The early design was mainly inspired by our own life experiences and by the SWOT analysis of the project ( described here ). We started with several designs.  First, we thought about a cell free solution, interesting to avoid GMM issues. However, it does not profit of the whole advantages of the microbial consortium, as presented above. Second, our partner Sunwaterlife has already developed filtration system to treat water in emerging countries. However, this requires energy. They solved this issue with solar panel, but it means the whole technology to be complex and expensive. We therefore decided otherwise and focuses on a cheap and user-friendly device to contain our engineered microorganisms ( described in the Device section ). Briefly, the device contains our lyophilized strains in a tea-bag-like polymer material allowing diffusion of molecules (including AMP), but not microorganisms. To increase security, this tea-bag is placed in a plastic device with membrane of the same material. It has to be"

2008-07-08
MODELING:
MISSING  REACTION:
We  forgot to take into account one reaction, cI* degradation (cI* -» 0). Now  it has been added to the model.
ASSUMPTIONS:
There  were some changes in our assumptions.
CHECK:
- It  is suggested to check more in-depth if nickel natural usage in the cell can  really be considered irrelevant for our experiment (assumption 5).
- Daniela identified the metabolic pathways which involve nickel in E. coli. Here is the link .
MODEL:
The first simulation in Matlab was generated. It worked! Everyone  should test it and correct or suggest anything necessary.
TO-DO LIST:
Defining  parameters is our topmost priority (reaction rates, kinetic constants and concentrations).
2008-07-09
GROUP MEETING:
Today  we discussed the following with Miguel:
BIOPARTS:
There  was information in regards to the transformation of the bioparts. Chiba’s team  explained to us that their biopart’s DNA was not in the registry however it was  mistakenly set as available. However they assured us that they have the functional bioparts, so we will have to request some DNA directly to the team.
ELECTRODES:
Miguel  thinks that measuring a conductivity change in the medium will be sufficient.  The temporary plan is to create a document gathering everything we know on the  subject and that everyone helps investigating as much as possible.
PARAMETERS  FOR THE MODEL:
This  is further explained below, in modeling session, but basically what Miguel told us is  that we can’t count with experimental data for the moment. He suggested that we  should search for average half-lives and protein kinetics in general and use  those parameters as a first approach.
CONTROLS:
Now  that the experimental work has inevitably been delayed, that time can be  invested in defining controls, both positive and negative for the  experiment.
MODELING:
Defining  parameters:
Obtaining  the kinetic parameters experimentally is impossible right now; we first need  the working bioparts. Right now we could get an average half-life of other  proteins, which share characteristics with our desired protein (for example, average half-life of membrane proteins to define RcnA’s half-life) and trust  that they won’t differ much. Once the experimental work resumes we could  compare our parameters with those obtained experimentally.
The  concentrations that will be experimentally determined (such as"

EPFL,2016,Team:EPFL#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," and investigate ongoing professional research and the interplay between                      synthetic biology and ethics.                      In September, we had the honor of sitting down with Dr.  Yolanda Schaerli,                      currently a group leader and SNSF Ambizione fellow at University of Zurich,                     who will soon start her own group at the University of Lausanne. Her past                      research has included performing directed evolution of proteins in water                      and oil droplets, creating an AND-gate using a split polymerase, and                      building synthetic gene regulatory networks. Her current project is                      looking at the evolvability of gene regulatory networks.                      After exploring her work in more detail, we pressed her on the ethical                      implications of her work, in particular, and synthetic biology, in general.                     We were especially interested in whether she ever faced public suspicion,                      due to her pursuits into genetic manipulation, but were relieved to discover                      that this was not the case, although she attributed this to the fact that                      she is doing basic research. We next inquired as to how public engagement                      is approached in the scientific world, and which players have the                      responsibility to make sure the public is informed about what kind of research                      is happening. We discovered that there seems to be a consensus that the onus,                     in this respect, is on scientists themselves, and this responsibility cannot                      be transferred to the public or politicians. In this sense, it is our duty                      to help these groups care about science, and understand it, and not theirs                      to enigmatically develop such an interest. Finally, we considered the role                      individuals might have, if any, in the development of future technologies,                      and the direction of synthetic biology. If individuals create their own s                     paces to experiment they should follow the same safety rules as researchers                      from the universities or companies. Navigating these ethical and communication                      challenges should be a principal concern of the scientific community, and                      will be paramount to the successful pursuit of the opportunities that lie ahead.
Interview
So we will conduct this interview in two parts. In the first part we would like to know a little more about you and how you got into synthetic biology specifically, and then we’ll get to the part pertaining to ethics and community outreach.
What can you tell us about yourself? How did you get into sciences, did you have a straightforward path into it, or did you have different turns?
Well I started biochemistry and microbiology at ETH Zurich. I directly felt that I liked protein engineering and found that engineering biological system was very cool. But synthetic biology was at the very start, and during"

The Chair for Chemistry of Biopolymers focuses on the structural biochemistry of integral membrane proteins. Core themes are molecular interactions between membrane proteins, structural dynamics of membrane bound protein helices, membrane protein/lipid interactions and structure/function relationships of integral membrane protein complexes.
During the planning phase of our project we asked Prof. Langosch for advice concerning the design of the transmembrane domain of our constructs.
Laboratory of Prof. Dr. Rost
Prof. Rost works in the field of bioinformatics and computer-based biology, focusing on the prediction of structure and function of proteins and genes. His team's specialty is the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to predict structure and function of proteins.
After developing an early version of our AutoAnnotator , we presented our work to Prof. Rost and his group. He gave us some very helpful advice on features we could add and provided us with access to his PredictProtein server. A special ""thank you"" goes to Manfred Roos for tailoring the access point of the server to our needs.
Laboratory of Prof. Dr. Schneitz
The Chair for Plant Developmental Biology is interested in the genetic and molecular basis of the regulatory pathways controlling organ development and tissue morphogenesis in plants.
The chair gave us great access to their microscopes and excellent support in how to use them. Many thanks for that, especially to Prasad Vaddepalli for his introduction into fluorescence microscopy.
Laboratory of Prof. Dr. Schwechheimer
The Chair for Systems Biology of Plants investigates a range of queries concerning the ubiquitin proteasome system of plants applying a combination of genetics, molecular biology and cell biology with both genomic and proteomic approaches.
Together with Prof. Schwechheimer we discussed several different signal transduction pathways that could be utilised for our kill-switch . Moreover he kindly granted us access to a fluorescence microscope.
Laboratory of Prof. Dr. Scherer
The Chair for microbial ecology conducts basic research in the field of molecular genetics and ecology of pathogenic microorganisms. Projects include the microbial characterization of food  and microbial diagnostics and consulting in the food industry for prevention and clearance of contaminations.
The team kindly provided us with a culture of Micrococcus luteus for the Kirby-Bauer assay and also helped out with a tube of restriction enzyme during an unexpected shortage.
Other Universities
The team also obtained help from other universities in order to complete the project. As nobody at our university works with Physcomitrella pat"
Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," Additionally as part of our collaborative studies, we invited two other iGEM teams to characterise our composite parts using their equipment and calibration curves, and the observed reproducibility between laboratories further validated our observations. Furthermore this part has now been characterised in a Gram-negative and a Gram-positive non-model organism. When tested in Gram-positive organism it was driving expression of gusA.
We demonstrated that our second antisense RNA construct [BBa_K2715008] was able to suppress the rate of production of toxin in C. difficile by 85%, validating our approach to reducing toxicity.
We successfully validated the functionality of the following submitted parts: BBa_K2715001, BBa_K2715002 and BBa_K2715008.
We collaborated with the University of Warwick and Imperial College London to validate our promoters and we collected a water sample for the University of Warwick. We also collaborated with Team BioMarvel, Korea to grammar check their Wiki pages.
We held a discussion group with non-scientists to determine their thoughts and feelings on antibiotic resistance and alternative therapies. We also interviewed experts in the field from different universities in the UK. We have also compiled reports showing the impact of our project on the community and whether elderly people have difficulties taking their prescribed medication. We also mined the comments from a you tube video on phage therapy to explore the emotions people feel towards phage therapy.
We have registered for the iGEM competition and will be attending the Giant Jamboree.
We have completed the competition deliverables, to produce a Wiki, poster, presentation and complete the judging form.
We have created an Attributions page showing the attributions for every aspect of our project.
We participated and had our results accepted in the InterLab Measurement Study.

Fluorescence standard curve
We observe that the values form a straight line on both linear and log scale.                       Beside, we observed water vapor on the well plate cap, this probably altered a bit the volume in the wells.
Cell measurement
   We can see that both absorbance600 and fluorescence values rise.
    The factors used to pass from the absorbance and the fluorescence values to fluorescence per OD and fluorescence per particles values are the following:
1. OD600 / Abs600 = 3.68
2. uM Fluorescein / a.u. = 1.59E-03
3. Particles / Abs600 = 7.25E+08
4. MEFL / a.u. =9.55E+09
Some values of fluorescence where too high to be computed by our machine. For those, we used the maximal value of the machine in the computations. Corresponding values are indicated by red boxes.

Raw results
As expected, the number of colonies falls with the dilutions. We chose to use the result of the dilution 4(8x10^5) to compute the concentration of CFU/ml.
Our results could be a bit distorted by the fact that there was water on the petri dishes we used as they did not dried under a hood.
The first Petri dish (on the left) was used to control potential contaminations. Nothing has grown on this plate. The left (resp. right) block of 18 plates corresponds to the culture of different dilutions of positive (resp.                   negative)                   controls: The first column represents dilution 3, the next corresponds to dilution 4 and the last column is dilution 5.
To go Further
To smoothen the functioning of the interlabs, we wish we had access to more theoretical documents to understand in more details the goal of the experiments, as well as the computation of the excel file."
