Our most meaningful collaboration by far is with Team Athens. Exchanging vital project ideas with them proved really helpful for both sides in the end. We lent a helping hand in their InterLab study by sending them our Measurement Kit, because we didn’t participate in it and they did. The best of all are the lasting friendships we made!

Human Practices
✔
Our project idea was inspired mostly by a donation campaign for a colleague of ours, organised in our faculty. We dived head-first into this problem and uncovered that the average survival rates for Bulgarian patients with cystic fibrosis are far lower than those for patients living in more developed countries. One of the main reasons behind that contrast is untimely diagnosis. This served as a huge push for us to try and develop our system and, in a way, try to give a second chance to patients by providing timely diagnosis. We presented the problem and our solution at various different science-oriented events - Sofia Science Festival 2018, for instance. We also organized our own campaign, The 65 SynBio Roses, in which we had people draw and/or color roses, some of which - with iGEM chromoproteins. This way, we managed to introduce people not only to an important issue in need of a solution, but to synthetic biology’s problem-solving potential, too.

Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

Abstract
Inflammatory Bowel Disease is an autoimmune disease that results in inflammation of the colon and small intestine. IBD is a huge problem in developed countries, vastly growing with no effective therapy in sight. This disease is caused by an imbalance of immune T-cells, Th17 and T regulatory , which control inflammation and immunosuppression responses respectively. We propose a novel mechanism using synthetic biology that aims to regulate this balance in vivo. This involves a two-part device: one that regulates inflammation and the other immunosuppression . We cloned a device that recognizes superoxide producers, a byproduct of inflammation and Th17 proliferation, to produce retinoic acid , which blocks the further differentiation of Th17 cells. This device has been characterized , is well behaved and capable of recognizing superoxides, like paraquat , at optimum levels of 40 to 80 uM without growth inhibition. To control immunosuppression, we cloned and mutated the trp operon so that it recognizes 5-Methyl tryptophan , a target substrate of an enzyme involved in Treg immunosuppression, and designed a potential IL-6 excretion device to regulate Treg proliferation.  The behavior of this novel tryptophan sensor has been studied by our group through the development of a mathematical model . Our results suggest that our construct has potential applications as a diagnostic or therapeutic tool for post-operative Crohn's patients.
Background and Clinical Significance
Fig 2.1 Incidence of various autoimmune disease
Inflammatory Bowel Disease is a group of inflammatory diseases that affect the colon and small intestine.  The disease comes in two varieties, either as Ulcerative Colitis (UC) or Crohn's Disease (CD).  An autoimmune condition, IBD is becoming particularly prevalent in the industrialized nations of the world.  Already, in the United States and Europe, the disease group affects over 4 million individuals.    With a faster growth rate and higher incidence than other well known autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis and asthma, IBD will affect an even larger percentage of the"

Brasil-USP,2015,Team:Brasil-USP#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," several iGEM project descriptions from populations of differents countries. This could generate significant information on how to propose better projects in the future.
     To this end, CGU Taiwan approached several teams asking for simple questions related to their own project. Then, all questions were presented to people from different countries, with significant different backgrounds. We have contributed with two questions:
How long does it take for one regular tire, the one used in our cars, to degrade if left in an open environment?
Is tire disposal regulated in your country? If yes, are these laws able to control correct disposal and recycling of rubber waste?
     To help them share this survey with in Brazil, we have translated it into portuguese. Visit CGU Taiwan team’s wiki to learn more about the answers to these questions and the overall feedback on our project.
Contributed to Modeling-Experimentation quizz from Team Aalto-Helsinki
     The scientific method is based on a closed loop between experimentation and analytical reasoning (modeling) on the data. While both are completely indispensable, there is a historical segregation between experimentation and modeling in natural sciences, probably due to a natural background divergence among different scientists. Team Aalto-Helsinki proposed a survey to investigate how most of iGEM team members see this issue and how each team is tackling the experimenting-modeling discrepancy. Visit Aalto-Helsinki to learn more about this survey!
     A few members of our team answered this poll. In particular, we are very happy that we could arrange a group of team members dedicated to modeling and bioinformatics. This group was in close connection with the Wet Lab, always keeping the Experimenting-Modeling cycle closed and working.
Participating in a survey from Paris-Saclay team
     In iGEM, we have a broad range of different backgrounds regarding to techniques and backgrounds. To better understand which chassis are being used and why, Paris-Saclay team prepared a short survey to gather this data. For instance, we have used E. Coli, from DH5a and BL21 strains.
     As a token of their appreciation, Paris-Saclay team share with us a Thanks Badge.
Participating and sharing a survey from UCL
     While iGEM projects are often motivated by day-to-day issues, solutions based on Synthetic Biology may yet not be well accepted by the overall population. It is, then, fundamental to understand how people will see your final product and make sure that there is some space for it in ther market. UCL team proposed a survey to investigate this topic, and we have helped them translating it into Brazilian port"

3. Determination of immobilized β2-MG concentration
As a result, the results show that the optical imaging of the liquid crystal cell becomes                             gradually bright with the increase of the concentration of fixed β2-MG under                             other conditions unchanged. Therefore, we can determine the change trend of the brightness                             of the liquid crystal. The concentration of β2-MG increases in the same trend.                             The relationship between the luminance of liquid crystal and the concentration of                             β2-MG can be established, and then determine the corresponding concentration of β2-MG                             according to the luminance of liquid crystal, so as to achieve the purpose of quantitative                             detection. Due to the need of the experiment, the maximum immobilized β2-MG                             concentration of 500 ng/mL is selected to be fixed on the substrate surface, which can keep                             the optical imaging background dark.
Determination of the concentration of β2-MG nano antibody
1. Screening criteria for the concentration of β2-MG nano-antibody
The influence of the concentration of the nano-antibody on the optical imaging of the liquid                             crystal cell was further investigated. If we don’t add β2-MG in the sample, there                             will has color spots in the polarizing microscope imaging. When the concentration of the                             nano-antibody in the sample was low, only a few bright spots approached the full black                             background. In the subsequent detection, the substrate immobilized β2-MG will                             compete with the tested sample β2-MG to bind the limited reaction sites on the                             β2-MG nano-antibody. When the concentration of the tested β2-MG                             approaches zero (detection limit is infinitely low), the β2-MG nano-antibody will                             combine with the substrate immobilized β2-MG to disturb the orientation of the                             liquid crystal molecule to the maximum extent, resulting in the optical imaging of the                             liquid crystal cell. With the increase of the concentration of β2-MG, the binding                             of β2-MG nano-antibody to the substrate immobilized β2-MG decreases,                             and the optical imaging becomes dark from, thus completing the detection of β2-MG.
2. Results
Under the condition of 500ng/mL of β2-MG, 250ng/mL, 250ng/mL, 500ng/mL, and                             600ng/mL of β2-MG nano-antibodies were fixed"

Analysing the benefits of microcompartments
On this page we explain in detail how our stochastic diffusion models work and then provide in-depth information on how we then used these carefully analyse of the benefits of microcompartments for our system.
Creating models of iGEM Melbourne's star peptide
We embarked on a major collaboration project with Melbourne iGEM team. Part of this collaboration involved helping this team by modelling the benefit of using their star peptide system in a bacterium and how that could control reaction rates. To do this we drew on the extensive knowledge that we have gained of stochastically modelling diffusion-driven systems.
Realising the biosensor
On the advice of industry experts, we produced concept designs of our whole system using CAD. We built the biosensor using the latest 3D printing technologies and we designed and built a very cheap circuit that can detect low levels of GFP fluorescence to go inside the biosensor. This part is really exciting...
Bioremediation realisation
Discover how we envisage our project becoming a real world product and see the CAD models that have allowed us to demonstrate our idea to industry experts.
Biopolymer containment
Find out how we modelled the processes that control the diffusion of DCM and reaction products through the biopolymer containment beads, and how this modelling played an integral part in calculating the optimum bead thickness for our system.

BIT,2016,Team:BIT-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," raised a question about the distribution of inhibitor proteins                                 as well as the plasmids. The random distribution may also lead to the                                 signal delay, which inspire                                 hot discussion among our team members. These considerations give us more possibility.
Since there is no antibiotics employed in our project,                                 the company’s manager affirmed our potential use in large-scale production.
What’s more, since our project has potential to be applied and has the obvious                                     advantage of no antibiotics employed, COFCO provided us with some financial help.
HP Union
In the Asia-Pacific conference, we greatly enlarged our horizons by sharing                                 ideas to other teams at the same time, we feel it’s not enough and it’s                                 necessary and urgent to establish a platform for teams’ interactive communication. That’s the first beginning of our HP union.
The first step is to build a Wechat official account to communicate with other                                 teams and propagandize                                 to the public. This way, we can investigate and get feedback from the public easily.
We lead the HP union and start the union with other five teams: BIT, CGU-Taiwan,                                 Jilin-China, Peking, TJU. So far, more teams up to 10 are members of the union.
And we had () user paying attention to the account.
We shared some articles about synthetic biology to the account referring to                                 issues about biological safety, ethics, iGEM competition and other general topics.
Besides, we plan to provide new teams or the potential participated                                     teams with resources including union members’ project introduction and team members’ personal                                 contact information attached with attribution.                                 This way, it can facilitate the communication among students.
Conferences
In August, 2016, BIT-China was invited to take part in the Asia-Pacific                                 conference held by team NCKU-Tainan. About 20 teams participated in the                                 conference, and all of them made splendid speeches to                                 present their own projects, from which we got to know plenty of exciting ideas.
We also presented our project, and received lots of feedback to improve our design.                                 As the first one to present, the Q and A section of our team were under                                 hot discussion. The questions raised refer to not only the project design,                                 but also extend to considerations about safety issues.                                 We also realized the importance of oral presentation from the questions.
In addition to this, we held and took part in several exchange                                 meetings with other four teams: Peking, Jilin-China, UCAS.                                 Through these exchange meetings, we got many useful suggestions                                 to shape our project step by step.

Conclusion
The huge energetic and environmental challenges every country will have to face in the following years call for institutional and organisational innovations capable of promoting the development of relevant technological innovations. The success of the open source movement in the software industry tends to support the idea that patents are not the sole way to support knowledge spreading and technological innovations in an economic sector. Building commons can be considered, to some extent, as a fruitful alternative to the patent inflation and its pernicious effects.
The iGEM community, as a group sharing knowledge on synthetic biology, can be regarded as a case of commons. But, as Elinor Ostrom's work highlights, it is the responsibility of every commons to define its own founding principles, namely a governance framework and an appropriate distribution of “bundles of rights” associated with different roles in the organization of the commons. Even if some milestones have been set, much remains to be done in this respect.
Consequently, we propose the iGEM community to develop a genuine reflexion on this important matter in order to form a strong “synthetic biology commons” whose technological and economic success could be compared to the open source movement.
The results of the UBC team’s survey, to the analysis of which we have collaborated, confirm that most of the iGEM community members oppose the patentability of the BioBricks designed in the frame of iGEM. Promoting the intellectual as well as economic value of iGEM outcomes, without resorting to the traditional intellectual property regime, should thus interest most actors in the iGEM commons.

Promoters of protein coding genes are usually upstream the genome therefore the possibility of this being the right sequence, in spite of what we had already discovered, was quite remote. (remota) Because they also submitted PgolS with ECFP reporter (BBa_K310015) and PgolS with EYFP reporter (BBa_K310016), these sequences are not correct either. In addition our latest assays prove our PgolsS construct to work efficiently.
After this discovery we checked other Illinois' gol operon related parts and realized they had submitted golB with what we believe is a typo within its sequence (BBa_K310011) and also in the parts that included it (BBa_K310014).
We suggest that these should be investigated by others teams too in order to prevent future participants from confusion.

Quick Facts on The JHU iGEM Human Practices Survey:
It is an anonymous 16 part questionnaire on the perception of GM foods including two demographic questions.
It is distributed at two Baltimore markets to ordinary Baltimore Citizens
It is approved as an Exempt Study by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB).
It aims to gauge the immediate appeal of Vitabread in relation to other GM and Non GM varieties
It aims to find an approximate ‘acceptable percentage’ of GM content in a recipe.
Some FAQs
What is an Institutional Review Board (IRB)?
An IRB is essentially an institution’s own Bioethics board that reviews, helps refine, and green-lights research projects on human subjects research.  It is there to make sure that no human subject’s rights will be violated in any shape or form by affiliated studies. For a more detailed explanation, see the Hopkins Medicine IRB Website .
Do you have to get IRB approval to do a survey?
You do not explicitly require IRB approval to conduct human practices research for iGEM. If you do not seek IRB approval and intend to publish the collected data, you may have to disclose this fact to the potential publisher first. Depending on your institution, you may be required to make other disclosures as well (e.g. to the participants themselves that your project was not IRB approved).
So why seek IRB approval in iGEM?
Seeing as synthetic biology is one of the primary focuses of modern bioethics , the field is inherently controversial and therefore subject to intense scrutiny.  IRB approval is the easiest way to certify a project as ‘ethically clean’ for the simple reason that a bioethics board has approved it.  It raises the standard of the project and makes it more acceptable to the general public.  For example, if all iGEM projects had IRB approved elements, the institution as a whole would be easily argued as one that cares about bioethics and aims to remain ethically sound.
Side Benefit: Study Team Members on an IRB Approved Study take short courses on Bioethics (e.g. Conflict of Interest, Human Subjects Research), which allows them to learn more about the field.
How should iGEM teams approach the process of IRB approval?
Design a study to receive IRB exempt status.  ‘Exempt’ refers to a type of IRB approval granted without an extended review process.   In our case, the IRB took around 2 weeks to review our second application and approve us"

All this while GraphMap, the tool we employed for this in the background, is highly                             sensitive and specialized for the utilization with third generation sequencing techniques.
How to use sequ-into
The philosophy behind sequ-into is to to bring a sophisticated bioinformatic tool as close                     to the wetlab as possible.
We wanted to set the entry point to use our software as low as possible.                     Therefore we created an introductory YouTube video, that shows the installation on a Mac OS System.                     It furthermore is an deatiled introduction of the whole functionality of sequ-into - which is the                     same on Windows and Unix Systems, the interpretation of the results and usage of the read-filtering                     option.
The user will also find comprehensive information on the installation, employed packages and                     structure of sequ-into on our documentation .

How to get sequ-into?
You can use sequ-into on a Mac OS, Linux as well as on a Windows System. Please                                     follow the respective instructions in our Installation                                         guide .
Get started
Step 1: Read files
FastQ, as well as Fast5, are suitable formats for evaluating your sequencing data                                     with sequ-into.
In the first step, you can choose which files you would like to seek into. Each                                     chosen file or folder will                                     be handled separately. This is also true if you upload them twice.
If you wish to examine certain reads together, e.g. because they stem from the same                                     experiment, make sure to                                     save them in a folder and upload that folder via Choose Directory. In order to                                     analyze a single file,                                     upload it via Choose File.
As soon as you have chosen your files an output directory will be generated. You                                     will find a temp folder                                     where your read files reside. You can change that output directory and folder name                                     at the bottom of the                                     page if you click on the text field.
After that, click Next to proceed.
Step 2: Reference files
To check what your sequencing files truly consist of you need a reference against                                     which the reads will be                                     mapped.
That reference might be a possible contamination, such as E. Coli, or a targeted                                     known genome of what you                                     intended to sequence. Of course, you can also use shorter sequences instead of a                                     whole genome as a                                     reference.

BCAM0228 QuikChange of the illegal EcoRI site was complete and sent for sequencing to confirm this was actually the case. The Device Committee met up with Dr. Stephen Reynolds from the University’s physics department, who helped us to optimize our light-detecting circuit. We constructed a crude (but effective!) Faraday cage from aluminium foil and a cardboard box to eliminate electrical interference from the buzzing computers in the dry lab…
We managed to clone rpfC into pUniprom, along with the rest of the DSF system; time for some tests!
Week 10
Sequencing results came back for the QuikChanged BCAM0227 and confirmed that the EcoRI site had been removed and so we handed it over to Dimitrios to clone it into pSB1C3.We obtained a culture of Vibrio fischeri from Dr Sarah Coulthurst’s lab, and began streaking plates to test out our physical device for detection of the bioluminescence from V. fischeri luciferase – it worked! At this point our device was essentially half of a water bottle covered in insulating tape, an Arduino and a voltage meter...However, we had come up with a product name: the Light Amplifying Signal Sensing Object, because every good cowboy needs a L.A.S.S.O., right?! It was time for a more robust design; our thoughts moved to 3D printing, and iGEM alumnus and polymath Nasir Ahmad showed us how to draw up plans using Google Sketch.
Week 11
At this stage, we had all of our systems (barring PAI-1) cloned into pUniprom and ready for blotting. So with a little, (actually, rather a lot), of help from ""The Blotfather"" Prof. Frank Sargent, we set to the task with all the elation of a team that can see the end of cloning in sight.
Meanwhile, some of the wet team set to the noble task of cloning our replacement Pseudomonas system. Luckily, all the components we needed were included in the 2014 iGEM distribution pack so we stabbed, rehydrated and got to work. We started by using the Ptet BioBrick as a vector and cloned in lasR downstream.
The Device Committee met with Dr. Mike MacDonald from the Institute for Medical Science and Technology (IMSAT) to discuss plans for building a physical device. They learned from him the"
SYSU-Software,2015,Team:SYSU-Software#Scientific_-_-_TEXT.html," teams lack experience in working on source code, and they have little time to “discover” the function of a software (represented by Colombia team). Other features for a good software should contain basic functions like mathematical modeling, design of construct, and analysis of DNA sequence (rpresented by Colombia, Bettencourt Paris and WLCMilwaukee team)
Obviously, we know that software in synthetic biology should contain the basic functions like design and modeling, while it should guarantee the user experience as much as possible. In the wet lab we need powerful analysis software. Software to deal with the text and graphic is also necessary. But no team has mentioned that they have used any communicating software. There being no such kind of software makes it hard to exchange ideas between the teams. Further, if we cannot easily find out the information on the work done by previous iGEM teams, it will increase a lot of unnecessary labor. What’s more, it does no good to the reuse and redesign of previous design.

“Redesign is an excellent idea. It could help a lot in reusing the former iGEM works. You know, they are difficult to be reused now.”— By LZU-China
“We have some common ideas in the computer-aided circuits design. But is aiding in design the only way that software helps synthetic biology?”— By HFUT-China
“Even software track should pay attention to biosafety problems.”— By NUDT_CHINA
“We still believe the communication between iGEM teams is not enough, especially the transparency in the experimental material, which affects the repeatability of the projects.”— By Nankai
We learn that wet-lab teams value communication between teams too. Most of them think that communication should not be limited to meetups; instead, communication should be held online, real-time and professional.
Inspirations on project
At the beginning of our project, we aim to develop a computer-aided circuit design software. The bi-directional dialogue between us and wet-lab teams reminded us of what kind of software is really needed.

3. Mathematical Modeling
Key Problem: Students who major in biology are usually not familiar with functions needed for mathematical modeling. Many of us find it hard to learn by reading books ourselves. Students of mathematic could aid in modeling, but we find it hard to communicate with them fluently for we don't understand each other sometimes. Solution: Turn to students major in bioinformatic for help. Invite them to teach a class on modeling in biology. Moreover, they can help explain your project to students majoring in math. If there's no students of bioinformatics in your college, invite students of other universities in the league (shown below) to come and help!
4.Blueprint - the League
Three iGEM teams in Wuhan, China uniting into a league could bring great convenience. Closely attached to each other and contacting more frequently, we can make better use of our resources by sharing them. Experienced web site designer, mathematic model builder, human practice organizer, etc. are sometimes hard to find or cultivate. Hence, encouraging them to help other teams in the league would save each team lots of time. Furthermore, some devices or facility could be shared."

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook )."
Lethbridge_HS,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"age and bacteria do not require a specific pH, although we will need to perform further tests to prove it. Furthermore, due to our system’s self-renewability, it is greater in both functional efficiency and cost efficiency. Our system is more complex in comparison to chemical precipitation, due to its requirement of heat and UV disinfection; however, our system proposes a solution that solves the issues faced with chemical precipitation in an effective manner, providing a sustainable alternative.
Incorporation
To incorporate our system into the biological wastewater treatment plant, we would put it in the secondary clarifiers as this is where metal removal occurs, according to our interview with the process coordinator of our local wastewater treatment plant, Duane Guzzi. Additionally, it would be the final process before UV disinfection, where all the organisms are killed. Currently, we are unsure as to where our system would integrate within industrial wastewater treatment plants; this will be a future direction.
Figure 1. Wastewater treatment plant process
Positive Impacts of Our System
The incorporation of our system into wastewater treatment plants could reduce the number of metals present in a more inexpensive manner, as it is self-renewable; doing so would help prevent heavy metals from negatively affecting the ecosystem, without the cost with chemical precipitation. Additionally, it could also be used in addition to chemical precipitation and biosurfactants for the complete removal of metals from wastewater. In biological wastewater treatment plants, the sludge made from the process is used as fertilizer for crops and soil which meet the guidelines for metallic concentration; our system could lower the concentration, allowing a greater amount of crops to benefit from the fertilizer. This reduces the amount of unnecessary sludge dumped in the landfills, increasing the reusability of waste [5]. The use of this system would be particularly ideal for places dealing with heavy metals present in wastewater, such as current industrial plants. Additionally, it can be used in places such as Flint, Michigan, where drinking water is tainted with large quantities of lead [6].
TAILINGS PONDS
Current Methods
Biosurfactants are one solution for metal removal in tailings ponds. Biosurfactants can be defined as the surface-active biomolecules produced by microorganisms with a wide range of applications [7]. Surfactants increase the solubility of hydrophilic molecules, thereby reducing both surface and interfacial tensions at oil or water interfaces, and have been studied for the removal of metals from tailings ponds. In one study, the removal of arsenic from mining tailings ponds was done by  Rhamnolipid biosurfact"

Also because vanillin is not actively removed from the extracellular medium, the rate of evaporation of vanillin is an important figure if we want to regulate the concentration of vanillin in the extracellular medium. A detailed analysis can be found in following document. vanillin_sensing
The most important figures are that the time to reach steady state between the concentration of the inter and extracellular concentration of vanillin in the order of 10 ms, the half-life through evaporation of vanillin in water  is 20 hours.
An equivalent model (single cell) of vanillin in the aqueous medium and evaporation was conducted.
Following simulation shows the time-scale of evaporation of vanillin out of the lb(aqueous) medium, the slow evaporation rate of vanillin is not surprising considering its use in the perfume industries as an aroma in the ground note.
Evaporation rate of vanillin out of lb medium
If this evaporation rate would show to slow, several active techniques exists to speed the process of removing the vanillin from the extracellular medium.

DNA purification
Protocol for Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
1. Weigh agarose powder and TAE buffer according to a proper portion, and add them to a 100mL conical flask(we usually make 1.5% Agarose Gel);
2. Melt the mixture in a microwave until the solution becomes clear(don’t leave the microwave);
3. Let the solution cool down to about 40-50℃ and add DNA gel stain, pour the solution into the gel casting tray with appreciate comb;
4. Let the gel cool until it is solid;
5. Carefully pull out the comb;
6. Place the gel in the electrophoresis chamber;
7. Add enough TAE Buffer so that there is about 2-3 mm of buffer over the gel;
8. Pipette DNA samples mixed with appreciate amount of loading buffer and dye(GeneFinder) into wells on the gel;
9. Run the gel at 120V for about twenty minutes
Axygen gel extraction
1. Prepare agarose gel (1.5%), use thick-welled comb.
2. Run desired sample on gel.
3. Excise the agarose gel slice containing the DNA fragment of interest with a clean, sharp scalpel under ultraviolet illumination.

Finally, value, synonymous to the term “luminance” is also predicted to decrease as IPTG concentrations increase. Luminance indicates emitted light intensity in terms of the amount of light absorbed (low luminance values) and emitted (high luminance values). Because the yellow coloration, observed in non-expressive cells are ""brighter"" and emit more light than the purple, IPTG induced cells, than it is predicted luminance values will decrease as IPTG levels increase.
As lab work concluded the proposed construct could not be successfully assembled. The initial portion of the construct: pλR LacI, yielded low miniprep concentrations that were impractical to proceed within the cloning workflow. We then attempted to ligate pλR B0034 LacI, but gel results, determining the existence of the sequences, were inconclusive. Because numerous experiences with the promoter, pλR, had not delivered applicable results, the R0040 promoter, obtained from the Interlab Study, was instituted as a replacement. Despite the initial obstacle, the middle parts of the proposed construct, being tsPurple and increasingly potent degradation tags, were ordered from IDT and successfully underwent the cloning procedure. The parts: tsPurple, tsPurple DAS, and tsPuple LAA, were sent for sequencing. The sequence containing LAA, and the sequence without a degradation tag both were verified as complete and void of mutations; the sequence containing DAS was received as lacking the degradation tag. The latter portion of the construct, composed of pLac ClpXP CI, was successfully assembled and sent for sequencing. Results from sequencing concluded that CI had mutated and, therefore, not functional. From the corroborated cloning parts, the sequences containing LAA and no degradation tags were individually ligated to the R0040 promoter and RBS. The ligations were then transformed into competent, NEB 5-Alpha cells, plated and visualized the next day. The presence of purple coloration verified the success of ligation. Despite lacking the full, genetic construct, we managed to obtain viable data from the Chrome-Q system using the proof of concept.
Proof of Concept utilized ATUM’s Protein Paintbox with the chromoproteins: TinselPurple (tsPurple), ScroogeOrange, and VirginiaViolet, and successfully underwent the optimized protocol. The resulting color expression, correlating with incremental concentrations of IPTG, was analyzed using the Chrome-Q system. Methodology for the Chrome-Q system can be found on the Model page"

Topic: The current dilemma of clinical diagnosis of colon cancer
1. Interview with Professor of Ottawa Hospital
According to the professor, we learned about the various methods of early diagnosis of colon cancer, and the problems faced by these means:
Colonoscope
Advantages: Colonoscopy is more accurate than barium enema X-ray, especially when detecting small polyps. If colon polyps are found, they are usually removed by colonoscopy and sent for pathological analysis. The pathologist examines the polyps under the microscope to check for cancer.
Disadvantages: Most of the polyps that are removed by colonoscopy are benign, and many are precancerous lesions. Removal of precancerous polyps prevents colon cancer from developing of these polyps in the future. But this is not an efficient method!
Sigmoidoscopy
Sigmoidoscopy is the process of examining the left colon and rectum using a shorter range of dimensions.
Advantages: It is easier to prepare and perform than a full colonoscopy, and sigmoidoscopy can be used for polypectomy and cancer biopsy.
Disadvantages: However, it has significant limitations in not being able to assess right and lateral colons.
CEA carcinoembryonic antigen method
Advantages: Indirect. If cancer is suspected, medical personnel can obtain the Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) - called the ""tumor marker"" to do blood test. CEA is a substance produced by some colon and rectal cancer cells as well as some other types of cancer. Colon cancer patients have higher levels of CEAS.
Disadvantages: Not all patients’ CEA is elevated though their cancer has spread. (Some colon cancers do not produce CEA.) In addition, some patients without cancer may also have high levels of CEA.
It can be roughly presented in the following table:
Table 1. Comparison between three diagnosis methods
Later, we learned from the professors about the current incidence of colon cancer in North America: According to the World Health Organization, colon cancer is already the second most common cancer in both men and women after lung cancer. In North America, the incidence of colon cancer is 2% in people over 50 years of age, and the incidence of colon cancer has little to do with gender. It has"

4. Successfully constructed the testing circuit of toxin proteins according to two kinds of inhibitors.                                 [For example, Part: BBa_K2120400 ]
5. Tested the lethal effect of producing DSB through coupling sgRNA and Cas9
Experimental details [Expand]
1. Constructing the testing circuits
The DNA Agarose Gel electrophoresis showed that the whole length of the first circuit is about 1500bp, the second circuit is about 1400bp.
Fig.1 DNA Agarose Gel electrophoresis results of mazF
Fig.2 DNA Agarose Gel electrophoresis results of hokD
2. Testing the lethal effect of toxin proteins MazF and HokD by measuring the growth curve.
The testing groups are the two circuits above (mazF and hokD), while the control is the empty vector. Add arabinose or not, there is another comparison. We used 0.01% arabinose to induce the PBAD promoter when the OD600 is 0.6. We measured the OD600 every hour until the bacteria reached the flat stage.
Fig.3 Compared with the negative control (the empty pSB1C3 vector), OD600 of the two circuits containing toxin proteins are obviously lower, and the difference is evident as time going on. No obvious difference observed among the three groups with no induction. It showed that toxin proteins didn’t leak out.
Through the growth curve, we concluded that toxin protein HokD and MazF have different lethal efficiency. Depending on different situations, we can choose either of them.
3. Replacement of the RBS to adjust the lethal effect as well as the threshold
Through one-step mutation, we have separately replaced the B0032 (33.96%) with B0031 (12.64%) and B0034 (100%). Here are the sequencing results.
Fig.4 The successful sequencing results of 4 mutations: B0031+mazF; B0034+mazF; B0031+hokD; B0034+hokD
We used 0.01% arabinose to induce the PBAD promoter when the OD600 is 0.6. We measured the OD600 every hour until the bacteria reached the flat stage.
Fig.5 For the toxin protein MazF, we concluded that the influence of strong RBS is more evident.

Notably, the proteolysis system has potential to apply in many fields. As a strategy to make it a toolbox for further research, we use different tags to test the strength of its proteolysis. With the reflection of red fluorescence, we are able to detect mf-Lon activity on various tags based on the distinguish value of UV detection. This toolbox is intended to be a fast and convenient method for prospective proteolysis option and degradation research.

Biotechnology at Aalto University
I have mostly been working in lab with many projects including fluorescent protein testing in yeast and constructing our biobricks. I also did some modelling since somebody needs to teach biology to the mathematicians.
When I heard that you could be a part of research project where designing and execution is done by students I knew this is something I want to participate in. A little bit more researching about previous year's iGEM projects, and the opportunities of synthetic biology got me completely hooked.
Laura Laiho

In the background research and lab I constituted one half of the degradation team. Outside the lab I, as our team captain, tried to keep everything on track and make sure that we were getting stuff done. I also held presentations to companies and drew the pictures for our introduction video.
I joined iGEM because I wanted to do something awesome, learn new stuff and see what a team full of students can achieve - a lot apparently! I came to iGEM knowing quite little about synthetic biology, but now I am confident that my future career will be in this field of science.

I worked on the modelling of the detecting mechanism of our project. I modelled mathematically the potential activity of our promoters and their mechanisms through a theoretical model and some simulations.
I joined IGEM to learn more about the state of the art in synthetic biology and how mathematics could be of help in a task -I thought- so distant. I was pretty excited of applying my knowledge in a very interdisciplinary team.

My main responsibility has been to make sure everything is moving forward in the lab. This has meant lots of lab planning, background research and experiment design, as well as making sure lab work is distributed and everyone knows what to do. And of course, plenty of the actual lab work too!
I wanted to work on an independent, challenging research project where I could apply what I know and do lots of problem-solving, so a student-driven team project seemed like a good fit. And I wanted to learn more about synthetic biology, which made iGEM an even better match!

Lethbridge,2015,Team:Lethbridge HS#Introduction_-_-_TEXT.html," many individuals, including one of our MLAs, who is also the Minister of Environment to get her support of our project; rural beekeepers in Southern Alberta to ask about the viability of our project; we also talked to our city council, and an urban planner to see how we could make our city more “bee-friendly”. We interacted with the public by handing out seed packets in parks, and informing them about the decline of bees and the city by-law that makes urban bee-keeping illegal; many signed a petition that we created to remove this by-law. To promote iGEM, we went to two middle schools to tell the students a little bit about our project and what iGEM is.

[ Blue points represents the track under blue light (470nm) ]
Analysis:
The test is doing under 5W LED blue light (470nm) with 1000mA LED driverand 10 Hz flash. Compared to the control group, pmyo2-chETA-eYFP showed a strong body binding tendency under internal light, mainly caused by the increasing head swing angle, which indicats the capability of chETA. To further explore its unique features, we also compared the results to those worms with same genotype, but given continuous stimulation (Figure 8). We found an enhanced influence on locomotion, as the turn is too sharp that it even changes their heading direction. A possible reason for this difference is that the switch between muscle activation state can be complete in this model. When the channelrhodopsin can’t reach the switching effiency, the tissue turned into a state of platform potential, thus subtle effect can be missing. But with chETA, the quick transforming is expressed.
5.2.8 Muscle contraction
From the result we get, we find that pmyo3-ChR2-YFP have an obvious response that the muscle of worm contract. So we try to observe the reactions of this kind of worm in high power field, for the light intensity is larger in high power field. As a result, we can find the muscle of worm contract severely, the video is showed below.

After amplification of the bricks produced via PCR, seven products combinations were ligated to a low copy backbone in the pattern of red, green and blue fluorescent proteins, consistently through the controlled use of the DCBA digestion site. Each ligation has only one ligation slot (due to availability of restriction cut sites) per reporter colour, leaving random chance to produce a combination of all the possible variants in the random ligations where multiple promoters are available.
e= empty promoter, h= high expression promoter
e= empty promoter, h= high expression promoter
 
 
 
 
These bricks were ligated with the backbone as follows:
eRFP-eGFP-eCFP - Low expression in all reporters
hRFP-hGFP-hCFP - High expression in all reporters
hRFP-eGFP-eCFP - Low expression in GFP and CFP, but High expression of RFP
eRFP-hGFP-eCFP - Low expression in RFP and CFP, but High expression of GFP
eRFP-eGFP-hCFP - Low expression in RFP and GFP, but High expression of CFP
eRFP-hGFP-hCFP - Low expression in RFP, but High expression of GFP and CFP
hRFP-eGFP-hCFP - Low expression in GFP, but High expression of RFP and CFP
hRFP-hGFP-eCFP - Low expression in CFP, but High expression of RFP and GFP
 
 
This produced a control for each reporter fluorescent protein in isolation. It also produced a control for all reporters on either highest expression or lowest expression. This finally also produced a random set of colonies for isolation (after transformation) for comparison and test for true randomness.
Results
Twelve colonies were picked from the pilot study of random ligation, which gave the following distribution:
STEP 5: Freeze Drying & Revival
Why
For Key. coli to become a success, the ability to transport the bacterial key in a safe way whilst maintaining a sample of viable cells with similar expression patterns is vital. The Key. coli cells can either be kept in a metabolically active state or in a freeze dried, metabolically inactive state. The first option has two major disadvantages: a continues supply of nutrients will have to be provided and through successive bacterial generations genetic drift will occur, meaning that cells will lose certain traits, traits that are not essential for the applied growth conditions. The reporters we will be expressing inside the cell will not be essential for cell survival and thus will"
Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#Modeling-content_-_-_TEXT.html," [7]. The measured pH values of the ruminal fluid and the NMS-media were 6.7 corresponding to a 36 % loss in activity. Thus, approximately only 43.52 % of the initial enzyme is active, representing the worst case scenario. An industrial production of alginate beads for entrapment is much more effective.
Furthermore a discrepancy between cultivation of immobilized E. cowli in NMS-media and ruminal fluid was observed. The cultivation in NMS-media resulted in a slightly lower rate of methane degradation if compared to cultivation in rumen fluid, which is discussed in the results.
Figure 5: pH-dependent activity of sMMO (modified figure) [7].
The immobilization of E. cowli in a calcium alginate matrix allows growth and enzymatic activity while cultivated in ruminal fluid. The costs for production of alginate beads shall be evaluated subsequently. As previously determined a total active enzyme amount of 244 g is necessary for complete degradation of methane produced through enteric fermentation.  In this project beads were manually produced using transfer pipettes, thus the diameter was 7 mm in average with 4×109 cells. Consequently, a total of 750 beads is needed to reduce the methane emission to a minimum, which have a retention time of 4 days in the cows rumen. For the reduction of the costs, the bead composition can be optimized. It has been reported that small amounts of paraffin increase the solubility of methane in the liquid phase vastly [12]. However, the health effects of paraffin has to be evaluated.
Our costs for the production were 50 cent per ratio, which consists of 750 beads. Hence, a total of 50 $ per year is needed to reduce the annual methane emission by 110 kg per cow. Ideally the worldwide methane emission is reduced by 164 million tons, based on a total number of 1.5 billion cows [13]. This is the ideal case. Nevertheless in case only 1% percent of the sMMO is active if immobilized and introduced into the rumen, the methane emission is reduced by 164 ×104 tons.
Considering the 25 times greater impact on global warming of methane in comparison to carbon dioxide, a comparative statistical analysis of cows with average emission values of cars is possible.
Does a cow equal a car?
Assuming that a cow releases a maximum of 500 L of methane and a minimum of 300 L per day, the annual emissions of carbon dioxide equivalents range from 2.737  to 4.562 t. An average car,"

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"  the possibility for horizontal gene transfer (HGT). We aimed to test if multiple kill  switches in a system would reduce failure rate and if integration into the genome would increase stability.
We have developed three types of kill switch to cover a broad range  of strategies that may be employed in kill switch design:
A metabolic kill switch that uses the production of reactive oxygen species to kill the cell
An enzymatic kill switch that uses the production of lysozyme (Gallus gallus)
And two systems that target DNA:
A CRISPR based kill switch based on the work of Caliando and Voigt (2015) that targets specific sites for degradation
A broad spectrum system that non-specifically degrades DNA mediated by expression of DNase 1
Continuous culture
Before starting the project we spoke to Prof. Robert Beardmore EPSRC Leadership Fellow in the Mathematical  Biosciences at Exeter University. Much of his research has been into antibiotic resistance. We discussed how high  selection pressure is applied by prolonged use of antibiotics and how kill switches may be analogous to this.   It is clear that cells which develop a mutation that inactivates the kill switch would be strongly selected for.  It was estimated that functional loss of the kill switch would occur in a short amount of time as a result,  and if this was the case, could have strong implications for kill switch longevity.
To test this we decided  to use a ministat (Fig. 4) to perform a continuous culture. The ministat was developed in the Dunham Lab at the   University of Washington (Miller et al, 2013). Each ministat chamber is fed from its own media container (Fig. 1)  via a peristaltic pump (Fig. 2), with the culture volume set by the height of the effluent needle in the chamber (Fig. 3). Air is  bubbled through flasks of water to hydrate it and then used to agitate the culture. Chambers were inoculated with  freshly transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) and samples taken to test if the kill switches were still viable.  By simulating in miniature how a kill switch might behave in an industrial setting, the ministat provides a proof   of concept for how a kill switch might be maintained in larger chemostats during a continuous culture. A protocol  for running experiments in the ministat can be found here

After the transformation, plasmid extraction and double digestion with EcoRI/PstI he noticed there was something wrong with the plasmid because the in the gel there were always more that the two bands expected, so he extracted the inverter by PCR, digested it with EcoRI/PstI and cloned it into the commercial vector pBluescript II KS + hoping it would work for the ligations.
It was successfully cloned in the new vector so he proceeded to ligate it with the GFP (BBa_E0240) into the pSB1T3, then  he extracted plasmid and double digested it with EcoRI/PstI, in the gel we can see the two bands expected one for the ligation product about 1900 bp and the other for about 2500 bp corresponding to the plasmid, ergo it seems that it came out well. The only problem is that it doesn’t seem to glow when exposed to UV light, but it should as the cI repressor protein is not being transcribed.

One of the main events of the week was BioFinland Pitching Competition. We applied and got to the finals, which meant free pitching training for the team by Helsinki Think Company and a chance to win 1,000 euros and get our picture to the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York City’s Time Square! Unfortunately we weren’t the lucky winners this time, but the event was a great practice for Boston and we met a lot of like-minded people from our own field.
HEUREKA
We attended the World Biotech Tour festival in collaboration with the Finnish Science Centre Heureka. For two days in September we had educational activities for school students and families in Heureka. Our aim was to explain and teach about lab work and synthetic biology in an easy and funny way to get the new generation of possible future researchers and scientists interested in biology and chemistry. These events - Meet a Scientist Day and Family Festival Day were mentioned in the event calendars of both the Finnish Bioindustries and the European Biotech week.
For explaining synthetic biology we created an experimental Plasmid Puzzle which was targeted mainly for smaller children to challenge their imagination and to possibly give them a tiny hint about what synthetic biology and DNA modification could mean.
The puzzle was made out of colorful foam blocks that we made by ourselves.
Every block presented a feature, like hot, cold, tasty, fluffy, sparkling, glowing in the dark, radioactive (or resistant to that), fledged and so on. Five blocks together created a shape of a plasmid. We wanted to make an attractive and really visual game for children to get their attention and we definitely succeeded in that. Kids of age 1 to 12 were interested in playing with the blocks and meanwhile we were able to explain principles of synthetic biology to them and to their parents.  We got really nice feedback about the activity from the Heureka staff. They said that this kind of activity is exactly what they are looking for and what they need in Heureka and they were willing to borrow the idea for future projects as well.  In the end we also got the opportunity to be part of something very nice and valuable. After the World Biotech Tour weekend our plasmid blocks were donated to a voluntary workshop meant for tortured refugee families coming from really hard conditions and especially"

These compounds are formed by the reaction of secondary amines with nitrosating agents, such as nitrates or nitrites.[1] A number of investigations conducted by research centers and food safety institutes have shown that many food products are contaminated with nitroso compounds during production process. These compounds are formed in a slightly acidic environment, which is caused by the reaction of sodium nitrite and nitrogen oxide with proteins, amino acids and amines in food.[2] The main precursors of N-nitrosamines are believed to be formed by reaction of nitrogen oxides.
Fig 2. The Carcinogenic Pathway of nitrite ion in human body
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) as most carcinogenic to humans, and N-nitrosodi-n-butylamine (NDBA), N-ntrosopiperidine (NPIP) and N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) as possibly carcinogenic to humans [3] The Process of Producing Pickled Vegetables.
In the traditional pickle industry, nearly all kinds of the vegetables can be pickled. Recent research has shown that all the plants tend to concentrate nitrate during their vegetation process, with the microbes and the nitrate reductases, which would convert nitrate into nitrite in the pickling process. After being ingested by our digestive systems, nitrite would be combined with the amine in our bodies, producing of nitrosamines. (Recently, Medical studies indicated that the nitrosamine is a strong carcinogen). Moreover, nitrite is one of the causes of methemoglobinemia which brings to the problem of having tissue hypoxia and also causes vasodilation and lower blood pressure.
The Nitrite
As we have seen the dangers of nitrite bring to human beings, therefore our team decided working towards our goal of investigating the negative effects of the picking process.
Through literature, we found out that the concentration of nitrite was generally higher in the pickled products. In order to obtain the actual data, we decided to have a field survey. Therefore, we contacted with the Zhejiang Qiumei Food CO, LTD(see our integrated human practices part )

Intellectual Property, Next steps and our financing approach
Intellectual property
We performed a prior art search to potentially build Intellectual Property. We talked with the Technology Transfer Office of our university. We identified a way to apply a patent for one specific application of our project.
The next steps
Wh talked with Deep Science Venture, a life-science incubator based in London. Depending on our lab outcome they proposed us to invest £100k to further push this venture. The program starts with a first three months validation period. At the end of this period, the entrepreneurs/scientists pitch their project to investors to rise money. After the contest we have planned a meeting with them. Our Lab and Research leader and Team leader and other members are truly considerate to integrate this program to switch our adventure to a research project to a startup venture.
Our financing approach
We quadrupled the amount of private sponsoring compared to the previous year. We decided to prior smart money. This way pitch our project in front of decision maker of large pharmaceutical companies. That gave us a certain project maturity, it was great exercise, that give us tools and experience to convince investor for much larger investments in our venture. This way, we anticipated the possible after-contest outcomes to use the momentum generated by iGEM.
We were also financed by the Brussels Public Institute Innoviris with a startup proof of concept grant. This sponsorship was a first step that opened the door for another financing opportunity if we keep going the project after the contest."

Automatic Unit Test & CI
Our project is deposited on github to support work division and efficient cooperation. During the development of the project, we use travis-CI for continuous integration and use coverall for coverage test. Thus our software is most likely to operate well as long as the unit test is good. With this method, we can ensure the quality of software and prevent programming bugs.
Algorithms
Biocircuit (Transformation from a truth table to logic circuits)
The Quine-McCluskey algorithm is a method used for minimizing of boolean functions that was developed by W.V.Quine and extended by Edward J.McCluskey.
Espresso heuristic logic minimizer is a computer program using heuristic and specific algorithms for efficiently reducing the complexity of digital electronic gate circuits.
Because Espresso is more efficient than Q-M algorithm, especially when inputs are more than 6, we choose Espresso for our software.
NetworkX is a Python language software package for the creation, manipulation and study of the structure, dynamics and functions of complex networks.
We use directed graph to characterize biocircuit, and NetworkX has make it more convenient to operate with graphs.
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
Pyeda is a Python library for electronic design automation. We once used pyeda to simplify Boolean formulas. However, we found bugs in the process, so we got in touch with its author Chris Drake and submitted the issue. Therefore, we didn't use pyeda directly but make some changes to his espresso model. We are very grateful to his excellent work.
Score Calculation for Logic Circuits:
The complexity of electronic circuits essentially depends only on the number of gates, and it can be minimized by the Espresso algorithm. Synthetic biology, however, is distinct from electronics and a gene circuit is much more complex than a logic circuit. We first simplify the truth table input by users to obtain several simplified logic circuits, and then correspond them to a gene circuit. We estimate the complexity of a circuit solution as a function of the number of the regulatory factors involved in the network. Considering the complexity involved in the promoters and RBS, we give a score function.

Transgene pollution
Transgene pollution describes the spread of transgenes beyond the genetically modified species by natural gene flow mechanisms [ Commandeur et al., 2003 ]. Transgenes can spread from transgenic to non-transgenic populations of the same species or related wild species (vertical gene transfer) or to entirely different species such as bacteria (horizontal gene transfer). Because the impact of novel genes on other species is unpredictable, transgene pollution is undesirable and could pose a risk to the ecosystem. When talking about transgenes, one also has to differentiate between primary transgenes such as our effectors and superfluous DNA sequences such as antibiotic resistance markers.
Preventing vertical gene transfer with non-sporulating Physcomitrella strains
Figure 2: Sporophytes of P. patens WT (A) and DSiR1 (B–D) lines 8 weeks after induction of sporulation. The spores of WT plants develop until they are mature in the spore capsules which then tear open and set free the spores. In the DSiR1 lines the spore capsules crack  open when the spores inside are still immature, Wiedemann et al., 2010
In order to prevent vertical gene transfer and to limit the spread of the moss in the environment, we looked for strains which are not able to form mature spores. P. patens is monoicous, meaning that male and female organs are produced in one plant. Normally, at the tips of adult gametophores the sexual organs, antheridia (male) and archegonia (female), are produced under inducing conditions. After fertilisation of the egg inside the archegonium a sporophyte develops which contains approx. 5000 spores. A possible way to inhibit successful germination of these spores is to knock out the enzyme sulfite reductase 1 (SiR1). This protein reduces sulfite to sulfide and is involved in sulfur metabolism. [ Wiedemann et al., 2010 ] disrupted PpSiR1 by homologous recombination and found that ΔSiR1 plants showed strong developmental alterations and are unable to produce mature spores. In the ΔSiR1 lines, only one third of the number of sporophytes was formed, the sp"

Discussion: Since no colony forms in the plate with L-Arabinose, we can conclude that the expression of CbtA can suppress the growth of bacteria. When CbeA and CbtA are co-induced by IPTG and L-Arabinose, the bacteria can growth and reproduce normally. It is reported that CbeA acts as an antagonist, rather than binding to CbtA, which is different from other Type-II Toxin-Antitoxin system.[2]
Figure 3. Growth bacteria with TA system under different inducers. (A) Plate with none inducer. (B) Plate with IPTG. (C) Plate with arabinose. (D) Plate with arabinose and IPTG. All the plates are incubated for 16 hrs after streak cultivation.
Drawing Abs600-time curve with different inducers
1. CbtA function validation:
Results: Abs600 values were measured from 0 to 14 hours in two groups and the toxication curves were drawn as shown in Figure 4. The growth rate of vector group bacteria after adding L-Arabinose sped up for a short time and then slowed down. At last, the trend was consistent with that without L-Arabinose. However, TA group, with the addition of L-Arabinose, showed the same OD and Abs600 values from the 4th hour for a while. After that, Abs600 values displayed a little increase. Besides, after culturing for 14 hrs, difference in turbidities of bacteria in different groups was visible (fig.5).
Discussion: (1) The reason why the growth of vector group bacteria accelerates after addition of L-Arabinose is probably because that E.coli can turn L-Arabinose into DXylulose 5-phosphate, which is an intermediate product in pentose phosphate pathway and can be used in bacteria as a carbon resource. What is more, the decrease after that maybe related with Carbon catabolite repression(CCR)[3]. (2) According to the characterization of pBAD, the addition of L-Arabinose with the concentrations of 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.6% shows no obvious difference in induction level of CbtA. Therefore, the difference among various concentrations of L-Arabinose in TA group maybe because of the metabolism of L-arabinose"

Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Another way to ensure safety could be to create a new lab strain of E.coli that has more auxotrophic requirements. This would make it more difficult for a modified bacteria to escape and possibly spread a Resistance factor or Virulence factor.
Parts could be made safer by introducing more regulation components. By making the bacteria require cofactors to function or to live in an antibiotic containing environment would help to ensure containment of the strain being studied. You could also make it more difficult for the new BioBricks to be transmitted in an active form to an undesired bacterial strain.

We were also recommended to use a Fusarium by researchers at Novozymes , but opted to focus on the ones we had multiple recommendations on.  For various reasons, our choice ended up being A. oryzae; A. oryzae is comparatively easy to grow on various substrates, it grows fast, gives consistently good results and is a well-established model organism. Though the other fungal species have previously shown to have desirable characteristics, when it comes to creating fungal materials, the results of our initial experiments made us decide on doing our research in A. oryzae with the possibility of transferring the discoveries to other fungal species at a later point in the project.
How to Build Structures on Mars
When wanting to erect livable habitats on Mars made of fungal materials, an obvious question is: What physical parameters will the fungal bricks have to withstand for them to be used as building material on Mars? Martian gravity is about 38% of Earth’s (3) makes it easier to erect self-sustainable structures on Mars than on Earth. However, the greater challenge is enabling structures to sustain the internal pressure generated by the pressure difference between the liveable habitat and that of the Martian atmosphere. The average pressure on Earth is 1.013 bar with 21% oxygen. The lowest human life-sustaining pressure is 0.121 bar, assuming a 100% oxygen concentration (4). Though, this is not desirable due to extreme fire hazards. At these oxygen concentrations, everything becomes combustible. Near the lower border of what is safe/healthy and sustainable for human life is an atmosphere containing 19.5% oxygen at approximately 0.65 bar (5). As stated earlier, the average Martian pressure is 0.006 bar. This is only 0.6% of the average barometric pressure on earth (6).
What building design/geometry is the best at containing pressures? For simulation purposes, the internal pressure is 1 atmosphere. Humans can live at lower pressures, but lab-equipment and plant growth are sensitive to lower pressures (7). This is why the International space station maintains an internal pressure of 1 ATM. Looking at a dome and a box design, the COMSOL simulations on Fig(2) and Fig(3), strongly indicate, that the dome design is the better choice. We assume that: Equal internal volume, an internal pressure of 1 bar and an external pressure of 0.006 bar. In order for the"

UAlberta,2017,Team:UAlberta#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," can be used to readily discern the relative strengths of protein-protein interactions, nor can it be used to separate desirable candidates from false positives. Though, as assays testing for protein interactions are not numerous, it was apparent that there is room for the development of other alternative screening methods to address these issues. In response, Team UAlberta aimed our project in developing a system that can provide a relatively quantitative readout linked to the strength of protein-protein interactions.
Jeffrey Wong and Phage Display
The scientific foundation of our project focuses on the idea of protein-protein interactions, and how best to engineer and optimize these interactions. One of the techniques currently used for the screening of protein-protein interactions is phage display. To gain a first-hand account of what phage display involves, we spoke to a researcher  who gets up close and personal with the technique on a daily basis. Jeffrey Wong is a Ph.D. student in Dr. Ratmir Derda’s group in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Alberta. Jeffrey’s project involves using phage display to identify peptide sequences that can be further developed for cancer therapeutics.
During our interview with Jeffrey, he spoke at length about the work-flow researchers go through when carrying out the phage display technique. One of the things that stood out to us the most was how time consuming and labour intensive it was to conduct just one round of phage display. This realization set us on the track of looking to find a quicker and more efficient way of achieving the same results. Specifically, the idea of a system with the potential to be automated was quite appealing in that it could cut down the need for scientists to be physically present in the lab during the majority of the selection process. An automated system will not only increase efficiency and free up researchers for other tasks, but can also speed up the process of engineering protein-protein interactions. Using the information we have gathered from speaking with Jeffrey, the UAlberta team has worked to shape our RISE technology such that it allows for a more efficient and streamlined methodology that does not compromise the quality of results obtained.
Campbell Lab
Directed evolution is a technique commonly used in protein engineering to develop better variants. Our RISE system employs directed evolution in the engineering of better protein-protein interactions. While our team was familiar with directed evolution within the context of our project, we wanted to reach out to researchers who carry out directed evolution experiments and highlight the advantages and discuss potential challenges. We spoke to three members from the Campbell Lab in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Alberta. The Campbell Lab is a world-renowned leader in the development of fluorescent"

Linkoping_Sweden,2017,Team:Linkoping Sweden#AlzheimersDisease_-_-_TEXT.html," or 50s. This kind of Alzherimer’s is often much harder to diagnose since it is easily mistaken for stress. [5]
Now let’s look a little closer at the disease, more exactly where it is formed and why. In our brains we have cells called neurons which is basically the essence of our brain. They connect to each other by  sending signals between them. In and around these cells we have proteins that help with signaling and just basic cell functioning. Two of those proteins are Amyloid Beta and Tau. In a healthy individual the body gets rid of these precursor proteins by breaking them down. In Alzheimer's disease these protein fragments accumulates into insoluble clots, called plaques. They form around the neurons and prevent them from communicating with each other with prevent signals to getting through until the neuron stops trying and shrivels. [6] Tau on the other hand is in the neuron and part of the stabilization along the part that sends the signals. In Alzheimer’s disease Tau gets loose from the structure and form tangles in the cell. Since the Tau stabilized the structure it begins to fall apart when Tau is gone so the cells ultimately dies. [6]
The exact reason why these proteins start to aggregate is still unknown and apart of the unsolved riddles about this disease.
Another question is the genetic part of the disease. Less than 2 % of Alzheimer cases can be associated with a dominant inherent gene. In half of these cases, where the disease developed earlier than at 60 years old, a mutation in the gene has been found. A total of 200 mutations in three different genes, which all lead to Alzheimer’s, has been discovered. The known gene mutations are all so called autosomalt dominant which means that if one of the parents have the disease caused by the dominant gene there is a 50% chance that the child will also develop it.

Within this volume, the activity of DNA polymerase incorporating a single nucleotide can be readily detected.
Why uses SMRT(The merits compared to the NGS)
Relative Terminologies
Contigs
A sequence contig is a contiguous, overlapping sequence read resulting from the reassembly of the small DNA fragments generated by bottom-up sequencing strategies. This meaning of contig is consistent with the original definition by Rodger Staden (1979). The bottom-up DNA sequencing strategy involves shearing genomic DNA into many small fragments (""bottom""), sequencing these fragments, reassembling them back into contigs and eventually the entire genome (""up""). Because current technology allows for the direct sequencing of only relatively short DNA fragments (300–1000 nucleotides), genomic DNA must be fragmented into small pieces prior to sequencing. In bottom-up sequencing projects, amplified DNA is sheared randomly into fragments appropriately sized for sequencing. The subsequent sequence reads, which are the data that contains the sequence of each fragment, are assembled into contigs, which are finally connected by sequencing the gaps between them resulting in a sequenced genome. The ability to assemble contigs depends on the overlap of reads. Because shearing is random and performed on multiple copies of DNA, each portion of the genome should be represented multiple times in different fragment frames. In other words, the sequences of the fragments (and thus the reads) should overlap. After sequencing, the overlapping reads are assembled into contigs by assembly software.
Scaffold
Scaffolds consist of overlapping contigs separated by gaps of known length. The new constraints placed on the orientation of the contigs allows for the placement of highly repeated sequences in the genome. If one end read has a repetitive sequence, as long as its mate pair is located within a contig, its placement is known. The remaining gaps between the contigs in the scaffolds can then be sequenced by a variety of methods, including PCR amplification followed by sequencing (for smaller gaps) and BAC cloning methods followed by sequencing for larger gaps.
Advancement from NGS
Extremely Long Reads
The NGS sequencing Technology requires prohibitive storage space and operation time for the sake of relatively short digital crumbs( In fact, the average length of NGS reads is far longer than the Sanger, the first GS reads). Clearly, the shortage of N"
Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Results-esp_-_-_TEXT.html,"-EB seems to be successful. EB is calculated to be 30 kDa and we observed an intense band around 30 kDa after IPTG induction. However, Western blot might be needed to further confirm the result as Coomassie Blue stains total protein and recombinant proteins can be hard to identify among the multitudes of endogenous proteins. Besides, the protein ladder used in this SDS page does not have a band at 30 kDa and the observed band might not be exactly at 30 kDa.
SDS-PAGE, Second Attempt [❓]
In this experiment two batches of SDS-PAGE were done. In the second SDS-page, we added the untransformed BL21 cells to see whether there is a difference between the transformed and non-transformed cells since it was hard to interpret the results in last SDS-page without such a control. This is especially important since the T7 expression system can be leaky and recombinant protein may be expressed even in uninduced cells, further complicating the interpretation.

Only two more weeks and we will make them our little scientists, let their imagination run wild! Now we're working hard on the organisation of the debate. ULB has found two professors who want to come as speakers to our debate.
Week 6
We are still working on the debate. We have four speakers: Prof.  Bruno André, Prof. Jacques van Helden, Prof. Filip Rolland and Prof. Johan de Tavernier. Though it is a little tricky to get a moderator. Sir Rob Heirbaut wasn' able to come on the first of September, hopefully sir Jeroen Tuytten will give us a positive response! We made a detailed program for our workshop with kids. The workshop will be next week! Also a booklet about our project has been made in English and Dutch, for the boardmeeting of the K.U.Leuven. We received lots of gimmicks from imec (see our facebook). IBM announced to be a platinumsponsor, which deserves a BIG thank you!
Week 7
On Tuesday we organized a workshop about synthetic biology and DNA for 36 children (9-11 years old).  After discussing with them what scientists do and what DNA and synthetic biology is, we extracted DNA from tomatoes together with them, which they found very amusing! Then we asked them to draw whatever they wanted to create with synthetic biology. Afterwards they received their own Eppendorf tube filled with the extracted DNA. Rob TV was present at the workshop and filmed the whole workshop. A preview can be seen on [http://robtv.be/nieuws/oud-heverlee/tienjarigen-ontdekken-dna] but we will upload it ourselves with English subtitles. Pictures, movies and the drawings will be uploaded soon. Furthermore Beneo-Remy and reMYND agreed to become a Jamboree sponsor. VWR agreed to be our Platinum sponsor (we even receive new sets of microliter pipettes) ! The first persons registered for our debate on the 1st of September! We also received pop-ups from the K.U.Leuven to properly dress our debate room. The K.U.Leuven furthermore donates 100 additional bags and 200 beach balls, to expand our goodie bags!

Day 15
Group D
Miniprep plasmid extraction for 20K and 22A tubes.
Nanodrop concentration measurement. Tom noted that most of our concentrations are too low for sequencing (≤100ng/μl) and suggested that we elute using 35μl elution buffer that had been prewarmed in 55℃ water bath and then pass the filtrate through column and spin down again for better yields.
In the afternoon we performed the restriction digests of the plasmid and prepared the gel to be run on Monday for the digest products.
The gel has been left in a tank with buffer and a lid.
Week 4
Day 16
Lychee
Run gel for digested plasmids from 10/7. Check if bands are of correct size, if so, send sample for sequencing
Gel run no.1: Bands overrun into the bottom half of the gel - redo. But 21K[22A] and 21J[22K] seemed to show correct-sized bands → send for sequencing
Did gel extraction for 21J bands from gel but"
