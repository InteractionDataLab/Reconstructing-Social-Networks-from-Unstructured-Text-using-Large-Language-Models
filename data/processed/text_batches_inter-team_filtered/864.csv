Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Linker_-_-_TEXT.html," expected to be approximately 100-bp and are indicated by the orange arrows due to their faintness. The –C lane is a negative control. +C indicates a positive control making use of the RFP coding device J04450 which has an expected size of about 1100-bp when digested. The gel was a 2% agarose gel and was run at 80 volts for 90 minutes.
A construction attempted this week consited of placing the RFC25 fusion standard GFP ( BBa_K648013 ) gene behind the promoter BBa_J04500 . Also attempted were plasmid switches of all of the coil genes ordered. Colonies were seen for all of the transformed ligation mixtures for these constructions. Colony PCR of these transformed colonies only produced potentially viable results for the J04500 + K648013 construct. The K coil, K coil His-tag and E coil His-tag plasmid switches also displayed bands around the expected size during colony PCR.
Week 12: July 15 - July 19
This week contained some disappointment as the BioBrick constructions continued to have limited efficacy. The confirmation digests of the construct that showed some promise during last week’s colony PCR (J04500 + K648013) and the plasmid switches (K coil, K coil His-tag and E coil His-tag) did not produce expected results. One rather notable issue is the ~200-bp size difference seen in the J04500 + K648013 from the expected size of 955-bp. The difference appears to suggest that the LacI promoter is not present. This hypothesis was confirmed with sequencing results. This would suggest that the wrong enzymes were used during construction or that there is potential contamination of the enzyme buffers used.
A replicate of these constructions this week also produced similar results. Due to this it is recommended that new buffers be used for further constructions. Some of the difficulty present with plasmid switching the coils is due to their small size however. Since the coils themselves are at minimum approximately 60-bp in size. This is not kinetically favorable for BioBrick construction. It may be wise to primer on the coils to appropriate constructs when the time comes for their addition.  Also present in our constructions are re-ligations of the original vector. Due to this the time for phosphatase treatment will be increased from two to three hours to limit this issue.
Week 13: July 22 - July 26
Proceeding with the recommendations from last week regarding BioBrick constructions the plasmid switches of the coil genes into pSB1C3"

The government of the United States of America is the federal government of the republic of fifty states that constitute the United States, as well as one capital district, and several other territories. The federal government is composed of three distinct branches: legislative, executive, and judicial, whose powers are vested by the U.S. Constitution in the Congress, the President, and the federal courts, including the Supreme Court, respectively. The powers and duties of these branches are further defined by acts of Congress, including the creation of executive departments and courts inferior to the Supreme Court.

iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware"
NAWI-Graz,2016,Team:NAWI-Graz#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," by E.coli we can be really sure that our insilico worked. For all composite parts one protein can be found on the gel. In case of the toxin part we found the dam methylase wich was located downstream the toxin. In case of the antitoxin composite part we saw the red chromoprotein on the SDS and also with the coloured colonies.
Microbiology
The last part of the project was the microbiological part. This final part would show us if our hypothesis was true or not.  The first thing we did was to set up two over night cultures from each strain. When we induced one ONC at an OD600 of 0.6 and we ecpacted different growth behaviour.  The E.coli with the mazF toxin had no changes in growing (Figure 12) while the one with the ccdB toxin did not grow as fast as the not induced, but still showed growth (figure 11) . We think this shows us that the toxin/antitoxin system works because there is growth but E.coli shows stress symptoms.
Figure 11 Growth behavior of E.coli XL1 pUC19_blue_ccdB with in iducing at OD600 of 0.6. It can be seen that after indcuing the induced strain growes slower than the not induced strain but has still growth.
Figure 12 Growth behavior of E.coli XL1 pUC19_red_mazF with in inducing at OD600 of 0.6. It can be seen that no changes in growth behavior happened
For the reason the red clone showed normal growth we decided to add IPTG from the beginning. What we saw was that the growth of the induced culture was about 50% slower than the not induced ONC but still showed growth (Figure 13). For us this proofed again that the system is working.
Figure 13 Growth behavior of E.coli XL1 pUC19_red_mazF induced from the beginning. After 3.5 hours the induced strain showed a 50% lower growth rate than the not induced strain. This led to the conclusion that the system works but puts our E.coli under pressure.
The next thing we did was to bring the different colonies together on a plate. First we tried without inducing to see what happened. Like we assumed nothing happened, to different strains grow next to each other. (Figure 14)
Figure 14 E.coli XL1 pUC19_blue_ccdB against E.coli XL1 pUC19_red_mazF on agar plate without IPTG. Plates show equal"

Gold Medal and Integrated Human Practices
This page will contain information for your Gold medal Human Practices work, which you can also use to nominate your team for the Best Integrated Human Practices page. To make things easier, we have combined the Gold medal page with the Best Integrated Human Practices page since we expect the work to overlap considerably.
iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.
For more information, please see the Human Practices page .
Gold Medal Criterion #1
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.

Dundee,2016,Team:Dundee Schools#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," how to do the various procedures required to produce our construct. In the beginning of the summer the Dundee collegiate team greatly helped me develop the skills needed, and from their experience I have learned not to repeat their mistakes - such as not labelling test tubes.
Individual Attributions: Dry Team
Mia Wood
So that we could get everything done, my time was split 50/50 between the dry and wet teams (wiki coder note: we include her as an honorary dry team member anyway for a satisfyingly even split. Also since it's the better team). In the lab I did a lot of work in making the initial construct and performing the tests on it with the help of John, Fatima and Alex. Working together with the rest of my team in the lab made it very enjoyable, and allowed us to help each other and share our knowledge. When I wasn’t in the lab I would be working with Beth and Darryl on human practices/outreach, contacting various specialists to get their insight into our project. I also worked on the maths modelling with Beth, Bartosz, and Darryl, with the help of Lucas and Prof. Fordyce Davidson. Special shout-out to Fatima for driving me home in time for the Great British Bake Off after being in the lab until late.
Beth Rear
Throughout our project I was mostly part of the dry team, involving myself in maths modelling with help from Lucas and Prof. Fordyce Davidson. I was also focused on the human practices aspect of our project, working together with Mia and Darryl to develop this. Once that was done, I started working on our presentation and poster together with the rest of the team. (She may be a technophobe, but most of the lovely diagrams you see throughout our wiki and on presentation slides were by her and her unexpected Powerpoint prowess). However, I would occasionally be found in the lab helping out with any work to be done, particularly towards the final stages of the project.
Darryl Sime
During our project, I took on the job of coding/bringing together the team’s wiki. With limited prior knowledge of HTML and CSS, I decided to teach myself them using Codecademy, W3Schools, and the wonders of Google. When I hit a snag, I'd also seek guidance when needed from John, or Chris Nelis from the Dundee collegiate team. I also worked on human practices with Mia and Beth, plus a bit of maths modelling with them and Bartosz, guided by Lucas and Dyce. Big big thank you also to Ummi"

Duesseldorf,2018,Team:Duesseldorf#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," are indeed living organisms somehow working to improve our health.
However, when looking at the most frequent answer to question five, some of the participants have never consciously taken probiotics to improve their health. When asking this question in the supermarket, most of the people did not immediately know what probiotics are or what they consist of, until we named some known examples of probiotics and explained them that they harbour microorganisms. This outcome is very peculiar, as most of them are aware that our gut microbiome plays a huge role in our daily life, yet they do not consciously try to improve their health by for example consuming probiotics.
We believe that this result is due to the lack of trivial information in everyday life which we realized when we encountered a woman suffering from Crohn’s disease in the supermarket. Even though she belonged to the older subgroup of participants, she was very well informed about synthetic biology, GMOs and potential harms. Her age however did not keep her from approving of the consumption of genetically modified organisms if this would improve her health. Moreover, also when considering the answers of question 6 it can be clearly seen that for us seemingly simple questions like: “What do you consider a genetically modified organism?”, were frequently answered incorrectly. This became obvious to us at the supermarket, when looking at the people struggling to answer this question.  All in all we observed a trend at the supermarket during our chats with the customers. We got the impression that young adults with higher academic degrees tended to be more aware of GMOs. However, similar to the other participants, they rejected the consumption of GMOs as well, even if this would improve their health.
This clearly indicates that the public is still not very familiar with synthetic biology and its potential benefits. The last question was whether people would agree to the consumption of genetically engineered probiotics. With our survey and with our personal interaction with the public at the supermarket we can conclude that there is a tendency and acceptance of people to consume synthetically engineered probiotics. We had the impression, that the ones denying the consumption of genetically modified organisms had a distorted image of synthetic biology due to lack of public knowledge regarding this issue.

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.
Results

Additionally, we have posted our safety guidelines on the Open Science Framework, a webtool developed by the Center for Open Science in Charlottesville, VA that localizes open-source scientific research for the purposes of collaboration and reproducibility.
COMMUNITY LAB SAFETY GUIDELINES
Values
At Open Bio Labs, we are interested in protecting the safety of the members and guests using our facility, the people in our community, our local and global environment and our ability to operate as a biohackerspace.
Our goals are to drive innovation and curiosity, while implementing safety without requiring everyone to be experts or presenting a barrier to entry.
Our safety practices are designed to be commensurate with the risks of the activities taking place at OBL. Policies will be developed if and when needed.
Open Bio Labs will not exhibit judgement whether an experiment is good science. During all stages of a project, we encourage members to consider the ethics of their work. We reserve the right to disallow any project from continuing if the ethical considerations do not align with OBL rules. Additionally, we encourage the expression of opinions, as we desire to operate as a springboard for individuals to learn and explore.
Why biosafety matters (globally and in the lab)
Biosafety is an important consideration when working with all chemicals and organisms. Safe research in the lab can prevent environmental and human health harm, as well as costly mistakes. Some important consideration beyond the nature of the chemicals and organisms in use are the importance of well planned protocols, following protocols, good communication practices, thorough document management and the encouragement of open and honest reporting. Leaders must always ensure learning and not just training. By following these standard practices, an individual and her team can lower the risk that their research poses to others in the lab and in the world.

Brochure
In order to promote the science of synthetic biology, promote biosafety and promote our team's projects, we decided to make a brochure on synthetic biology after discussion. To make the brochure more interesting, we wrote a coherent story of the project and produced four cartoons to vividly visualize super-resistant bacteria. On the first day of school, we sent the brochure to the freshmen. After receiving the brochure, the students were reading it carefully. Some interested students even asked us for more knowledge about synthetic biology. We hope that this brochure will stimulate students' interest in synthetic biology and participate in more activities related to synthetic biology in the future.
Open a public course
In order to meet the needs of more people, we applied to the school this year to open a public elective course on the basis of molecular genetic machine engineering design, which allows college students interested in synthetic biology to independently learn the knowledge related to synthetic biology, we have provided A platform that can learn the knowledge of synthetic biology, we are pleasantly surprised that the class was full, and in addition, we introduced the igem competition, these college students showed a very strong interest and enthusiasm.
WeChat public account online
WeChat is a popular social software in China for communication by mobile phone. Some middle-aged and elderly people in China don't always believe in rumors. In order to disseminate scientific and technological knowledge to them, some scientific and reasonable views have been disseminated to prevent the elderly from being misled by rumors. We created two WeChat rumors, including bacterial resistance and GM food safety; and were promoted and forwarded in a circle of friends. Finally, we have received a lot of praise and received a lot of attention. Through our promotion, middle-aged and elderly people understand the truth behind more rumors and are no longer easily misled by rumors. It is hoped that this will enable older people to understand biology more deeply, so that the elderly are no longer misled by rumors and hope to promote public attention to biology.

By measuring these factors, we provide  not only solid data to support our hypothesis for our model, but also the  values of the parameters involved ( Results ).  As a result, we were able to achieve a double-ring pattern by modifying the cooperativity of the response to AHL upon adding positive feedback to the genetic circuit. ( Results ).
During the experiments, we encountered numerous challenges and difficulties. To overcome them, we created several NOVEL  protocols, software, and devices with the help of our knowledge from different  fields, such as “growth curve on agar plate” ( Protocols ), “movie taker”, and “reflection spectrophotometer” ( Novel  devices ). We believe more researchers will benefit from our  inventions.
Last but not least, in this  project, we created 15 biobricks and characterized one existing biobrick ( Characterization ), which are considered to  be helpful to future iGEM competitions and the study of synthetic biology.

Chemotaxis Model
The above embedded video is of bacteria chemotaxing towards a source of aspartate in the form of a crack from -300 to 300 in the view along the pipe axis. The units are in microns.
Introduction
When bacteria move in reaction to a chemical this is chemotaxis. A model of this is important to us, as the Pico-Plumber will consist of a colony of bacteria dispersed in water that swim towards potential leaks marked by chemicals. The aim of our chemotaxis model is to simulate how bacteria respond to a source of chemoattractant diffusing through a virtual pipe from a breach in the pipe inner wall. Using this simulation we can ascertain roughly how long it takes bacteria to swim towards a leak in the pipe, and from this, the required density of bacteria in the pipe to seal a hole of known diameter in a given time. A model of thousands of bacteria, each independently moving, is also useful in modelling how populations of interdependent gene regulatory networks behave. It is our aim to integrate a chemotaxis model and multiple gene network simulation together in order to check for any emergent behaviour and to see if the system will work.

Figure 1. A typical simulation setup visualized using VMD of DCD-1L solvated in water with NaCl. For clarity, the water molecules have been left invisible.
Prior to the production run, each simulation system was energy minimized using the steepest descent algorithm. This energy minimization was followed by a 0.5 ns NVT equilibration with a time step of 2 fs. During NVT equilibration, the temperature was controlled by the stochastic velocity rescaling thermostat developed by Bussi et al. [4] with τT = 0.1 ps. The NVT equilibration was followed by NPT equilibration for 1 ns with a time step of 2 fs. During the NPT equilibration, the pressure of the system was set to 1.0 bar using the isotropic Parrinello-Rahman [12] pressure control with τp = 2.0 ps. The temperature was controlled by the stochastic velocity rescaling thermostat by Bussi et al. [4] with τT = 0.1 ps. During both NVT and NPT equilibration runs, position restraints were applied to the protein structure.
For the production run, the pressure of the system was set to 1.0 bar using the isotropic Parrinello- Rahman [12] pressure control with τp = 12 ps. The temperature was controlled by the stochastic velocity rescaling thermostat by Bussi et al. [4] with τT = 0.1 ps. A time-step of 2 fs was used. For all equilibration and production runs, electrostatic interactions were calculated using the Particle-Mesh Ewald method [5] and periodic boundary conditions were applied. The simulation time for all systems during the production run was 50 ns.
Analysis of the simulation trajectories was carried out using Gromacs 4.6.7 built-in tools and visualization of trajectories was accomplished using VMD [8] . Assignment of secondary structure elements of the peptide was done using a Gromacs interface for DSSP [ 16 , 9 ].

I am a Biomedical Engineering master student at the TU/e. I am originally from Mexico, but after finishing my bachelor on Biomedical Engineering there I decided to come to The Netherlands to continue with my studies and seek greater challenges. I love being involved in many things at the same time, the more the merrier, especially if they put my brains to the test! iGEM has definitely given me that extra something that I always enjoy, making me get involved not only in modeling and programming, which I really like, but also in the lab. When I am not busy with the iGEM or my master studies I like reading a good book and running, dancing or just keeping myself active.

As a Biomedical Engineering student, I'm always interested in some complicated and interesting things. For me, the major reason to take part at the iGEM team of this year was doing research in a quite young field of science and engineering. Now I can bring the basic knowledge of theoretical courses into practice, which I think is nice and very usefull for a better understanding of the theory. I think iGEM is a nice opportunity to widen my horizon, improve my academical skills and to learn a lot about this interesting and emerging field of science.

I'm currently enrolled in master program Biomedical Engineering at TU/e. My bachelor was mechanical engineering. But I thought Biomedical engineering is a newly-emerged challenging area so I switched to it. It turns out to be a rewarding decision as I learned a lot from the lectures and I found many similarities in both engineering subjects. Now I would like to try some projects to get deeper understanding of engineering principles so I parcitipated in the iGEM team.

Soiled: Prototype device and Mobile App
By replacing the toxic chemical based laboratory standard of soil analysis with a colorimetric biological analog we can provide a safer alternative. Our plan is to produce a microfluidic chip that will house the necessary reagents, biological or otherwise. The microfluidic cartridge will be loaded into a portable device and integrated with compatible technologies, such as a phone and it’s case. The “color data” can be captured and measured by the phone’s camera, eliminating human error.
Soiled Bio Art Installation
In the Soiled installation we used an assortment of materials to depict the five boroughs of NYC, with a LED representing each of the locations we sampled. Using an Arduino we coded the network of LEDS to cycle through the results of the nutrients we tested for. The color of the LED indicates which nutrient was currently being displayed and the brightness of the LED correlates to the concentration of the nutrient at that specific site. This installation will be reinstalled at the School of Visual Arts gallery in Chelsea in early 2016 and we invite you all to attend.

Q3. What do you think are the advantage to synthetic biology?
A. A number of advantages were listed including:
Synthesis of biological and industrial compounds
Less damage to environment
Healthcare and energy production
Preventing and treating diseases
Q4. What do you think are the disadvantaged to synthetic biology?
A. A number of disadvantages were listed including:
Lack of control and regulation of what can and cannot be produced from synthetic biology methods
Create pathogenic or invasive species
Exploitation by businesses
Could be dangerous when released in environment
Q5. What are your opinions on the use of synthetic biology (including GMOs (genetically modified organisms))?
A. Majority of surveyors had thought that the idea was a good idea
Q6. What do you think about the use of GMOs to treat human disorders?
A.
Q7.  Would you allow yourself to be treated for a disorder using genetically modified bacteria in your gut?
A. From the above bar graph it can be seen that a majority would allow themselves to be treated by GMOs, however it cna also be seen that some however would not give a definite yes answer but will be dependent on the circumstances
Q8. What do you think the ethical issues surrounding this topic are?
A.
""Playing God"", the complexity of organisms and the potential for side effects. ""Not natural"" (as in the anti-vaxxers)
""What if the bacteria interfere with other bacteria in the gut ? What if the bacteria mutates and becomes less reliable, or hazardous ? Overproduce NMNAT could literally modify NAD+ pathway, which is a pathway highly regulated and controled. NMNAT by overproducing NAD+ or NADH could generate others disorders...""
""patents, leaks, misusage, modifying living organisms""

Education
As directed from the Human Practices and Survey wiki page, from what we had found on the survey we thought about going one step forward such that we created a lesson plan that could be used by teacher teaching students in Year 9/ 10. The link can be found under this: Lesson Plan

StudiumPlus Sponsoring - Auswertung
2 Studentische Vertretter waren anwesend und der Dozent.
Die ""Geldgeber"" waren nicht ganz überzeugt vom Projekt. Der Finanzplan ist noch zu unstrukturiert und es ist eher nur eine Teilfinanzierung möglich. Zusätzlich wurde gefragt, ob die Reisekosten vom AstA getragen werden könnten. Jedoch ist das nicht möglich, da der AstA keine Lehrenden unterstützt und die Reise im Rahmen des Moduls wäre. Ausweg: das Modul 2 Wochen vorher enden lassen und die Reise als studentische Exkursion ""tarnen"".
Wenn die Finanzierung durch StudiumPlus klappen würde, könnten einfacher weitere Sponsoren gewonnen werden, da die Uni ihre Unterstützung zeigt.
Einwurf von Teilnehmerin: Möglicherweise kann doch das MPI als Sponsor dienen - Sie wird versuchen, die entsprechenden Leute zu kontaktieren.
Weiterhin muss die Interdisziplinarität des Moduls gezeigt werden um die StudiumPlus verantwortlichen zu überzeugen

Blog #11 - No time for high politics
By NBailly 15:42, May 31 2014 (CDT)
International collaborations against antibiotic resistances are all well and good, but the UN Climate Change conference of all collaborations shows why coordination at the government level is the wrong approach, says Lars Fischer, editorial journalist at ""Spektrum Der Wissenschaft"". Not even a century ago, the discovery of antibiotics caused a decisive turn for the better in the millennia-long battle against infectious diseases. But while many already saw pathogenic agents eradicated and a golden age of medicine seemed within reach, we have now however reached an abyss: a dramatic relapse into a world looms ahead, where microorganisms are again rulers over life and death.
The threat emanating from the increasing antibiotic resistances is existential—for every one of us, as well as the countries and society itself. That the world community unites in a supranational board in order to face the latter, suggests itself. However, as alluring as the vision of an intergovernmental panel on antimicrobial resistance may be, as evoked by Mark Woolhouse and Jeremy Farrar (authors of the Nature article ""Policy: An intergovernmental panel on antimicrobial resistance"", published May 2014), this thought is gravely mistaken.
UN Climate Change Conference
Summits like the UN Climate Change Conference are the wrong approach to problems such as antibiotic resistances, says Lars Fischer. Picture from the Intern Blog of American University.
Indeed, it is right that there are parallels between climate change and antibiotic resistances, however, there are also extensive—essential—differences. Firstly, the time span: Glaciers melt and climate zones shift over centuries, the ocean"

Experiment of Suitable Antigen Concentration
Time:
30 Aug: Antigen concentration 500ng/ml; Antigen concentration 1000ng/ml; Antigen                                 concentration 2000ng/ml; Antigen concentration 4000ng/ml.
2 Sept: Antigen concentration 100ng/ml; Antigen concentration 200ng/ml; Antigen                                 concentration 300ng/ml; Antigen concentration 400ng/ml.
We investigated the effect of antigens of different concentrations on the vertical alignment                             of                             liquid crystals without antibodies. The methods of antigen-antibody immobilization on glass                             were                             collected from the literature of silkworm (crosslinked glutaraldehyde).The antigen was                             dissolved                             in 0.01 mol/L of PBS buffer (pH = 7.4) and configured to have                             0.1mg/L, 0.2mg/L, 0.3mg/L, 0.4mg/L, 0.5mg/L, 1mg/L, 2mg/L and 4mg/L of the antigen solution                             to have                             experiments with 1% DMOAP. For details of subsequent treatment, please refer to the third                             step of                             competitive immunoassay method. Antigen concentration gradient is small in the first five                             groups                             while antigen concentration gradient of the last three groups is big. Three parallel                             experiments                             were carried out in each group, and we chose the best picture to integrate them together. We                             observed bright spots separately under quadruple and tenfold objective. The specific results                             of                             the experiment are recorded as follows:

Minnesota,2014,Team:Minnesota#Templates#home&action=edit_-_-_TEXT.html," the benefits of implementing our device and how do we know if the benefits out-weight the potential risk of introducing a biohazard into the local water stream? What kinds of precautions should we bear in mind when designing the device? While our documentary addresses all these issues, what is even more thought-provoking is the question of can we reduce the usage of GMOs for bioremediation by reducing the production of pollution?               Please sit back and enjoy as the University of Minnesota 2014 iGEM Team presents our full thought processes regarding the above matters in a documentary film.
Public Perception
our team sought to inform the majority stakeholders in our community concerning the scope of our project. This year, our team chose to have an exhibit catered towards adult residents at the Minnesota State Fair (the largest MN gathering with over 1.8 million visitors annually) to learn the ways we can best design our technology to meet the needs and concerns of the people whose waters we hope to help remediate..  We delivered a short synopsis of our device, the synthetic biology involved, and safety precautions we have insured. We then presented visitors with a five question survey (Likert Scale) to gauge public perception of both our device, and the synthetic biology methods used. The survey was a huge success with over 320 participants. The survey delivery captured a great cross-section of the MN community that would be most impacted by the implementation of our device. The results of our survey, illustrated below, informed how and where the public would be most comfortable with  implementing our device, and illustrated the need for catered education addressing the public’s major concerns prior to applying our device in the environment. Our model for gauging public perception allowed for a wide, diverse crowd to be accessed. This model can be used upon request.

Abstract
Beside the research in the own project's field it is important to collaborate with other iGEM teams in order to share knowledge and face challenges together. In this way, ideally both teams can profit from the work and experiences from one another and push their individual projects even further. In concrete terms, we sought to support various teams in their advances, for example by designing measurement systems for them or by submitting to them experimental data they required. In the following we list our efforts towards this.
iGEM-Team York_UK
The iGEM-team York did, similar to our project, research into microbial fuel cells and so we got in touch and talked about our proceedings. We came to know that York had problems cloning the mtrCAB cluster and invested a lot of time to solve these problems. Time was certainly running at that point and we decided to help York. We already designed our MFC and tested different constructions in order to determine which one would be the most suitable. With all the experience we collected with MFC-construction, we were able to construct a MFC specially adapted to the requirements of team York. To ease up the usage of this cell, we wrote a detailed instruction on how to operate the MFC. Additionally we put nafion membranes, gaskets, carbon electrodes and injectors into a package and sent it to"

Playing with Pseudocounts
Using CTC because of position 6's reliance on the CNN frequencies, we see what difference values of pseudocounts (if in the frequency table, the frequency of an amino acid is 0, bump it up to the psuedocount: ex. A = 0 becomes A = .015 with a psuedocount of .015) make. Pseudocounts are necessary for data that has small sample size - we could be missing out on working helices because a letter's frequency is 0 when it shouldn't be.
Various pseudocount (psu = ) values. Look at the 7th column, which is position 6 in the helix:
psu = 0
psu = .005
psu = .008
psu = .01
psu = .015.
psu = .020.
The variation from E being the top letter to A being top back to E is from a slight adjustment in how we add on psuedocounts: the 'new' way is a more proportional approach.
Notice how psu = 0 gives only the four letters found in our dataset, while psu > 0 adds in other letters, each with a small probability ranging from .5% to 2%.
The question is how much psu to add: less means we weight our (possibly flawed) data of proven zinc fingers more. Higher psu adds more randomness (variation) to our sequences, but some fraction of those sequences will not work.
Updated Closest Zif268 Fingers
We realized that some of our ""close non-zif268 fingers"" were actually not all that close to Zif268, and so we went into the 88,000 zinc finger"

Human practices allowed us to reach out to our community and increase awareness of the various problems caused by biofilm.
We chose our project with the idea of combating antibiotic resistance. It has been well documented that bacteria found in biofilms are more resistant to antibiotic treatment than other bacteria, making them very difficult to get rid of. Having little idea about the impact biofilm has on our society, we decided to investigate further. Initially we wanted to find one area of application, but at the beginning we were not aware of the broadness of issues caused by biofilm. After doing several interviews we decided that the purpose of our project is to prove a principal and to address the broad variety of issues that needs individual solutions. This is important when assessing the delivery method for our CRISPR-system. This way we got an idea about the applicability of our system and which considerations that have to be made related to the individual problems.
We also spoke with experts for advice regarding our lab procedures, as we were uncertain of which aspects to focus on regarding biofilm formation. We wanted the biofilm assay design to have similar conditions as in nature. The discussions we had are described in the timeline below.

Introductory Lab Session – 16th July 2009
Introduction
In yesterday’s lab session, we prepared two chosen cultures of E.coli cells (one culture containing RFP and the other culture containing GFP) for midi-preps by inoculating 2 tubes of 3ml LB with them (2 different tubes for the two colonies). The cultures were then left overnight to grow under incubation; if the E.coli cells have grown successfully they will be midi-prepped today. If not, another attempt will be required. If the midi-preps are successful then analysis of DNA by gel electrophoresis will commence.
Practical Outline
If inoculations successful then carry out midi-preps on the 2 cultures of E.coli – one culture should contain GFP and the other should contain RFP.
Analyse midi-prepped DNA through gel electrophoresis.
Observations
When the flasks were taken out of the orbital incubator, not only could it be seen that the LB solution had gone cloudy with the presence of E. coli cells but that the cultures were also brightly coloured red and yellowy green (for the RFP and GFP-containing E.coli cultures respectively). With this success, the two inoculated LB solutions were transferred to 2 falcon tubes (50ml) for the midi-prep procedure.

Collaboration with Paul (visited the farm several times)
Using fresh milk samples from the farm
Summary
Paul elaborated on the mastitis problem by stating that cows can pass on the (potentially multiresistant bacteria) to their calves, further increasing the spread of antibiotics. Beyond the borders of the Netherlands, milk farmers have bigger challenges with antibiotic resistance. “Resistance transfer is a major challenge beyond the borders as antibiotic remainders can be found in food from cuttle.” In the Netherlands, this seems less of a problem, according to Paul. “We need to be sure that no antibiotics remain in the milk before we can sell the milk”.
“Since two years we are breeding cows that are healthier and have more resistance against diseases. We treat mastitis with the antibiotic Ubrolexin in a late stage. In this stage the udder looks red and infected”. Paul is able to check himself whether or not the cow has mastitis in early stage. “If the cow has mastitis, the milk texture is different. In this early stage, Ice Mint, a treatment salve, can do the trick and cure the infection”. Paul told us about new techniques in the market, like the milk robots that detect the potential of mastitis. “Measurement on the milk conduction can predict whether or not a cow is infected with mastitis”.

Summary
During this interview, we gained knowledge on current methods to identify pathogens and determine the sensitivity of these pathogens. These detailed methods will be necessary to follow trends and to validate current treatment and diagnosis.

BostonU_HW Main Page
Welcome to the 2017 BostonU HW Project: MARS
Microfluidics is often an overlooked tool in the field of synthetic biology because designing and using microfluidic chips requires specialized knowledge. Our project, MARS (Microfluidic Applications for Research in Synbio), aims to increase the accessibility of low-cost and easy to use microfluidic systems for the synthetic biology community.
The typical design, build and fabrication flow utilized in microfluidics requires significant intellectual investment, technical agility, a high startup cost and time investment. The 2016 iGEM Hardware Team, Neptune , in conjunction with CIDAR Lab created an alternative software workflow tackling design and manufacturing barriers. What our team focused on is the implementation stage of this workflow, ensuring that synthetic biologists are able to effectively use the tools provided to them.
The main goals of MARS are to:
Increase accessibility of Microfluidics
Design chips that are relevant to the day to day protocols in synthetic biology labs which can be used together to perform more complex protocols
Create and provide a standardized method of evaluating chip functionality
These three goals led to the creation of the three main branches of MARS: Microfluidics 101, the MARS Repository and Fluid Functionality. Using this end to end system, microfluidics can become a more accessible and practical tool for synthetic biologists to integrate into their labs.
Use the graphic and images below to navigate the three branches of MARS and get a more in-depth look at what we have created over the summer.

DTU-Denmark-2,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Project#PlugnplayAssembly#customization_-_-_TEXT.html," new BioBricks can be used directly or purified by agarose-gel purification if needed.
6. The assembly of new BioBricks and parts should be performed according to the protocol USER cloning .
The figure below shows the process of creating a degenerate linker (illustrated with a loop). Primers can be designed by using the standard Plug’n’Play linkers.
Illustrated below the process of creating a non-degenerate linker.
Example
Synthetic biology is all about creativity, and sometimes the standard is just not enough, making it necessary to combine the above mentioned customizations. The figure below illustrates that ""Plug 'n' Play with DNA"" makes it possible to assemble a degenerate linker (red), a non-degenerate linker (yellow), introduce a non-degenerate point mutation (X) as well as a degenerate point mutation (N) into one plasmid in just ONE round of cloning.
Linker table
Tips & Tricks
Design primers så the Tms between forward and reverse primer are within 2-5°C.
Remember that the annealing temperature should normally be 3°C under the Tm. However, when the linker is added to the primer, the Tm is increased. We have experienced that the best results are obtain when the final annealing temperature is above 62°C, if the primer have a Tm around 59°C to begin with.
The X7 Phusion polymerase have in the PCR reaction a extension time of 1000bp per minut.

Here is a short video on the serial monitor collecting data. The numbers are in relative light intensity units. We measured the lab at normal lighting conditions.
Data collected
We decided to characterize lux brick using our sensor. We measure the light intensity of lux brick at different glucose concentrations. Here is a graph of our results.
The measurements obtained by the sensor indicate that at higher glucose concentrations the biolumiscence of the cells decreases. However, experimental data obtained by plate reader is contradictory. ( Check here for data ) We believe that the sensor was not sensitive enough to measure light intensity differences between the flasks. Also there was a lot of noise in the measurement as you can see in this rough graph of the data.

I don't even know why I ended up being stuck with a group of French-Spanish-Iranian-Malagasy people that were doing a project in synthetic biology and I decided to give them a lift by looking for sponsors, project design, playing in the lab and presenting the project to the public.
I brought chaos and revolution to the team to wake up their most brilliant ideas. I am the bioreactor engineer, a gifted negotiator, and I know quite a lot of very romantic sentences in french.

Hello, my name is Toky. Coming from Madagascar, I did my bachelor degree in bioinformatics at the University of Evry. Passionate about technology, biohacking and neuro linguistic programming, I heard about iGEM and I knew that I wanted to participate.
As a computer geek, I was involved in most of task requiring a computer. Designing primer, analysing sequences, modeling and building things virtually before assembled them in the lab was main part of my tasks. Curious, I like to know what happen in the different part of the project and I love to bring my touch and help making things advance.

The Public BioBrick
One of the inspirations for our company was provided by an extensive human practice activity from last year. We were strongly involved in the Public BioBrick project, a 5-month collaboration between UCL iGEM and the London Biohackers to explore the potential of citizen scientists to access and contribute to the Registry of Parts .
The project included molecular biology work in the London Hackspace as well as UCL's teaching labs, into which we invited the citizen scientists. In the end, the work culminated in the first BioBrick submitted to the Registry that was completely designed and made by a public, non-academic group. Finally, the result was exhibited and discussed at the Grant Museum in London by a large audience from a variety of backgrounds.
This collaboration was our first of many interactions with the DIYbio community, and have been an important stepping stone in discovering the needs of citizen scientists to access synthetic biology in a safe and responsible way.

iGEM High School
Earlier this year, we helped mentor the first UK iGEM HS team at UCL Academy, a new academy school for pupils of any background. Even though the school is much better equipped than most public schools, the essential equipment for participation in iGEM - a PCR machine, a gel electrophoresis device, etc - was missing and laboratory work had to be carried out in our university laboratories with the high school students.
This experience has not just taught us about the necessity for affordable equipment that can be used in the classroom, but also about the need for the tools to be user-friendly to the inexperienced.

Genetic construction
Our relA BioBrick was digested with E+S, it was ligated into E+X-digested BBa_B0015 . the relA+double terminator was then ligated into an RBS backbone from BBa_B0034 . To be able to control the expression of relA, the arabinose-inducible promoter/inducer BBa_K113009 containing pBAD/AraC was put in front of the construct.
rrnB P1 was joined with BBa_I732019 containing an RBS, lacZ coding for beta-galactosidase, and a double terminator. This was then combined with the pBAD-relA construct. A problem we encountered was that relA contains a PstI site at bp 1393. This was mostly worked around in our construction. In one step in the construction, we had to digest relA with PstI.

Sydney_Australia,2017,Team:Sydney Australia#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"quencing from last week was entirely bad quality. We determined to send     off PCRs rather than whole plasmid, so Jamie amplified the inserts in the     pET15b vector and sent them off for sequencing again.
•Courtney also redid the transformations of pET15b-gBlock into BL21, as     they didn’t work last week. This time we finally got some successfully     transformed cells!
•Emaleen performed colony PCR on these transformants and correctly sized     bands were seen. We hope to start induction next week.
Education and Public Engagement:
•Courtney, Grace, Emaleen and Jamie gave a talk about iGEM and our project     at an event hosted by the USYD Biomod team. These excellent scientists are     entered in the Biomod competition which focuses on biomolecular design.

BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," syringe pumps were used to gradually push a syringe to dispense at a constant rate in Neptune’s project, they were able to demonstrate a high degree of control with their hardware platform. This gave us the confidence to reuse their hardware platform for our control syringe system in TERRA.
The control syringes are used to actuate valves on the TERRA Adapter, a predesigned chip for our system, enabling the system to selectively dispense outputs onto the vessel. The control syringe system can be broken down to units, with each unit containing a servo motor, 12mL syringe, 3D printed piston, and mounting board. These units can then be combined together in a modular fashion depending on how many are required for your experiment. Every output from your microfluidic chip requires 2 control syringe units, one for dispensing and the other for waste. For example, a 3 output microfluidic chip experiment requires 6 control syringe units. Its recommended to setup a multi-unit system when first setting up TERRA in order to eliminate to need to add further control syringe units for future experiments.

Controlling Our Hardware
To control the syringe pumps and the XY translational stage, we designed a back-end software framework in which actuates the servo and stepper motors responsible for movement of the pumps and XY-stage.
The XY translational stage moves through a set of timing belts and pulleys, where the pulleys are attached to the shafts of stepper motors. The timing belts are connected to horizontal and vertical 3D printed components of the plate support, so when the motors actuate, the pulleys rotate and the attached components move along their respective axes. The motors are also controlled by a motor driver, which allows for microstepping. Microstepping divides the motion, or steps, of a stepper motor into smaller divisions, allowing smoother and more accurate actuation. We incorporate DRV8825 motor drivers to our XY-stage system.
The syringe pumps exist in three states: origin, open, and closed. Each of these states are associated with a specific pulse-width-modulation (PWM) values, which dictates angle the arm of the servo motor. The servo motor is connected to a 3D printed arm, which then moves the piston of the syringe. This then actuates a valve on a microfluidic chip.
The stepper and servo motors are controlled by an Arduino Mega 2560, which is connected in the configuration shown below:

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,". Q8 accuracy measures the percent of residues for which 8-state secondary structure is correctly predicted. For the Contact Map Predictor, we set a probability threshold of 0.45 to determine whether two residues are in contact and the model correctly predicted 43% of all contacts.
We will continue to work towards improving the model performances as well as attempt different approaches to solve the contact map.
However, for the sake of completeness, we employed a publicly available tool that offers similar functionality but different approach. RaptorX-Contact-Predict is a web server tool that predicts the contact map and provides direct visualization of the resulting tertiary structure through JSmol.
Contact Map comparison of fimH wild type and our modified fimH. Black dots signify common contacts that exist in both structures, green dots the unique contacts in wild type fimH and the magenta dots the unique contacts that exist in our modified fimH sequence. The locations where the RPMrel and tags were inserted are evident in the contact map in places where there exist only magenta dots along the diagonal.
The top left structure corresponds to wild type fimH, the bottom left to our modified fimH. To the right, we see the two structures superimposed, with wild type fimH shown in grey.
A Deep Dive into Specifics - IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
Data
Our dataset is a set of 10932 proteins from the PDB database, that were selected based on certain criteria using the PISCES server. Specifically, the percentage identity cutoff is 60%, the resolution cutoff is 1.8 angstroms, and the R-factor cutoff is 0.25.
We observed that 9754 out of 10932 proteins have some missing residues, for which there is no structural information available. In all such cases, the missing residues were discarded and the sequence truncated. 21 proteins were excluded from the dataset as there was no available secondary structure information whatsoever.
We split the dataset of 10911 remaining proteins, into 8728 for training and 2183 for validation. In addition, we tested our Secondary Structure Predictor to the benchmark dataset CB513 in order to compare our approach with existing methods.
Labels
For the Secondary Structure Predictor the required label for every Amino acid in the sequence is the corresponding secondary structure information. Every Amino acid belongs to one of the 8 classes [ 3 ]. Hence, every protein sequence is paired with its label, a sequence of equal length consisting of the class id for every Amino acid.
To derive secondary structure labels for our dataset, we employed STRIDE, an algorithm designed for the assignment of protein secondary structure"

As a tutor game aimed at improving the understanding and facilitating IGEM and synthetic biology, iGAME itself is exactly a great way of human practice. With iGAME, people do not feel any distance to synthetic biology any more. Actually, it is time for everyone to join this trend to be as cool as Sheldon’s new biologist girlfriend. However, we do not stop here. We paid great effort to the safety issue and we have been dedicated to improving the knowledge of synthesis biology from classes and tried to share the part we contribute to the worldwide. We innovatively plot a new way of spreading the spirits of IGEM by starting our own community and we will never stop sharing and communicating.

Human Practice,""the C project""
Although we do software, we also keep eyes on promotion of synthetic biology and sharing our own program. Therefore, we started a long term human practice, “the C project”, since this summer.“the C project”, as we call, consists of three parts: Curriculum, Communication and Community.
Curriculum
As a IGEM team, we try to let people as many as possible to know what synthetic biology is. Therefore, advisors of our team, Haiyan Liu and Jiong Hong, have established a set of synthesis biology curriculum this summer. We have done many works related to human practice on the curriculum.
Jiong Hong(in the right picture), advisor of our team, gave lectures introducing safety and ethnics issues of synthetic biology.
Luojun Wang(in the head picture), members of our team, gave lectures promoting iGAME.
A survey* on how students know about synthetic biology and their interests for tutor game was made.(*the survey statistics comes from a sample of 240 students. Numbers of undergraduates, masters and PhDs are 160, 60 and "
TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," has led to the development of antibiotic resistances. Although this problem has already been popping up in scientific and newspaper articles for over 30 years, its threat is one that can no longer be ignored. The US Department of Health and Human Services estimates that annually over 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths in the United States are caused by antibiotic resistance. Moreover, it is approximated that by 2050, 10 million people will die annually due to antibiotic resistance. The ‘antibiotic apocalypse’ needs to be prevented, so action should be taken now!
Benelux Meetup at Wageningen UR
During the Benelux Meetup we attend an extensive workshop.
Citation Wageningen iGEM Team 2017
""""The goal of the workshop was for each iGEM team to get out of their expert point of view and discover what the needs or problems would be for the end-user of their project. The teams were to find out: What would it mean to use the technology in practice? Three to six people of each iGEM team were coupled to a small group of another team. Next, one team got to shortly explain their project as 'developer'. The other team was to ask questions as 'end-user' about how the use of the technology and its influence on their lives or work. After 15 minutes, the roles were reversed. The experts and alumni iGEM teams were also invited to participate.

Brainstorming
As described before, combating the development of antibiotic resistances was a project we thought worth working on. Nevertheless, we did not consider the application in fish farms as a feasible option anymore. So, we went back to brainstorming. Here, we thought about a new potential application: fighting (the formation of) biofilms, for example in industrial pipelines and on boat hulls. Additionally, we came up with ideas to remove biofilms from food and plants (Agrobacterium). Nevertheless, all these ideas either had a much easier and well-implemented chemical alternative or they were very questionable with regards to safety (i.e. containment of the genetically modified organism) and effectivity. Luckily, we ran into new possibilities!

Then, the bacterial solution was lysed and the expressed IL10 was detected by Western Blot (Figure 7). From this result, IL10 was successfully expressed in our constructed plasmid. As a widely validated and used anti-inflammatory interleukin, IL10 has been identified with critical functions in immunosuppression in human [3].

Next, we transformed the plasmid of myrosinase-His (Fig 5C) into BL21, and cultured at 37 ℃ overnight and diluted to OD = 0.2. After growth for 2 h at 37 ℃, different concentrations of IPTG were added to induce at 16 ℃ for 16 h. Subsequently, bacterial cell lysate was obtained and the expression of myrosinase was detected by SDS-PAGE. (Figure 8). The sequence of the myrosinase enzyme was optimized based on the K12 strain and the position of the strip is correct, so myrosinase was successfully expressed. The myrosinase can convert cruciferous vegetables contained glucosinolates into sulforaphane which has well-known anti-cancer activity. A previous work demonstrated the activity of myrosinase expressed by E. coli Nissle 1917 in vivo and in vitro [4], the expressed myrosinase in our constructed plasmid should with broad applications in vivo.For more details about this transferase related information, please see our project design .

Light drives the sensor to a state in which phosphorylation of OmpR is inhibited. Since unphosphorylated OmpR doesn’t bind to OmpC promoter, there would be only basal expression level of OmpC promoter.  In this condition LacIM1 and cI are expressed at basal levels. This enables the expression of a wild-type LacI and again results in repression of the inverter. Thus again Artificial Cooperation System turns on, and two types of cell would save each other from dying while communicating with each other.

Light drives the sensor to a state in which phosphorylation of OmpR is inhibited. There is no expression from OmpC promoter because unphosphorylated OmpR doesn’t bind to OmpC promoter. In low ratio of phosphorylated OmpR, LacIM1 and cI are expressed only at basal levels. This enables the expression of a wild-type LacI, again resulting in repression of the inverter. Thus again Artificial Cooperation System turns on, and two types of cell would save each other from dying while communicating with each other.
Figure 4-3-3.Wolfcoli system at daytime
At full moon night  (Medium light intensity) (Fig. 4-3-4)
Medium level of phosphorylated OmpR ratio results in moderate levels of cI and LacIM1. However, because the repression efficiency of cI is significantly higher than that of LacIM1, cI effectively shuts off LacI expression while the LacIM1 concentration is below the threshold required to repress the inverter. This difference between the cI and LacIM1 repression efficiencies drives the inverter to a state of turning on.  This results in turning off the Artificial Cooperation System. Thus, the two types of cell would not rescue each other in crisis situation since they can’t communicate. Due to these behaviors, we called the designed E.coli“Wolfcoli”.

As the secondary supplement, the anti-myc antibody previously used in the western blot was used. As it can be seen in Figure 3, after the addition of the anti-myc antibody a wavelength shift occured, which shows that an association of the anti-myc antibody to the HA4 Evobody happened. When a regeneration solution was added, a dissociation of the anti-myc antibody could be observed.
With this results put together, it can be confirmed that both the HA4 Evobody and its mutants as well as both SH2:cI fusion proteins were correctly expressed.

Wageningen_UR,2012,Team:Wageningen UR#Visiting Secondary School_-_-_TEXT.html," Secondary School twice. During the first meeting they gave a presentation about some basic genetic engineering tools and afterwards the pupils learned how to extract DNA from fruit with some basic tools like soap, salt, coffee filters and ethanol to precipitate. During this, all necessary steps were explained well, so the pupils were aware in each step of what they were doing, like breaking down cells walls or filtering out other cell components. During this simple experiment, the students experienced that DNA is present everywhere even in the fruit they eat and how simple the principle of DNA extraction is. This makes DNA a much more visualisable concept for the students.
At the end of the day, several articles about ethical issues among genetic engineering were handed out to the students, they were assigned to read it and come up with an opinion about the particular topic. The pupils were also supposed to make a leaflet about certain synthetic biology topics. There was no standard design and they were assigned to come up with a leaflet from scratch with their own thoughts, topics and creative ideas. This resulted in a lot of nice leaflets which were discussed during the second time the iGEM students visited this Secondary School. Some of the creative leaflets made are uploaded on our webpage. The leaflets are written in Dutch because it was a Dutch School.
A small summary in English of the leaflets:
Leaflet 1: The leaflet starts with a small summary of the possibilities of synthetic biology. They mention advantages in medicine production, the production of artificial cells and tissue for injured people and the advantages synthetic biology could have for the environment. They claim that synthetic biology would be able to contribute to those three topics and they enforce this claim with an example of a breakthrough of the iGEM team of the University of Groningen which, in 2010, came up with a protective biological layer for industrial ships. This layer could replace the conventional chemical layers which harm the environment due to heavy metals. In the end they mention genetic heredity and they warn of the fact that in the future people could ‘order’ children with specific traits. They raise the ethical question: should this be possible?
Leaflet 1
Leaflet 2: In this leaflet, synthetic biology is defined and explained with some examples. A clear overview of pros and cons of synthetic biology and its possibilities is given and they explain how synthetic biology could create life. Furthermore they explain how heredity works and of what components the DNA exists.

Windstott Farm
Genoa, NY
Windstott Farm has robotic milking machines, unlike other farms. We spoke to Bill Kilcer, the owner. Robot farms require very little human interaction - cows step into the machine as they need to, and sensors detect the teats before latching on. We watched the process and noticed that the iodine spray was automatically sprayed after milking, unlike other farms where a person had applied it manually. Bill told us that our ideas of having a temperature sensor and iodine spray built into the shell were already incorporated into the robots. He also said that our app would not be helpful for him because all the metrics that the milk samples are tested for, such as conductivity, temperature, and amount of fat and protein, are already stored in a computer. In addition, there was no need for CowMD since most of the farmers do not need information about symptoms. This feedback made us realize that our idea would be most helpful for bigger traditional dairy farms.

Scipio Springs Dairy
Union Springs, NY
Scipio Springs Dairy is a large farm with 800 cows. We met with Bill Morgan, who looks over the operations of the dairy farm, and the herd manager of the farm. Bill was interested in implementing bacteriocins on his farm instead of traditional antibiotics. He was impressed by our modular idea for the shell because he believed that it was an all-encompassing prevention to bovine mastitis. Bill believed that the UV light would be a great alternative to the traditional use of heat because heat changes the functionality of the proteins in the milk as well as the milk’s flavor. He liked the temperature sensor idea because Gram-negative infections  typically cause an increase in temperature. Bill Morgan was supportive of our idea, and was interested in testing our prototype and app once we finalized them.

Dairy One Co-op Inc
Ithaca, NY
Dairy One is a dairy data management company that assists farmers in making farming decisions. We spoke with John Tauzel and James Zimmermann for feedback on our app. Dairy One supported the Somatic Cell Counter idea because it is convenient and innovative. For the cost calculator, they noted that calculating the overall profit/loss of the farm would be more beneficial than looking at individual cows. They suggested that the cow data show the effectiveness of the farmer’s practices, so that the farmer can review productivity and make long-term decisions.

Uppsala-Sweden,2010,Team:Uppsala-SwedenWeek4_-_-_TEXT.html," AHL. The AHL which is thus synthesized diffuses through the cell membrane and gives rise to a chemical gradient around the sender colony. AHL in the receiver cells activates the expression of lambda repressor (CI) and Lac I repressor (Lac IM1). Receiver cells which are nearer to the sender colony are exposed to a high level of AHL thereby has a high cytoplasmic CI and Lac IM1 and hence the GFP gets repressed. On the flip side, when the receiver cells are farther from the sender colony, they are only exposed to a minimal amount of AHL thereby expresses only basal amount of CI and LacIM1 which triggers the cells to express wild type Lac I to compensate and this also represses GFP expression. Cells which are exposed to intermediate amount of AHL expresses moderate amount of CI and Lac IM1 but since CI is more efficient than Lac IM1, it effectively shuts down the expression of Lac I and Lac IM1 concentration is below the threshold to repress GFP. Thus the system expresses GFP only in the presence of intermediate dosage of AHL. The article also discusses about the mathematical model, spatiotemporal simulations and dynamic behaviour of the multicellular system. The concept has been adapted with some modifications in our current project.

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html,". The origins for this strategy comes from medical and engineering professions, where expertise is associated with the morality of the practice of the profession. If the same is applied to synthetic biology by means of doing no harm with the technology, it can be reconciled with and held publicly accountable with respect to the objectives of public health and national security. In fact, synthetic biologists already somewhat fulfil this requirement as many of them are actually engineers that permeated the field of biology (Weir and Selgelid 2009). This even applies to the UCL team where five students are biochemical engineers in the making and two others are pursuing a PhD in this field. The fact that the whole project is coordinated from the UCL Department of Biochemical Engineering also gives an indication of how strong this project is approached from an engineering perspective.
Nevertheless, in order to circumvent the governance conundrum for synthetic biology, professionalization can also be seen as one of the ways to connect the advantages of self-governing and self-regulating scientific production to a public policy framework. Science is often considered as a form of knowledge production that remains immoral and centred on discovery. By defining it in professional terms, other values can be attributed to it as well. In any case, what is suggested here is that there are ways in which governance can be organised so that the complexity of the issues can also be dealt with from within. Since synthetic biology has problematized governance for innovative practices in the life sciences, new regulatory frameworks have come forward to address the issue. Biosafety and biosecurity measures, such as updated codes of conduct, ethics education, oversight, commercial limitations, registration and licensing are among the options that have been suggested. Even so, there is a consensus with the community of synthetic biologists that the scientific momentum to gain progress as a discipline remains underpinned by transparency and synergism on a transnational level (Weir and Selgelid 2009). Furthermore, Miller and Selgelid (2007) argue that dual-use governance should be balanced between individual sovereignty of scientists and undivided governmental oversight (Miller and Selgelid 2007). The implied solution would then be a reflexive approach made up of self-governance within the scientific community itself. The role of the government can vary in degree of their involvement, but overall, the provided governance structure must assure that advances in science and economic growth are not curtailed (Kelle 2013).
Self-governance would entail that the synthetic biology community would be endowed with an operational framework in which it can voluntarily regulate itself to avoid misuse. Individual scientists are then able"

Results
- We have examined the behaviour of S. oneidensis and E. coli in different media using half fuel cells. We managed to obtain results using the following media: LB, M9 with glycerol and M9 with sodium acetate. The results are summarised in figures 2 and 3 below. We also performed a measurement for Citrobacter freundii to see whether it differs from other bacteria.

Experiment 3 (left) was performed using 250 ml of medium M9 with 0,4% glycerol while experiment 4 (right) was performed using 250 ml of medium M9 with 0,4% sodium acetate. In experiment 4, C. freundii was also tested.
Growth-based biosensor
We have designed and tested a growth-based arsenic biosensor with a direct electric output. In order to test the principle of this device, we have transformed E. coli JM109 with Edinburgh 2006's BBa_J33203 BioBrick (arsenic promoter with arsR repressor linked to lacZ' gene responsible for lactose degradation). We have then prepared 3 half-fuel cells with lactose medium (M9 with trace elements and thiamine + 1% lactose):
1) BBa_J33203 transformants  in medium with sodium arsenate (100 parts per billion concentration)
2) BBa_J33203 transformants in medium without sodium arsenate
3) control, wild type E. coli in medium with sodium arsenate (100 parts per billion concentration)

The growth of cells and associated change in voltage was much slower compared to our previous experiments. This can probably be attributed to the lower temperature of incubation as the fuel cells were incubated at room temperature. Despite the slower growth rate"
