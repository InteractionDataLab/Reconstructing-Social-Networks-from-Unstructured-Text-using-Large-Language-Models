IvyTech_SouthBend_IN,2014,Team:IvyTech SouthBend IN#progress_-_-_TEXT.html," with an outside adviser, we have realized that much of our protocol was wrong when it came to running an electrophoresis gel. We were doing a ""quick run"" protocol, running a high voltage for a short time. Now we are running at a significantly lower voltage, and tripling the time it takes to complete the gel. The DNA bands to our parts are now turning out well. However, the bands in the DNA ladder still look smashed together, which continues to make it impossible to count our parts' kilobases.
Our team has started working on a plaquing assay with T7 and T4 viruses. We are trying to figure out exactly what concentration of virus we need to work with. Unfortunately, the problem of contamination has become an even bigger issue during the performance of this protocol. The outcome yields a lawn growth of cells that is too thick to make out sufficient plaques of dead zones and there are bright yellow colonies found on a few of the plates (Five plates total in all.) We worry also that perhaps we are using a broth culture of top 10 E.coli cells whose concentration may be too high for the virus to kill.
Week of 7/20/14 through 7/26/14
We have created a stock of our two parts on the pSB1C3 backbone. We purified both parts, will prepare to send them in to iGEM by running an electrophoresis gel to prove that our parts are what we say they are. We ran two gels, but the DNA bands are coming out deformed for some reason and the DNA ladder does not have distinguished bands that can be used to count how many kilo-base pairs our part has. We are looking into why this is. Possible explanations include incorrect voltage, incorrect agarose gel thickness, or incorrect amount of DNA added. Adjustments will be made in the future.
We have also performed 3A biobrick assembly two more times and have a new stock of our part on its original backbone pSB1AT3.
Our problem of contamination is continuing to persist. During our attempts of recreating a new stock of our parts, we found bright yellow colonies all over more than half of the plates we streaked.
Week of 7/13/14 through 7/19/14
This week we worked towards switching our part's backbone from pSB1AT3 to pSB1C3. We had some difficulty doing this. The first attempt was fruitless, but on our second attempt we had success and we now have a stock of our part on a chlor-resistant backbone.

Objectives
This year we presented Softer Shock to several audiences, from students to seniors,               to get their point of view and develop the project according to society’s needs.
Presentation of softer shock at the Sèvres mayor’s office and the Department of Val de Marne.
On Thursday, April 27 we had a meeting to present our project to the mayor’s office of Sèvres’.                   A part of our team went to this meeting to present the iGEM and our project (what is our goal to improve agriculture).                   We presented the scientific and ethical aspects of synthetic biology in youth education and our qualifications                   for the grant. They were very interested in our project and the potential results. We were awarded a grant of 1 000€                   for participating in the student science education, and congratulated for our enthusiastic participation in such a                   competition. For our first professional presentation it was a very good experience!
With the same goal to present our project for fundraising but also to have different perspectives and                   advice on softer shock we met some representatives of the Val de Marne Department. Our project consits of                   different parts. First, we present the context and the history of the iGEM competition. Then we explained what                   made us different from other teams -  our pluridisciplinarity and complementarity. We then explained the technical,                   scientific and ethical aspects of our Softer Shock project. We concluded the presentation with the project budget and                   the our requirements for accomplishing Softer Shock. We were awarded a 1 500€ grant, they were confident in our project                   and wanted to help us to start our proof of concept.
Our participation in the French Science Festival
The Science Festival in France, held annually since 1992, is a day of science presentations and                 demonstrations in public spaces. The goal is to provide an appealing introduction to science for the youth,                 as well as provide a opportunity for informed dialogue between the general public and working scientists on                 science in current events.
In order to present synthetic biology and some of its applications (of which our project is only one example)                 we presented Softer Shock to other students.

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#expresults#qs_-_-_TEXT.html," 3OC12-HSL binding to the corresponding LasR regulator followed by inducing the promoter pRhl . Here switching occurred at a concentration 1 nM of 3OC12-HSL and reached fluorescence per OD of 750 a.u.. This is approximately 0.5 fold the value of the fluorescence per OD shown by the reference curve indicated in green.
Conclusion of crosstalk experiments
As shown in the graphs in the matrices above, we found and quantitatively characterized all three levels of crosstalk. The three levels were the following:
A given promoter with its corresponding regulator and a different inducer molecule
A given promoter with an unspecific regulator and a particular inducer
A given promoter with both regulator and inducer being unspecific
Unspecific inducers binding to the regulators as well as unspecific binding of the regulator to another promoter species was observed in almost all possible combinations.  To conclude, we were not able to find an orthogonal quorum sensing pair out of the three systems investigated ( LuxI/LuxR, LasI/LasR, or RhlI/RhlR ). While we see a significant effect when implementing the influence of these crosstalks (on an inducer-, regulator- and promoter-level) in our whole cell model , the logic gate still continues to function for a range of inputs at physiological concentrations.

Promoter design
Promoters classes
Constitutive promoters
There are several types of constitutive promoters that we can focus on.  These promoters are separate in regard to their respective sigma binding domains.  Constitutive promoters that interact with the sigma 70 domain of RNAP are most common most prevalent being as how sigma 70 RNAP is most common at normal cellular growth conditions.  The alternatives would be sigma 54 and sigma 32 binding factors, these types of polymerases are more active when the cell is under certain strain, such as heat shock of nitrogen starvation.
There has already been considerable work done with sigma 70 RNAP including an established promoter library of varying promoter strengths available on the parts registry.  We will develop and implement a method to fully characterize and standardize these promoters' activity and upload it to the registry.
Promoter UP Elements
Work has been done to identify a consensus UP element on some promoters which interacts with an alpha subunit on RNAP.  This UP element has been shown to significantly increase the recruiting power of promoters.  We are working on creating this UP element as a modular BioBrick part and characterizing its activity using the promoter characterization method that we develop.  We will also manipulate this element using a bottom-up design approach to get UP elements of varying degree's of strength.  Thus increasing the level of control we have over gene expression.
T7 Promoters
T7 phage promoters have long been utilized as a way to create orthogonal gene expression.  There is very little variation in the strength of T7 promoters available via the BioBrick registry.  Our goal is to identify a consensus T7 promoter sequence and use our bottom-up design approach to create a library of T7 promoters which we will characterize and upload to the registry.
Design strategies
Promoter design will be approached from the bottom up.  First, a consensus promoter sequence will be studied and accepted by researching the work done by others on various promoters.  This consensus will be our starting point as we identify which nucleotide and nucleotide sequences are most important to RNAP binding affinity.  We will use direct synthesis to construct promoter sequences that we will test.

Unfortunately, we couldn’t transform the diluted DNA from the 2013 DNA kit.
Today, instead of trying to transform using JM110 by washing it with sorbitol 1M or using a commercial cell, we used Escherichia coli DH5α chemically competent cell to transform biobrick BBa_E0840.
We also transformed Escherichia coli DH5α with  pUC72 having approximately  1.000ng/ul and 1ng/ul, because we wanted to find out if the reason why the diluted DNA didn’t work was due to its low concentration.

The velocity V2 is calculated by multiplying the kcat-value of 0.0212 s-1 found in the literature with the used concentration of NAD+. For KmNAD+ and Kmbos we use the values we found in the literature ( Chen et al., 2002 ):
KmNAD+= 0.5 µM
Kmbos= 0.06 µM
Regarding KiNAD+ we considered AMP and NMN as possible inhibitors ( Chen et al., 2002 ) for the reaction. The literature provides half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50-values) of 3.1 mM for AMP and 9.5  µM for NMN. We assume that AMP has no significant influence in our model, as the IC50-value is quite high. The IC50-value of NMN on the other hand is in closer range to concentrations that might be achieved during the performance of our test, so we do consider it in our calculations. To determine KiNAD+ we used the formula

yielding an value of 0.45 µM for NMN.

The modeling was done with the software Berkeley Madonna using the common fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to solve the equations. The model was fitted to the measured data shown above by the function ""curve fit"" in Berkeley Madonna to calculate the parameters, constants etc.
To model the BPA degradation by E. coli carrying BioBricks for BPA degradation (<partinfo>K123000</partinfo> and <partinfo>K123001</partinfo>) the cell growth has to be described first to calculate a specific BPA degradation rate per cell.

Fine tuning
From the equation, we can predict that:
1. the integration parameter km1 can characterize the relative level of leakage.
2. the larger the RcfB concentration is, the quicker the fluorescence will be.
At first we have the constitutive promoter fine-tuning. The BIT-China suggests us using different promoters in our construction. The performance of promoter P170 and rCfB play an important role. We choose to use different constitutive promoter J23103 J23109 J23107 and J23100 for the result (Figure 11). According to the figures, we can get the highest rate of change in fluorescence when we use J23100 promoter which is also the most sensitive one among all the promoter testing. Therefore, we choose J23100 promoter since it is convenient to represent lactate concentration by using fluorescence as the measurement. Particularly, when we have a stronger promoter, the amount of rcfB will be more during stable state. As a result gained from equation, the P170 can be activated in a faster speed and consequently, the changing rate of fluorescence will be greater as well.
Figure 12. Fluorescence changes with time when rcfB is constitutively activated by J23100, J23103, J23107 and J23109,respectively.
Next, we will explore the effect brought by leakage which means that P170 can activate and lead to fluorescence expression when lactate doesn’t exist. We have predicted that km1 is the index of leakage. km1 is higher, then we get more leakage shown up. Here we make k_m1 equals to 1, 10, 50 respectively and the result is shown in Figure 12. As predicted, the result is well suited to our calculation, because km1 is a constant unrelated to lactate concentration. It has a remarkable  influence on the result when lactate amount is relatively small. Then we will analyze the constants related to km1, which mainly contains rate k3 that is directly activated by P170 as well as proportion , which can both affect leakage. Our target is reducing the leakage expression, thus, we need to lower those constants as much as possible.
Figure 13. Fluorescence changes with time when k_m1 equals to 1, 10, 50. Difference has been show to illustrate the situation of different km1 under limited lactate concentration.

OUC-China,2017,Team:OUC-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," research shows that the quantitative description on function of terminators in yeast is very important for SynBio work in the future.
Just the same as in promoters, for yeast, terminators also have some core regions that play a crucial role in their functions, the existence of which makes it possible to optimize those lengthy terminators into shorter but stronger ones.[18]  ZIJIAN GUO et al. identified that the yeast terminator has three domains，suggesting that 39-end formation of yeast mRNAs have the following three degenerate elements: (i) the efﬁciency element, which functions by enhancing the efﬁciency of positioning elements; (ii) the positioning element, which positions the poly(A) site; and (iii) the actual site of polyadenylation.[17,18]
As suggested in Yamanishi’s research, we chose an engineered minimal expression-enhancing terminator with low leakage for standardization in our project. We call it MINI terminator.
Fig 3.2 The structure of mini terminator.
Combination
In 2013, Kathleen A. Curran et al. published a research, in which they mentioned that different combinations of promoters and terminators can provide various effect on expression level of the corresponding gene [19]. This research shows that the modularization properties of promoters or terminators in yeast is not as good as that we desire. It is difficult to predict the behavior of a particular promoter-terminator pair based on their respective strength.
To characterize the function and relationship of promoters and terminators in yeast, we see the promoter-terminator pair as a basic genetic regulatory element here. So, what will happen if we place strong MINI promoters and strong MINI terminators from different research works together? When we define the promoter-terminator pair as genetic regulatory element, is it possible to find out the minimal genetic regulatory element (MINI-GRE) which can drive similar expression level as that of commonly used parts before in Yeast?
Circuit construction
To explore the feasibility of MINI-GRE by combining promoters with terminators as that we mentioned above, we designed four promoter-terminator pairs, and constructed four different report circuits for them (fig 3.1).
For circuit 1, we pair promoter CYC1 with terminator CYC1, which are among the most commonly used native promoters and terminators and also have a relative medium strength in yeast.[19] For circuit 2, promoter CYC1 is paired with terminator MINI. The MINIp-CYC1t and MINIp-MINIt, respectively, serves as the chosen"

Throughout our project, we collaborated a lot with another team, 2012 Tsinghua iGEM team. We widely communicated with each other in various aspects. We shared our experience and opinions all the time and one was always willing to offer help when another got trapped. We held a joint seminar together to introduce iGEM to undergraduates on campus, which turned out to be a huge success – the lecture hall just could not hold one more enthusiastic heart!

From 2011.igem.org
Background Research
Synthetic biology, as an emerging field, raises issues of particular sociological importance. Education, regulation, interdisciplinarity and reasons for participation emerged from our initial brainstorming as interesting themes, and we have examined each of them below with a view to shaping our ‘human practices’.
Education - Science Question Time
The iGEM website explains that the competition is an effective teaching method , but how does it facilitate education? We attended a discussion with experts in science education policy, organised by the Biochemical Society , the Campaign for Science and Engineering and Imperial College London , to find out current policy issues that affect iGEM’s educational potential.
During the Science Question Time , several concerns were raised that are relevant to the competition. First, what are the barriers to participation? In the UK, with educational budgets squeezed as a result of conservative policies, it is becoming more difficult to afford college and university education. Participation in iGEM is expensive, with travel, accommodation, and summer living costs required. With gaining external sponsorship becoming more difficult due to the economic climate, this expense means that many students are excluded from taking part in the competition. We asked funding advisers from the Wellcome Trust, a UK iGEM team sponsor, what they thought about this cost here .
The second prominent issue raised was the question of how to encourage young people to choose a career in scientific research. There are several campaigns such as Future Morph aimed at persuading students to choose science education. To find out what makes iGEM appealing to students choosing a science career, we asked UK iGEM teams why they decided to take part here , and talked to Guardian Science correspondents about the educational-monetary value of iGEM here .
Regulation - Louis’s POST Internship
In the UK, the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology provides impartial analysis to government of science and technology related public policy issues. This information is used to inform regulatory decisions, and since iGEM constitutes a significant part of the emerging field of synthetic biology, we decided to explore how POST presents the field and relevant social issues. Our team member Louis undertook an internship in the office, and explored the processes by which scientific and social research is condensed for consumption by parliamentarians.
Louis discovered that the UK’s government has highlighted a preference for international agreement on synthetic biology policy, to improve competitiveness and maximise economic benefit from the technology. European initiatives such as Emergence and Syn"

Cellulose modulates biofilm formation by counteracting curli-mediated colonization of solid surfaces in Escherichia coli. Microbiology (Reading, England). 2008;154(Pt 7):2017-24. . This would be achieved by the cloning of plasmids containing the cellulose synthase operon acsABCD, utilising the two parts BBa_K1321334 and BBa_K1321335 , constructed by Imperial College London 2014. This would enhance the cellulose biosynthesis and thereby optimise the energy outcome of the entire system in our project. Due to cloning difficulties, it was decided to prioritise other aspects of the project and therefore keep this part theoretical henceforth. For further information about the cellulose biosynthesis approach, read here.

Cellulose Biosynthesis
Approach
Optimised Cellulose Biosynthesis in E. coli
To enhance the cellulose biosynthesis, parts containing the coding sequence of the Cellulose Synthase enzyme were cloned into the E. coli strain MG1655. The original idea was to clone the entire cellulose synthase operon acsABCD into one vector under control of the Ptac, as seen in Figure 1. With a plasmid with a total length over 9000 bp, the cloning emerged difficult. After several unsuccessful attempts, a different approach was sought.
Figure 1. The acsABCD operon controlled by Ptac cloned into one high copy vector.
In this design, it was attempted to implement the acsABCD operon into E. coli MG1655 on two separate vectors, with both parts controlled by Ptac BBa_K864400 , ensuring equal expression levels of the parts. The AcsAB dimer, encoded in the part BBa_K1321334 , was attempted to be inserted into the vector pSB1C3. The part BBa_K1321335 , containing AcsC and AcsD, was inserted into the vector pSB1A3. Several combinations of the two parts and different vectors carrying different resistance cassettes were attempted, but unfortunately without success. Correspondence with a supervisor from the Imperial College London team , revealed that cloning with these parts had emerged difficult for them as well. Due to time constraints, it was decided to prioritise other aspects of the project and therefore keep this part theoretical henceforth.
If the cloning of the acsABCD operon had been successful, the cellulose biosynthesis would"

Project Abstract: Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field.
We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

Yale,2016,Team:Yale#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," Markov model-based search algorithm hmmer to search for homologues on the Viral Genome Database and on the ENSEMBL Bacterial Genomes Database and display them in a phylogenetic tree.  Ligation independent cloning was then used to clone the recombinases into vectors for testing.
pORTMAGE-3: An independent system for MAGE on a plasmid
To streamline the implementation of MAGE, scientists have developed pORTMAGE-3, a broad-host vector that contains a beta recombinase, a dominant negative mutL mutant, and a temperature-activated promoter. However, these components come from E. coli and are not validated in rhizobia. Thus, in parallel with our work with recombinases, we transformed and tested rhizobia with pORTMAGE-3 and hope to optimize it.
Constructing a synthetic biology toolkit
In order to make rhizobia easier to engineer, we worked on establishing a library of inducible and constitutive promoters compatible with rhizobia. To do this, we identified potential promoters through extensive literature searches on the organisms in question. Using ligation independent cloning, these promoters were cloned into vectors with citrine fluorescent protein and tested in E. coli and the rhizobia strains.
Nodulation Assay: Ensuring that rhizobia do not lose the nod plasmid after MAGE heat-shock
During MAGE, a brief heat shock period (42°C for 30 seconds) is performed to promote the uptake of mutagenic oligonucleotides into the cell. However, it has been shown that upon heat shock, rhizobia are prone to losing peripheral plasmids. One plasmid of importance is the nod plasmid, which contains the genes necessary for producing proteins essential in nodule formation. The purpose of performing a nodulation assay is to ensure that the nod plasmid is not lost upon the MAGE heat-shock step. Such loss of the nod plasmid would undermine the significance of rhizobia in the legume-rhizobia symbiosis that allows for nitrogen fixation.

This  compares to polypropylene having a melting point of 170℃ a young’s modulus of 1.7 GPa and  a tensile strength of 35 MPa (Khanna and Srivastava 2005). The similarity in properties between  PHB and polypropylene is advantageous: 1) PHBs could replace polypropylene, 2) similar  properties could mean mixing the two plastics leading to ‘hybrid’ materials, and 3) downstream  processing of PHB could be carried out with the same equipment reducing processing costs. The  potential applications for PHAs are so vast that many companies are starting to commercialize  (Chanprateep 2010).
Figure #. The figure above shows the standard structure of PHA. When R is methyl (CH3) the polymer is known as PHB. ‘n’ represents repeating subunits of the monomer. PHB polymers can up to 900-1000 kDa in size.
The genes from some of these PHA producing species of microbes can be expressed in laboratory based strains (e.g. E. coli) to overexpress the PHA polymer to obtain high yields.
Polyhydroxyalkanoates at iGEM
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have a long established history at the iGEM competition. The first PHA project at iGEM was first carried out by the 2008 Utah State iGEM team (Utah_State 2008) . In 2012 the Tokyo Tech team demonstrated a fully functional polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production system made out of BioBrick parts using a native promoter system (Tokyo_Tech 2012) . Tokyo Tech’s complete operon was released to the iGEM community in the 2013 distribution kit. In 2013 the Imperial College team used a hybrid promoter system to improve upon Tokyo Tech’s 2012 design to get 11x more PHB production (Imperial_College 2013) . Imperial’s project also explored degradation of PHB for carbon recycling.

However, he also told us about the importance of safety, since the distinguish of RIFAs also hurt our environment and make an unpredictable result. Besides, we learned that although RIFAs are invertebrates, keeping them in the lab still requires a higher biosafety level for that they are hard to wipe out. Due to its high biosafety level, our wet lab may not be able to use RIFAs as a project, but we still thank professor Yang a lot for teaching us so much.
After this visit, we recognized that a mature project is not only creative but also available and safe.
Visit Dr. Wen-Chuan Kuo --The use of OCT and the animal experiment
After a series of brain storming, we decided to deal with androgenetic alopecia. At first, we wanted to make a simple device that can observe the hair follicle. Therefore, we visited Dr. Wen-Chuan Kuo on April 28th. Dr. Kuo have abundance experience in using OCT, which is a kind of hair follicle observing device. Dr. Kuo taught us how to use OCT, but she also mentioned that we should use mice as an experiment object of OCT. However, our competition has time limit, and none of our members are able to get the qualification in animal experiments. We needed to find a new project.
1st Time With Dr. Chih-Chiang Chen --Project decision
The process of project design was frustrating. To avoid animal experiments, we decided to change our project and try to heal Androgenetic Alopecia(AGA). To know more about the social demand in this area, we visited Dr. Chih-Chiang Chen of Taipei Veterans General Hospital in the morning of May 4th. Dr. Chen introduced the mechanic of hair growth, and taught us the difference in hair follicle between mice and human. That is the reason why we cannot find a good object in AGA test, and hard to prove the efficacy of candidate medicine. To solve this problem, we decided to use synthetic biology to design a medicine screening system for curing AGA.
While carrying on and improving our experiments, we did not forget that our project is not only for the iGEM competition but to serve the people suffering from hair loss. To fully understand their needs, we visited experts, interviewed them and discussed with peers.

(2) J23100-(RBS)yebF-terminator
Steps:
Transform both circuits to Escherichia coli, and grow the modified E.coli liquid culture overnight. At the meantime, culture Streptococcus mutans biofilms, and add crystal violet to label the location of the biofilms.
Adjust the two cultures to the approximate OD value.
Centrifuge the cultures and extract the supernatants.
Finally, add the solution into the liquid culture of Streptococcus mutans. Use confocal microscope to check the crystal violet stain. The amount of crystal violet stain can show if the biofilms are degraded or not.

St_Andrews,2011,Team:St Andrews#switch_-_-_TEXT.html,"ose control, but we decided that the data was not sufficient to show kill switch activity.  In order to reduce growth, in subsequent experiments we replaced the luria broth with sterile water and incubated the E. coli at room temperature rather than 37 degrees, but even with these changes, we were unable to find useful results.
In Week 10, with the iGEM Jamboree looming, we decided to view our E. coli under a light microscope in the hopes to watch our kill switch functioning.  This inspired the idea to use fluorescent dyes to distinguish between live and dead cells, and then measure fluorescence in the same plate reader we used for measuring absorbance.  We purchased the LIVE/DEAD Baclight Bacterial Viability kit, which functions via a mixture of two dyes.  The first, SYTO 9, is absorbed by all cells regardless of whether they are alive or dead, and fluoresces green (at 530 nm) when excited (with 485 nm).  The second, propidium iodine, is only absorbed by cells with damaged membranes.  Propidium iodine competes with SYTO 9, fluorescing red (at 630 nm) when excited (with 485 nm) and reducing SYTO 9's fluorescence within that cell.  Further details of how the LIVE/DEAD Baclight Bacterial Viability kit works can be found here .  We integrated our characterization experiment into this experiment's protocol, which can be found below.
BBa_K628006 Characterization Experiment Protocol
We also devised a protocol to test the potential drug release of our kill switch.  We hoped that we could synthesize a DNA device that would create a drug in vivo that would be released along with the cytosol upon membrane pore formation (i.e. kill switch induction).  The drug would be a protein created by a synthetic gene placed on either the same plasmid as, or alongside the plasmid containing, our kill switch.  This gene could be governed by either a constitutive promoter, allowing a slow, increasing concentration of the drug within the cell, or by an inducible promoter, which would only induce drug production when stimulated by an outside source.  Because iGEM requires proof-of-concept experiments (and we lacked the knowledge required to synthesize and intracellular produce a real drug), we theorized the ""drug"" as a GFP molecule.  GFP is too large (26.9 kDa) to be exported naturally from the cell, and therefore served as both a molecule of the right size"

A significant amount of Tn5 was observed in the nickel chromatography elution fractions (lane 10-14), however the Tn5 protein was also observed in the flowthrough and wash elution fractions (lane 5-9). It is recommended to optimize the nickel chromatography to reduce these losses. For our purposes, the Tn5 losses were tolerated because the amounts that we obtained were sufficient to proceed to functionality testing of the Tn5. To increase the Tn5 amount, the first five elution fractions were pooled (lane 10-14).

Each team got 20 minutes to present their project to the audience, explaining both their goals and their accomplishments to far. It proved excellent practice for the Giant Jamboree! Afterwards, there was plenty of time to admire each other's posters, ask questions and of course enjoy a drink and nibble or two.

Having prepared our ORF314 for further processing, this week we planned to insert a His-tag into the plasmid, after which the plan was to add the ORF401 sequence so by the end of the week we would have a complete bacteriophage lambda stf (tail fibre protein) gene with a His-tag for easy purification. But alas! In typical scientific fashion, our brilliant plan utterly failed. Although the insertion of the His-tag through the clever use of oligos and a type 2 restriction enzyme appears to have worked well, the next step – excising a ~200 bp section of the plasmid and replacing it with the ORF401 using one blunt-end and one sticky-end restriction enzyme – appears to have resulted in… well, nothing. At least, on optimistically running an agarose gel, the only products appeared to be our original plasmid (containing ORF314 and the His-tag), the pSB1K3"

2.3.3 iC1C2
Scientists have designed and characterized aclass of channelrhodopsins (originally cation-conducting) converted into chloride-conductinganion channels. These tools enable fast optical inhibition of action potentials and can beengineered to display step-function kinetics for stable inhibition, outlasting light pulses and fororders-of-magnitude-greater light sensitivity of inhibited cells.
The engineered iC1C2 was designed based on the 2012 crystal structure of C1C2 to conduct chloride ions instead of cations, utilizing physiological chloride gradients to precisely inhibit action potentials in response to blue light. The resulting inhibition is much more light-sensitive than with prior optogenetic inhibitory tools and involves reversible input resistance changes. Light sensitivity of expressing cells is further improved. The channel pore is open and flow of chloride ions across the cell membrane is elevated between the blue and red light pulses, thereby greatly reducing spike probability in expressing neurons without the need for continuous light delivery.

Hamburg,2017,Team:Hamburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," Some siderophores include mechanisms or a sufficient affinity to extract iron3+-ions from human proteins. The utmost important factor for our project, however, is the ability of siderophores to form chelate complexes with other, sometimes cytotoxic ions.
A new antibiotic approach: Gallium loaded Siderophores
At the beginning of our iGEM year we split up into 4 groups to brainstorme for  something to research. After our presentations we decided to research novel antibiotic compounds: Gallium-siderophore complexes. However, the first ideas to develop a method in this direction turned out to be either impossible or non iGEM compatible.
But we could find potential targets in carbapenem resistant Enterobacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa,which in turn narrowed the selection of potential siderophores to research. Hence, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most prevalent multiresistant strain in our hometown Hamburg, and sometimes untreatable, it became our prime target.
Gallium mediated cytotoxicity
For Pseudomonas aeruginosa many experiments have been done with gallium in various forms. Recent findings show that gallium affects pseudomonades and familiar strains in multiple ways. Notably, gallium ions disrupt biofilm formation which is an essential part of chronic infections and increases resistances against normal antibiotic compounds and immune responses from the host.
Most of the toxic effects of gallium are mediated by its similarity to iron, especially Ga3+ and Fe3+ are very similar. Speaking of ions, one of the most important factors why gallium inhibits bacteria originates in its inability to form Ga2+ ions which in turn means that gallium is useless in a redox cycle. Therefore Ga3+-Ions can disrupt the electron transport chain. Another important factor is that iron ions are an important co-factor for many metallo-proteins. However, gallium-ions can effectively replace it chemically, which is linked to a loss of function. [8], [9]
Pneumonia as our prime target
P. aeruginosa, K. pneumonia and E. coli, three potential multiresistant strains that have one thing in common: they can cause pneumonia. Therefore, we included a testing system into our experiments to monitor the effect of our potential treatment as closely as we can in relation to the lung. Most of us think that animal testing is a necessary evil which should be abandoned if possible. Depending on the research done in animals the results are potentially unadaptable.

Practice in Hebei Province
To comprehend the current situation that nematodes damage the environment and how agricultural workers work in their lives, our team went to Ceyu Town, Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province on August 17th and 18th and made a firsthand research on comprehensive degree that local inhabitants know about plant parasitic nematodes and whether they will take necessary preventable measures.
Fig. 5 Field investigation in Hebei Province
Earlier literature indicates that there are plant parasitic nematode problems in Hebei Province, and Soybean cyst nematode(Heterodera glycines) causes severe problems specially [7] , so we communicated with local government and residents to know about whether they had heard plant parasitic nematodes before, and what measures were taken to deal with nematode problem.
Four parts were involved in our investigation as below:
(1) We had an interview with the official in the Agricultural Service Center in Ceyu Town;
(2) We communicated with local pesticide retailer;
(3) We talked with local farmers;
(4) We gathered soil and plant samples in farmlands
We get the following information from our talk with the official of local Comprehensive Agricultural Service Center in Ceyu Town:
(1)Chinese government has settled Fundamental Comprehensive Agricultural Service Centers and such institution can instruct farmers to work better; we have also understood that the main duty of the centers is coordinating with the instruction of superior governments and then deploying work.
(2)The area of farmland of Jingxing County is relatively small, with the average area of that local farmers have is about 334 m2, and the main crops planted there are corn, millet and soybean.
(3)Most pests are visible in the daily work of farmers who use Kresoxim methyl and cypermethrin, and the standard of using pesticides is various; still many farmers are trying to enhance the pesticide efficiency by increasing the dosage of pesticides.
However, officials knew little about what nematodes had damaged to local agriculture when being asked. To a further vision, we contacted to local pesticide retailers for knowing plant diseases and insect pests.

Moreover, we created seven fully synthetic T-domains based on multiple sequence alignments of 250 NRPS modules and measured the indigoidine yield after insertion into the indigoidine synthetase scaffold. Since the the NRPS T-domains must be activated by a member of the 4'-Phosphopantheteinyl-transferases (PPTases) [9], which differ in their substrate specificity [10], we coexpressed every engineered indigoidine synthetase with PPTases from different host organisms (Sfp from B. subtilis [11], Svp from S. verticillus [12], EntD from E. coli [7], DelC from D. acidovorans [8], NgrA from P. luminescens [14]) ( Fig. 2b ) and determined the indigoidine production rate of every engineered indigoidine synthetase in combination with a respective PPTase.
Figure 2: Optimization of the Indigoidine Production by Domain Exchange and Activation by Different PPTases. a) In a first approach, the T-domain of the indigoidine synthetase indC is replaced by T-domains from other NRPS modules and fully synthetic T-domains. In NRPS, the growing peptide chain is covalently attached to the T-domain via a thioester bond. In order to optimize the indigoidine synthetase for the use to label non-ribosomal peptides with the indigoidine-tag, we investigated the influence of the interaction between T-domain and PPTase measuring the amount of indigoidine produced by each combination. b) The indigoidine synthetase must be activated by PPTase, which transfers the 4'-PPT residue from Coenzyme A to a conserved serine residue in the T-domain of the indigoidine synthetase. Since the PPTases differ in their substrate specificity, we tried different PPTases to see, which one is most efficient in activating the respective engineered indigoidine synthetase from a).
With this approach, we learn more about the interaction of T-domains and PPTases and their influence on the NRPS efficiency. Since this combinatorial approach requires the cloning of large plasmid libraries and hundreds of cotransformations, we established HiCT:"

In the Hardware page we explained how we arrived to the final design of our 3D Printer, The  Biolinker. Here you can read about our adventure in finding the pieces to build our Biolinker. This page also shows our media interaction with respect to our Biolinker: radio interviews and presence in newspaper, articles or websites. We were surprised to find so much enthusiasm for our project, and we hope that we made synthetic biology and bioprinting more well known to society.
Building the Biolinker was really exciting, but suddenly we had a practical problem: we didn’t have enough K’NEX to finish this design. With what we had until then, the printer could move on the X axis (structure on the left side of the picture). We ran out of K’NEX when working on the Y axis, the structure on the right side of the picture.
At first, we wanted to buy new K’NEX online. However, the packages specific to our needs were expensive . Thus, we decided to reach out to people via media on twitter, facebook, and radio. In a few minutes we had already retweets, and in no time we got an email from 3FM (national Dutch radio station) for a live request on national radio.  So Sunday morning we were live on the radio show Weekend Wijnand. Within an hour, Marijn van Iersel (an 11 year old boy () called the radio station, willing to donate us his K’NEX.
In the same day we were called from another radio station, Omroep West for an interview about our project in their morning show. We also featured on their website . Ever since the radio interviews we kept receiving emails from people all around the country willing to donate K’NEX. We’d like to thank them by adding their photos and short stories here.

Summary
Introduction
Background
Stainless steel is an alloy of different metals and apart from the base material, iron, contains a large proportion >11% of chromium. There is a wide range of stainless steels for a variety of different applications, ranging from surgical steel to alloys used in the aeronautic industry. For our application we assumed stainless steels that are used in bulk production of standard kitchen knives with a chromium content between 12% and 14%. We also utilise the fact that chromate is a salt containing chromium. Bone incisions and kerfmarks, distinctive marks left behind, are current indicators for different types of weapons such as saws (1) or knifes.
We used pig bones to investigate incisions by stainless steel tools.
↑
Initial Ideas
At the beginning of the project we met with Dr. Lucina Hackman, an expert in dismemberment cases at the University of Dundee. In dismemberment cases it is obvious enough that a body has been dismembered. However, if the body is not found for a long time and the only remains are bones, it is hard to tell if a person has been stabbed or if an animal was chewing on the bone. This is where a chromate biosensor would be useful. By detecting minute amounts of chromate on a bone, the use of a weapon may be inferred which will justify searching for trace evidence.
We found that a chromate detector had already been submitted by the Beijing Institute of Technology 2013 iGEM team, where they had created a biobrick for this BBa_K1058008 (Fig. 1). The biobrick is a modified version of a highly sensitive chromate resistance operon of Ochrobactrum tritici 5bvl1( 2 , 3 ), containing a promoter, Pchr, a coding region for a chromate responsive repressor of this promoter, chrB, fused to the sequence of the fluorescent reporter GFP.
The Science behind Chromate resistance
Ochrobactrum tritici 5bvl1 was discovered in 2004 in a chromate contaminated wastewater treatment facility. A specific characteristic of this strain was that it could both, reduce Cr(VI) and be resistant to it at the same time. Previously characterised strains were either resistant or could reduce chromate (2) . Over the last 10 years the group that discovered it started working out the underlying mechanisms of this set of characteristics. A transposon located"

We provide instructions ( RFC 99 ) for a rapid and cost efficient cloning and transformation method based on CPEC which allows for the manufacturing of multi-fragment plasmid constructs in a parallelized manner: High Throughput Circular Extension Cloning and Transformation (HiCT)  CPEC was performed according to the following protocol: The total mass of DNA used per CPEC reaction varied between 50 to 200 ng. The insert to backbone molar ratio was 3:1 for insert-backbone and 1:1 for insert-insert molar ratio. Conversion from mass concentration of fragments to molar concentration was done using the formula: cM = c*10^6/(n*660), where c is the measured oligonucleotide concentration [ng/µl], n is the number of dinucleotides of the fragment and cM is the resulting concentration [nM].   The final reaction volume was adjusted to 6 µl with polymerase master mix (Phusion® High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with HF Buffer, NEB #M0531S/L). The CPEC reaction was carried out under the following conditions:
initial denaturation at 98°C for 30 s
5 cycles with:
denaturation step at 98°C for 5 s.
annealing step at 53°C for 15 s
elongation/filling up step at 72°C for 20 s/kbp of longest fragment.
final extension at 72°C for three  times the calculated elongation time.
(Optional: Hold at 12°C )
After CPEC, 5 µl of of the reaction mixture were used for transformation. The remaining volume was used for quality check on a gel with small pockets (10 to"

Twelve years have passed since Professor Yingjin Yuan worked with MIT and successfully promoted the iGEM in Asia. iGEM has been all the rage in Tianjin University. This year, a group of dynastic teenagers have gone through a series of tough tests and eventually set up a united family. The wonderful summer will be kept in everyone’s mind. Thanks for everyone who once reached out to us.
Parts
We attach great importance to the construction and appliance of BioBrick Part. We submitted a variety of parts centering on core KaiABC oscillator, from single genes to cassettes with fusion proteins in yeast two-hybrid system. Effective cassettes about reporter genes and downstream application were also constructed and submitted. Besides, we redesign previous Nanoluc to serve our project better.
Model
The models include four parts. First, we established a fluorescent protein model using grayscale analysis to screen out the most suitable fluorescent proteins. Then, we drew the growth curve of yeasts and it fitted logistic model. It described the growth situation of the yeasts after plasmid introduction and it also offers the best measuring point and the best measuring interval. What’s more, we drew the degradation curve of the fluorescent protein, which helped us know different characteristics of the two chosen fluorescent proteins better. Finally, we constructed a model to illustrate the oscillation of KaiA, KaiB and KaiC protein called Mars Model, it also explained nicely the reason why the cycle reduced in yeasts.

The best part of MoDeL is that it can preserve detailed structure in species and reactions using Chain-Node Model. Based on the model, MoDeL is able to markup almost all kinds of reactions in a detailed and clear way.
Overview of MoDeL
Figure 5 above is an example of a simple network of biochemical reactions(pTetR + TetR2 = pTetR*:TetR2) that can be automatically constructed using MoDeL:
MoDeL supports automatic construction of such network with only the input of its initial conditions and environmental parameters. In order to do this, obviously the data of parts, species, reactions, compartment, units and so on is needed. Besides, relationships between these components are also needed, so we can link to a reaction when we find a species. Data of relationship is stored as references and exists in most MoDeL components.
To define all the needed components in a systematic way, MoDeL organizes them in five component containers at the top level:
:: System: This container contains definitions of units, functions, rules and global parameters. These are all basic elements for other components of MoDeL, and many are mathematical concepts without direct synthetic biology meanings. The name of the container, System, separates this container from others which contains components of biological significance, and indicates this container includes the basic parameters of the whole system.
:: Compartment: This container contains definitions of compartments. Compartment here is considered as a holder of substance with certain volume, so it only stores related data such as units and volume. It also stores a list of compartments that are permitted to be placed inside. For compartments like E.coli that can multiply, a corresponding compartment with the same id will be created in the sub-container of compartment in Part.
:: Part: This container contains definitions of parts. Part includes the basic units that can be inserted in an abstract chain. The container of Part has five sub-containers which are: compartment, biobrick, compound, plasmidBackbone, and substituent. Biobrick contains biobricks from PartsRegistry together with other similar components created by users. Compartment contains cells and other microscopic organisms that can multiply. compound contains small molecules like IPTG and other compounds. PlasmidBackbone contains plasmid backbones come from PartsRegistry or defined by users. Substituent contains substitutes for template modeling.
:: Species: This container contains definitions of various species defined by Chain-Node Model. Each component stores the cnModel structure of chains and trees. Related reactions are also stored"

The three days there benefited us a lot in the practice and further modify of our experiments. We met the highly experienced teams from Asia and Europe. We learned about their projects and their way of dealing with problems during the experiment. One of them from a university in China gave constructional advice to the way we collect data. He mentioned that their way, which uses a special software, is extraordinarily effective for the data collecting and is very easy for making graphs to show the trends and results visually.
We are specifically improved in the aspects we see biosafety and bioethics. We understand that biosafety isn’t only about the safe chemicals we used when conducting the experiment, it is also about preventing any possible damage to us or the environment. After coming back from the meet up, we checked our process thoroughly to make sure that our product will be safe.
During the workshop and lectures there, we also got to know more about the skills of doing presentation and making posters. “Sharing ideas with a group of people who are doing different kinds of projects to serve for the common good of human beings feel great!” Rebecca and Helen said after coming back with lots of valuable advice.

The reaction pool is more than 10 meters deep, but the regular sampling of the sewage can only cover the several centimeters right beneath the surface. We can add a light sensitive part after our memory circuit, in that way, we may guide the engineered E.coli to collect the data at the bottom and swim up the surface to be collected.
After the visit
We cultured E. coli DH10B, the bacteria where we constructed our circuit in with 100%, 50%, 25% and 0% sewage in the culture system. At last they all survived and thrived. Even the group cultured with 100% sewage seemed to grow well.
The result showed that it is possible to put the bacteria directly in the reaction pool and collect the data later on.
In that way, we can make more improvements
A suicide gene may be attached to the end of our circuit, so that we can prevent it from spreading into the environment.
A special sequence served as the identity number of the E.coli may be add to the beginning of the circuit. So that if we put in the E. coli in batches, we can identify the data collected in each batch easily.

Week 1
We installed the Matlab software and Simbiology toolkit, we watched some tutorial ‘webinars’ from Mathworks. In a meeting with the advisors, we learned more about the purpose and basics of modeling in synthetic biology. After downloading the projects of previous year teams of the K.U.Leuven to understand the inner workings of their model.
Week 2
We made our own model in Simbiology of the freeze-antifreeze system. We still have to implement the kinetic parameters of the whole system to predict the outcome of the wet lab experiments. We wait for the promoters linked to GFP, synthesized in the wet lab, to check the kinetics of the promoters.
Week 3
Installation of maya, an amazing 3D-visualising program, provided by iGEM sponsor the mathworks. We checked the price and normally it costs $3,251! Time to watch tutorials... Friday-evening we had a funny evening dinner with our team
Week 4
Place text of third week modelling category.
Week 5
These week we focused on PowerPoint animations and project description. The PowerPoint animation should make the project overview more attractive. We’re wondering which software other teams are using for animations. 3D-animations are to difficult and time-consuming while PowerPoint animations are rather simple. We also worked on project description, describing all the biobricks we are going to use and also which one we can’t use anymore because they didn’t work in the lab.
Week 6
Stimulation test on each part. Good results are obtained from Freeze and Celldeath part while more works are needed to optimize Antifreeze part.
Week 7
We finish the description of biobricks, and tried sensitivity analysis. For lack of some data, e.g. CeaB, some assumptions have to be made to run the model.
Week 8
(1)made assumptions for senstivity analysis of freeze part;exploit parameters for luxR,cI,luxI which we know; try the model in two stimulation time.

However, by administering the kill switch later, there is a no guarantee that of the gene of interest will be silenced. The infection of the target cells with the kill switch would have about the same probability of success as the gene of interest, and there is no guarantee that all of the affected cells will get the kill switch containing DNA.
When and Where to Use it
Overall, the usage of this RNA editing genetic therapy would be best utilized for non-developmental, somatic based, gene therapy. This system works best as a way to test potential gene therapy treatments by first applying it in somatic cells. These cells will potentially expressed the desired genes, but would only last as long as the cell lives. Once the cells die and are replaced, the editing genes that we are adding will be lost, due to difficulties in maintaining a stable line of cells that will not stop expressing the added genes. This would require an additional treatments of the therapy. Additionally, this system uses doxycycline to allow the expression of the editing system. Long term usage of doxycycline can potentially cause the development of doxycycline resistant diseases in the patient, and can cause other side well known minor side effects. These factors combined indicate that this system would be best suited as a tester gene therapy, where in, it can be used to determine if a proposed gene therapy change will cause the desired outcome, before being administered using DNA based changes. Germline based therapy, besides being a largely debated ethical topic, would not be an efficient use of this editing system. The main purpose of this gene therapy is to allow for the stopping of the genetic changes. Most importantly, this system works using a Tet-on regulation system. Doxycycline is known to have toxic effects on skeletal development in fetuses, and its administration is usually stopped by the patient unless it is crucial for survival. Even if other regulation systems are used, the effects of the gene therapy would have to be monitored constantly in the developing fetus, to observe if the change is occurring as desired or if other complications are occurring. However, this system, having its expression controlled by outside signals, allows for developmental therapies. Germ-line therapy is out of the question for genetic editing, but this system could be used to target a gene used for early development in patients (fetus and adolescent) that is not used or required during later stage maturation. A gene used during early development could be repaired, and then later down the line, the treatments can be stopped, potentially allowing fetuses (that were previously unviable) to"

Chemostat: A Steady Growth System
Our culture management system standardizes the concentration of yeast cells in culture through a Chemostat, an experimental setup developed by the Dunham Lab at the University of Washington. Specifically, it maintains yeast growth in constant log phase by continually expelling excess solution while adding unused media. The yeast culture's growth rate can be maintained at a steady-state condition by adjusting the flow rate of new media, as long as a supply of unused stock  media is available.
Our setup borrows the constant-volume culture mechanism of the Chemostat. But unlike the Chemostat, our setup uses visual inputs and computer-controlled electrical outputs to control culture growth.
Raspberry Pi
The Raspberry Pi is an inexpensive, credit card-sized computer. It is compatible with Python and many other development languages, making it a suitable choice for running scripts, which can control the many general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins it is equipped with. The HDMI and USB ports allow connection to LCD monitors and operation through its visual interface, making it exceptionally user-friendly for its cost. With the built-in WiFi in its latest version, the Raspberry Pi 3, cultures may be remotely monitored and adjusted as needed, allowing even more efficiency both in and out of the lab.
Figure 1. The Raspberry Pi is an inexpensive and compact computer powerful for its size.
Pi Camera
A Pi camera is a compact device used to gather visual data of the culture. Since the Pi camera is manufactured for use with the Raspberry Pi, data it collects can be easily processed by scripts. Conveniently, the Pi camera involves minimal wiring by the user so if ever damaged it may be quickly replaced at a low cost.

1.Government sector:
    We managed to contact the branches of Environmental protection department of the People's Republic of China- Wuhan Environmental Protection Bureau(WEPB)and Hubei Environmental Protection Department(HEPD) to get some specific data of pollutants monitoring indicators for our modeling and figured out current regulations and laws about bacteria used in sewage treatment.
    We noticed that halogenated phenol was not an environmental indicator yet, but officers had realized the harm of this kind of pollutant and are considering to make it an indicator.
    Apart from it, we also surprisingly heard that there is almost no official law on that issue because biological methods are seldom used still. It strongly indicates that wastewater treatment is an urgent field requiring more attention for government management.
2.Interview
    In August, we had some interviews with many students from different schools in the street in Wuhan University to know public understanding on sewage treatment. What makes us astonishing is that only minority of them can say something about this necessary process to purify wastewater.

    We made a questionnaire based on our project and let it out in three different places to make the results more dependable. These three places are New York, Helsinki and Wuhan University and the results have been summed up as follows.
You can download our questionnaire by clicking here.
    The data we've obtained in questionnaire is showing below:
    As we can see from the figures above, most people think that the city’s water pollution only has a slight change or even no change. Although almost half of our interviewee are students under 20 years old, but on the other hand, it indicates that many young people have been aware of the importance of wastewater treatment and water environment is in an emergency that feasible approaches should be conducted to deal with it. And we are also frustrated to find that only a small amount of people knows about halogenated phenols, which is a common but toxic pollutant in wastewater. But most people prefer to reduce the pollution by Biological treatment, and that is what we are going to do.
    Above all, we can see that most people are now holding the view that our environment is getting worse, but they don’t know the details of the pollutants, especially halogenated phenols. That tells us that we need to do more things on public education on details of"

6.27 Mutagen Concentration Test - Third Protocol
I) Purpose
To test the third protocol for applying 5-bromodeoxyuridine and inducing mutation.
II) Expected Outcome
- A decrease in phage viability with increasing mutagen concentration.
- A few random mutations that produces smaller phage and consequently larger plaques during selection with x8 agar.
III) Reagents Used
5-bromodeoxyuridine stock in freezer labeled T7 (10mg/mL); 50mL of M9+ prepared by the large phage group; BL21 overnight; 5.3 phage stock; x8 top agar; uracil solution (2.5mg/mL); adenine solution (5mg/mL).
IV) Procedure
1) Applying the mutagen (6.12)
- From 5.13 Determining E coli concentration with spectrophotometer, we know that the concentration of E coli BL21 in a liquid overnight culture is about 3.12E8 cell/mL. But we need to resuspend it in M9+ medium.
- To make the M9+ suspension medium supplemented with the appropriate amount of uracil and adenine, 200uL of adenine solution and 400uL of uracil was add 50mL of M9+.
- Label 5 centrifuge tubes (15mL) 0, 100, 200, 500, and C (control). To each of these test tubes, add 10 mL of E coli overnight. Cells were then pelleted via centrifuge at 400"

     The third and final feature of the population control  circuit is the element which actually performs the limiting, a cell poison. The CcdB gene was selected for this purpose, as it is lethal when expressed  in E.coli and has been shown to be effective at population control in  existing scientific research.  The  peptide operates by rendering DNA gyrase nonfunctional.  Once the translation of CcdB has begun, the  colony size begins to decrease as cells die from exposure to the poison.  The cell population size continues to drop  until it is below the density level which is capable of producing enough AHL to  trigger transcription of the poison downstream of the sensitivity tuner.  The cycle then repeats itself, with the  colony beginning to grow again until it passes the threshold, then decreasing  in density until poison production is cut off.   This oscillatory period has been shown in previous research to dampen as  the cycles continue, leveling out along the “switch point” where CcdB is  expressed

Since it should be proportionate to quantities of microtubules only by a coefficient \(\lambda \), we can use this to simulate the results whose condition is used in the wet parts.
Details of Partial Differential Equation Model
We know that the movement of any material is ruled by the certain laws of nature (physical and chemical laws). We establish some mathematical model including partial differential equations to describe these rules especially the mechanism of numerical relationships in the tubulin.
We build the partial differential equations and definition conditions based on the conservation laws.
The tubulin solution area \(\Omega\)  is thought to be a kind of fluid motion. In the solution there are many assembling of tubulins, the hydrolysis, aggregations and disaggregation of the protein filaments. Although the mechanisms of these biological phenomena are still uncertain but we can build the equations based on conservation laws, which certainly rule the biomass.
We take a solution area as our study object. The quantity in the solution area is certainly ruled by conservation laws no matter what shape of the area is. Our models are based on conservation of mass.
We choose a solution area \(D\)  in the \(\Omega\) . Considering in the time range  , according to the mass conservation:
\(\overrightarrow{f_1}\) is the velocity of assembling of the solution which flow into the \(D\) . \(\overrightarrow{f_1}\)  can be regarded as the product of the velocity \(\overrightarrow{v}\) and the assembling ratio \(k\) . However, there is no need to consider the  \(\overrightarrow{v}\) and \(k\) . The inflow mass during  \(dt\) through any  \(dS\) of the \(\partial D\)  can be given:
$$-\rho \cdot \overrightarrow{f_1} \cdot \overrightarrow{n} \cdot dS \cdot dt$$
\(\overrightarrow{n}\) is the unit normal vector toward outside so there is a minus in formula. \(\rho\) is the density of the tubulin solution in \(D\) . In a similar way \(\overrightarrow{f_2}\) is the velocity of the disaggregation mass which flow out the \(D\)  and \(\overrightarrow{f_2}\)  can be considered as the product of outflow velocity  \(\overrightarrow{v_2}\) and disaggregation ratio \(r\) there is no need to consider the  \(\overrightarrow{v"

Should'nt Doreen & co. come with us? At least we should invite her, because i think Doreen has really helped us until now and i have told them of Amsterdam and the US final before ""recruiting"" them for our team (Roman)
Do we have enough money to invite them?
On the one hand they always answered questions if we asked them, but they did not contribute directly or without being asked first
Many members of Skerra group contributed more than they did.
Idea: Offer them to pay attendance fee but ask them to make sure that the Schwab-LS will pay their travel expenses

Prof. Dr. Stefan Jockenhövel - ITA at RWTH Aachen
We thank professor Jockenhövel for the very interesting and revealing expert discussion about tissue engineering at the ITA in Aachen. This expert discussion gave us the insight that the in medical applications commonly used plastic PLA is degraded into acidic remains in the body. In this point our polymer has an advantage as it contains significantly less acidic groups .

Jon is a Grade 12 Student at Western Canada High School interested in pursuing a career in science. He spent a week with the UofC iGEM team and is excited to one day be able to work in the lab.
Nicole Delaloye
Nicole is a sophomore at Rice University down in Houston, TX. She is a member of their varsity swim team and is currently studying biology.
This past summer, I had the opportunity to take a tour of University of Calgary’s iGEM lab. And to be honest, before I entered that lab I had no clue whatsoever of what iGEM actually was. However, during my tour I learned all about the iGEM competition and what it entitled; how each team was given identical kits and then set free to go explore the new realm of synthetic biology. I loved the idea of how much independence students received on this research opportunity, never before had I ever heard of such a thing. During my tour I was even given the opportunity to go work in the lab, donning lab coat and latex gloves, I grew my first bacteria culture ever. After spending the afternoon with the University of Calgary’s iGEM team, I have never found myself so excited about biology. This stuff even topped my first dissection. iGEM seems like the best research opportunity a student could ever have. Not only does iGEM offer students a chance to work in the newly emerging field of synthetic biology, but it also gives them an opportunity to work with a team of students who are wholly committed to the competition. After learning that iGEM is an international competition, I found out that Rice University has a team competing as well. I’m not only excited to see how both the UofC and Rice teams do at the iGEM Jamboree, but also to hopefully be a part of either team in 2010.

Edinburgh_UG,2016,Team:Edinburgh UG#Error Correction_-_-_TEXT.html," amount of BabbleBricks in one    BabbleBlock. This data has been plotted for BabbleBlocks containing 2 and 3 BabbleBricks    in Fig.1 and Fig.2 respectively. Assuming that between the time of writing and reading    any number of mutations can occur, the maximum probability of a mutation event resulting    in the same checksum can be calculated by comparing the frequency of one checksum to the    total frequency of unique bits of information.
Therefore, it can be predicted that for an average sentence containing 9 words the maximum    probability of the same checksum occurring will be of the magnitude of 1%. The probability    should decrease marginally when adding BabbleBricks due to the slightly increased range of    checksums that become available. This value can be optimized by altering the method of the    checksum to utilize a greater range of values and to spread out the frequency more evenly as    to reduce the maximum probability of the same checksum occurring.
Currently one BabbleBlock has 4 BabbleBricks dedicated to storing the checksum, giving a maximum    10^4 possible values. The first step in determining a ‘CheckMethod’ is to ensure that all checksums    for a suitable amount of BabbleBricks can be stored without going over 10^4. It is also important    to not use operators that will result in negative numbers or decimals, therefore limiting the    possible checksum values to integers up to but not including 10^4, this rules out operators such    as subtract and divide. For this example, a suitable number of words in a sentence and therefore    BabbleBricks in a BabbleBlock shall be 20. All simulations will be carried out on 3 BabbleBrick    systems due to computing limitations.
Checksums are non-directional, for example a BabbleBrick of bases [2,2,2,2,2] would have the    same checksum as [2,1,3,2,2].  To alter this a checkmethod will incorporate the position    of the base in to the calculation. At each point the digit is multiplied by its position    in the BabbleBlock, where the first BabbleBrick has digit positions 1 to 5 and the last    BabbleBrick (20th}) has positions 96 to 100. A scaler alpha has been included to    increase the range of results. To ensure multiplications don’t result in a null result    the value of each base had a value of 1 added to it. The first checkmethod of one    BabbleBlock can be defined"

To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds.

In KS Reaction, both two substrates (Proplonyl-CoA and (2S)Methylmalonyl-CoA) are anchored on ACP domains. And what's more, ACP domains anchoring substrates belong to the same DEBS 1. We can easily draw a conclusion that the concentration of substrate A equals to substrate B’s, that is, [A]=[B]. Therefore, this kinetic model can be simplified. The simplified equation is:
After perfection, the final equation is:
[A0]is the concentration of DEBS 1.
[F] is the concentration of product in enzyme catalyzed reactions in last step.
[D] is the concentration of product in KS domain catalyzed reactions.
3.  KR Part
The reaction mechanism of KR Reaction is Ping-pong bi-bi + T-C bi-bi. It is a little more complex so that the related kinetic equation can’t be written out. Therefore, we simplify the reaction mechanism directly.
Because NADPH and NADP+ is dynamic-balanced in vivo of E.coli and their concentrations are constant, we needn’t consider the amount of NADPH participating in the reactions and the output of NADP+ in the analysis simplifying reaction mechanism. And the graph of mechanism is written as:
However, the amount of NADPH does have a certain influence on KR domain catalyzed reactions, so we should regard NADPH as a kind of inhibitor of KR domain, that is, KR domains will lose efficacy after they provide protons and NADPHs don’t compensate immediately. Then description is similar to enzyme inhibitor’s. Therefore, the final simplified equation is:
[A0]is the concentration of DEBS 1.
[H] is the concentration of NADPH and KR domain.
KIis the dissociation constant of NADPH and KR domain.
[J] is the concentration of product in enzyme catalyzed reactions in last step.
[Q] is the concentration of product in KS domain catalyzed reactions.
4. DH Part
The reaction mechanism of DH Part is single substrate enzyme catalyzed reactions. The kinetic equation is :
[A0]is the concentration of DEBS 1.
[V] is the concentration of product in enzyme catalyzed reactions in last step.
[Y] is the concentration of product in DH domain catalyzed reactions.
5. ER Part
The reaction mechanism of ER Part is same as KR Part’s. Therefore, the kinetic equation is the same.

Anthony is the pastry chef of the team. Besides his cooking skills, he designed all the biobricks sequences: gene optimization, and Serial Cloner software were his friends for many days. During our wet lab period, when we needed any help, he was always ready to assist. He created the wonderful PowerPoint presentation you will see in Boston… so do not hesitate to come take a look at our presentation, because it’s a real treat for the eye!
Mélissa David
Mélissa played a big part in making this project possible: she is often glued to her laptop or phone to contact sponsors or realize quotes about the goodies we will have in our stand. She is responsible for all the events we took and will take part in, and she represented us at International ExpoSciences. Finally, she teamed up with Alexandre on the parts submission, helping him with the PCR.

Feedback from our moderators was that 20 minutes was not enough time to have everyone in the group participate fully. So if in any way possible, make the groups small.
As expected, the discussions on gene drives were more broad than the ones on bioluminescent trees. Choosing the introduction material is very important. If you have a shy, bigger group more guided material is good. For people to really think of their own views and values, less guided starting material is better.
If you want to assign participants to (several) tables, you need some sort of system to do this. We decided to hand out sheets of paper with two numbers on it (a group number for the first and second round). You can also assign people by counting or let them choose themselves.

MEASUREMENT
In pursuit of a rigorously scientific result, we have adopted multiple measuring approaches throughout the whole project, among which two predominant methods described in extreme detail in wiki, would inspire relative researchers.
As two sophisticated and renowned reporters in biotechnological domain, fluorescent protein and luciferase were opted to illustrate the effectiveness of our constructed oscillating system, detected by combined means and instrument. Mcherry and EYFP, two selected fluorescent reporters were measured by both fluorescence spectrophotometer and Leica DMi8 respectively. Leica DMi8 allows us to visually and intuitively see the expression of the fluorescent protein EYFP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae In terms of luciferase, in addition to commonly used firefly luciferase, a courageous attempt we made was to choose a novel luciferase NanoLuc and its live cell substrate in spite of no records of the usefulness in Saccharomyces cerevisiae before and obtained expected outcome successfully.
How did we choose our reporter gene?
To achieve the best measurement of our oscillatory system, we chose two different kinds of reporter gene as our downstream reporters, fluorescent protein gene and luciferase gene,  which are both widely used in the biotechnological labs.
Fluorescent protein
In search for the part kit provided by the iGEM headquarter, we found several available fluorescent proteins. Under the instruction of our fluorescent protein judging model , we finally chose mCherry and EYFP as our fluorescent protein reporter.

• Analytical Procedure
➢ Electrochemical test (polarisation test, power density test, voltage and current)
Polarisation curves for measuring power density vs current density plots were constructed using a range of external resistance ranging from 10Ω to 1 MΩ. The closed external circuit of the MFC system for each test were opened to connect various external resistances when the system exhibited a stable voltage across the initial 1000Ω external resistor. The current flowing through each external load was calculated using  Ohm’s law.
I   =   E/R
where E is the potential across the resistor (mV), I is the current flowing through the load (mA) and R is the external resistance (Ω).
The power generated was calculated with the following expression (Fernando et al., 2012)
P = E*I
where P is the power produced (µW), E is the potential difference between anode and cathode (mV) and I is the current generated (mA).
The power density and current density values were calculated by normalising power and current values to the projected surface area of the anodic electrode (25cm2).

Team Activity Tests: Today we managed to rebuffer the BPUL samples given by Team Cultivation. We got fraction 3 to 7 and 15 to 19 of the purification, because they have shown a nice peak. After bringing the BPUL laccases into water, we incubated with 0.5 mM CuCl2 and measured the protein concentration via Bradford. The offered fractions contained the following protein concentrations after rebuffering: 0.0087 mg/mL (fr. 3), 0.0110 fr. 4), 0.0632 (fr. 5), 0.1672 (fr. 6), 0.1229 (fr. 7), 0.0060 (fr. 15), 0.0034 (fr. 16), 0.0326 (fr. 18), 0.0225 (fr. 19). The protein amount in fraction 17 couldn't be measured but we didn't leave it behind. We adjusted the protein concentrations to the concentration of TVEL0, but did also measurements using 140 µL of each sample, because the protein concentrations do not only represent gained laccases.

We ran OE PCR reactions without primers for all five genes but still saw multiple bands for some of the genes. We discovered that the master-mix concentration was too high for all of the reactions we had performed, so we changed the amount of master-mix in each reaction to ensure the concentration was 1X rather than 2X. After changing the master-mix concentration, we ran more OE PCR reactions without primers and selected certain reactions with the least amount of nonspecific bands for templates in our regular PCR reactions.
Our over-the-weekend cultures had little growth after 24 hours, but showed adequate growth come Monday morning. After discussing this with other teammates, we found it was most likely due to improper aeration of our samples, which were stored upright with a tight cap in the incubator. We then performed a plasmid isolation followed by a restriction digest to test the identity of our isolated plasmid. Our first digest was unsuccessful, which we hypothesized was because of the age of our enzyme sample. Our next digest, performed with our most recently acquired enzyme, showed the expected band pattern after altering the contrast on the gel image. We also attempted a PCR linearization of our amplified plasmid which was unsuccessful. Through these experiments we learned how to better analyze gel images by increasing exposure, brightness, and contrast, as well as proper incubation practices for liquid cultures. We also ran into several issues with budgeting time correctly in lab, which prompted us to change how we schedule our lab procedures to create as little “dead space” as possible.
For our third attempt to amplify out ade2 homologous arms from Y. lipolytica, we instead did a serial dilution to ensure that we were not using too many cells in the PCR reaction mixes. Again, no amplification was observed.

Interview Record With Hande
In this record, Q is our questions,and A is their answer. The letters before ""A"", A, B, C represents for three seniors from Hande.
Q: We are interested in yew trees and its product taxol. Yew is a endangered plant and widely allocated in Yunan. So we’d like to learn something about the usage and protect conditions of them. First we are wondering where is the materials come from and how it was distributed. Do you use yew woods under rough machining?
B A: After 2005, our materials came from several resource:
Cooperation with farmer households and companies in this province;
We have our own plant bases in Yunnan. Since 2000, we have developed bases in Wenshan, Diqing and Dali.
Last decade, we purchased materials outsides. Some companies are planting yew trees and conducting rough machining, like Lishui,Zhejiang, Hongdou corporation in Jiangsu and so on.
Import from Canada and Europe. But it’s only a little.
Q: Is the growth cycle too long to cause some problems?
B A: We can harvest just two years after planting. For it’s suitable for yew growth, their growth speed is sufficient. The appropriate growth condition of yew is elevation between 2000 m to 3500 m in acidic humus and pH between 5~7, shady environment. When it grows up, whole plant can be used.
Q: How to find a balance between harvest and plant growth? You know, picking more branches and leaves will influence its growth.
C A: Both growth and harvest have their own standards. We only use bark and roots before, which need diameter more than 15 cm. that’s too difficult to find. Now we use tender branches and buds, and we can harvest every year. We developed a technique that we add a kind of fungi or its spora, which were separated from soil near the root of wild yew tree, around the roots of young yew seeding, and that shows a"

Nagahama,2015,Team:Nagahama#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," E. coli high resistance against geraniol and reduce intracellular geraniol concentration.
BBa_K1653020
Fig. 12: Intracellular geraniol concentrations of E. coli JM109 (WT) and its overexpressing of marA strain, E. coli JM109 (marA).
In this figure, intracellular content of geraniol was less in the strain E. coli JM109 (marA) than the strain E. coli JM109 (WT). The concentrations of intracellular geraniol from E. coli JM109 (marA) was 42.9 μg/ml, which was 40% lower than that from of E. coli JM109 (WT), 72.2 μg/ml. This figure is suggesting that internalized geraniol could be more efficiently exported through AcrAB-TolC efflux pump following the presumed activation of this gene by introducing the activator marA gene.
Enhancement of geraniol resistance

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them. Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a more comprehensive understanding of the practical conditions and improved our own project.
Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!
Zhisheng YU
Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the"

When we have preliminarily optimized the bacterial proportion and medium compositions, we got a significant improvement of the electricity output in spite of the relatively short sustaining time.(shown as follows)
Figure 17. The electrical output of co-culture MFCs with optimized division of labor and bacteria proportion
We also attempted to put the fermentation bacteria into the system some time after Shewanella. However, the later joining of fermentation bacteria will the stability of the system so that the output oscillated for a period of time. We can see from the figure 18, even though the lasting time was longer than before, the maximum electricity output was still limited.

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook-N_-_-_TEXT.html," the UC Berkeley DNA sequencing facility. With results coming in at the end of the week. Our reads indicated that our GFP gene was functional with no detected SNPs that would hinder our experiments.
We did our first yeast miniprep to test the effectiveness of our outlined miniprep procedures. The resulting Nanodrop curve was ragged and lacked the attributes of plasmid DNA. We tried again to miniprep yeast, this time washing the glass beads multiple times to get rid of residual isopropanol. The results were much better: a DNA curve. Still, there was an unknown source of salt contamination in the plasmid sample.
