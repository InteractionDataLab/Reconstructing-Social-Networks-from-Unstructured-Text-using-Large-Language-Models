Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#DateRapeDrugs_-_-_TEXT.html," by the transcription factor GabR in the presence of GABA. We assume that GBL was metabolized to GABA in B. subtilis, which resulted in an activation of GabR. With regard to our biosensor, this confirms that the GABA sensor can be used to detect date rape drugs in combination with an enzymatic conversion.
Effect of GBL on B. subtilis GABA sensor. 5 mL cultures in M9 with different GBL concentrations were grown overnight and RFP fluorescence was measured in a plate reader. The error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates.
qRT analysis of the reaction of the gabR and gabT genes in Bacillus subtilis to GBL.
Conclusion
We successfully built a biosensor for the detection of the common date rape drugs ingredients GHB and GBL, which is based on the BlcR repressor. A future aim for our GHB sensor would be the optimization of the BlcR containing E. coli cell extract as well as tests with purified BlcR. A higher fluorescence output would make the detection with our measurement prototype and app easier. In addition, we developed a functional biosensor for GABA, which enables an indirect detection of GHB as an alternative approach.

Figure 4: Sketch of the principial structure of the model.
First, the fluid velocity at the given point is found. The method is the same whether there is 0, 1 or 2 walls, but the tensor used varies.
The dragforce created by the fluid on the sphere is calculated using the same formula we used in part 3
Once we have the force, we can use it to calculate the torque on the sphere, then we summarize the torques of the individual spheres to get the total torque
We then transformed the torque to angular acceleration by dividing with the inertia. This is also where we introduce the potential, that we mentioned earlier
Now that we have the angular acceleration, we can insert it into the equation of motion. This allows us to calculate the position of the flagella at the next timestep by using its position at the current and at the previous timestep.
In the end, this model showed us that in less than 100ns the velocity of the flagella would be the same as the velocity of the fluid when the flagella started with a velocity of zero, after which the two velocities never diverged far from each other. Since the velocity of the flagella always went to the velocity of the fluid on such a short timescale and since these calculations took a lot of computer power we decided that instead of force calculations we would simpy find the flow velocity at the tip of the flagellum and convert that directly to the angular velocity of the flagellum.
A 2-D model of the system
In this chapter we will present our model a bit more precisely and present some of the results it has given us.  The 2-D model consists of a one dimensional grid, to which flagella are attached. Each flagellum produces a force which creates a flow which pushes the other flagellum, and thus a dynamic system is created. To calculate how big the flow will be at a given point, a vector from the tip of the force-producing flagellum to the point where you wish to know the flow must be created. To know how a flagellum is affected by the flow, the flow at the tip of the flagellum must be calculated.
Once you have this vector and the vector corresponding to the force, the flow can be calculated using stokeslet or the Oseen-Blake tensor, depending on whether there is a wall nearby. In our system there is a wall so we will be using the Oseen-Blake tensor. This means that we are also required to find a vector from the mirrorpoint of"

The  concentrations that will be experimentally determined (such as aiiA) will be  calculated using the average synthesis rate of the given promoter, and the  proteins degradation rate.
In  the case of nickel and AHL, whose concentrations are arbitrary, we’ll use the  model itself to estimate the range that will be experimentally tested; it is  also necessary to evaluate if this concentrations are biologically feasible.
Notes  on the model:
Rules  are apparently unnecessary, at least in our case, given that the declared  properties naturally occur in our model; for example, in the case of total  nickel, it is unnecessary to specify that it will be constant, given that for  every lost molecule of internal nickel one molecule of external nickel is  gained, and vice versa. Therefore the sum will be constant. The rules will  therefore only be used to illustrate this phenomenon.
Null  is a special variable of the program to define the degradation of a protein,  the model was corrected to use this variable.

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," that if a person want to lose weight, the amount of calorie he consume must exceed the amount he take in. So, in the initial phase, calorie consumption is what we focus on. As long as he get used to the diet, we started to focus on the nutrients in food. Since too much starch may lead to obesity, we should make a reduction. Lastly, if he can follow all these requirements, we can than adjust his diet into a much healthier one, like, adding more organic food or something. If we ask a client to stick to all these rules at first, we can say that there’s no possibility that his determination will last.
We: Have you ever seen someone, like, desperately push himself to the limit no matter what it cost, and, just to lose weight?
  
Coach: Of course, yes. But, I would like to say that if you only care about your stature, but ignore the true value and purpose of exercising; I will tell the person, I’m sorry, but, I think we may not suit your need, and it will be better for you to look for someone else.
We: So, how do clients get started?
Coach: First, we reach a consensus with our clients. Then, we analyze their current physical conditions. Since we should prevent clients from over exercising, we, have the obligation to remind those who train themselves in rashness of the importance of keeping a regular daily routine. 
We: So, how’s it like to have a “regular daily routine” ?
Coach: Try to avoid overworking. Also, too much sleep is not advisable.
 
We: So, how healthy we get is not in proportion with how much we exercise, right? 
Coach: Exactly. You shouldn’t do what your body can’t afford just to get a sense of achievement. 
We: So, in addition to exercising, do you control your diet as well? 
Coach: Of course, yes. But, we don’t deliberately restrain the appetite, for people drop off easily because of that. 
We: So, according to what you said, do you consider our project beneficial?
Coach: Sure. I can say that it is really an innovative idea. But, what you should know is that the mechanism of sugar controlling in our body is much more delicate than you can imagine. You guys should give an insight into some impact it may bring to, like: Will there be any side effects? Will people be too reliable on it? Will a long term dosing lead to endocrine disorders? These are all what you should be wary of.  "

Heidelberg,2015,Team:Heidelberg#Sandbox_-_-_TEXT.html,", the development of innovative techniques to analyze metabolic pathways became an important field in research. Those assays require a variety of tools allowing the user to detect small molecules even within live cells
Fernandez-Suarez2008
Tyagi2009
. Such methods hold promise to solve the mechanisms of transcription, translation, localization and the function of non-coding RNA.  The most common ways to analyze small molecules or cellular pathways include protein-based methods like GFP or molecule reactive probes which have been engineered in the past. Having a fluorescent readout seems to be a valuable implement to provide time-resolved information in vivo and in vitro. Recently, Paige et al. discovered an RNA that mimics the green fluorescent protein (GFP) so called “Spinach”
Paige2011
Strack2013
Strack2015
. This Spinach aptamer was generated by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). In presence of the 3’5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidne imidazolinone dye (DFHBI), RNA forms a stable Spinach-DFHBI RNA aptamer-complex, which is fluorescent. Since then Spinach has been successfully applied by several laboratories to image RNA in live cells

in vitro or to sense different small molecule levels in vivo
Kellenberger2015
Kellenberger2013
. A prominent example is the sensing of ci-di-GMP concentrations in live cells. To do so, Kellenberger et al. attached a ci-di-GMP aptamer to the Spinach aptamer. In presence of a small molecule (c-di-GMP) the aptamer forms a functional stem which results in the formation of a fluorescent Spinach-DFHBI RNA aptamer-complex. Thus, small molecule concentrations can be determined by a fluorescence read-out system.
In our project we are interested in small molecules that are difficult to sense using common techniques. Here we will describe an innovative system that uses the Spinach2 fused to a specific aptamer to detect small molecules. In 2013 the Jaffrey Lab developed Spinach2 which shows in comparison to Spinach a better folding efficiency and thermostability.

Method
200 larvae were placed at the center of an agar plate (2.0%, radius: 8cm). A piece of filter paper was placed on each end of the plate (Figure 1). 2.5µl of limonene was dropped on one side of the filter paper (Limonene) and cover the plate with a lid. Three minutes later, the number of larvae within a 3cm radius from the filter paper was counted (A or B). The concentrations of limonene are diluted by 20% and 10% with DMSO. The control is DMSO.
The behavioral effects of incentives were measured by Response Index (RI). The RI is defined as (Ns-Nc)/(Ns+Nc), where Ns is the number of population attracted to limonene, and Nc is the number of population which moved to the control.
When all the population move into the radius with limonene, RI is 1 and when all the population move into the radius of control, RI is -1. Positive values mean positive chemotactic effect, and negative values mean negative chemotactic effect.

Discussion
Because RI was over 0 in all the trials, it was revealed that limonene attracts Drosophila melanogaster. Furthermore, it was suggested that the effects of incentives were increased relative to the concentration of limonene.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model#Software_-_-_TEXT.html,"The tool takes as input:
A .fasta file containing a DNA sequence.
A vector with target region(s). These are the bps that the tool searches for gRNA positions. They can be exon-exon junctions as used in our application, but also regions in e.g. the active site of the protein.
Properties of the Cas protein that will be used. These include the PAM sequence (PAM), the prefered gRNA size (gRNA size) and the amount of base pairs in the gRNA that perfectly should match the score (Cas on target). Please note that the tool currently only supports single base pair PAM sequences and assumes the Cas on target is about the bps directly attached to the PAM.
The tool first translates the input gene into an amino acid sequence and into a vector with the amount of possible codons per amino acid position. This vector is used to identify regions with little codon substitutions possible. Using the target region and Cas property input parameters, the target region(s) of the gene is or are scanned for possible gRNA positions.
Combining the information on the possible gRNA locations and the vector with the possible codons, gRNA positions are selected where the least amount of codon substitutions are possible. This is an essential step, because selecting these positions greatly decreases the amount of gRNA’s that need to be generated, while keeping the same amount of (doping) sequences that we can detect. Supplying more or larger target regions is beneficial to the result of the program: the possibility increases that a target region overlaps with a region with low amounts of possible codons. This means it is more likely that a gRNA position is found where only very few gRNA’s need to be generated. Increasing the target region does increase the running time of the program. At these positions, gRNA’s are then generated and stored. This output can be exported as a fasta file.
The tool supports frame-independent translation, PAM identification on both strands and varying gRNA lengths. It currently does not support PAM sequences of more than 1 specific nucleotide or direct input of amino acid sequences. The programming language we used for this tool, R, is an open-source programming language that can be augmented with packages that are convenient for working with genomic data ( R core team, 2015 ). Packages used are seqinR ( Charif and Lobry, 2007 ), Biostrings ( Pages et. al. ) and Magicfor ( K. Makiyama, 2016 ).

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Model#Coacervation_-_-_TEXT.html," point Q, which lies out of the coacervate region, meaning that the system will no longer form coacervates.
Adding more polyelectrolytes to a solution thus does not mean that the system will move further in the coacervate region, but out of it. In fact, having too many polymers will cause coacervates to disappear! We can prove this by showing that $\sigma(\phi)$ only has one single minimum in the region $0 <\phi<1$. First note that the minima of $\sigma$ are given by $$\frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial \phi}=0$$ Taking this derivative and equating it to zero gives the equation $$\phi^2+\left(\frac{N+2}{N-1}\right)\phi-\left(\frac{1}{N-1}\right)=0$$ Of which the exact analytical solutions are given by $$\phi=- \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{N+2\pm\sqrt{N^2+8N}}{N-1}$$ As we expect $N \gg 2$, we can say $N\approx N+2 \approx N-1$ we can approximate our result as $$\phi \approx \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}+\frac{2}{N}}-\frac{1}{2}$$ Because by definition $\phi$ cannot be negative, the only physically relevant solution, we define the critical concentration $\phi_c$ to be $$\phi_c=\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}+\frac{2}{N}}-\frac{1}{2}$$ Note that $\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}[\phi_c]=0$, meaning that as the polymer size increases, the lower the critical polymer volume fraction is required to have coacervation (for a fixed charge density). At the same time it proves that there is only one single extremum of $\sigma(\phi)$ for positive $\phi$, and we already know that this is a minimum from examining the graph.

We were successful inside and outside of the lab over the course of this project and achieved many requirements for the bronze, silver, and gold medal. We were very proud of our results especially given we are a small team and had to undertake iGEM during our university semester. As with any research project, there are many more strategies that could be undertaken and much more work that could be done. We are excited to see how future iGEM teams can use our project to build on their own.

Improve a Previous Part
BBa_K2260000 and BBa_K2260002
We improved two parts. The first, BBa_K2260000 , was an improvement on Imperial College's phaCAB operon submitted in 2013. The gene order was changed to improve PHB yield (Hiroe et al., 2012), codons were optimized for expression in E. coli, and restriction sites were removed to allow part compatibility in all iGEM RFC assembly standards. The second, BBa_K2260002 , was an improvement on SDU Denmark's phasin-HlyA part submitted in 2016. Codons were optimized for expression in E. coli.

Grenoble-Alpes,2018,Team:Grenoble-Alpes#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," the memory stage is pretty convincing as the capacity unloads 1mV/20s. Working on through-hole components, a polymer capacitor is what suits the best to a memory stage as its capacity can be really high (up to 100µF) but unlike chemical capacitors for instance, they have a high leakage resistance. Ideally, this resistance should have the same impedance as the AOP which is harshly the case with polymer capacitors. X7R capacitors have a much higher impedance, but they are smd components. I then need to work on smd. Another reason to work on smd is that my trans-impendance AOP can only be soldered smd.
I tried to work on SMD but the circuit doesn’t work: I can’t solder cleanly, so it’s really hard to have something that is functional. Basically, soldering the components in the wrong way means that they must be unsoldered, which destroys the tracks for instance. Actually, the transimpedance and the memory stage eventually worked, but the PCB was so damaged that it was not possible to fix the substractor stage.
As the circuit worked on breadboard, I tried to solder thru hole components on another PCB. Same issues as last time, it did not work. It is quite concerning as I need to test my photodiode to make sure it will detect fluorescence light.
I eventually tested my photodiode on on breadboard as the circuit DOES work on it, but the tests didn’t go well as the working conditions were not good (no complete dark, photodiode not stabilised, eppendorf not placed correctly...). I have to 3D print the components that will constitute my module.
An absorbance measure is not bound to be necessary. This needs to be confirmed by Fred, the fluo expert of Biomérieux. If it is not necessary, the MC simulation, which is really cool, is not necessary. We’d juste need to calibrate beforehand the photodiode. It should be done this way:
→ We measure the output voltage with 3 solutions: 2 highly concentrated  and a blank, to get a straight line.
→ Then, several measures of the blank are done : an average voltage is calculated
→ the minimum sensitivity is this average voltage added to 3 times the standard deviation.
→ We finally complete the line with other concentrations.
This will be done when I have the circuit and the 3D pieces.
Finally… there is no 2 kinds of fluorescence anymore… The only fluorescence we will measure is from RFP."

Public Engagement and Education
We have adopted two-way science communication that is accessible to all, innovative and interactive, and takes advantage of technologies to communicate aspects of our project, and related issues.   Of the general public, we engaged with families, over 200 Year 8 students (12-13 year olds), over 150 sixth formers (16-17 year olds), and adults.
Encouraging Families to Aid Glowworm Conservation Efforts
After reading up on the conservation of fireflies and how harvesting of fireflies (e.g. for luciferase extraction) used to contribute to a decline in firefly populations, Asal consulted Amit for his take. He explained that yes, this was a problem, but is no longer an issue where luciferase extraction is concerned, and that we should instead focus on British glowworm conservation efforts. She decided to promote this to very young children at our more family based events:
At the Biology Rocks event held at the National Museum in Cardiff, Asal ran an enzymatic luciferase demo to demonstrate the reaction whilst describing how genes work to two year olds all the way to 15 year olds. We linked our stall to a microscope demo next to us (swabbing cheeks). She talked to young children about glowworms eating snails and making luciferase that can be used to follow genes. She also encouraged them to add their drawings of glowworms to our poster, resulting in 36 drawings.
Excerpt used to explain the issue alongside a colourful poster
You are made up of cells. (picture of child swabbing cheek viewing under microscope).
Your cells contain genes 'plugs' that switch on to make you you.
To give you brown eyes. Your nails. Attached earlobes.
All living things have genes. Your plants. Your pet dog. Your dad.
We can follow them using reporters like luciferase. It glows.
To find out what genes do when switched on.
When here and there.
Luciferase comes from fireflies. They glow at night.
They were once harvested for their light. And because people liked looking at them.
And for luciferase. They lived less and made fewer babies. This is not done much any more.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help"

NUS_Singapore-A,2018,Team:NUS Singapore-A#shadow#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the device would occupy a smaller area, thirdly, for the user’s comfort during transport as the inconsistency in shape made the structure unwieldy to carry, fourthly, to make the design aesthetically pleasing, and last but definitely not least, the design now becomes infinitely more modular as users can now continuously stack combinations of D-LA!, the petri dish module, and F-LA!, the erlenmeyer flask module, into a single column. As the components are lightweight, structural failure is not a concern, and the number of units a user can stack is only limited by the microcontroller. Many petri dishes and flasks can be illuminated simultaneously while still occupying the same area as a single testing unit. For more on the increased functionalities of our final iteration of DF-LA!, please visit our Hardware page.
Users reported satisfaction with the final design iteration. Please visit our Hardware page for more on how we conducted user testing and learned from user feedback.
Light Wait
Light Wait is a 500 ml working volume bioreactor system, with features enabling optogenetic biomanufacturing, and computer-assisted automated feedback control. Light Wait comprises 4 components - a fermentation chamber, a peristaltic pump, a 2-in-1 OD and fluorescence sensor, and an Arduino Uno microcontroller board (Figure 14). The microcontroller is not shown for visual clarity. We omitted it as it was not something we designed ourselves but an off-the-shelf component. For a user guide of how the entire system operates, and our design of the system as a whole, please visit our Hardware page. This page will focus on the design considerations of the individual components, which are summarized as follows.
Figure 14. Setup of Light Wait. Components from left to right: peristaltic pump, 2-in-1 OD and fluorescence sensor, and fermentation chamber.
Peristaltic Pump
The peristaltic pump was adapted from the design by the 2015 Aachen iGEM team, since their design was also for continuous pumping in a bioreactor. Three modifications were made.
The first modification replaces their pentagonal spring rotor base with a circular rotor base (Figure 15).

This was so that we could countersink flat-head bolts into the rotor structure, compared to having raised bolts such as pan-head bolts (Figure 18).

M01W01: The One With The Kick-off (1st-7th Jun)
We designed the Gb3 mimic and I3A constructs. After a reasonable survey of different gene synthesis service providers, we finally contacted GenScript, Hong     Kong, to get our constructs synthesized. The GenScript agent was very pleasant and responded quickly. The deal was finalized and they initiated gene     synthesis.
Meanwhile, we started contacting companies and potential sponsors, requesting for funds to bolster our project.
M01W02: The One With The Proposal (8th-14th Jun)
We mainly carried out administrative procedures during this week. The work involved running about from one office to another, filling out forms and     declarations, taking signatures and seals, sorting out our finances – all this in order to raise a Purchase Order form for availing the gene synthesis     service of GenScript (for the I3A construct). The Gb3 mimic construct was just a couple hundred base pairs in length, so payment for the same could be     processed directly.
We also drafted a project proposal and cover letter to be circulated amongst distinguished alumni of our institute. We pitched our project to them in the     hope of garnering some financial backing for our project.
M01W03: The One With The Sterilization (15th-21st Jun)
While awaiting the arrival of our synthetic constructs from GenScript, we decided to prepare ourselves for the challenges ahead (primarily cloning) by     sharpening our tools. That means it was lab-cleaning week! All the instruments were polished with 70% ethanol to make them sterile. The 37oC incubator was     fumigated with methanol. An exhaustive list of chemicals and consumables was made and the immediate requirements were ordered right away.
We planned to isolate the BioBrick part BBa_F2620 (pLuxR promoter element) in the next week. Since the part was supplied by the Registry in a pSB1C3     backbone, we poured LB agar plates with trace amounts of chloramphenicol as a selection marker for positive transformants.

Simulation
We used MATLAB software to solve the ODE system and simulate the system dynamics, using ode15s solver. ETH Zurich Team helped us a lot with the coding and also with some modeling advice. After taking a look at our first code and model, they sent us some tips to improve our model and a more elegant version of the code, making it easy to manipulate parameters and variables. They also shared materials about stochastic modeling, that will help future attempts on modeling our circuit or future projects.

Results
sRNA influence in the circuit:
After building our model and starting the parameter setting, we concluded that the sRNA-mRNA affinity constant (Kdsrna) has a high influence in the circuit response.  Then, we decided to analyze how different values would influence the Insulin expression when the system is on and off, by looking at the Blocking efficiency (%):
Blocking efficiency (BE) denotes for the percentage of insulin blocked by the circuit in the glucose absence in different  Kdsrna values.
The first graphic shows that the sRNA Blocking efficiency decreases as Kdsrna increases and the high BEs happens when the sRNA affinity is lower than 0.1.
After plotting graphics in lower Kdsrna values, we were able to reach the best affinity constant in order to reach the highest insulin difference between active (glucose ON) and inactive (glucose OFF) circuit and run our simulation.
Simulations
Glucose ON and OFF
We first ran our circuit response in glucose presence and absence
This results provided the circuit time response around 5.8 minutes reaching steady-state after 66 minutes.
Different concentrations
We tested our circuit response to different glucose concentrations, as shown in the graphic below:
Different concentrations of glucose don’t make a relevant difference in the insulin amount according to our model. This is an undesirable characteristic in our circuit since we want our system to respond proportionally to the glucose amount. This results can be explained due to our oversimplification of the CcpA activation by glucose that, in reality, involves active transport and different enzymatic conversion thought the chassis metabolism before the activation of CcpA itself. Avoiding this steps turns glucose into a simple inductor of the circuit and ignores the fact that it participates actively in the chassis metabolism and growth, which may cause the model to exhibit variations when compared to"

The ID gene: This gene is entirely optional but can be used as a barcode to identify the strain. This allows for quality control of what is inoculated when a new production culture is started.
The landing pad: This part allows for easy integration of new gene cassettes into the system.
CRE-recombinase: The CRE recombinase should be integrated in the chromosome as well, so we do not have to use an antibiotic for maintaining the plasmid. It has to be under the control of an inducible promoter. The expression of CRE will trigger the differentiation.
The Landing Pad
Starting from this chassis, up to four metabolic pathways can be added by using the attB sequence as a landing pad. Like the Lox sites, this sequence comes from a bacteriophage: the PhiC31 phage uses it to integrate itself in the genome of the host. To insert a new sequence in this landing pad, all you need to do is build a plasmid with the matching ""attP"" site and express the PhiC31 integrase.
attB: GTGCGGGTGCCAGGGCGTGCCCTTGGGCTCCCCGGGCGCGTACTCCA
attP: AGTGCCCCAACTGGGGTAACCTTTGAGTTCTCTCAGTTGGGGGCGT
When inserting something in the landing pad, a new landing pad should be added for subsequent integration. This landing pad should be orthogonal to the first one to avoid multiple successive integrations. The same integrase can be used, the central TT just has to be replaced by CC to make the two sites orthogonal.
In summary, a new gene to be added in the system should have the following standard structure (A):
An attP sequence different from the one that was used just before,
A Lox sequence (Lox sequences should be added in the same order they come in the Lox Array),
The operon to be expressed,
An attB sequence, orthogonal to the attP used for integration,
A selection system (not depicted here for clarity).
When the phage PhiC31 integrase is expressed, this plasmid will be integrated in the locus (B). The CRISPR-Cas9 system from S"

Therefore, the addition of His-tag could potentially interfere with the interaction domain and thus the formation of a homodimer, which would be consistent with several reports[4][5][6].  To address this issue, we decided to perform a molecular dynamics simulation using the GROMACS software package[8] on a structure of βHACdH, determined by X-ray crystallography by Leesong et al., 1996[1]. This would allow for the trajectories of the N- and C-Termini of βHACdH over the course of the simulation to be studied, therefore allowing us to identify which terminal would be more suited for His-tag addition.
Installing GROMACS
The Groningen Machine for Chemical Simulation (GROMACS) Version 4.5.5 [8], was installed on a MacBook Pro 2011 model, operating OS X 10.8.3, with a 4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3 memory, 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5 processor and a 320 GB SATA disk drive. Prior to installing GROMACS, “command line tools” were installed within Xcode, Version 4.6.1. GROMACS was installed to single precision, with the source file downloaded from www.gromacs.org/Downloads. In addition to GROMACS, the FFTW library, Version 3.3.3[9] was installed, with the source file downloaded from www.fftw.org/download.html.

Behind the scenes of the Molecular Dynamics Simulations
For the simulations of βHACdH, a dimeric structure of βHACdH (PDB ID: 1MKB) derived by X-ray Diffraction, with a resolution of 2 Å from an E.Coli expression system by[1] was used.  The molecular dynamics simulation was performed within the GROMACS package using version 4.5.5 [8], with the AMBER99SB force field[10], the transferrable intermolecular potential 3P (TIP3P) water model[11] and the original crystal waters, from the X-Ray Crystallography with periodic boundary conditions.

Uppsala,2014,Team:Uppsala#ProjectTest KillingTest_-_-_TEXT.html," sRNA system from Team Uppsala iGEM 2012, called spot42. The spot42 was redesigned to sense our USP45 sequence and bind to it. We call our modified part, Spot42_USP45. The Spot42_USP45 system consists of an antisense region that will recognize our USP45 and it also has the part that recruits the Hfq protien that will block and inhibit the mRNA translation. The Hfq protein will stick to the antisense region; this will block the RBS from binding to the mRNA and therefore inhibits the translation. We have designed three different antisense regions for our Spot42_USP45. They are all based on USP45 but with different lengths, 10, 15 and 20bp. This is to ensure that it is specific to only USP45. Otherwise it might bind to another region and inhibit a process that could be vital for the bacteria. We chose to have USP45 as our primary secretion tag since our initial goal was to build our system in Lactobacillus. To help us with that, we used knowledge from the Uppsala iGEM 2013 team, who worked with Lactobacillus and USP45 among other things.
Result
Characterization
Our initial plan was to have an secretion tag together with our colicin Fy allowing it to secret from the living cells. Unfortunately we did not manage to get the assembly of any of the constructs to fully work. Our enzymes for the Freiburg standard did not seem to work so we had to use SpeI and XbaI causing a stop codon that we did not managed to mutagenise away.
We had however succeeded in creating construct without secretion tag. The expression of colicin Fy with x6 His-tag was characterized via an purification of the protein with IMAC followed by an SDS-page to confirm lenght, [Link to protocol] . 11 tubes of eluent from the IMAC was saved. The protein concentration in each tube was analyzed with a nanodrop. Tube 4 and 6 had higher concentrations than the other tubes and were run on SDS-page.
The results from the characterization experiments can be seen in fig. 2 and 3. According to calculations based on the nucleotide sequence, the mass of colicin Fy is about 49,6 kDa. The protein ladder we used was Thermo Scientifics PageRuler Unstained Protein Ladder #26614 (fig. 2). The thickest band is 50 kDa so our bands should"

Collaborations
We initiated a collaborative effort with Team Heidelberg, who designed a software for generating new aptamers.  At that point in time, we thought our controls were working better than they were and that we would be able to use the aptamers they designed in our system.  When we were hesitant to commit due to the time it would take to clone plasmids to work with a new aptamer-trigger combination, Heidelberg suggested a modified switch design where the trigger could be the same as what was previously used, so no cloning would be required.  We started moving forward with this design….and then realized that our negative controls had produced the same results as our positive control for the last two experiments.  Set-back about a month, at the end of August, we concluded we could not reasonably plan on testing Heidelberg’s aptamers.  We additionally realized that the aptamers their software was designing likely too short to work in the sort of switch we had designed.  We scrambled to design new ways of detecting proteins and ordered several for synthesis, including Heidelberg’s idea with a longer aptamer.  Then, just days before the wiki freeze, we produced some very promising results.  We remain optimistic we will be able to test one of Heidelberg’s aptamers or the switches they inspired before the iGEM.  Stay tuned for the results to be presented in Boston!
Heidelberg Inspired Sequence We Ordered
We also skyped with rookie team, Nait_Edmonton, and helped them navigate iGEM policies and advised them on how to recruitment and team logistics.  As we have a big team, that is entirely student led and independent of another PI, we have had to figure out to divide work amongst our volunteer team members.  We advised them to give people very specific tasks to maintain accountability.  We also answered questions about the Jamboree and got them excited to go!
Additionally, we sent our laboratory protocols to the  University of Michigan Software Team who designed a protocol database for their project.  SInce their project did not involve any wetlab work,"

Intro: Miniprep Yeates' wt cage cells. Assisted Phil in making reagents. Lab meeting. Prepared protocols for transformation.
Miniprep Used 2mL of 10mL overnight starter culture. Used highest centrifuge setting for all centrifugations. Yield: 108.01 ng/uL 1.98 260/280. stored in -20C boelter protein cage box.
Notes: Remember to put cap on centrifuge. Rcf dorresponds to g's. Switch between using rpm/rcf button. Balance all tubes with 1.5mL tube and water. Not super precise but its ok. The P3 buffer is in the fridge with the glass door.
Solution making technique: Rotate solid reagent bottle to pout out precise amount. Add acid/base to water. If no flat surface, hold bottle with two fingers to level it.
Lab meeting notes: Think of types of people to contact for human practices. Wearable biomaterials. iGEM journal club next Wednesday.
Michael Gel making: Mix agar and TAE buffer. Microwave for a couple minutes. Let it boil for about 10 seconds before stopping microwave. Add cybrsafe. All casting trays/electrophoresis machines in 7731.

iGaME: Synthetic Biology for Gamers
To promote public awareness of synthetic biology and introduce its basic ideas to the laymen, our team is devoted to the development of an experimental video game which aims at instructing non-biologists to design and improve biological systems. Following the games-with-a-purpose paradigm in which players help solve scientific problems, we apply the human brain's puzzle-solving abilities to the complex designs of biological systems. While most of developed simulation tools are designed for experts to model the reaction networks from scratch, our game integrates a modeling environment in which users only need to submit their assembling of parts for our program to discover and generate the biological model automatically. With a mass of data for the use of modeling, we propose the Standard Biological Parts Automatic Modeling Database Language, which enables descriptions of complicated biological processes. Additionally, previous iGEM project models will be featured to demonstrate the availability of our idea.

SDU-Denmark,2013,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour53_-_-_TEXT.html," TN, Shirk MC, Fall R. Nonradioactive assay for cellular dimethylallyl diphosphate. Anal Biochem. 2001 May 15;292(2):272-9. (Link) We were capable of producing a standard curve by reacting DMAPP with acid for 2 min (instead of the 60 min specified in the previous study) (Fig. 1). At this time, we obtained optimal peak detection for standard solutions. We were, however, incapable of detecting isoprene, even in high concentrations of bacterial samples treated with acid. The test was expanded to include acid hydrolyzation for 2, 30, 60 or 90 min, yet we could not detect isoprene, and therefore not detect DMAPP.
Figure 1. Optimization of the procedure is needed before characterization of the dxs bricks can be completed using this approach. We suspect that the complexity of the bacterial samples is too high, and thus the reaction does not take place as fast as might be necessary for detection in our setup. Sonication of bacterial samples with and without addition of standard DMAPP, and subsequent measurements might shed some light on this hypothesis.  However, it should be noted that the GC wasn’t fully functional during the test period, consequently leading to broader peaks and thus lowered the sensitivity of the instrument. On the 3rd of October, we received a mail from Professor Lars Porskjær Christensen, Department of Chemistry-, Bio- and Environmental Technology, University of Southern Denmark:
""...The GC has now been repaired and the sensitivity has been improved considerably. The GC-peaks should be very sharp now. This may be the reason that you have not observed any release of isoprene from your samples...MailTranslated from danish"".
Unfortunately, with only 2 days left to wiki-freeze, there was no time for another round of testing. Since the European Jamboree in Lyon we have performed the experiment multiple times, but it still needs further optimization, as our results are inconclusive.
Growth Experiment

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#famAlbum_-_-_TEXT.html," medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

Public Engagement
Wechat Subscription Account
Only lectures are not enough to advocate synthetic biology. For idea to penetrate into everyday lives, we have to immerse people in the knowledge by publishing articles every week. We chose Wechat subscription account, a platform for professionals to spread ideas, as the media to deliver our ideas to people when they are scanning daily news or replying friends’ messages. We want people to gain synthetic biological knowledge easily and delightfully.
By making full use of this account, we successfully introduce the basic concept of synthetic biology, promote iGEM competition, and present our team project. We transformed complicated biological knowledge into simpler ideas or similes. More than 350 people subscribe us and the amount of reading in nearly each article exceeds 200. Lots of students around us demonstrate their interest to us in synthetic biology after reading our articles. We felt heartily joyful when we see our articles shared by others and when many students asked us how they could join the 2017 iGEM team. This practice definitely enhances our passion for iGEM and future investigation.
We will certainly continue to publish articles in this account, and promote iGEM competition and synthetic biology.
Shenzhen teams meet up
To further communicate with other projects, exchange our ideas and improve our methods, we contact several teams in Shenzhen in order to hold a seminar and share opinions. On august 20, 2016, we met up with SZU-China from Shenzhen University, BGI-College from BGI to present our project and develop more. After the presentation, we each receive specific great advice on experiments from other teams on possible safety problem on projects and improvement in experiments. We also examined and discussed into bio-safety problem in biological projects and the world.

Procedure
Clean your working area by wiping down with 70% ethanol.
Label one PCR tube for each colony, at least three colonies should be picked for screening per plate.
Add 10uL of Milliq water to each labelled PCR tube.
Pick the colonies carefully using a pipett tip and resuspend them into the prepared PCR tubes.
Prepare a 12.5uL PCR reaction for each colony, where the addition of template DNA is taken from the PCR tubes with the resuspended colonies and 1uL should be added.
Mix throuroghly and spin down the PCR reactions.
Place the tubes in the PCR Machine and use the following settings:
Initial denaturation - 98°C for 10 min.
Separation of strands - 98°C for 10 sec.
Annealing of primers – Tm of primer (approx. 55-62°C) for 30 sec.
Elongation – 72°C for 30 sec/kb.
Repeat step 1-4 for 30 cycles.
Final extension - 72°C for 10 min.
Hold - 4°C for infinite time.
Note: If smearing appears on gel, it could be due to too many cycles – optimize between 25-35 cycles. If no correct bands appear on gel, try doing a temperature gradient PCR to optimixe the annealing temperature of the primers. Also, cPCR is not enough accurate – so sending for sequencing could still be an idea even if no bands appear on the gel.
Once the PCR tubes are taken out of the PCR Machine, turn it off and leave the lid closed until it has reached room temperature, then open it and leave the lid open for the next user.
Prepare a 1%-agarose gel with the number of wells corresponding to the number of colonies screened.

The spined media was transferred to a HPAEC-PAD Vial (and septra) and the running program was consisted by a constant flow rate of 0,35 mL/min with the injection volume of 20 µL.
To validate the amount of sucrose secretion in different conditions, 17 different samples of induced S. elongatus PCC7942 were prepared with different osmolarity (0mM, 50mM, 100mM, 150mM, 200mM, 300mM). Furthermore, the amount of sucrose secretion was validated with and without selection pressure. Optical density was measured at 730nm wavelength to see a correlation between selected osmolarity and growth.

Samples of cyanobacteria supernatant were analyzed by HPAEC-PAD on a Dionex BioLC (Dionex, CA, USA), using CarboPac SA 10 (Thermo Scientific) column for fast separation of sugars. The running program was consisted by a constant flow rate of 0.35 ml/min and injection volume of 20 µL. Before injection of each sample, the column was washed with 0.5 M NaOH for 5 min, then equilibrated with water 10 min. The elution program consisted of an isocratic elution with water from 0 to 10 min, followed by a linear gradient up to 0.5 M NaOH from 10 to 15 min. Monosaccharides were detected using a pulsed amperometric detector (gold electrode) set on waveform A, according to manufacturer’s instructions, with a post-column addition of 1 M NaOH for detection. Monosaccharide and disaccharide standards were from Sigma and included D-Glc, D-Fru, and sucrose. For verification of the response factors, a standard calibration was performed before analysis of each batch of samples for measurement of sucrose content.
Results: Although some samples were lost post 78 hours, sucrose was observed to rise steadily in the samples above 100 mM NaCl (Fig. 29) , which is also expected from the literature (Ducat et al 2012). However,"

Intro: Today I delved into the specifics of resuspending newly synthesized DNA once we receive it from IDT. Phil and I discussed primer design in more detail. We will order the cage gene flanked by the iGEM prefix and suffix, then use one round of PCR with primers overlapping the cage gene itself and including the NdeI and XhoI sites. Additionally, I designed amplification primers for the cage gene itself. Phil and I researched which sequencing primers to use for the pET22b vector.

Cage Amplification Primer Design: I used the PCquad 2.0 benchling file that Phil created by altering some of the optimized codons for preferred primer design. My primers amplify just the cage gene itself. They are 20 and 21 bp long, both with Tms very close to 55C. After analyzing them primers using IDT's OligoAnalyzer 3.1 ( https://www.idtdna.com/calc/analyzer ) I determined that the two primers formed a heterodimer with a deltaG of -6.21 kcal/mole. However, Phil and I decided that this was fine since anything greater than -9 kcal/mole should be alright. We tried to run heterodimer analyses of each primer against the cage gene"

Now a Biobrick can be transformed into a vector v, each component of which represents the value of a property. To meet the two expectations above, we model the measurement as:
where F[i](x) are functions to map each property into interval [0,1] (called mapper) and w[i](v) are preset parameters to balance each component (called balancers).
Mappers simply normalize the properties into bounded real number. For properties with different types, their mappers also differ a lot. You may refer to our source code listed at the bottom of this page to read the detailed implementation of each mapper.
You may notice that balancers are designed as functions instead of constants. This is because some fields may have inner connections, and with such design, it is easier to control whether to skip a field or not, simply by setting its balancer to zero. Take uses as an example. uses is one of the properties to describe the popularity of a part, and is weighed highly in our system. However, during researching we found that for parts with certain types (such as Cell or Measurement), only a small fraction (less than 5%) of them have meaningful uses values, making the evaluated quality of them extremely low. To solve this, we changed the balancer of uses from a constant to a function depending on the type of the part. It defused the imbalance to some extent.
Some properties are relatively static compared with others, such as those from the main data source, and it's a waste of resources to evaluate their mappers repeatedly. Thus, we will precalculate these fields and cache the values every time after the main data source is updated. With the assistance of MyISAM database engine and a series of extra optimizations, the quality measurements of 39311 parts can be accomplished in about 2 seconds (tested on production server).
Among the properties we selected, some of them are subjective, such as `watches`, `stars` or `rate_score`, representing the feedbacks from Biohub Forum users. As mentioned above, such data can be easily counterfeited. A malicious user may"

Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," also built upon the literature we had read to gain background on oxidative stress’ effects on plants. Moreover, experts who focused specifically on hydroponic systems, helped us gain a new perspective on common problems at hydroponic farms. These insights helped us develop a concept of how to design the product that would house our bacteria, and served as a preview into user interviews. We also learned about how we could test our system based on plant immunity and plant science.
Key Takeaways
Affordability is a key concern for hydroponic systems which typically have narrow profit margins.
ROS affect plant growth and differentiation - therefore a ideal balance must be struck between too much or too little oxidative stress.
Ideal testing would require setting up a small-scale hydroponic system in a greenhouse.
Our approach using a biocircuit is innovative and a different way of thinking in the realm of plant sciences.
The product we create cannot be too technically challenging to implement for a farmer. We should aim for the greatest simplicity and ease of use while still achieving the regulation of oxidative stress we desire.
Feedback we received about the design we developed by the end of our project confirmed we have achieved something that could easily be incorporated into a currently existing hydroponic system.

Dr. Neil Mattson
We reached out to Dr. Neil Mattson, an expert on hydroponics and horticulture at Cornell University, to understand the hydroponics industry and intricacies. When we met with Dr. Mattson, he spoke with us at length about some of the problems hydroponic growers face, including high costs from HVAC systems and low margins due to disease and low yield. We realized that our system needed to be affordable as well as effective in increasing yields. From a technical standpoint, Dr. Mattson also helped us design our testing protocol by suggesting we use basil, a relatively easy crop to grow hydroponically that is becoming more and more widespread.

Dr. Adrienne H.K. Roeder
Dr. Adrienne Roeder was in a unique position to help us as a molecular biologist studying plant growth at Cornell University. She spoke to us about the special role reactive oxygen species (ROS) play in plant growth, including their roles in cell differentiation and maturation. She was excited about our project, as her own research had shown that using intracellular expression of oxidative enzymes such as catalase could help reduce oxidative stress for plant and increase blooming in plants exposed to external high levels of ROS. She expressed that there was potential that our regulation of ROS via OxyPon"

The next major improvement was the decision to use a pulse wave modulation (PWM) controller for the LEDs. A PWM controller has multiple output connections through which it controls connected LEDs individually. In addition to the aforementioned methods, the mean intensity of each LED can be adjusted as well. In principle, these kind of controllers have an integrated circuit (IC) with a storage unit that caches information about the brightness of every connected LED. This storage can be addressed by the microcontroller via a communication protocol similar to the popular Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol: A single data bus is used for transmitting digital data to every connected peripheral device, while a second, individual connection is used to determine which device shall be listening. This way, in order to control a number of n peripheral PWM controllers only n+1 GPIO pins are needed. In our case, we decided on the TLC5947 from Texas Instruments, a constant current 24‑channel PWM controller that operates on our supply voltage of 5 V. We therefore need four of these controllers for our 96‑LEDs.
The TLC5947 PWM controller on an adafruit breakout board.
With the increased potential of having a microcontroller and the possibility to adjust the LED's brightness, a simple on‑off button is insufficient. Therefore, we evaluated different interfacing options. The first and easiest option we tested is a series of status LEDs, each indicating a different intensity setting. A single button could be used both for switching between the different settings, and for turning the LEDs on or off by differentiating between pushing the button for a long or a short period of time. Unfortunately, the microcontroller has to be reprogrammed every time that a different set of illumination settings is needed. More importantly, the illumination time cannot be set precisely. In order to be able to adjust the time and intensity precisely, a display is necessary.
Two 7‑segment displays connected via two 8 bit shift registers.
One possibility we evaluated is to use a series of 7‑segment displays. A 7‑segment display basically consists of 7 LEDs that are arranged in shape of an 8, so that any digit between 0 and 9 is displayable. An additional 8th LED serves as a decimal point. Our prototype with two of these 7‑segment displays controlled by the Arduino Nano via two 8 bit shift registers worked perfectly. By pressing a button, the displays switches between showing either the illumination time in a range from 1 second to 60 minutes, or the LED's"

Assumptions
1). All nanobodies are bound on the surface of a magnetosome, i.e. no free floating nanobodies.
2). Each magnetosome has the same number of GFP-specific nanobodies adsorbed on its surface. 
3). A magnetosome does not interact directly with GFP molecules nor interfere with the reactions between GFP-specific nanobodies and GFPs.
4). The GFP-specific nanobodies on the surface of a magnetosome have the same association and dissociation rate constant to GFP when compared with the GFP-specific nanobody alone.
5). The binding of GFP with GFP-specific nanobody is in a one-to-one ratio.
6). The reaction follows the law of mass action, which means the reaction rate is proportional to the concentration of the reagents.
Model
Figure 1 shows the model constructed in SimBiology. The blue rounded rectangles represent the reagents, including antigens (GFP), GFP specific nanobody and the nanobody-antigens-complex. The yellow circle represents the binding reaction. The arrow points toward the nanobody-antigens-complex indicate that the complex is the product of the forward reaction. The double arrows above the yellow circle “binding” indicate that the reaction is reversible.
Figure 2. Interaction between antigens (GFP) and GFP specific nanobody to form the nanobody-antigen complex
Result and discussion of the simulation
By using the scan function of SimBiology, the dynamic of the system was simulated with changing the initial concentration of the antigen (the green line) from 0 M to 1.6x10-6 M with an interval of 2x10-7 M.
Figure 3. Simulation kinetics of the interaction between GFP-nanobody and antigen
Two observations were made from the simulation above. First, when the concentration of the antigen (GFP) is below that of the GFP specific nanobody (7.78 x10-7 M, given in the Calculation section above), as shown in Figure 3.1 to Figure 3.4, the antigen (GFP) becomes the limiting reagent and the final molarity of the nanobody-antigen complex (represented by a red line) equals to the initial molarity of the antigen. However, when the concentration of the antigen is higher than that of the GFP specific nanobody, as shown in Figure 3.5 to Figure 3.9, GFP specific nanobody becomes the limiting reagent, so the final molarity of the nanobody-antigen complex equals to"

Building with Biology: Port Discovery
July 30th, 2016
We volunteered at the Building with Biology Event held at Port Discovery in Baltimore, MD to raise awareness about synthetic biology among children 8 and up. We manned six tables with different activities involving synthetic biology, which are described in more depth below.

At this station, visitors were introduced to two catastrophic situations that they needed to solve using their imaginations: 1) Their friend fell off of a skyscraper, and 2) Their friend caused a massive oil spill in the ocean. To tackle the first problem, kids designed a superhero that could shoot spiderwebs or fly to ultimately catch their friend. For the second problem, kids designed a super bacteria that could clean the ocean by detecting, degrading, or digesting oil. This activity served as a introduction of the possibilites of synthetic biology and genetic engineering.
Visitors would learn about the concept of BioBricks and versatility of engineering cells to solve global issues. They used a cell model made of wooden poles and color-coded parts that fit on the poles. Each color had a different function like red for production and blue for sensing. A visitor would pick a challenge card with an area of research on it ranging from making synthetic blood to treating malaria. Then she would make a cell that would solve the problem using a solution description on the back of the card.
Eat it? Think about it? No way? Visitors were introduced to a variety of engineered foods, both currently available and in development, and asked their opinion on consuming the goods. Items included vanilla flavoring, caffeine, and milk synthesized by yeast, a food pill that provided all daily nutrients, golden rice, and meat created in a lab. Participants were also introduced to different ways we have modified agriculture like selective breeding, genetic engineering, and synthetic biology.
Visitors would be introduced to a wide range of applications for synthetic biology to start a conversation among the visitors on the level of importance of each application. Each visitor at the table was given a stack of colored coins to represent their opinion. They would place all their coins on the application(s) most important to them and then we would all discuss their choices and reasoning. An additional activity was to give each person at the"

Fatty Acid Sensing Mechanism
BBa_J176171
BBa_J176171 was planned to be used as a mammalian vector backbone for the promoters. After running PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) to amplify the FABP1 promoter and ligated it with GFP and the backbone, we did mutagenesis for the vector. Based on the gel photo, we concluded that the vector was easy to get degraded. Finally we figured out that BBa_J176171 was heat unstable and changed our plan.
Result
Figure 1: Degradation of BBa_176171 plasmid at temperature above 50°C after denaturation step of polymerase chain reaction. BBa_176171 and pEGFP-N1 were placed in ddH2O and ran polymerase chain reaction denaturation step at 98°C for 30 seconds and placed in a range of temperature from 50°C to 59°C for 30minutes. For controls, BBa_176171 and pEGFP-N1 were stored in room temperature (24°C) and 4°C for 30minutes respectively. The plasmids were ran on Gel Red pre-stained 0.8% agarose gel using 140V for 25minutes. 0.5uL of GeneRuler 1kb ladder was used.
Liver Fatty Acid Binding Protein 1 (FABP1) Promoter
This promoter was cloned from human genomic DNA (gDNA) (see gDNA extraction and PCR protocols ) with engineered RFC10 prefix and suffix for BioBrick submission. The promoter was then ligated with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) from pEGFP-N1 (Addgene), and cloned into BBa_J176171 mammalian backbone. The promoter and EGFP were successfully cloned into BBa_J176171 by digestion and ligation.

It started with a brief description of chromosomes and their function (the majority of them were already familiar with the terms) and afterwards, they integrated teams to develop a staining and observation on microscopes of chromosomes from plant material.
Workshop #4 (September 18th, 2012): Restriction Enzymes and Electrophoresis
The objective of this workshop was for students to understand and practice the concepts of plasmids and restriction enzymes as well to develop a digestion and electrophoresis gel protocol. We gave a description of how electrophoresis and restriction enzymes work, we encouraged them to ask questions if needed. Afterwards, they practiced the concepts by making their own digestion, preparing the agarose gels and charging the samples. Finally, they observed their results and analyzed them. They observed the difference between a supercoiled DNA and a linearized DNA.
Workshop #5 (September 20th,2012): Applications of Restriction Enzymes and Electrophoresis
We decided to give a more fun twist to the last workshop by making the students analyze the many applications of electrophoresis. The workshop started by a brief explanation of some of the applications, then we promoted a discussion with the students for them to propose how and where they think electrophoresis and restriction enzymes were used. Afterwards, the students developed a protocol using a Forensic BIO-RAD kit to identify the supposed criminal of a crime scene. After that, we decided to make a conclusive discussion and encouraged students to analyze what they learned in all the workshops. We were very pleased to know that everyone showed interest and wanted to continue learning more about iGem and Synthetic Biology.
Collaboration
During summer, we were interested in learning how other Teams from Latin America were doing with their projects; therefore, we contacted a few of them in order to share our experiences. One of these teams was Costa Rica-TEC-UNA, who we contacted via Facebook.  After disscussing with them the aim of our projects, they asked our team to review their constructs and debug them if needed. We found no problems with the design of the constructs, although we did noticed that some nucleotides were missing from Suffix and Preffix parts of the sequence. The missing nucleotides caused a modification on the reading frame. Additionally, we gave them some thoughts regarding the proteins they were using, because undesired expression of such proteins could prematurely begin cell lysis.
Around August, we began"

This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the medal criterion or award listed below .
Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal criterion and/or award. See more information at Instructions for Pages for awards .
Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!
Best Basic Part Special Prize
To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.

Figure 12: The concentration of B-pinene increased using the pinene synthases (PgTPS-Pin2 and PsTPS-Pin), with selected enzymes' concentrations being tripled, for the simplified biochemical pathway. Mutant cells contain the erg20-2 and K6R-HMG2 genes where as endogenous cells have the HMG2 and ERG20 genes instead.
The fourth result was for the concentration of B-pinene decreased using the pinene synthases (PgTPS-Pin2 and PsTPS-Pin), with selected enzymes' concentrations being tripled, for the simplified biochemical pathway. The simulations suggest the following:
tripling the [IDI1], for the production of I-PP, decreases the [B-pinene] by 35.65%
In particular, the model breaks down when the concentration of [IDI1], for the production of I-PP, is tripled because negative values are noted. Therefore, one should not attempt to"

Scene 2
Anna has been living in her country wooden house for a long time. In the past few years she had been harassed by termites and always worrying about her furniture and house. Last year she bought a device from the ZJU Termites Terminator Company and it worked perfectly. Anna was so happy and she kept the device in home all the time. Recently she was annoyed by cockroaches. She bought some cockroach drugs and put in the Termites Terminator device. Several days past but there seem to be no effect. She called Termites Terminator consulting about it. It is clear that she shouldn’t refit the device into a cockroach killing device. The device should be used as instructed and recycled in time.
Warning
Used device should be taken away by technical staff from termite control  center. To do this, make an appointment through our online tracking system.
Keep the device in a dry environment.
Only provided baits are allowed and do not refit without authorization.

On Saturday morning, Tracy went to the supermarket. After picking up the necessities, she remembered that there were some termites in her home recently. She came to the shelf of termite drugs but got lost in such many types of products. A shopping guide came and asked her about the damage situation. Base on that information, the shopping guide recommend her with the Termites Terminator device from ZJU Termites Terminator Company. Tracy read the introduction of the product for a while, but when she found that the product is based on GMO, she showed a little bit of hesitation. Noticing this, the shopping guide told Tracy that this product had been fully tested and got the safety certification. It is an efficient and environmental-friendly product with new intellectual property and are highly supported by the government. Follow the instruction in the product and there will be no danger for her family, her children and her pets.

MOTIVATION
With the rapid development of synthetic biology, there is an increasing requirement of an accurate quantitative regulation of gene expression. Moreover, researchers can provide insight into how the quantitative regulation system can be improved with the application of mathematical modeling.
Briefly, our team was in the devotion to developing a brand new method of accurate quantitative regulation at post-transcriptional level by means of utilizing the effect of inhibiting degradation of mRNA stem loop. More specifically, we hoped to realize a gradient amount of expression at protein or mRNA level by quantitatively manipulating the free energy  (∆G)  of designed stem loops downstream. However, the designed system is quite complicated than one can think—it consists of a variety of reactions and complex physical chemical process. To validate the effectiveness of initial designs and realize quantitative manipulating, we constructed a series of mathematical expression and built a mathematical modeling to simulate the theoretic curves of mRNA and protein. Thus, we could mutually authenticate the theoretic curves with the experimental ones and prove the feasibility and potential capacity of our designs’ functionality.
INTRODUCTION
Firstly, we analyzed and constructed the whole metabolic network of the system. The whole network could be separated into several independent processes: (1)mRNA transcription, (2) mRNA translation, (3) mRNA Cleavage by RNase E,(4) mRNA decay by RNase II. The complete metabolic network was listed in given blow. To determine the parameters in these processes, we respectively sought for Michaelis-Menten Kinetics, Empirical Formula and Partition Function (literature material) to respectively calculate the parameters’ value.
Secondly, our designed stem loops shared a gradient free energy. In order to simulate the theoretic curves of mRNA and protein and add the free energy (∆𝐺) into our model, we expect to determine the mathematical expression between the values of free energy (∆𝐺) of stem loops and the corresponding parameters—the constant of decay. To solve this problem, we sought for the Hansch-Fujita Equation which was a regression models widely used in the chemical and biological sciences. We also combined this"

Proceeding with the recommendations from last week regarding BioBrick constructions the plasmid switches of the coil genes into pSB1C3 were attempted again. Based off of the colony PCR there were some potential completed parts for the plasmid switches. Verification digests of the miniprepped plasmids from these colonies combined with sequencing revealed the successful plasmid switch of the E coil with a His-tag (Figure 5).
Figure 5. Confirmation digests of the K coil, E coil with His-tag, K coil with His-tag and the E coil parts within the pUC57 vector using the NotI enzyme are present in the respectively labelled lanes. These digests were used to confirm if older coil stocks were suitable for construction. Also present are the confirmation digests of the K coil, E coil with His-tag, and K coil with His-tag after an attempted plasmid switch into pSB1C3. The expected bands were observed for the plasmid switch of the E coil with the His-tag. Due to the faintness of the bands they are indicated with orange arrows (reference stock plasmid bands are also indicated). Positive and negative control lanes are present on another gel. The gel was a 2% agarose gel and was run at 80 volts for 90 minutes.
Week 14: July 29 - August 2
We attempted plasmid switching the coils into pSB1C3 however our attempt was unsuccessful. None of the plates had any colonies. This was attempted twice.

Fourthly, violacein and chromo-protein generally have no toxicity or risk. Based on experiments done in vivo with violacein, daily intake of up to 1mg/kg for 35 days is well tolerated and doesn’t cause hematotoxicity nor pose risks of renal or heptatotoxicity (Bromberg et al., 2010). And chromo-protein is generally safe because it is all working with probiotic strain and making these strains to produce healthy nutritional compounds, and chromo-protein does not produce any kind of toxic or dangerous gene in any way (Hampus Elofsson et al, 2013).
Sensitivity
Our engineered bacteria show distinct color-depth difference when exposed to different concentrations of tetrasulfate and thiosulfate, ranging from 0.01 mM to 1mM. As it is tested in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) mouse model, the two-sensor system was able to sense and report the tetrathionate and thiosulfate concentration level by expressing sfGFP; this is an indirect prove that our system is theoretically able to report different concentrations of tetrathionate and thiosulfate. Detail speaking, according to the diagrams found (shown as follows) in the passage “Engineering bacterial thiosulfate and tetrathionate sensors for detecting gut inflammation,” the average fluorescence when DSS is present is about 2000 MEFL; relating this data to another diagram, 2000 MEFL of fluorescence corresponds to a thiosulfate concentration of about 0.1 mM, which can be considered an estimated average of the concentration of thiosulfate in human’s gut. Since the 0.1 mM concentration is within the range that we can visualize the difference of resulting color, we can say that our project have an acceptable sensibility (Kristina N-M Daeffler et al., 2017).
As we can see in the following photo, the expression of protoviolaceinic acid (a fore body of violacein) in different concentrations can be easily visually distinguished, so that its sensitivity can be guaranteed.
Price and Response Time
Our bacteria would be already modified and copied to an appreciable quantity when it is ready to be commercialized, so that the job for each seller would be just cultivating the bacteria, making the capsules, and transporting them within 2-8℃. Generally speaking, this whole process wouldn’t be very expensive compared the current ways of gut inflammation"
Edinburgh,2008,Team:Edinburgh#Notebook#Cellulose degradation and related notes_-_-_TEXT.html," and America (from which the strain would take long to arrive and would probably be more expensive). Chris says he would be quite keen to have his PhD students working Cellulomonas anyway (hence his approvable of ordering it).  There are alternatives to actually using our chassis organism to degrade cellulose though:
E. coliis naturally able to metabolise pentose sugars (arabinose, xylose etc.), which are the products of hemicellulose hydrolysis. Hemicellulose is similar to cellular and present in a lot of waste biomass. It can be broken down into pentose sugars by the action of dilute acid. We could grow our modified strain of E. coli on a hemicellulose hydrolysate medium.  E. coliis able to metabolise lactose, a sugar which can be retrieved from whey. Whey is a waste product of the dairy industry, of which, because of its biological oxygen demand (BOD), dairies have to pay companies to dispose of. So we could probably get whey for free, although there probably isn't much of it hanging around the 3rd world!  The final idea is to used mixed cultures. This would mean using a cellulytic organism to break down cellulose. Because the demand for C, N and P are roughly in a 100:10:1 ratio, and cellulose is has them in a roughly 100:0:0 ratio, the cellulytic organisms secrete high-C waste products that can then be naturally metabolised by E. coli. Chris is currently investigating the feasibility of this, culturing E. coli with C. hutchinsonii and paper.  Related things to consider:
To get a bacterial gene, it's best to order a strain of said bacteria and use PCR to amplify the gene ourselves. An unfavourable alternative is to order custom-made genes from GeneArt, which would be expensive and could take as long as 2 months to get here (in theory it shouldn't take longer than a few weeks, but it was 2 months when they tried it last summer).  Cellulase enzymes need to be secreted. The secretory pathway of E. coli is apparently poorly understand (unlike that of B. subtilis), and is unlike the canonical bacterial secretory pathway. If we are using E. coli and cloning cellulase enzymes into them, we need to find out how to secrete the enzymes.  A method may be to fuse cellulase to the C-terminus of Haemolysin A ("

Introduction
In addition to questioning the legacy of using antibiotic resistance genes for selection and counterselection, we have also questioned the legacy of using E. coli as a chassis for a lot of the work done in synthetic biology and other genetic modifications. This organism was set up as the chassis back in the 1960s, when synthetic biology did not even exist – as such, we wondered whether it would be the optimal chassis for this field or if the field needs a novel chassis that can co-evolve with it and which was implemented with the specific needs of this area in mind.
As such, we propose Citrobacter freundii to provide a dialogue on what a synthetic-biology specific chassis should look like, what properties it should have and what should be known about it before it can be used as a reliable chassis.
Citrobacter freundii, or the ‘Friendly lemon bacterium’ gains its name from its ability to grow on citrate as the sole carbon source. It is part of the gamma-proteobacteria, like E. coli, which means that it has a lot of very similar traits to it (meaning that we can use the same protocols that were originally derived for E. coli) but, as we have found"
METU_Turkey_Software,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software#test_-_-_TEXT.html," them and make their data available through the parts registry. So the     while the individuals labs are receiving plates with higher rated, fully     working parts for their projects, anyone who wants to work on a more     exotic part can search through the achieves and re-vitalize the parts     stored there. The challenge of re-vitalization of parts can be encouraged     as an collaborative effort.
New Options for the Parts Registry Database
96% of participants are like minded with us that it      will be useful to have a link out to the gene/protein information      of the parts and - %97 of participants have been agree that they      would like to know if a part is also involved in known biological      pathways.
For receiving pathway information more participants have     voted for NCBI Cog (59%) than KEGG pathways (38%) when the responses     for both has been distributed among the choices according to response     rates. Adding the blast option to the parts registry has also     been suggested to locate parts of interest. We are sure all of us would     like to see gene-protein and pathway information if these information     was integrated into the database and offered automatically for each     entry in the database.
We are planning to provide this information about the parts to     all parts registry users as a build-in option in the next version of     BioGuide in iGEM 2011.

The PCR products were analysed on 5% native TBE polyacrylamide gel. The resulting gel is either stained with ethidium bromide and imaged with GelDoc system, or directly imaged with Typhoon Imaging System. The resulting gels are shown on Figure 1.

A part of our Team (Benjamin, Damien, Joaquin and Kilian) went to the European iGEM Meetup that was organized in Paris by IGEM IONIS (July 2 and 3). It was a great opportunity to present for the first time our project to other people. We created a poster for the occasion. This experience permit us to challenge our project to different views and we have seen what the other teams are working on.
It was really interesting and we bonded with other teams thanks to the party organized by our french host.
Here is a picture we took on the Champs de Mars to enjoy a soccer game for the european championship with other teams (Cardiff_Wales, iGEM Tuebingen and UAM_Poznan).
