Figure 2: Schematic outline of the CINDY Seq method. CINDY Seq is a method that can allows detection of specific RNA sequences with the use of Cas13a. If the added RNA sample contains the Cas13a target, the long RNA polymers will be collaterally cleaved by the active Cas13a. When there is no target present in the sample, Cas13a remains inactive and will not cleave the RNA polymers. These RNA molecules will form coacervates that are visible to the naked eye.
Perspectives for characterizing existing and future BioBricks
The nature of CINDY Seq is such that, in principle, it can be used to visualize any significant change in polymer length. As a result, this provides a promising outlook to characterize existing and future biobricks that involve the polymerization or degradation of coacervate-forming polymers (see Figure 3). Examples of such enzymes are: nucleases, proteases and amylases. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that even the molecule ATP can form coacervates ( Jia et al. 2014 ), so that one can even imagine to demonstrate energy consumption or ATP synthesis.
An obvious example of a BioBrick that can directly be characterised using the coacervation detection method is BBa_K1923001 , encoding for a variant of Cas13a closely related to the one we have used in our project. With the coacervation detection method any crRNA and RNA target combination can be tested, for activating Cas13a, and even binary tests for off-target effects can be done by introducing mutations in the target RNA.
Figure 3: Schematic outline of the CINDY Seq method. Proteins that can be characterised by CINDY Seq are involved in the assembly and degradation of polymers.
Another example of a BioBrick that could be characterized using coacervates is T5 Phage Exonuclease ( BBa_K676006 ). This part encodes for a DNase that can denature linear ssDNA and dsDNA, but will not cleave supercoiled plasmids, which makes it ideal when manufacturing plasmids. It has been demonstrated that coacervates can also be made using ssDNA and dsDNA ( Jain & Vale 2017 ). The cleaving activity of this (and other) nuclease can therefore be tested using the coac"

Modeling the Gene Regulatory Network
Our group seeks to assess the optimality of the synthetic system that modulates pucB/A gene expression and LH2 complex assembly in Rhodobacter sphaeroides.  Here we employ a mathematical model of this system to generate predictions about the behavior of the active system in response to light input. Features of the system that the model may help investigate include the time scale of response to light signals, the robustness of the system in response to fluctuations in light intensity, and the translation between changes in gene expression and the absorbance spectrum of the engineered cells.
Though the context of the model can extend back to the transcription of PrrA/B genes involved in integration oxygen and light signals, a preliminary testing model was developed using assumptions of certain initial conditions to isolate the light signal's effect.  Since Cph8 and OmpR are located on the same transcript downstream of the puc promoter region, it was assumed that their associated protein and mRNA had already reached steady state concentrations.  Moreover, the concentrations of the factors were assumed to be equal at this state.  The model whose diagram was constructed in the Simbiology Toolbox distributed by MathWorks details key reactions leading to the translation of the pucB/A genes.  The reaction rate equation used for the phosphorylation of OmpR as a consequence of the light signal reaching Cph8 bound to OmpR is capture in a modified form of Michaelis-Menten kinetics.  A logic function that corresponds to light ON/OFF (1/0) multiplies the maximum reaction rate in the numerator.  Thus, the model assumes that no phosphorylation occurs by this mechanism in the absence of light.  The OmpC promoter binding equation was based on the Hill Equation for a Repressor (1).
Component characterization steps and literature searches are underway in order to obtain quantitative parameters for the reaction rates.  In order to simulate behavior of the system, put"
ETH_Zurich,2018,Team:ETH Zurich#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," European iGEM Meetup in July, we realized that both of our teams were working on chemotaxis-based biosensors. Although our projects are based on somewhat different methods and applications, we did struggle with similar         complications at the time. Therefore, we decided to stay in touch and update each other about problems and solutions, which formed the base for our collaboration. An example of our similar approaches was found in the way both our         teams dealt with our intended use of split luciferase. Both our projects included using the reconstitution of a split luciferase to create a read-out signal from the chemotaxis pathway. Especially when searching for the right luciferase for our         application, we were happy to split tasks. We shared outcomes with each other, which led to our current solution using firefly luciferase.         In the future, we also aim to integrate the engineered bacteria from the Utrecht iGEM team on AROMA. We hope their biosensor will improve the range of detectable concentrations, while also broadening the range of substrates that could         potentially be sensed.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"). Experiments regarding population structure, UV stress, and simply bare growth can be observed in a much shorter time frame.
V. natriegens has a single stage lifecycle and does not form spores. The rod shaped bacterium does however possess a single polar flagella (Austin et al. 1978).
Ecology
V. natriegens has some amazing abilities. By understanding them as adaptations, it becomes quite apparent that V. natriegens is itself first and foremost a product of its environment. Therefore, getting a better understanding of its ecology helps explain some of these capabilities.
Figure 1: Coastal salt marsh in the southeast USA, this is the habitat V. natriegens was first isolated from(Pendragon 1966).
The rod-shaped bacterium occupies a special ecological nice in estuarine and salt marsh regions, where strongly fluctuating salt concentrations and nutrient availability create a challenging environment. In order to adapt to these challenges, V. natriegens can utilize a wide range of substrates to outgrow competitors, as well as remain in a low metabolic state for extended periods of time when the nutrient pool is depleted (Nazly 1980). Furthermore, it has the ability to quickly draw available phosphorous from its environs and store them in polyphosphate bodies (Nissen et al. 1987) for later utilization. Yet another way in which V. natriegens is adapted to its variable environment is the storage of carbon as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), biodegradable polyesters that are accumulated in intracellular granules that can be broken down under starvation conditions (Chien et al. 2007).
From the well oxygenated upper layer of mud down to the anoxic layers, V. natriegens is able to grow in many surroundings. These extremes are challenges to which V. natriegens found solutions. At the surface of the mud, as well as in open waters, the bacteria are exposed to strong

radiation. As a response to this, the

damage repair systems are highly active (Simons et al. 2010), with significantly elevated expression levels of some parts of the system compared to E. coli , thus increasing

sequence integrity. By switching to fermentation, growth can be maintained under anaerobic conditions, allowing the colonization of the lower strata in the mud.
V. natriegens was shown to be a vital part of the marine ecosystem because it has the rare ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen under anaerobic conditions, thereby enriching"

Collaboration with Kanagawa Institute of Technology
1. Overview
Our team collaborated with iGEM 2016 team KAIT Japan and other teams, as we were asked to help them with the modeling in an early stage. From iGEM 2016 team KAIT Japan we were asked to help them create a mathematical model for their project.
2. Project
Team KAIT wanted to increase the production of Bacterial Cellulose (BC) produced by the bacteria A. xylinum. To do so, we have to take in account the cellulose synthesis pathway.
Fig. 8-2-1. Cellulose synthesis pathway of an Acetobacter
Taking this pathway in consideration iGEM 2016 team KAIT Japan planned to increase the amount of cellulose production by diminishing the amount of G6PDH and PGI enzymes by the antisense method.
3. Mathematical Model
Cellulose is produced basically by a series of enzyme reactions, so in order to create a mathematical model for this project, we have to take in account the principal reactions taking place in this production. By doing this we obtain the following equations .
$$ \displaystyle \frac{d[Glc]}{dt} = - \frac{V_{max_1}[Glc]}{K_{m_1} + [Glc]} $$
$$ \displaystyle \frac{d[Frc]}{dt} = - \frac{V_{max_5}[Frc]}{K_{m_5} + [Frc]} - \frac{V_{max_6}[Frc]}{K_{m_6} + [Frc]} $$

Mating-type Switch and Mating Switcher
Obtaining the chassis
Aiming to achieve MTS for environmental use, it is essential to make sure that when the MAT locus has DSB (double strands break) cleaved by HO, our type-a (MATa) yeast can only become type-α (MATα). Therefore, we used a Ura-tag to replace the HMRa domain in chromosome Ⅲ. In this way the HMRa will no longer be the donor for the homologous recombination in the repairing process for MAT cleavage. Since the change of mating type may appear successively, there is a great possibility that the same type haploid mate with each other. After selection, by homologous recombination, we deleted the Ura-tag for further usage. We selected the target colonies (SynⅩ-dUra) via 5-FOA plates.
Fig. 1-1. The PCR strategy for testing whether we deleted the HMRa in SynⅩ-dUra.
Fig. 1-2. As we can see in the gel photo above, the UP and DOWN segments hasn’t been amplified in our SynⅩ-dUra comparing to the BY4741 as control. Which indicated that the HMRa gene has been successfully eliminated.

Fig. 1-2. As we can see in the gel photo above, the UP and DOWN segments hasn’t been amplified in our SynⅩ-dUra comparing to the BY4741 as control. Which indicated that the HMRa gene has been successfully eliminated.
The result for constructing the Gal systems
In this pathway, we chose Gal1 as our inducible promoter for the expression of HO gene, CYC1 as the terminator, and PRS416(with Ura-tag) as our vector. As for segments ligation, we designed the cutting sites for Bsa1 enzyme in each part, hoping to achieve seamless ligation of these three parts.
We adopted the PCR method to amplify the Gal1-part (BBa_K2407001) and CYC1-part ("
TAS_Taipei,2016,Team:TAS Taipei#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," peroxide (Domínguez-Vicent 2016). (see Model 1 for full explanation).
The amount of total GSR (in both forms) is constant. In reality, for the first days of the treatment the GSR level is being increased, so GSR levels will not be constant until 30 days of the treatment have passed (see Model 3). As we will discuss in Model 3, a one-time treatment will be made as soon as prevention is fully effective.
The cortex and nucleus of the eyes are indistinguishable and regarded as a single entity. As cataract damage can occur in both areas, we simplify the model by combining them to form a single system.
The amount of H2O2 in the aqueous humor (but the amount in the nucleus changes). As cellular respiration is constantly regenerating ROS and forming H2O2, there will constantly be H2O2 diffusing into the lens.
The amount of H2O2 in the aqueous humor is equal to the initial value of H2O2 in the cortex. The rationale is that initially dynamic equilibrium exists between the lens and the aqueous humor.

Here we employ a mathematical model of this system to generate predictions about the behavior of the active system in response to light input. Features of the system that the model may help investigate include the time scale of response to light signals, the robustness of the system in response to fluctuations in light intensity, and the translation between changes in gene expression and the absorbance spectrum of the engineered cells.
Though the context of the model can extend back to the transcription of PrrA/B genes involved in integration oxygen and light signals, a preliminary testing model was developed using assumptions of certain initial conditions to isolate the light signal's effect.  Since Cph8 and OmpR are located on the same transcript downstream of the puc promoter region, it was assumed that their associated protein and mRNA had already reached steady state concentrations.  Moreover, the concentrations of the factors were assumed to be equal at this state.  The model whose diagram was constructed in the Simbiology Toolbox distributed by MathWorks details key reactions leading to the translation of the pucB/A genes.  The reaction rate equation used for the phosphorylation of OmpR as a consequence of the light signal reaching Cph8 bound to OmpR is capture in a modified form of Michaelis-Menten kinetics.  A logic function that corresponds to light ON/OFF (1/0) multiplies the maximum reaction rate in the numerator.  Thus, the model assumes that no phosphorylation occurs by this mechanism in the absence of light.  The OmpC promoter binding equation was based on the Hill Equation for a Repressor (1).
Component characterization steps and literature searches are underway in order to obtain quantitative parameters for the reaction rates.  In order to simulate behavior of the system, putative values were included that exaggerate true concentrations and time scales.  OmpR was given an initial concentration normalized to one, and all other components were assumed insignificant initially to this value. An ideal light pulse was introduced at an"

UNebraska-Lincoln,2018,Team:UNebraska-Lincoln#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," was identified as the rate-limiting enzyme. The team decided to moved forward with the design in the second paper.  We obtained plasmid 100167 and 100169 from Addgene.
Although it was reported that plasmids 100167 and 100169 can be used together in E. coli. The team still did literature search to confirm that double transformation of the two plasmids can be easily performed in the lab. Initial research on the topic of double transformation of plasmids through chemical transformation showed that efficiencies were likely to be low when the plasmids had the same anitbiotic resistance gene and/or when the plasmids have the same origin of replication (Goldsmith et. al, 2007). Plasmid 100167 has chloramphenicol resistance marker and p15A origin of replication. Plasmid 100169 has ampicillin resistance marker and pBR322 origin of replication. The two plasmids can be simultaneously stably maintained by E. coli.
During brainstorming, the team also identified the enzyme that can synthesize 7-epi-sesquithujene from FPP.  Gene TPS4-B73 was first isolated from Zea mays. We discussed strategy to enable the expression of the plant enzyme in E. coli host.  After comparing the codon usage preference of Z. mays and E. coli, we decided to examine both the native and a codon-optimized version of TPS4-B73 gene and compare which one can support high production of 7-epi-sesquithujene.
Experimental design:
The team first determined cloning strategies to replace the amorphadiene synthase (ADS) gene in plasmid 100169 with either the native or the codon-optimized TPS4-B73 gene for the biosynthesis of 7-epi-sesquithujene. The team decided to use two methods in order to expand our lab skills.  For the cloning of the native TPS4-B73 gene, we used sequence and ligation independent cloning (SLIC) method.  For the case of the the codon optimized TPS4-B73 gene, we decided to use conventional cloning method, which requires restriction enzymes and DNA ligase. More details on the methods used are available in the lab notebook, experiments, and parts sections.
We next designed protocols for culturing the E. coli cells that express pathway for the biosynthesis of 7-epi-sesquithujene. Following the procedure of an article that describes the purification of"

3. Unsolved ethics: Is your project suitable for supervillains? In this workshop the participants could discuss the ethical impacts of their projects and reflect on additional steps which could be taken to make their ideas more acceptable by the general public.
4. Funding the fun: The road to Boston In this workshop the participants could discuss how they went about to making the journey to Boston possible. Some important questions that were discussed included the amount of money required, the type of sponsorship obtained from companies and how to approach them in the best way.
5. After iGEM: Unexpected applications In this workshop the discussion focused on how to make the projects available to the community and also if they could have any additional applications other that what the teams had already thought of.
The workshops were divided into two sessions of 1 hour each, and the participants got to sign up for the two workshops that they found to be the most interesting. This part of the NiC was very well thought out and provided many interesting ideas on improvements that can be made, both for the teams and on the iGEM management’s side of things.
Following the workshops, the prestigious prize ceremony was held, announcing the winner of the all-time first Nordic iGEM Conference. Our congratulations go to the Stockholm iGEM team who managed to claim the Golden Pipette. After an amazing dinner, it was time for the Bar Crawl. This was a really fun opportunity to get to forge deeper connections in a relaxed setting and at the same time discover the beauty of the Uppsala University nations. The Bar Crawl was a great ending to an amazing day, which had been full of new experiences and meetings with really wonderful people.
The last day all of the participants could take it easy and enjoy a sightseeing tour of the town of Uppsala. The NiC ended at midday and it was time to say goodbye to all the people and new friends we had met during the weekend. We want to thank Uppsala and Stockholm for a really great event as well as all the other teams who attended for being awesome. We hope that NiC go on to become an annual event and we look forward to seeing you all in Boston.

Hallo Besucher. Ich heiße Bianca Genenncher und bin in meinem Abschlussjahr des Masterstudienganges ""Biochemie und Mikrobiologie"" der Göttinger Universität. Während meines Bachelor Studiums, ebenso in Göttingen, fokusierte ich mich auf die Molekularbiologie der Pflanze im Bereich der Pflanzen-Pathogen-Interaktion, bei der die Untersuchung der pflanzlichen molekularen Reaktionen auf invasierende Pathogene einen Hauptaspekt darstellte.
Letztes Jahr habe ich dann ein Auslandssemester an der Universität Aberdeen in Schottland absolviert. Ich habe diese Zeit mit anderen Studenten aus den verschiedensten Ländern mit interessanten, kulturellen Hintergründen unglaublich genossen, aber darüber hinaus natürlich auch die Schönheit der Natur bewundert. Dies ist mein erste iGEM-Teilnahme und ich bin froh ein Teil des ersten iGEM-Teams der Universität Göttingens zu sein. Ich bin hoch motiviert, die Experimente zu starten und die ersten Erfahrungen zu sammeln, eigene Experimente zu gestalten. Ein weiterer Grund für mich daran teilzunehmen, ist die Internationalität des Wettbewerbs.

To test the chemical tolerance of the ‘warship’, we immersed our device in intestinal-pH solution, concentrated hydrochloric acid, sodium bicarbonate solution and common organic solvent, and found it was intact after our tests. We also used mechanical compression to test its rigidness and found it was stable in shape.
To test the ‘warship’ function, we first tested whether our device allows small molecules like IPTG pass through the membrane (Figure 2). We found adding IPTG in the bath solution outside of ‘warship’ successfully induced GFP expression via bacteria inside the ‘warship’ (Figure 3).
Figure 2. Diagram of testing exchanging of small molecules between the bath solution and the ‘warship’.
Figure 3. IPTG in the bath solution outside of ‘warship’ induced GFP expression via bacteria inside the ‘warship’.
Next, we tested whether the bacteria inside the ‘warship’ can leak out into the bath (Figure 4). We introduced ampicillin resistance bacteria inside of the ‘warship’ and kanamycin resistance bacteria in the bath. After overnight co-culture without antibiotics, we collected the bacteria from the bath and the ‘warship’ and re-grew them in the presence of ampicillin or kanamycin. We found there was no mixing of bacteria between the bath and the ‘warship’ (Figure 5)
Figure 4. The diagram to test whether bacteria can flow between the bath and the ‘warship’.
Figure 5. No mixing of bacteria detected between bacteria in the bath and the ‘warship’.
Therefore, our results showed that our designed ‘warship’ can withstand chemical and physical challenges. The ‘warship’ can successfully allow exchanging of small molecules but not bacteria. Therefore, it increased the safety level of gene modified bacteria and should their surviving power in gut since introduced bacteria can stay together.

How to express parts of plasmid such as RBS, promoter, ...etc.
Types of restriction enzymes
Why a scar occurs and how to prevent it (Silver's method, application of Berkley's method, Lim standard)
How to construct a backbone having desired origins and antibiotic resistance based on Reshma method.
Practical usage in companies.

To each evolution object you want it to evolve, a scoring function can be designed to output PoPS as the fitness score to your demand. After that, you can ligate the scoring function device into the E.ADEM plasmid, transform E. coli, culture the cells and wait for them to evolve automatically and robustly, and get what you want at last.
E.ADEM is designed by implementing evolutionary algorithm back into biology. The output of the scoring function is connected to the core of E.ADEM, a self-adaptive controller that can adjust variation rate and selection pressure , base on the fitness score, the population size and the average fitness score calculated by a quorum sensing device. To carry out individual functions, 3 more modules are also designed: a variation function to change the evolution object by mutation or recombination, a selection function to control the survival or death of the cell, and a reporter module to report the score to the user.
We performed comprehensive measurement using constitutive promoter family stimulus signals and modeling of each components. A prototype machine with the self-adaptive controller is built. Modular design and PoPS device boundary standard will ensure the extensibility and universality of the machine.

Once this issue addressed, we started looking at how we would organize the place. Fortunately there was a lot of space that we could use. We were given levels 0 and -1, and were able to organize them as we wanted. The place also had a backyard where we would be able to do the coffee break, a rooftop room with a beautiful view for the V.I.Ps,  and most importantly a state-of-the-art amphitheater for the conferences. Finding this place was very comforting for us, as we knew we would be able to host our event in the best possible conditions.
Communication Tool
As said before, once the event was announced on social websites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and the iGEM website) we wanted to have the biggest impact possible on the iGEM Community. We therefore started editing logos and banners, such as the ones you can see below.
These were posted online, in order to give to the greatest amount of persons possible an access to the essential informations they needed to know. Infographics were also created, to make sure the information was clearly explained for everyone.
To achieve further communication, we decided to make a quick video teaser about the event to encourage European iGEMers to come. In our video we highlighted the meeting, exchange and Paris.

The EECA is available on both iOS and Android smartphones, and is designed to work offline: as some people may not have an internet access abroad, this feature was absolutely necessary. The app would update itself if any connection was detected, but would otherwise function offline without any problem.
It featured four main tabs: the first one, the Home tab, included a short description of the teams organizing this event and their projects, along with links to our media pages and e-mail addresses.
Then comes the « Map » tab: we drew a map of the campus so that every team could know where to go and where to visit « that project I wanted"

Background
Protein plays a significant role in performing physiological functions. [1] However, in diseased cells, protein carrying out a certain function may indicate the proceedings of disease. Such protein could be sorted to biomarkers, which have been regarded as the targets of disease detection and treatment in recent years. [2-4] Therefore, detecting those biomarkers of protein-type becomes more and more critical to biological and medical fields.
There are two main detecting approaches to detect a particular protein in a complex sample. One is direct determination of the content after purification, and the other is binding assays which include a target recognition probe and a signal transducer. The former approach includes gel filtration chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, nickel column and more. While on the down side, these methods involve high costs, strict equipment requirements and other drawbacks, which are not suitable for promotion and application. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a typical representative of the latter approach, nevertheless, such assays using antibodies as affinity ligands have cross-reactivity of antibodies compromising the specificity to the target of interest. [5] What's worse, the premise of using ELISA is to find the corresponding antibodies, but the fact is that not all"

Educative Survey

Educative Survey
MOOC
Banning Plastics
To degrade or not
We started our human practices investigations by conducting a survey. Our main goal was to understand PLA knowledge and acceptance from the general public. But we also wanted to make a useful ""educative survey"" by providing useful knowledge on PLA to respondents.
In order to make a proper survey, we needed follow a good methodology, and to understand our bias. Therefore, we asked some methodological advices to Marie Beigelman, a student at ENSAE, the French National School for Statistics and Administration. You can find the link for the survey here .
Methodology
The French Robert dictionary defines a survey as an investigation aiming at identifying opinion repartitions according to a population sample. Two words were of importance to us : sample and investigation; and we kept them in mind for the redaction of the survey and the treatment of data.
Definition of the content
We tried to formulate our questions in the most possible neutral way. But as we decided to provide respondents with further information on the topic of PLA, we managed the organisation of the survey so that the respondent would not look at the extra informations at the same time as he is answering the question - otherwise the answers would have been biased.
Another element we took care of was to diversify the kind of questions asked in order to enable respondents to express themselves further than ticking boxes. Thus, we varied between opened and close questions.
Limits of the survey
Given the methodology chosen for spreading the survey was digital, there are some limits we have to take into account:
As we focused on University-related networks, our sample is mainly composed of educated-people and youth.
As we provided facts along the survey, it"

Let the children compare three solution.
The Solution Experiment
Materials:
salt, a beak filled with water, a spoon
Steps:
let the children guess how many spoons of salt can dissolve in a beak of water.
Then add one spoon of salt by the other, until the salt precipitation.
The group that guess it right win.
Speed Up！ Solution Experiment
Materials:
salt, a beak filled with water, a stick to stir
Steps:
each group get the same amount of water and the salt.
the group that first dissolve all the salt win(remember to give them the right amount of salt, if the salt is too much, the game will never end and if the salt is not enough, they will win simultaneously ).
Think about what will effect the solution rate.
Purple Cabbage Experiment
Materials:
purple cabbage water(boil the purple cabbage for 10-15 minutes, or until the water turn purple), some beaks, solutions with different pH value(vinegar, soap solution, water, lemonade……etc)
Steps:
Add each solution in the beak.
Add the purple cabbage water into the beak.
Observe the color of the solution.
WHY DO WE CHOOSE THIS TOPIC
Water is closely associated with our life. We want them to understand that even it looks simple, it has a lot of science in it. Besides, there are many funny experiments that is easy for them to do, especially the purple cabbage experiment, we want them             to be awed by the color change. What’s more, children are easily accidentally drink the strong acid and base. To avoid the tragedy happened, instead of prohibit them from it, they should get close and learn what is acid and base and with that             understanding, they can use the acid and base in a careful way.
The Process
After WEEK ONE, the kids and us are much more familiar with each other. Before we started, they had already surrounded us and kept asking what is the solution we bring. At the beginning of the class, as usual, we asked them to divided into groups, and             start the lessons with question and answer. They are still really eager to answer.
After the basic concept of what is solution, we talk more about the properties of the solution and interspersed with the experiments. Because we need to use a lot of solution to do the experiment, some are not eatable, to avoid any danger             or any other naughty behavior, we have to have an agreement before we start. They have to follow the rules, otherwise we have to terminate the fun experiment."

Uppsala,2017,Team:Uppsala#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," parts of this we turned to Uppsala Innovation Centre for help. There we met with the lawyers Per Kjellin and Olivia Tolan, who could answer questions about our rights and discuss pros and cons. For example a patent would enable a protected environment for developing of our product but it would also limit the potential research opportunities. In the end we decided to not go ahead with the patenting but it was our research on the topic that made us able to take an informed decision, and we are now more educated on how to possibly proceed with another project in the future.
EDUCATING
“The Student Conference in Science and Technology” is a yearly event where professors and students from the faculty of science and technology from Uppsala University get the opportunity to make presentations and receive feedback. Our team were glad to present our project during this day. The main part of the audience was first-year students. This was taken in consideration and the content of our presentation was adjusted to fit their level of knowledge. The audience gave our speakers useful feedback and we are happy that we got this occasion to practice our presentation. We actually won Best Presenter at the event, voted by the audience!
SynBioHour is an event that iGEM Uppsala Association organizes. The purpose is to give the general public knowledge about synthetic biology, iGEM and to make them interested in what is possible to do during an iGEM project. Similar to the student conference mentioned above, we got to present our project and it was a great opportunity to further discuss opinions regarding our project.
NIC (NORDIC IGEM COMPETITION) NORDIC IGEM MEETING
The iGEM Nordic Meetup (NIC) originated in Uppsala in 2015 as an opportunity to meet other teams from Northern Europe, get some feedback on the projects and to prepare the ground for future collaborations between the teams. It became a tradition that the next NIC is hosted by the team that wins the best presentation contest during the meetup. This year, teams have met in Copenhagen at an event hosted by iGEM UCopenhagen. During the first day we bonded over games and activities provided by the team. The second day was spent with lectures informing us about with various issues that we might run into during iGEM competition such as communication with media or ethical issues. Each team also presented their project and gained feedback from iGEM judges on how to address possible critical issues they might run into. Lively discussion continued until late night hours with a BBQ dinner prepared. The award for best presentation this year went to the newest team in the Nordic iGEM world"

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Project#StickerSystem#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," and aphids is lost, as well as the honeydew cue for the production of methyl salicylate. Because of this, an oscillating pheromone production is needed, to prevent aphid habituation to β-farnesene and overburdening of the plant's metabolism by methyl salicylate.
Sticker
The sticker we used is courtesy of the 2012 Groningen iGEM team, as a part of their ""Food Warden"" project. The polymethylpentene sticker has pores in it with a radius of 1 to 10 nm, large enough for the exchange of volatiles, but small enough to keep bacteria inside. It can be easily attached or stuck on a plant (see picture). For more information on the sticker, click here .
Oscillator
As a result of keeping the BanAphids in a container, the direct contact between bacteria and aphids is lost, and hereby the honeydew cue. If we were to use our honeydew system, β-farnesene would be constitutively expressed because of the lack of glucose, which makes the BanAphids switch from the production of β-farnesene to methyl salicylate. However, after a certain time aphids get habituated to the β-farnesene signal, rendering our sticker useless. Constitutive expression of methyl salicylate isn't an option either, since constant activation of plant defence systems would put a burden on the plant, thus reducing crop yields. As a solution to this, we came up with an oscillator that switches between the production of β-farnesene and methyl salicylate through time. On the oscillator page, we elaborate further on the design, genes and wetlab results of the oscillator.

iGEM Thessaloniki - InterLab
The Divices 1-4 from Thessaloniki and our negativ control.
We collaborated with this year’s Thessaloniki iGEM team by taking part in their InterLab. They are working on a synthetic biology circuit which ensures a stable protein expression. By making the gene expression independent from the potentially fluctuating copy number of plasmids, better predictions can be made about the stoichiometry when metabolic pathways are integrated into the chromosome. In this experiment we tested their four test devices.
We hope our results represent the desired outcome of the InterLab. We cultivated the cells in an incubator that was in frequent use by other team members, so the cultures weren’t shaken for multiple short intervals. If our data varies from what was expected, one explanation could be, that the Escherichia coli cells didn’t incubate correctly and therefore didn’t grow as well.

3\(\alpha \)-HSD Kinetic Model
Background
3\(\alpha \)-HSD is the name of a group of enzymes which convert certain hormones (like DHT) to another hormone (like \(3\alpha-diol\)) and vice versa, by means of oxidation and reduction. There are several strands of this enzyme, with different levels of potency. In humans, the enzyme is encoded by the AKR1C4 gene, while in rats it is encoded by the AKR1C9 gene. We chose the rat version of the enzyme because it is more efficient in breaking down DHT [7] .

All AKRs catalyze an ordered bi-bi reaction in which the cofactor binds first, followed by the binding of the steroid substrate. The steroid product is the first to leave, and the cofactor is the last. In this mechanism, \({K_{cat}}\) represents the slowest step in the kinetic sequence [2] .
Figure 2 – A schematic from an article [4] of the kinetic mechanisms for AKRs.
Approaches to modeling the process
1. Cofactor saturation assumption
We assume that the levels of the cofactors on the scalp are high enough that they are always at saturation in the enzymatic reaction. The advantage of this approach is that we can use the Michaelis-Menten reversible equation to describe the reaction. As we will explain later, this assumption may not be correct, so we will offer other approaches as well. Another major disadvantage of this model is that it does not take the levels of the cofactors into consideration, so it cannot help us predict the system's behavior for different cofactor concentrations.
2. New Model Development
Taking cofactors into consideration, we can use principles from statistical mechanics in order to develop a completely new enzymatic reaction function. The advantage of this approach is that it describes the kinetics of the enzyme in much more detail than Michaelis-Menten reversible, and can even offer some explanations for our wet-lab results. The disadvantage of this approach is that there are no reaction constants available for it, so we will have"

Although all of the organisms are in line with biosafety level 1 (BSL), we have treated it as a potential affection source and created following rules to minimize the danger:
Wearing appropriate protective equipment like gloves and lab coats.
Don’t eat any food or store it in the lab.
Avoid wearing shorts or shoes that make your legs or toes exposed.
Washing hands before leaving the laboratory.

Safety training
There is no Biosafety Committee at our university, only a bio-safety officer. Nevertheless, we have iGEM instructors, Dr. Chun Li and Dr. Shuyuan Guo, who trained us about the project progress regularly and is responsible for the bio-safety of our project. The general rule at our university is that every student has to take part in specific safety training before their first experiment. Further, once a year, every member of the lab is required to take a refreshment course in lab safety, bio safety, fire safety, waste management, handling gas cylinders and working with hazardous materials. All of these treatments ensure our lab safety.

Public & Environment safety
The model organisms used in our project are non-virulent strains which are commonly used in microbiology laboratories. The organism has been provided various resistance of antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, ampicillin and kanamycin. Without the circumstance which contained specific antibiotic, our organism has no advantage in the competition with the wild one. Besides, although we have improve its resistance of higher temperature(42~45℃), it can still be denatured via heat. In a word, it can work well in laboratory environment and will be eliminated through competition when exposing in the wild.

Tokyo_Tech,2014,Team:Tokyo Tech#Policy and Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," allergy. You introduce allergen into the body in very small amounts, and by gradually increasing it, you can suppress the body′s hyper-allergic reaction. However, there are several defects in this treatment. You have to go to the hospital for treatment many times, and it takes three to five years for a complete recovery. By using E. coli, we tried to invent a faster and easier immunotherapy.
 
 
Lie Detector
Fig. 6-1-2-4. Lie Detector Poster
In this project, we tried to make a lie detector by using E. coli. By putting Na+ channel in the flagellum motor, E. coli responds to the sodium ion contained in a liar′s sweat and starts running. If the E. coli moves, it comes in contact with lysozyme and the outer membrane dissolves. Then, ATP inside the E. coli is released to react with luciferase, producing a glow.
 
 
Bank E.coli
Fig. 6-1-2-5. Bank E. coli Poster
We thought of making E. coli act as a bank by taking things in and out. We had two scenarios for this theme:
• Exchanging things between Bank and Consumer
Other than these stories, recreating the bursting of the bubble economy with E. coli was also in the plan.
 
 
Fertilizer
Fig. 6-1-2-6. Fertilizer Poster
Micronutrient fertilizer is very important to the growth of crops. However, more than 70% of the fertilizer goes unused in soil. Phosphorus included in the fertilizer becomes insoluble by binding with metals, such as aluminum and calcium. Since plants cannot absorb these immobilized phosphorus, the phosphorus accumulates in the soil. To solve this problem, we decided to use E. coli to degrade the immobilized phosphorus into phosphoric acid, which plants can absorb. After producing phosphoric acid, E. coli stores it in its body in a polymeric form. By collecting these E. coli and extracting the polymer, we can retrieve the phosphorus left in the soil.
 
2-2 Results
Many visitors, especially those lacking a scientific background, reacted negatively to E. coli at first. However, by introducing the properties of E. coli, we were able to change their mind. On the Post-it notes, there were many opinions saying that they were looking forward to new inventions using E. coli. We can say that our goal, which was to inform people know and change their negative thinking about synthetic biology, has"

As starting point of our directed evolution system for binding proteins we needed a numerousness of partly randomized Monobodies and Nanobodies, respectively, to emerge our Evobodies. An Evobody is a binding protein resulting from the combination of a scaffold , be it Monobody or Nanobody, with a continuously mutation and selection system, and thus represents the fusion of a semi rational design approach with evolution.
We designed two libraries for Monobodies and Nanobodies, respectively. A library is a collection of identical plasmids that only vary in the protein coding sequences (CDS). These CDS are designed to possess optimized and planned randomized subregions displaying high variability. The result is a wide variety of plasmids with different inserts. One major advantage of a library is the availability of a wide range of different binding proteins as starting material for the evolution process, which ensures that candidates with limited but evolvable affinity are present from the outset. After transformation into E. coli a heterogeneous culture is created and after plating the transformation each colony carries a different insert encoding a different binding protein ( Osoegawa et al., 2001 ).

Undergraduate
Hello! My name is Nimaya De Silva, and I am 18 years old. I just graduated from Winston Churchill High School. Starting this fall, I will be entering the biomedical sciences program at the University of Calgary. This is now my third year of iGEM. I joined iGEM to gain more experience in the lab, and to venture more into the world of biology. But I have also found myself working on human practices, and coding the wiki which has been very enjoyable! I hope to continue my experiences in iGEM in post secondary as well! Besides iGEM, I love to read anything and everything to do with dystopia and Harry Potter and love to recreate pop songs on the piano!
Mina Akbary
Grade 11
Hi!!! My name is Mina Akbary-Zheng, I am sixteen years old and I am in grade 11 at Winston Churchill High School. I was excited to join iGEM for the first time because I loved the idea of creating something completely unique with people with similar interests to me. I love designing and coding on the wiki and learning new things about lab work and synthetic biology. I have not yet decided what I want to study in post secondary but iGEM has led me towards a path in engineering or computer science. Besides iGEM, I love dancing, listening to music (Jazz, La La Land or Hamilton) and annoying my parents while singing in the shower.

iGEM and the Jamboree
While being a part of the iGEM competition this year we have learnt responsibility, time management and prioritisation as well as an endless list of laboratory techniques that we will expand on and use as our career progresses.
With the hype of the Jamboree just a few short weeks away, we are spending every spare moment trying to finish our research and presentation. We are nervous yet excited about presenting to the science world and representing RMIT, Victoria. We have been ecstatic as we have the opportunity to travel across the world to Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the most prestige schools in science; and be apart of a world wide University competition. For some of us it is the first time flying and for all of us it a first time visiting the US.  We are sure to gain a lot of great experiences from the jamboree and are looking forward to meet other teams and students from across the globe.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#html5_-_-_TEXT.html,"ML is chosen to be the output of our auto-modeling module.
Generally speaking, MoDeL needs not to be conformed to any constraints set by SBML. However, since SBML is a widely used standard, it is better for MoDeL to share common concepts and components with SBML as many as possible. For example, MoDeL still uses rules, function definitions and unit definitions in SBML. By doing so, it will be easier for software tools to change formats between MoDeL and SBML.

Using C-N Model we can model systems with great complexity
The simplest example with only E.coli cell
introduction
As the simplest example, a model of a flask with only E.coli cells inside will be shown. Only one reaction will be considered: the replication of E.coli. However, it is not trivial. MoDeL enables users to add such an auto-catalytic replication reaction easily and conveniently. The minimal database used for this model could be download here.
database construction
We only provide key points regarded with construction of this minimal database. To add the auto-catalytic reaction in the Reaction container, a species with only part E.coli is required. It has the simplest Chain-Node model format: only one chain with one part and no trees. The auto-catalytic reaction has one modifier and one product and they are both referred to E.coli defined in Species container. Since they are compartment-type species (species representing a compartment), attribute itself of compartmentLabel node in modifiers and products definitions should be set the same with label of the compartment they represent in the compartments definition. It ensures that the product and the modifier are the same, avoiding wrong mismatch of the product which is different with the modifier. Since number of E.coli cells will reach a stable level in a long time course, we use <math>k_{g}(1-C_{E.coli}/C_{max})C_{E.coli}V_{Flask}</math> as the reaction rate, where <math>k_{g}</math> is the growth rate of E.coli, <math>V_{Flask}</math> represents the size of E.coli, and <math>C_{E.coli}</math> and <math> C_{max}</math> are concentration of E.coli and its max concentration in the flask, respectively. The negative sign in the rate equation indicates self-repression of E.coli cells.

He suggested we could use a tube with a preservative in its lid that is only released upon closing the tube. The tube could then be sent out via post to an individual to provide a saliva or urine sample, and could be posted back to a centralized lab for processing. For blood, there would be localized centers for tests (or just GP centers) and one main processing lab.
He also recommended using a multiplexing assay to detect multiple different miRNAs simultaneously from the same sample. However, at the time we had only designed one series of switches which would be activated by homologs. For a multiplexing assay, cross-hybridization levels need to be minimal - so we knew we had to think about new ways to design our switches. Our second series of switches, designed after talking with iGEM EPFL, were designed to solve this problem.
Professor Lovat’s team at UCL also helped us choose the best pieces of equipment for miRNA extraction which helped us with our cost analysis . We also discussed carrying out miRNA extractions in the field with them, as well as automation of the miRNA extraction protocol.
Sensitivity and Specificity
Professor Lovat and Dr Desai were concerned about the specificity and sensitivity of our test, and how it would be used for screening.
There are two types of sensitivity and specificity:
In terms of the toehold switch, sensitivity is the lowest number of miRNAs that can be detected and specificity is whether only the target miRNA can activate the switch. The feedback of doctors prompted us to seek out the advice of iGEM EPFL, to create the second generation switches with massively superior specificity.
In terms of a screening tool, sensitivity relates to the false negative rate, while specificity relates to the false positive rate.
A 100% sensitive test will always pick up the disease but may also pick up patients that do not have the disease (no false negatives).
A 100% specific test will never pick up healthy patients but may also miss patients that do have the disease (no false positives).
High Sensitivity
Few false negatives

Low Specificity

A highly sensitive test will have few false negatives but lots of false positives. Switch to high specificity .

Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
In order to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with"

Emily's first experience with cloning! Ashlee led Emily through several practice experiments from designs made earlier in the year: making a gel, loading samples, gel purifying DNA. Ashlee introduced Emily to her research the previous semester. She had inserted the HMF-ABCDE pathway on the pSEVA251 KanR plasmid into P. putida and had validated its function, but was having difficulty inserting the dCas9 system into the pSEVA251 KanR HMF-ABCDE plasmid. The plasmid size would be close to 18 kb and this, among other affects, was thought to increase the difficulty of the cloning. Another hypothesis was that the dCas9 pathway did not have a strong terminator for the trans-acting RNA. Ashlee and Emily began work to insert the terminator. They performed a ligation of the pSEVA251/HMF plasmid and the terminator.
Clay and Sam worked on a program in Excel to codon optimize GFPs. Sucess. Unfortunately, program is clunky and requires a lot of user input for any optimization. Decision made to attempt the same task in MATLAB.

Ashlee and Emily finished the ligation, transformed the ligation into DH10B electrocompetent Escherichia coli cells using electroporation, incubated at 37 degrees C for 1 hour, and plated on Kanamycin plates.

Freiburg_Bioware,2010,Team:Freiburg Bioware#Project#insertion of motifs into surface-exposed loops_-_-_TEXT.html,"NTA affinity chromatography. This purification method was tested using the cell culture lysate of transfected AAV-293 cells that were either grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS or in the serum-free GIBCO® FreeStyle™ 293 Expression Medium (Invitrogen). The usage of serum-free media is a technological modification meant to facilitate the production of pure viral vectors. Purified viral vectors are important for several applications such as animal models and biophysical characterizations. On the other hand, the elution of the His-tagged viral vectors allows also enrichment of transgene viral vectors. In order to answer the question if and to what degree viral vectors are transferred into the media, the cells were centrifugated, then divided into the pellet fraction and the supernatant. Physical cell lysis was performed for both fractions of the two produced batches (serum-free and FCS media) by performing four cycles of freeze and thaw.
 
Experimental setup for the purification of His-tag presenting viral particles produced by AAV-293 cells in DMEM or the protein- and animal-free Freestyle medium. Purified viral particles can be detected by ELISA using an anti-poly-Histidine antibody or qPCR for encapsidated vector plasmids, respectively
 
Material and Methods:
Transfection of the AAV-293 producer cells was performed in five 10 cm petri dishes with 3.6x10^6 cells, resulting in a confluency of about 70-80% according to the standard protocol either with cells grown in GIBCO® FreeStyle™ 293 Expression Medium (Invitrogen, protein- and animal-origin free) or in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS (PAA). For transfection, the composite parts pCMV_VP123(587-His) and RepVP123(587-KO)_p5-TATA-less were used in an 1:1 ratio together with pHelper and [AAV2]-left-ITR_pCMV_betaglobin_mVenus_hGH_[AAV2]-right-ITR. Cells were spun down at 200 x g for five minutes and the samples were divided into the pellet and the supernatant fractions. Physical cell lysis was performed by four cycles of freeze and thaw for all four samples. The cell lysate / supernatant fractions were incubated with 800 µl of His-Affinity Gel (kindly provided by Zymo Resear    ch, USA) at 4 °C for 18 hours with 200 rpm constant"

IIT_Delhi,2015,Team:IIT Delhi#team6_-_-_TEXT.html," come up with a strain of engineered bacteria (using Synthetic Biology) which converts harmful components of an exhaust gases coming out of chimneys of various industries and car exhausts into harmless by-products. And as a matter of fact, we have been successful in achieving this far. However, we have given a parallel thought about improving the efficiency and durability of the bacteria and also about including further gases with harmful consequences to be reduced as well.
Secondly, we are aiming to build a working prototype using innovative techniques of mechanical and chemical engineering, thus giving an inter-disciplinary dimension to our project.
The reactor which we are designing can be used on a multi-purpose basis like :
Diesel Generator
Car Engine
Industrial Purposes
This done, all that remains is to incorporate our genetically engineered bacteria into the prototype which will give the final touch to our project and allow us to offer the world with a unique solution to address air pollution!

PCR Amplification of gBlocks Using New Primers
***Refer to the Master Table for detailing gBlock-primer combinations for both preparation for the gene sequences’ eventual transformation into pSB1C3 shipping vector as well as pBAD33 or pBAD/HisB expression vector.
Primer naming and explantion can be found here.
With reference to the Master Table , standard PCR reaction mixtures (1uL 1ng/uL DNA template, 1.25uL 10uM forward primer, 1.25uL 10uM reverse primer, 9uL Milli-Q water, 12.5uL Q5 Master Mix) was set up for A*-F*, H*, I*, K*-N*, A#-E#, K#, N#, L#, H#, M#, O#, and P#.
G* and J* were not run because we already potentially have viable BioBricks for them from the plasmid extraction done earlier today (24/06 PCR batch).
DspB-containing setups J#, I#, F#, G# were not run because DspB has a BspHI restriction site in the middle of its sequence. The DspB-containing gBlocks will first be QuickChange-PCRed as an insert in the shipping vector to remove the restriction site by introducing a point mutation to codon-swap before being redigested out of the shipping vector and ligated into the expression vector.
Some compromises had to be made in terms of annealing temperature as there were only 2 PCR machines available and hence only 4 different programs could be run in parallel. The annealing temperatures were set up as below:

Step 2: Isolate both miniA1 and miniA2 (see Figure 4) fragment sequences from C. thermocellum's scaffoldin CipA gene
Step 3: Combine miniA1 and miniA2 by means of a single sac1 restriction site
Step 4: Isolate the coding sequence for the type one cohesin region, CtCoh1, from C. thermocellum's genome
Step 1
Our team addressed the S-layer binding module issue by hybridizing the type 2 cohesin of C. thermocellum with the LPP-OmpA, BBa_K103006 , part previously submitted to the parts registry by the 2008 Warsaw iGEM team. The LPP-OmpA part is a transmembrane protein with an extracellular amino acid string that allowed us to attach the type 2 cohesin of Clostridium's sdbA anchoring module without affecting the protein's structure or functionality. With LPP-OmpA acting as the new anchoring module, the cellulosome should successfully bind to the cell surface. Unfortunately the final transformation of this part failed and the team was unable to submit this part; however, it is documented in the Registry as BBa_K877001 .
Figure 3 - A diagram of our MiniA part ( BBa_K877000 ) and LPP-OmpA/coh2 part ( BBa_K877001 )
Steps 2 and 3
To address the difficult size of the cipA cellulosome gene, the team developed an abbreviated version of the cellulosome scaffoldin by removing from the coding domain six of the nine cohesion regions as well as the cellulose binding domain. The second fragment termed miniA2 codes for the last two cohesin modules and a signaling peptide for exocytosis. The miniA1 fragment begins with the iGEM standard prefix and ends with a blunt restriction site, sac1, while the miniA2 fragment begins with sac1 and ends with the standard iGEM suffix. Figure 4 depicts the portions of the scaffolding protein that were termed miniA1 and miniA2.

Background
Tetracyclines are a class of antibiotics produced by Actinomycetes with broad spectrum and high efficiency. In 1948, Dr Benjamin Minge Duggar extracted the first tetracycline antibiotic—chlortetracycline from streptomycin. In the following several years, Oxytetracycline and tetracycline were also isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces. These antibiotics belong to tetracycline antibiotics, and all of them have similar antibacterial spectrum. Because of its broad spectrum, high quality and low cost, tetracyclines have been widely used  in livestock and poultry industry with the largest production and clinical usage. Low doses of tetracyclines can be used as growth promoters in livestock and poultry, while high doses can treat diseases. [1]
With increasingly realizing the importance of Tetracyclines in agricultural production and disease treatment., people are gradually aware of the existence of antibiotic abuse. The survey showed that the total amount of tetracyclines used for therapeutic purposes in the European Union in 1997 was about 2,294 tons, while the consumption of tetracyclines in the United States increased from 3,000 tons to 3,200 tons in 2000-2001. The adverse impacts of antibiotic abuse on the ecological environment and public health are becoming obvious and acute, making antibiotic pollution become a hot environmental issue of universal concern. [2]
In the process of antibiotic abuse, antibiotics enter our ecological environment through a variety of ways, they can be transported to surface water and leached to groundwater. In Canada, the residual concentration of tetracycline in groundwater was 400 ng/L, while that in surface water was 32 ng/L. In the United States, the average concentrations of tetracycline, oxytetracycline and aureomycin in surface water were 0.11"

Nutrient Secretion and Utilization
PowerCell is the generator that will power all of the BioTools in a Martian settlement. PowerCell will secrete nutrients for use by other biological tools a source of energy and raw materials to construct useful products.
Like any other tools, biological tools need energy to run and raw materials to work with. The two major nutrient sources needed for biological tools are carbon sources (sugars) and nitrogenous nutrients (ammonia). In a Martian settlement, PowerCell will harness the energy of the sun to harvest these nutrients directly from the  atmosphere and provide them to the settlement's biological tools.
This summer, we tackled only the half involving sugar secretion. This was partially to due to the time constraints of a summer project, and partially because there is evidence that ammonia secretion occurs in cyanobacteria by means of passive diffusion without the need for genetic tinkering ( Ammonia translocation in cyanobacteria ). More research needs to be done to determine if this level of diffusion is sufficient to sustain other biological tools. In any case, we designed our system on a platform (Anabaena 7120) with the capability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, so that this avenue is open for exploration in the future.

Figure 2. A representation of EPO based gene doping. Viral vectors infect kidney cells, increasing their production of EPO. The increased concentration of EPO in the blood leads to an increased production of red blood cells. The endogenous production of EPO is inversely related to the red blood cell count.
Vectors in Gene Doping
A vector is a DNA molecule used as a vehicle to carry foreign genetic material into another cell. Once, there it can be expressed and replicated. The effect and detection of gene doping is highly dependent on the vectors that are being used. In the early stages of our project we spoke with Prof. Hidde Haisma from Groningen University, a gene doping expert, who told us the main vectors he would expect athletes to use. He suspect that the most common vectors are plasmids and adenoviruses, because of their relative safety compared to vectors that integrate the DNA into the genome of the cell. Integrating vectors, such as the retrovirus, present the threat of insertional mutagenesis which can lead to the development of cancer. Table 1 shows our analysis of possible gene doping vectors and some of their properties based on the work of Ratko et al. 2003 .

Cambridge,2009,Team:Cambridge#Project#Carotenoids#PR_-_-_TEXT.html,": D90087.2).
During our preliminary research, we have encountered a few issues:
In part K152005, the “CrtE” sequence (which originated from part K152001) contains 3 nucleotides different from the NCBI data base.
Originally, the registry annotation for K152005 indicated that there was no ribosome binding site before gene CrtI (i.e. “…rbs+CrtB+CrtI+rbs+CrtY…”). After clarification with Team Guelph 08, we were told that it was an error in annotation. The registry entry for K152005 has since been updated to include the ribosome binding site.
Teams of previous years constructed various composite parts containing two or more enzymes of the synthetic pathways (e.g. CrtEBI, CrtEBIY), but they are not available on the 2009 Distribution Plates.

Plasmid Extraction using miniprep kit ( 1.7 )
Sequences G [pSB-1C3] and J [pSB-1C3] were extracted from overnight cultures of E. coli DH5𝛼 using E.Z.N.A. Plasmid DNA Mini Kit I.
refer to pages 10-12 for Mini Kit protocol. Some special notes:
All optional steps were carried out except equilibration step.
After centrifugation in step 2, the tubes were pulsed before the excess supernatant was removed through pipetting.
After addition of solution I/RNAse, vortexing/vigorous shaking of the tubes should be avoided to prevent shearing of nucleus and undesirable accidental extraction of chromosomal DNA.
After addition of solution I/RNAse, resuspension of pellet can be done by dragging the tube along an eppendorf rack.
Steps 6 and 7 (involving solutions II and III need to be carried out in quick succession (adhering to the short incubation time) to ensure good results. It is advisable to do these two steps in pairs as in step 6 the tubes need to be tightly capped once solution II is added.
After addition of solution II, the waiting time before proceeding to the next step should not be more than 5 minutes.
The precipitate formed in following addition of solution III does not pellet well after centrifugation in step 8, and hence the suspension needs to be removed immediately to prevent resuspension.
The inversion in step 6 needs to be done gently so that genomic DNA of the bacteria are not extracted along with the desired plasmid DNA.
50µL of elution buffer per tube was used at the end because plasmid DNA is being eluted.

INSA_Toulouse,2013,Team:INSA Toulouse#contenu#lab practice#results#logic gates_-_-_TEXT.html," one which are working well. Our results show that the best solution for in vivo characterization of these gates would be to integrate them on the chromosomal DNA. Our in vivo results are stochastic; probably because of the plasmid copy number that can vary in the cell while, in vitro, it is difficult to conclude with negative results, because of non ideal experimental conditions that can be specific for each recombinase. We started the construction of a designed strain for integration of our four logic gates, but, because of lack of time, we preferred to concentrate on the in vitro characterizations. The gates can now be implemented for other purposes. Specifically, the logic gates switches can be seen as an elegant way to detect some events that occurred only once in a cell. If the output of this event is the production of a recombinase, the switch will occur in the cells where the event took place and the red colonies (if the RFP is used as an output) represent the population in which the gates switched the gates, or more simply said, where the event took place. As the switch is permanent, it will be genetically transmitted to the offspring of the mother cell. Hence, in this system, many events, not necessarily occurring at the same time, can be followed. The logic gates can then serve as events detectors with logical operations. For example: if we need to detect two events that have occurred within the cell (and not necessarily at the same time), this is typically an AND gate.

HUST-China,2015,Team:HUST-China#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," our project and presented it to Prof. Zheng. We intend to use the marine yeast as our chassis, which has survival advantages in marine environment. We hope to improve its survivability in special marine environment and use surface display technology to attach the yeast to the sand, which can solve the inefficiency caused by stream. It will not only enlarge the application area of yeast, but also improve the solidification capacity. Moreover, as the growing resource consumption and pollution are causing more and more environmental problems, scientists are seeking solutions in the light of biological science to accomplish the task of energy conservation and environmental protection. Our project is going to make an attempt by using environmental friendly adhesives technology, which will bring much less pollution to the environment.
After listening to our presentation, Prof. Zheng praised our idea and creativity. He said that although it was the first time that he heard about synthetic biology, he believed that it would be exciting to turn the idea into reality. Interdisciplinary studies are more and more necessary for scientific progress now. Prof. Zheng told us that in the field of civil engineering, the existing chemical and physical technologies have grown quite mature and complete, but there are still bottlenecks in its development and further breakthroughs require inspiration and methods from the study of other disciplines, for which he is also seeking cooperation with professors from other disciplines. “Synthetic biology might be THE WAY to break through.” he said.
Prof. Zheng also told us that microbial silt reinforcement technology still requires further developement. So far, there are room for improvement in terms of some physicochemical properties of the product, such as its resistance to pressure. Therefore, it is necessary to prove that our product is superior to existing technologies by conducting soil property experiment. Prof. Zheng suggested that we can perform experiment with small particles sand material, because the biodegradable adhesive we are going to use is flocculation protein, and over huge particles may counteract its solidification effect.
Suggestions
In addition, Prof. Zheng expressed his concern on the safety issue. He pointed out that if our project is applied in an open environment, necessary measures, such as fencing the area, must be taken to make sure that the diffusion of the engineering strain is under control; otherwise the diffused strain may cause the solidification of seabed soil, which will affect the survival of marine plants and animals. The safety issues were always the topic that we attached great importance to, so we began to discuss how to regulate the expanding of the strain colony. During discussion, we came up with the idea of experimenting with auxotrophic marine yeasts, whose diffusion can be regulated by"

Proof of Concept
To determine the potential of our parts to improve microbial electrolysis, we first performed in vivo tests for the ability of PR+blh to lower pH and of Nox to reduce oxygen levels.  
The pH of liquid cultures of cells containing the K2182002 was compared in dark and light conditions, and with and without B-carotene needed for PR function. The pH of cells grown with both light and B-carotene rose more slowly than other cultures, suggesting that the plasmid could be used to moderate the alkalinity of an MEC cathode and provide protons for hydrogen production. This is in agreement with previous characterization performed by UNITN-Trento 2015.
The dissolved oxygen concentration of liquid cultures of E. coli BL21 was compared for wild type cells and those transformed with nox plasmid K3282003. The presence of the nox plasmid lowered the dissolved oxygen concentration over time in cultures with the same number of cells exposed to air.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"egrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant"

Our project is to develop a new treatment for type 1 diabetes using a genetically engineered probiotic bacteria, which means that to this project became a real product someday, it would have to go under several safety assessments and approved to be used in humans. Over this year, as we worked in our project, we were always worried about the legal requirements for a GMO like ours become a real product and how biosafety laws affect and guide the development of new GMOs. This document was very useful to us to research and understand the laws of our country, and also other countries, the steps that we would have to take if we wanted our project to became a product. It was also very important to know the laws of other countries and see how GMOs are seen around the world.

Our team is working on creating E.coli that can fix nitrogen. As our future vision, we are thinking of commercializing those GMMs by putting nitrogen-fixing GMMs into capsule. By taking this GMMs, we can help babies under 1000 days suffer from malnutrition comes from low intake of proteins. So, this GMM Legislation Doc will help us when thinking how we can actually commercialize.
Chile
As a team, we have realised that in comparison with other countries, ours stands out due to the lack of regulations for GMO and GMM. This situation, harm us as researchers, scientists and community, in two ways. Firstly, working with GMM might be dangerous as no safety guidelines have been established. Secondly, no research is done. Both options result in a danger to society, the lack of biosafety, and a delay in scientific research for biotechnology.
According to this analysis, we have thought of introducing a debate into the community about the implementation of regulations for GMM. We have also considered suggesting the creation of protocols and laws for the GMO and GMM to the institutions in charge of the GMO regulations, such as Agricultural and Livestock Service and Environment Ministry. This could imply an increase in area-related startups, along with scientific advancement and a more informed and conscious society about biotechnology in general.

ITB's iGEM Project or Dewaruci is tackling the environment issue specifically the microplastic. We are designing a bacteria that could degrade micro-plastic on the open ocean. It means that we are going to release the GMO's to the environment. This document possibly could provide the regulation information for the future worldwide implementation of our project which may lead to more innovation and development of the project itself.
