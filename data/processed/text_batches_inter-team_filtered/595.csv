WHU-China,2012,Team:WHU-China#Notebooks_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEM team), but not the living Salmonella enterica was manipulated in the lab, and the genes from it are homogeneous of E. coli K.12, not associated with pathogenesis. We will not implement our future experimental plan with microorganisms of risk group 2 or vertebrates in our current lab, for too low is the biosafety level and no animal facilities.
To manipulate microorganisms, an ultra clean cabinet is used and strict aseptic technique is followed. All experimenters have been trained on foundation microbiology technique and biosafety. All microorganism contacting vessels are sterilized before and after experiments in appropriate protocols. Also, all microorganism materials will be sterilized before discarded. In this way, we believe that no public or environmental harm will be caused by the experimental organisms. In addition, no one in our team will be hurt by the experimental organisms.
The genetic modifications we make will change metabolism of bacteria. However, there is no evidence both theoretically and experimentally that these modifications will improve the pathogenicity of the bacteria or cause damage to environment even taking the risk of horizontal gene transfer into consideration. The effects of expressing gene adrA regarding infectivity and pathogenicity on E. coli is not clear now, but it still can be easily controlled in the lab environment without human ingestion. Also, we will insert a death device into the bacteria cell when we construct the whole system (still far from now) to avoid the proliferation out of control. For more information about gene safety, please read the next section and documents of our relevant parts on registry.
We have considered the potential harmful chemicals and equipments, as listed below:
Basic molecular experiments: NaOH, HCl, SDS, acrylamide, TEMED, ethanol, IPTG, liquid nitrogen, β-mercaptoethanol, xylene cyanol FF.
Bacteria culture: ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol.
Chemical analysis and measurements: acetone, cupric acetate, Sudan III, Congo red, Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250.
Equipments: UV lamp, supercentrifuge, heating equipments (alcohol burner, PCR amplifier, water bath, dry bath), electrophoresis apparatus, -80℃ refrigerator, ultrasonic cell disruptor.
All of these are regular reagents and apparatus in a molecular biology laboratory. The risks of them come from inflammability, explosibility, irritation, corrosivity, toxicity, carcinogenicity and physical injury. But none of them raises special safety issue, with chemical hood"

I'm a Year 2 student studying Biochemistry as my major with Statistics and Computer science as my two minors. You may wonder why I study such a combination of subjects. The reason is that I think a good scientist should have the ability to see the nature behind large amounts of data and explain a phenomenon quantitatively and precisely, therefore I try to get myself armed with the knowledge of Statistics and Computer science. In our HKU iGEM team, I mainly work as one of the seven principal investigators to connect theory to practice. It's really fun to spend time in lab day and night seeking for the secrets of synthetic biology. And it is iGEM competition that lets me enjoy the joys of teamwork and learn to overcome hardships in research.
Hui Wai Wai, Nadia
I am a sophomore accounting and finance major in the business school with a minor in biochemistry. You might wonder why a business student would be interested in pure science research work and how I can be of help. What fascinate me are the boundless possibilities that exist in genetic engineering, and how iGEM makes it possible to gather brilliant ideas from all around the globe. Indeed, it takes me some efforts to catch up with the lab techniques. But with the support from my team members, everything is so much easier. I have to express my gratitude to the team leaders that trusted my ability and I am proud to be part of the team. With everyone’s efforts, our research is progressing well, and we will work together to make our idea of suicide gene possible. May I wish iGEM 2010 a success.

I am Cindy, one of the principal investigators of the team this year; I also work on the wiki& art as a novice :P. Joining the iGEM team as a year III chemistry student is quite a big decision for me. Biochemistry, despite its verbal relation to chemistry, is a novel subject to me. Decided to make the best of my final year in the university, I explore more in other aspects other than my own major- engaging in this project and doing psychology are two of them. I am certain that devotion to the project would be an thought-provoking experience.

TJU,2015,Team:TJU#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the lactate-based growth rate was much higher as well.[2] Thus, lactate is the most suitable carbon source and also the key mediator for the material flow in our system.
Figure 3. Our design of broadening the spectrum of carbon sources for MFCs based on Shewanella. Through it, we will presents the prospect of its expanding application range.
In order to develop a proper mechanism for lactate supply, we use Escherichia coli, a well characterized bacterium, to produce lactate. Previously, researchers has developed a system that was able to produce 142.2 g/L of L-lactate with no more than 1.2 g/L of by-products accumulated by knocking out ldhA and lldD and inserting L-LDH.[3] Consequently, E.coli has many advantages as a host for production of lactic acid, including the ability to produce optically pure lactate, rapid growth under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and its simple nutritional requirements.[4]
Escherichia coli grows fermentatively in glucose-containing medium under anaerobic condition with formation of a mixture of organic acids (lactate, acetate, formate and succinate) and ethanol, and lactate only takes no more than 50% of the total metabolites.[4] Since we need to provide enough material support for the growth and metabolism of Shewanella under anaerobic condition, we decided to enhance the yield of lactate by genetic engineering through two strategies:
1.1  ldh- Lactate dehydrogenase(LDHE)
LDH is an enzyme found in nearly all living cells (animals, plants, and prokaryotes), which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate with NADH serving as the coenzyme. Naturally, E.coli can produce D-lactate by itself but the amount and the activity of lactate dehydrogenase becomes the bottleneck. We found that those two factors of enzyme are hard to change dramatically in vivo. So in our project, we intend to introduce high-yield exogenous L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhA) from Lactobacillus, which can convert the redundant pyruvate and subsequently provide even more sustenance for Shewanella. Similar metabolic pathway has been found in a variety of organisms, to distinguish the differences, we renamed the heterogenous L-lactate dehydrogenase gene ldhE while homogenous one keeps original ldhA.

STANDARD JOURNAL
Thursday 23rd June - Told last night after going to see X-men that we need to have a poster completed and ready for use by friday. Spent the day writing poster drafts and designing the layout, as well as attempting to copy the logo we designed onto the computer. We also updated the Wiki and gave it a new navigation bar, and looked into flight and hotel prices for Amsterdam!
Friday 24th June - Spent the day preparing for a brief presentation to the staff of the JIC so that we could prove we've actually done something! Researched more deeply into possible methods of ensuring light production only in the dark. We decided finally on three model organisms, Moss, Algae and E. coli, and divided the team into three sub-teams to work semi-independently on each project.
Monday 27th June - Today, we spent the morning researching moss and received our sample of algae in a nappy! A slideshow of photos was embedded onto the home page of the wiki and then we had lunch. After lunch we carried out transformations with 5 different biobricks, where the details can be viewed in the lab journal.
Friday 1st July - In the morning we ran a gel of our Miniprep of the BBA_M30109 transformed E.coli cells. The Gel showed that we had indeed successfully isolated the plasmid from our cells, and so in the evening (LATE into the evening) we ran  PCR protocol to try and amplify the specific gene we wanted from the pl"

SAFETY & PROTOCOLS
After identifying public awareness as an effective catalyst for change, we thought about how we might raise public awareness. Who would our target audience be? How would we communicate our message? We were particularly inspired by Greg Neimeyer’s Black Cloud initiative and identified high school students as viable candidates and a lesson plan as a feasible medium.  Our motivation for developing a lesson plan to be used in conjunction with our biosensor was two-fold:
to engage students in STEM by demonstrating that biology and chemistry have real world applications
and to raise awareness and accountability around chemical use by enlisting the help of students to use our device to monitor environmental levels of triclosan.
To aid us in our development of a lesson plan, we reached out to Community Resources for Science (CRS), an organization that works with scientists to bring their work into the classroom and engage students in hands on, inquiry based learning experiences.
Sasha Stackhouse and Morgan Seag at CRS provided valuable feedback on how to present our project more clearly and how to fit our lesson plan to next generation science standards. Once we got the approval that our lesson plan met their standards, CRS connected us with their network of teachers in Davis.
While we are excited to share our project/message with schools in the area, delivering the instructions ourselves somewhat limits our scope. Ultimately we want to reach students around the nation. To better understand how we could refine our lesson plan to allow for wider distribution, we spoke with Ann Moriarty, an AP Biology/biotechnology teacher at Davis Senior High School.
Ms. Moriarty has a background in research herself and propounds the value of hands on activities in engaging students. In her classroom, for example, students develop an appreciation for biotechnology through running protein assays and performing gel electrophoresis to verify that their restriction enzymes cut the plasmid in the right location.
Ms. Morariaty provided valuable insight on the considerations that go into developing a lesson plan- the most salient being the constraints imposed by lack of funding and teaching to a curriculum.
The first obstacle is funding. The school budget is variable, teachers fill out a petition, and the process can take as long as a year.   This piece of insight further emphasized our need to drive the cost of our assay down.   For example, in the first iteration of the lesson plan, the activity involved taking a field trip out to a local body of water where students would collect a sample for measurement. Ms. Moriarty"

But on a positive note synthesis from DNA 2.0 arrived, and preliminary results using CHBT combined with D-cysteine showed significant light output implying that functional LRE should allow recycling of oxyluciferin.

Fusion Protein GFP Expression
Though we were unable to successfully clone the testing constructs listed here , we tested the single transcriptional units with GFP and YFP fusion proteins to check whether there was any protein expression at all. It was hypothesized that because the two heavy gene sequences in a fusion protein are very close to each other, GFP expression wouldn't be as high as it would in a single GFP control. The hypothesis was accepted based on the results on Figure 7. However, it should be noted that the fluorescence for both tetR+GFP and araC+GFP is not greatly different from that for just GFP. This cannot be used to conclude whether the fusion proteins affect regulator function. For that, we will need to test the testing constructs designed. We should be able to present that data at the Jamboree.

WashU_StLouis,2014,Team:WashU StLouis#Project#light_-_-_TEXT.html," of regulating gene expression via proteins, having to worry about different concentration levels, potential cross effects, etc., regulation via light can be easily tested for and manipulated as well. Therefore, we propose to design a hybrid inducible light-sensitive promoter for heterologous regulation of the nif cluster in E. coli.
Approach
We created a 4 piece assembly plasmid integrating light regulation components from pJT122, but swapping out cph8 (for EYFP from pSL2264) and lacZ (for TetR from pTet-PP*) and combined them into a plasmid PBJ003 which should repress expression of EYFP when induced by light. We used these plasmids because they were easily available in the Moon Lab at Washington University in St. Louis, and we didn't need to get them from other labs or the registry. PBJ003 contains the basic cpcG2 promoter driving tetR production. When induced by light, the TetR generated will bind to the tet promoter which should repress eyfp production. We also created a hybrid promoter to swap out for the basic cpcG2 promoter. Both these parts are on the registry under BBa_K1385000 and BBa_K1385001 .
Hybrid promoters that integrate the regulatory elements from several sources have been shown to be functional with varying levels of success [3]. Operator sites for the green-light sensitive PcpcG2 promoter are well known [4], additionally, the hybrid trc1O promoter has been shown to be highly expressed in E. coli even without IPTG [5]. The trc1O promoter has one lac operator site and is thus easier to induce than the more tightly repressed trc2O that contains two repressor binding operator sites.
In order for PcpcG2 to function as a light-sensitive promoter, a histidine kinase CcaS and response regulator CcaR will be required. Upon exposure to green light, CcaS is auto-phosphorylated and then phosphorylates CcaR. This changes the DNA binding affinity to CcaR allowing CcaR to bind to PcpcG2 and activate transcription. This could be obtained by creating our own plasmids with these genes (already done). Our hybrid promoter could be cloned into a vector that contains a fluorescent reporter protein EYFP driven by pTet. Our eventual goals would be to regulate the nif cluster once we properly characterize the system.
A few factors have been taken into consideration for the design of the hybrid promoters. The consensus sequence known as the “G-box”,"

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," start developing a business plan by considering four essential factors that make or break a new business as proposed by (Sahlman, 2008). Here is an example of analysis that focuses               on four interrelated factors critical to new businesses:
1. People: Initiators of business and external parties with key services and resources (suppliers, experts, lawyers, accountants, etc.). Execution skills and quality of people count more to realizing a business                 than the business idea.
Key points:
a. How familiar are team members with industry players and dynamics.
b. How well known is the team and it’s people within the network, what reputation does it have?
c. Quality, knowledge and experience of team members.
2. Opportunity: Product/Service sold, customers, growth/diffusion curves, barriers towards success.
Key points:
a. Is the market that the project targets large and fast growing enough?
b. Can market share be easily obtained (new, emerging market) or is a fight needed with entrenched competitors (mature/stagnant market)?
c. How is the product sold (pricing scheme), to whom, why is it compelling for the customer to buy it? How expensive is it to acquire and retain a customer - access to customers is easy?
d. How much capital equipment and assets are needed to support setting up business and sales.
e. What’s the competition in the market? What are their strengths, weaknesses, resources? How would they respond to our technology? Can alliances be formed?
3. Context: regulatory environment, demographic trends, other uncontrollable and variable factors.
Key points:
a. Is there a favorable regulatory and macroeconomic landscape?
b. Are there growing trends that encourage products and services in the industry?
4. Risk and Reward: Assessing what can go right and wrong and how the entrepreneurial team respond.
Key points:
a. What risks are there and what measures can be proposed to diminish them?
b. Can a deal with investors be simple, fair and emphasize trust rather than legal ties?
c. Can the business be seen as an adaptable series of experiments that are open to change? Can experiments be made to test feasibility?
Enabling or hindering elements of a business. To consider both internal and external factors that can block or help an emerging business, a SWOT (Humphrey, 2005) analysis can be made. A Strength-Weakness-Opportunity-Threat               (SWOT) is only one method of many, to evaluate these factors.

METU_Turkey_Software,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software_-_-_TEXT.html," the main graph has been presented on the right     hand side of the diagram. These features classify our graphs as disconnected     graphs [1].
Fig. 3: A zoomed in screenshot showing two sub-graphs within     the disconnected graph.
""Semi-Simplicity""
A simple graph is a graph in which no more than one edge contains     the same set of nodes. So, in a simple graph it is not possible to find     more than one edge with the same source and the same target. Additionally,     an edge with the same source and target, forming a loop is not allowed.     But, in synthetic biology it is possible to construct a device consisting     of devices or bio bricks of the same species or type. Accordingly, our     graphs are simple graphs with an exception of possible self-containing     loops, where the edge starts from and ends on the same node. Our graphs     have an exception of having loops and due to this permitted flexibility     our graphs are ""semi-simple"".

In order to develop BioGuide algorithm, there was a need to      reorganize and normalize parts information database in partsregistry.org.      Information of the parts was processed and developed from partsregistry.org      which includes the PartID, PartName, RFC values, etc , designer      and contact information and parameters to build a standardized template      for our algorithm to run smoothly.
Database standardization is done by analyzing iGEM Spring 2010      distribution and collecting information needed for the standardized      parts. Also new parameters are assigned according to parts input-output      model like : Inducer, Activator, Repressor, Inhibitor
For each promoter we have assigned their inducers or repressors      as input and for protein generator parts we have assigned generated      proteins as output which maybe activator or repressor of other devices.
iGEM devices are depicted in pictorial forms called flowcharts,      encapsulation of implementations , decision branching and direction      are milestones of our algorithm. Following flowcharts are the high      level representations of our algorithms developed for the BioGuide      software.
We run our algorithm on the real combination dataset in order      to build our input/output relations graphs. We also collected the      subpart assembly order, such as 1st: promoter, 2nd:rbs, 3rd:coding      seq, any internal parts and the Last: terminator. Each specific      Biobrick type has been assigned a number as a unique image ID from      1 to "
Duke,2017,Team:Duke#HP#Silver#Social_-_-_TEXT.html,"5]. This can help to perpetuate the cycle of infection to children and thus repeats.
How can testing help?
A rapid diagnostic test is far from a comprehensive multidimensional intervention, but it does more than one may think. With rapid diagnostic testing, we may not be able to help early marriage statistics, except to encourage safe sex if one or both of the partners are infected with HIV. That outcome is wishful thinking. However, preventing HIV transmission through widow inheritance is becoming practice in some places [5]. If traditional health practitioners had access to a cheap accurate rapid HIV diagnostic test, this kind of transmission could be mitigated. This in turn can help to lower the rate of those infected by preventing the spread of infection. It could also stabilize family dynamics by preventing couples from fighting about the “unknown” of HIV. Another exciting aspect of the diagnostic test is to prevent deaths of those already infected. Because HIV is only symptomatic in its final stages, inexpensive rapid diagnostic tests are especially necessary. By testing people, they can find care, or at least are more likely to be able to seek out care if it is available. This may help to reduce the number of “AIDS orphans” in Sub-Saharan Africa by keeping parents alive longer. It may also be effective in preventing infection from those who have concurrent sexual partners. It is not wishful to think that men would want their partners to be tested for HIV before engaging in sexual activities, thus reducing the number of those affected. Dr. Broverman detailed that wealthy, mobile men were at greater risk for spreading HIV. The key word here is wealthy, these men who use sex workers would theoretically be wealthy enough to afford the test and stop themselves from contracting the disease from concurrent partners. Another key aspect of the test is that it could be used as a crude tool of virus load detection to help people plan when they need to visit orthodox medical centers to change their drug cocktails. That kind of knowledge may also do something about the hopelessness surrounding the issue of HIV[5]. Dr. Broverman talked about people asking her if testing was even a good idea, because they felt that HIV was a death sentence and that it was better not to know. With knowledge comes power, and the rapid diagnostic test intended to be created is designed to empower people, especially women (who are more likely to get tested) to take control of their status.
Limitations
This does not fix everything, there is still a huge problem with the stigma surrounding HIV. In 1998 a woman was stoned to death in the region when it was discovered she had HIV. Less than twenty years later"

Presenting our project to others in the Research Program.
Thursday, 7/11: Today, in the morning, we met with Orit, who checked in on our progress for both the project and our presentation tomorrow. We received some great advice on how to improve our powerpoint, as well as some direction on where we now want to take our project. After lunch, I continued to work on what I started yesterday - getting the message to show up in the correct div. This, however, proved to be so much more difficult than I had originally imagined. What was supposed to be a quick fix quickly consumed my entire day as I struggled with this task. In the end, with some help from Diana, I was able to discover where the problem was, and start working my way towards fixing it. It was a long day, but after continued adamance that I was going to beat this pest, I eventually figured it out. Success!
Friday, 7/12: In the morning, Heather and I finished finalizing our presentation and then did a run-through with Consuelo. Having gone through the practice, we felt much more comfortable for the official talk at 12:30. Afterwards, we continued working on our project, and made a lot of progress! Heather had experimented with the idea of making the entire screen a canvas yesterday night, and today was able to perfect it. Meanwhile, I worked on some of the aesthetics of our project. Then, in the afternoon, the lab headed towards Old School Pizzeria for some dinner and fun!
Week 8: July 15 - July 19
Monday, 7/15: Today, I added an intro page to our website which explains what our project is and what our goals are. More importantly, I worked on writing a parsing method that would correctly remove all special characters, and all hashtags (#) and mentions (@) from the twitter message. This is because special characters are not part of the codon dictionary, and would thus throw an error. I also worked on the transitions since often the workspace would change without waiting for the translation process to complete itself. Then, at the end of the day, Heather and I talked about our poster design and wrote up the abstract and design/implementation process.

We had a meet-up in Trondheim with the iGEM team from the University of Oslo (UiOslo). During the                 meet-up we had a ""Mini Jamboree"" and held presentations for each other. Professor and previous iGEM                 judge Eivind Almaas was present to give feedback, and the teams gave feedback and comments to the                 presentation and project for each other. After the Mini Jamboree we had a lovely lunch together                 (see pictures) and sightseeing in our laboratory, at the university campus, and in Trondheim city.
Presentation rehearsal at ""mini-jamboree"" with the UiOslo iGEM team.
Lunch with the UiOslo iGEM team.
Improved characterization
Afterwards, we decided together that the UiOslo team could help our team by improving the                 characterization of our biobrick MP6 mutator. They used Escherichia coli TOP10, which is a different                 strain from the E. coli DH5α that we have been using. By using a different strain, we were able to obtain                 more data on the mutagenesis activity of the plasmid and check if the plasmid worked in another strain.
We sent our biobrick to Oslo, together with the guidelines on how to perform the experiment. First,                 the MP6 mutator plasmid was transformed into E. coli TOP10 together with the pLA230 control plasmid.                 After 16 hours incubation at 37 C, the transformed bacteria culture was split into two, and glucose                 (20 mM) was added in one culture flask while arabinose (20 mM) was added in the other one. The cultures                 were incubated at 37 C for 24 hours. The next day, 100 μL of the different cultures were plated on plates                 with LA, glucose and ampicillin (culture dilutions 10-0-10-3) and plates with only LA and glucose                 (culture concentrations 10-5-10-8). The plates were grown overnight. The resulting plates are shown                 in the picture below, and all results are also shown at Team UiOslo Norway"

Currently, I am working on the implementation of the algorithm as well as corresponding with a fellow undergraduate, Will DeLoache, about the modification of the algorithm to  include antibiotics.  Because of my lack of knowledge of biology, the inclusion of antibiotics was a problem I had not anticipated.  Basically, every subpart would have a specific antibiotic associated with it, and that antibiotic would determine what the resulting composite part's antibiotic would be. This introduction changes the optimization of the algorithm as a common subpart now has 6 different varieties (the 6 different combinations of antibiotics) associated with each.  To find the most optimal subpart for reuse the algorithm now has to take into account the antibiotic varieties of each common subpart. For example, if part ab is used 5 times in assembling a goal part, with three of those being ab/Antibiotic1 and Antibiotic2 the other 2 being ab/Antibiotic2 and Antibiotic3, then ab/Antibiotic1 and Antibiotic2 would be the optimal choice for reuse.
Next week, I will hopefully finish the implementation of both algorithms, and begin working on different forms of input and output for goal parts and resulting assembly sets.
Week Four: June 30th
This week the tool transformed from “Optimal Assembly” to “Algorithm Manager” as we realized it would be more useful if it were more flexible.   The tool still works with the two assembly algorithms we have written (WOAA and Optimal Assembly), but it can be extended to include algorithms that have nothing to do with assembly.  Extending it"

Maker's Faire
Our team participated at the Maker’s Faire at Port Jefferson on June 10th to interact with enthusiastic learners and students about biology with a specific focus on synthetic biology. We organized numerous activities and games by using three activities in the Building with Biology kit. These activities engaged people from the ages of 5 to adults. Even though these activities were fun, they were also educational. We engaged the parents and adults into discussions about taboo topics that are affiliated with synthetic biology, such as GMO products or genetic engineering. We found that even if they were hesitant to accept that synthetic biology can have a powerful impact on society they were willing to hear our side. With the kids, however, we tried to see what their opinions were on synthetic biology. For example, if one kid would be willing to eat a hamburger where the meat at was made in lab. They offered a new perspective because they have not yet been influenced too much on the pros and cons of synthetic biology. The Maker’s Faire was a very insightful experience for the whole team to spread awareness about a branch of science that is still relatively young and is packed with immense potential while receiving feedback from the community we service.

A handful of our team visited Harold D. Feyette Elementary School and Camp Avenue Elementary School to talk about science and synthetic biology with the students in different 2nd grade classrooms. Every classroom was filled with students that were so excited to have us come in teach them about our research and synthetic biology. We again used the Building with Biology kits, and it was a huge success. The students were amazed by the DNA necklace they made and how foods like meat can be made in a lab. After the last classroom activities finished in Camp Avenue, the students kept asking us questions about our project, bacteria, and synthetic biology’s importance, and it was very gratifying for our team to see so many young people interested in this new field of science. The students and the teacher enjoyed us being there so much so that Megan, Chloe, and Juliana were invited back by Principal Ronald Reinken to assist the 4th graders in cow eyes dissections. We would like to thank both principals for allowing us the opportunity to talk to their students and show them a tiny glimpse into"

Method 2
Protein Building Blocks
Protein building Blocks (with additional Streptavidin). The single building blocks contain N- and C-terminal catcher-tag elements with a streptavidin in the center of the protein. The catcher-tag system binds a permanent lock-key system to each other. The streptavidin unit can bind to the biotin functionalized azo dye to integrate the molecules into the polymer tissue.
Azo Dye
 
Molecular Machines (Azo dyes) can fulfill motion on a molecular length scale. The contraction of the dye is driven by light, which changes the conformation of the -N=N- bond from trans to cis. Implemented in high number in a tissue they can lead to contraction of the whole tissue. The invention of such small motors was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry in 2016.
Artificial Muscle
Muscle tissue with molecular machines can be obtained by combining biopolymeric tissue with an integrated streptavidin moiety. The streptavidin can bind a biotin functionalized azo dye leading to a further cross-linking. Via light-irradiation the azo dye molecules change their conformation and contract the tissue. Thermal or irradiation with a longer wavelength restores the position of the azo dye and the tissue relaxes to the original state.
Entrepreneurship
The work, which is and can be done by robots is continuously increasing as well as the number of steps where complex shaped matter has to be handled. For this purpose, soft robotics are essential to prevent damage from the material. Current materials for soft robotics are based on silicones and related polymeric materials. Combined with electrically conductive materials in alternating layers, they form dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs), which serve as muscle in robot arms.                 Silicones and elastic polymers can be counted to rather cost-efficient materials. However, considering the production of the material a high amount of electricity and chemical effort must be applied. This can be circumvented by a production from E. coli, where the organism produces a economically friendly biopolymer with the desired properties. The biosynthesis of the polymer building blocks, safes a significant amount of resources and energy.
The fabrication of the silicones to a device is carried out under elevated temperatures, where high accuracy at a micrometer scale is a crucial factor. This accuracy must also be maintained for the device made of biopolymer, which can be realized with modern 3D printers. Further, the 3D-printer is operating under"

The isothermal PCR kit from TwistDx has arrived. We are now preparing to i) individually test the isoPCR kit and the Blood PCR kit for efficacy with our mock pathogen, under standard conditions (i.e. isoPCR without blood ) and ii) test a hybrid PCR setup that utilizes both RPA (isoPCR) and the KAPA blood-compatible Taq in conjunction. Our experiments will use a mock-pathogen-contaminated blood sample - a mixture of blood and a liquid E. coli culture containing a known plasmid and gene.
Week 14: Aug 25-29
We have had little success with the synthesized genes in regards to cloning. After multiple attempts it was discovered that the plasmid containing our synthesized gene was not successfully transformed. This was indicated by running digested and undigested plasmid minipreps on a gel, which showed no bands. We are starting from scratch again - transforming E. coli with our synthesized product to obtain viable genes to clone. The construct that was previously apparently successfully assembled was sent for sequencing to verify.
Isothermal PCR appears to work. The positive control showed a smear caused by protein-bound DNA. Cleaning the PCR product with a purification column showed a sharp band at the expected size of 132bp. This was replicated by diluting the PCR products by at least a factor of 10, demonstrating that purification is not strictly necessary. The dilution of the PCR products promotes a dissociation of the protein and bound DNA. When using BioBrick primers to amplify a sequence many small bands <500bp were produced, this was expected as described by the TwistDx manual that optimal amplification occurs for amplicons 200-400bp. The TwistDx resources go on to describe the small bands as ‘primer noise’ that is inherent to the system. Reduction of primer noise is possible namely by screening several variants of primers. We are attempting to reduce the primer noise by synthesizing longer primers 34bp for improved specificity as recommended by TwistDx. Isothermal PCR appeared to work nearly equally well with both whole colonies and purified plasmid as the template (Fig. 2).
Figure 2: Results of isoPCR under standard isothermal conditions using BioBrick primers. Two different sequences were targeted for amplification; C1-λ is a promoter sequence with an expected amplicon size of 406bp; RFP is a coding sequence with an expected amplicon size of 1100bp. Templates used in this experiment were either whole colonies labelled ‘C’, or purified"

What's more, simulation time slot is necessary as well to give concentration-time figures of the inputs and outputs of a given gene circuit. You are free to see the concentration-time evolution of every substance in designed gene circuits individually.
Details:
There are two formalisms for mathematically describing the time behavior of a spatially homogeneous chemical system.
The first one is the deterministic approach which regards the time evolution as a continuous and wholly predictable process governed by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations (the ""reaction-rate equations"").
The other one is the stochastic approach which regards the time evolution as a kind of random-walk process governed by a single differential-difference equation (the ""master equation"").
Some simple arguments in kinetic theory show that the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics has a firmer physical basis than the deterministic formulation. Unfortunately, the stochastic master equation is mathematically intractable in the most cases.
There is, however, a way to make exact numerical calculations within the framework of the stochastic formulation without having to deal with the master equation directly. It is a relatively simple digital computer algorithm, which uses a rigorously derived Monte Carlo procedure to numerically simulate the time evolution of a given chemical system. Like the master equation, this ""stochastic simulation algorithm"" can correctly explain the inherent fluctuations and correlations that are unfortunately ignored in the deterministic formulation.
4.Analysis: Get robustness and sensitivity analysis
Function:
While offering various functions, BioBLESS also serves as an analysis tool for designed gene circuits. Having designed a gene circuit, you can click the ¡°Analysis¡± button to reset parameters of initial concentrations and reaction rates. Meanwhile, BioBLESS will set simulation slots and carry the simulation task automatically. According to the perturbation ratio you input, such as 20% or 30%, the concentration-time curves of inputs and outputs will be shown together to shed light on the robustness of a designed gene circuit. Moreover, data processing and demonstration will help users to better understand the robustness of designed gene circuits.
Details:
Robustness and sensitivity can measure the property of being strong and healthy or not in constitution. They refer to the ability of tolerating perturbations that might affect the system¡¯s functional body. When perturbations to the inputs of a system are small in magnitude, we hope to measure whether the concentration of outputs will change sharply or in extreme cases, even destroy the input-output logic embodied in truth tables. The most intractable problem we confront is the overload on our server to complete the simulation task. After literature reviewing, we choose some factors, for"

Our first designs of the microfluidic chip were quite different from the final design. Although we made several different moulds for the chips the manufacturing process of the manufacturing steps after using the mould remained the same throughout the project. We found that the process worked well and therefore developed a manual with the hope of facilitating the making of microfluidic chips for other iGEM teams as well as for other low budget laboratories.
In order to make our manufacturing method more comprehensible for the final users, we contacted the Stockholm based biohacker community Makerspace about our microfluidic chips. We sent them files containing our CAD designs as well as a manual on how to manufacture their own chips. The manual as well as our other guides on how to make the chips was then rewritten into a final version based on the feedback from the biohackers. As our manufacturing method makes microfluidic chips more accessible, they will mainly assist smaller labs with lower budget. Biohackers therefore felt like the obvious choice to ask for feedback. We hope that the feedback provided have made our guides easier to understand and our chips, in turn, even more accessible.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," some ways to determine which tree structure is preferred and based on this to arrange them. We know each tree could be uniquely converted to a binary tree by taking the first child of each node as the left child and its siblings as its right child. The Huffman algorithm is used to generate the Huffman code of each node in the binary tree. Since the Huffman code of each node represents its path to the root node, we can restore the tree structure from the Huffman codes of all leaf nodes. Hence, the Huffman codes of leaf nodes could uniquely determine a tree structure. With help of Huffman codes, it is simple to compare the forest structure after and before exchange of both chains.
To go further, we must define the preference of each forest structure due to exchange of chains: compare each node of the first tree by their Huffman codes and weights in the same way as comparison of strings and if equal, compare the next until difference appears or to the end of either forest. If one is less than another, it has higher priority. With this definition, the order of those equal chains in the first-stage sorting is determined by the one which generates the forest strucuture with highest priority among all possibilities. By performing this algorithm for all groups of equal chains obtained from the first-stage sorting, we could find both the unique order of the chains and the groups of equivalent chains (exchange of the order fo several chains in the same equivalent group will not change the forest structure). The figure illustrates this idea graphically.
It is easy to compare two structures with help of chain sorting. We only need to compare first the chain list in order, chain by chain, and if equal, compare both associated forest structures. If two structures are same, the comparison must be equal since chains and trees are all in their unique order. If the comparison is equal, they must be the same structures since we could uniquely generate a Chain-Node structure from the chains as well as its associated forest structure.
Structural pattern match of template species
We assume that if a combination of species in the species list could be structurally matched to reactants and modifiers templates defined within a reaction, they are possible to react with each other in the way as the reaction template describes. Hence, it is important to find such matchings between species in the species list and template ones defined in the database. We will first give the basic idea and then some modifications.
Blocks of ST and NST part on a template chain
Combinations of NST block matchings form a region restriction for ST part blocks
The template ST block contains 3 ANY parts. If the first ANY part is matched A and B,"
Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,", because the first mass drug administration we did started in 2011 up to 2013, then we went back to the districts where we were doing the mass drug administration we found out that the prevalence of TF, trachoma follicles, was below the public health problem, below 5 %. But we realized that just bringing that is not enough. As I have already said, that the rural minister should do the whole SAFE strategy. Now with the coming of other organisations that are helping us like The Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust Fund. They are helping us to deal with the whole SAFE strategy; The surgeries, those that have got problems and are burden for the mass drug administration and F and E [SAFE-Strategy: S stands for surgery, A for antibiotics  F stands for facial cleanliness and E for environmental improvements].
Daniel C.:
So you are doing progress?
David Chinyanya:
Yes, we are doing good progress.The impact survey that we have done this year, we found that almost all the districts the TF is less than 5%. In other districts it was 9.9 %, other up to 15 % those were we have done a few rounds of mass drug administration. But those that were above 5 %, where we have done the mass drug administration (MDA) we found that it is less than 5 %. Which is now not [a] public health problem [anymore]. But the problem that is going to be there is sustainability. We have to sustain that. Because we know that there are others in the incubation period. Others will still have the organism with them. Now if we donˋt do anything, if we don’t improve on the F and E, likely it will come back.
Daniel C.:
Is it true that the threshold of 5 % is for communities that have “new” trachoma, and there are about 2 % of communities that already had trachoma and are being reexamined?
David Chinyanya:
No, [that’s] not correct. Because we do random sampling in the community. We do random sampling of 30 households. We examine everybody in that house. As you know, random sampling can mislead you. You can miss a house, that has got the problem. But now, when you do the mass drug administration it includes everybody. Even those who had not been sampled. Assuming that they still have the chlamydia. We know that by doing the F and E and the antibiotic and the mass drug administration we are likely to win the battle.

Motivation and brain storming =
Since 2008, we have been participating in iGEM as METU( Middle East Technical University) wet-lab team, and each year we have noticed the increasing number of teams participating, along with an increase in biobricks entries at partsregistry.org. While having more choices of biobricks to choose from is incredible, searching for and choosing the appropriate parts is becoming a challenge. This year during the construction process of iGEM biobrick parts for our new project, we felt the need for an application to find interacting parts based on an input/output model to design the genetic constructs. Using a specialized software for searching the parts registry to find possible biobricks to include into our construct would be much easy, fast and accurate than manual. We have shared our need with a group of friends who are software engineers, and initiated  the METU_Turkey_SOFTWARE team where we worked together over this summer to build the BIOGUIDE software.

We plugged in the sequences of our chosen enzymes (( CaCCD2 ), ( CsADH2946 ) and ( UGTCs2 )) and started modeling. The templates were chosen based upon quality parameters such as Global Mean Quality Estimation, QMEAN, resolution of the crystal structure and sequence identity (5). After choosing the best templates we obtained the models detailed in figure 1 and the models along with the quality scoring are summarized in table 1. We could make two immediate observations. The CsADH2946 model seemed the most promising one, quality-wise with GMQE close to 1 and higher QMEAN being better. In addition, looking at the N-terminals (the blue ends in figure 1) we could see that they are stretched out, poking outwards from the protein. This was a good indication that we could put a His-tag at this end, with no complications. Another discovery we made was that the second step enzyme CsADH2946 is most likely a tetramer. This information was helpful when purifying the enzyme and going forth with molecular dynamics.
Table 1. The enzymes modeled, which templates were used and quality assessment by means of GMQE and QMEAN. GMQE ranges between 0 and 1, where one is good and zero is bad. As for QMEAN the higher the score, the better(1).
Figure 1. Homology models of the three enzymes selected for the zeaxanthin-crocin pathway. The first and the third enzyme are monomers, while CsADH2946 is a tetramer. The homology models were created using SWISS-MODEL /2/.
Molecular Dynamics in GROMACS
– The Art of Putting Digital Molecules in Digital Boxes of Water
To assess the models and prepare them for further characterization we used GROMACS /1/ to simulate our enzymes in saline water for a total of 100 ns. This lets us assess their stability and obtain new models that are closer to their native conformation which would be the most probable state of the enzymes during the activity measurements in our wet lab.
How We Simulated Our Enzymes
Molecular dynamics is a simulation approach where the potential energies of a molecular system is parameterized using a predefined force-field. A trajectory of the atoms of the system, that is how the atoms move over time, can then be simulated by numerically intergrating Newton's equations of"
Lethbridge,2016,Team:Lethbridge#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," Induced overexpression of lambda cI protein fused to single-domain antibody library. Upon introduction of IPTG to a final concentration of 1mM, increased expression of lambda cI is observed.
The CDRs confer the specificity of binding, and a large library of possible sequences facilitates panning for single-domain antibodies with specificity for any given antigen. Our library of cloned CDR1-3 variants were sequenced using the MinION fron Oxford Nanopore Technologies and the complexity of our library was analyzed. As illustrated, we have a complexity of upwards of 1011 possible variants.
Figure 6: The complexity of the single-domain antibody library as analyzed using Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION. The library is hypothesized to contain over 1011 unique possible sequences which may convey different binding characteristics.
The single-domain antibody library was placed downstream of a lambda-cI coding sequence and utilized for selection of antibody binding to a target protein. Binding of the antibody to a target brings RNA polymerase alpha subunit in proximity to a reporter promoter. Transcription and subsequent translation of the fluorescent reporter is then assessed using fluorescence spectrometry and Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS).
Figure 7: Ensemble measurement of Blue Fluorescent Protein (BFP) signal upon excitation with 402nm light. An emission maximum at 457nm was observed, indicating that BFP is being expressed and can be used as a suitable readout in future experimentation. Fluorescence was compared to a PBS blank (grey).

We can influence the stability of the molecules. For example, in cell B it is important that there is a fast switch between conditions and a fast turnover and degradation is necessary. This is why we add a LVA-tag to the proteins. This tag destabilizes the protein and makes them degradade faster. The degradation rates used in the model are put in the next table:

This theoretically enables us to produce fully processed nisin containing the YAAY- and His6-tag C-terminal in a resistant E. coli which also exports nisin to the surrounding medium. Unfortunately, the construct still contains two forbidden SpeI restriction sites so it cannot be registered as a BioBrick. Those restriction sites will have to be removed using site directed mutagenesis. Due to secretion of nisin and its inducible expression, production of large amounts of nisin is possible in the future using for example a bioreactor in a perfusion process.

The transformation of E. coli DH5α with existing BioBricks BBa_K1331001 (rhlA), BBa_K1331002 (rhlB), BBa_K808000 (araC) and BBa_J04450 (mRFP) as well as pVLT33 containing rhlC was successfully carried out. Unfortunately not all required PCRs worked and it was not possible to amplify rhlC. However, the restriction digest provided the right sizes of fragments accorded with theoretical values leading to the conclusion of having the correct templates (Figure R.1). Since most of the PCRs were not successful (with temperature gradient, GC Enhancer and different concentrations) the project was dropped because time was running out. A possible reason could be the high complexity of the gene and especially the high GC-content. This could lead to an inhibition of the proofreading DNA polymerase [R.1] . The content of rhlC is indicated by about 82 % in a window of 100 bases starting at base 843 (IDT).

Our Project
The Problem:
The world these days has turned into a junkyard of wastes. In today’s world, greenhouse gases such as NOx and SOx pose a global challenge to our sustainability which needs to be addressed on an immediate note.
Being greenhouse gases, both NOx and SOx have a good hand in Global Warming, the most challenging problem at these days. Considering the present rate of rise in temperature, the world’s certainly at the stake of destruction.
These oxides increase the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere which is responsible for the photochemical production of ozone in the lower layers of the atmosphere which has detrimental effects.
SOx is the main precursor of air pollution which is a deteriorating problem for all of us.
Producing acid rain and acidified soils, Sulfur Oxides not only result in respiratory problems such as asthma and pneumonia, but also destroy farm crops, buildings and environment, causing huge economic losses every year.
Both NOx and SOx also have detrimental effects on the environment.
An Innovative Solution:
Our team, iGEM IIT Delhi, plans to combat this catastrophic effect using one of the most promising field of research, Synthetic Biology.
Firstly, we aimed to come up with a strain of engineered bacteria (using Synthetic Biology) which converts harmful components of an exhaust gases coming out of chimneys of various industries and"

Hi to all of you!!!
I’m Feriel (alias Fifi) from Joseph Fourier University where I’m finishing my Master in Nanobiotechnology. Ever since I can remember, I have been fascinated by what Life Science might achieve, especially by designing new living processes that, I’m sure, will really cause major scientific advancements in the future. So when one of our teacher mentioned the possibility to join Grenoble iGEM team, it immediately excited me and I was determined to  participate! This competition is definitely a unique opportunity to learn about life science, experience new things, meet other people and work in a team, all at the same time! An exceptional adventure in few words! Apart from iGEM, I like to cook Kessra and Boureks (Algerian specialties)… I had to talk about food!

We performed gel extraction and redid double digest of parts that were mislabeled. We contacted Piedmont Plastics about specific kinds of PET. After looking over the results of the mutation verification with our mentors it was decided that we could expect with high confidence the mutations conferring similar results.
Week 5
Monday July 16th
Our team was finally back together, as a majority of people were absent for the latter part of last week. A few of us went over what was done last week, and how there was an error in running the gel extractions, so we made a decision to reattach the promoters to the B0034 RBS. Some of us began by running digestions of J23100, K206000, J23101, and R0010 at the E and S sites. B0034+C0012 was digested at X and P, J23101 was digested at S and P, and B0034 was digested at E and X. We also wanted to carry on some of the themes from last years project, and began trying to mutate K206000, or the pBAD promoter, to improve its function through random mutagenesis. Some of our team members also began preparing the E. Coli strain, numbered MG1655, by streaking the organisms on plates from the glycerol stock. After, we rehydrated MG1655 strain. We also liquid cultured and plated DH5α cells and tried to make competent cells for MG1655 strain, but put them in the 37 °C room. Some of our team members began to run error prone PCR ( PCR Protocol ) on the K206000 part as well, to make a part family as well. In our discussion of how we were going to assay our samples, we also ordered pNPB, another sample used to determine degradation in comparison to PET. With the previous mutations confirmed we looked towards generating our own mutations. The first step was generating a 3D structure from LC Cutinase’s sequence (LC Cutinase being newly discovered has no known 3D model). We started this by using Swiss-model again to fit LC Cutinase’s sequence into the 3D model of 3VisB. This process took Swiss-model the most of the rest of the day to generate.

We improved previously existing BBa_K863110 and BBa_K103003 BioBricks parts by combining them, creating one part. It is a fusion protein between the Clostridium cellulovorans cellulose-binding domain of cellulose-binding protein A (CBPa) with the B domain of Staphylococcus aureus protein A (BpA). This fusion protein can be used to bind antibodies to cellulose. To facilitate protein purification, we added a His-Tag. To remove the His-Tag, we separated the HisTag from the sequence by the TEV cleavage site sequence.

Culture transformation E.coli for mini prep
Add 5ml LB+Amp+Tet liquid medium to 10 glass tubes.
Use teeth stick to pick up single colony and put it into glass tubes.
Put the tubes into shake incubator 37C overnight.
Conclusion
The PCR result showed that BioTaq worked well for both cwlJ and sleB,even when we use the original designed primers and B.subtilis 168 DNA as template.
We can't get PCR result when we used MotTaq. It may because our MotTaq has lost it's activity or it is not suitable for our template.
GoTag works well when we applied PCR for sleB, but no PCR result for cwlJ when we used primer cwlJForward and cwlJReverse. After we got the PCR result of cwlJ fragment (by c"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#Mutation#Global_-_-_TEXT.html," (Cox, Horner 1986). DnaQ926 competes against DnaQ about incorporation into the DNA polymerase     III complex. Incorporation of DnaQ926 leads to proofreading deficient replication complexes. Therefore, overexpression or plasmid-based expression     of dnaQ926 is supposed to yield an increased mutation effect. The huge  amount of mutations introduced by dnaQ926 overwhelms the E. coli mismatch repair system leading to the manifestation of mutations from various sources (Schaaper, Radman 1989; Damagnez et al. 1989)
The exact rate and mutagenesis spectrum of DnaQ926 depends on the used cultivation media. Rich media leads high mutation frequency (3.7×104 over background) with mostly transitions, while minimal media cause less mutations (4.8×102 over background) and mostly transversions     (mainly AT → TA). The faster growth of bacteria in rich media decreases the time the time to remove errors before cell division via the repair     mechanisms (Schaaper 1988).
Figure 3: Structure of DnaQ with indicated mutation sites. In DnaQ926 the acidic amino acids D12A, E14A (red) are changed to alanine.      Thereby complexation of the function-essential manganese ion (grey) is abolished due to missing negative charges at the amino acid residues.       (PDB: 2IDO) (Kirby et al. 2006)
DNA adenine methylase (Dam) and SeqA
A mechanism of mismatch repair is the Dam-directed mismatch repair (DDMR). Parental and daughter DNA strands are modified     by methylation at GATC sites. These methylations are added after replication by the DNA adenine methylase (Dam). In the timeframe     between daughter strand synthesis and Dam methylation the repair mechanisms can distinguish between the correct base on the methylated     parent strand (template) and the falsely incorporated base on the non-methylated daughter strand (product). This modification     is used by the mismatch repair proteins MutS, MutL and MutH, which repair the daughter strand relying on information from the     parent strand (Horst et al. 1999).
SeqA is a GATC-binding protein, which also controls the methylation state of DNA. It counteracts Dam by demethylating DNA. This results     in hypomethylated DNA on both strands, which further decreases the efficiency of DNA mismatch repair (Yang et al. 2004).
Combined overexpression of dam and seqA strongly shifts the methylation"

An average car, consuming a maximum of 150 g and a minimum of 90 g of carbon dioxide per kilometer, covers in average a distance of 15.000 km per year. Hence, the annual emission rates range from 1,350  to 2,250 tons CO2. Consequently, the cow’s impact on global warming is twice as great as the impact of a car.
Industrial application of this years iGEM project is able to reduce the annual methane emission by 110 kg methane per cow corresponding to 2750 kg CO2-equivalent emissions.

For example, we were able to establish a partnership with National Chang Gung University -- allowing us to collaborate on the presentation brought forth to Wego Billingual High School. Likewise, we also got to know the members of NTHU_Taiwan; they introduced us to NTHU Professor Yang, who taught us how to use photobioreactor to detect algae growth curve.   Still, this conference was extremely valuable not only because we were able to learn from each other, but more importantly due to the fact that we had the privilege to talk and spend time with people of same interests!
Taiwan Conference
On July 17, 2017, we attended the conference hosted by National Chang Gung University. Teams all around Taiwan attended this conference. This was the first iGEM conference we attended, on top of it being the first opportunity we had to meet other teams. We were extremely thrilled to be able to share our project and listen to other teams' projects. We spent the entire day talking to other teams and getting to know their progress. We started off with an icebreaker where teams were asked to describe their project in less than 1 minute. This was a fun activity as it encouraged members to simplify their projects to the basics. In the afternoon, we presented our project and received feedback from the other teams. As a result of the conference, we were able to establish friendships with several teams that we later met at The Asia Pacific iGEM conference. Also, we were able to brainstorm on possible collaborations by getting a glimpse of what each team's project is about; for instance, we learned that National Chang Gung University shares a similar denitrification mechanism as us, eventually, this led to a successful collaboration between the two iGEM teams. This was an important milestone for NYMU-TAIPEI iGEM team because it was our first contact with the public and, overall, we were exhilarated to meet teams from all over Taiwan."

Design
     HTML, CSS, and Javascript were used to create the user interface for Protocat 2.0. The intent was to design the site in a way that makes it easy for users to create, find, and use any protocol on our database. We used Bootstrap for its HTML grid layout to format our pages.
     We used the Django web framework designed for Python 3.4 to manage the inner workings of Protocat 2.0. Django is convenient because it is capable of useful features including managing administration, databases, authentication, and templating of data on HTML pages through a Model-View-Controller system. The Model component is the Python code interacting that stores classes and objects needed for the database. The View component is the user interface that updates when changes are made to the model. The Controller handles browser requests and responses, as well as database connections. The combined MVC is an architecturally sound web application.
     Protocat 2.0 uses two databases, one for protocols and one for users. We created a “class Protocol,” a model of a protocol, to be used in the protocol database. This class includes properties such as name, reagents, protocol ID, and steps. Django takes care of the necessary steps to aggregate the various protocols into a database. Whenever changes need to be made to our models, all we need to do is migrate the changes through Django and it will change our database accordingly. Django comes with its own user system, which was used instead of creating our own user model. New user information such as username, password, email, and real name are added to the user database. Likewise, when a protocol is uploaded, all those attributes are saved in the protocol database."

Introduction
This year, we iGEM Japan carried out ”iGEM Japan Human Practice” suggested by iGEM Kyoto. In this project, we drove an attitude survey on genetic engineering and biotechnology cooperating with one another. We attempted to recognize the current situation of Japanese public view, and we will take advantage of this result for future human practice activities.
Motivation
According to the previous result of human practice activity, which was a survey with questions about genetic engineering, more Japanese people chose ""negative"" or ""neutral"" than the other nationalities [1] . In addition, it is often said that many Japanese people hate or avoid genetically modified food [2] . We are interested in this tendency. Thus, we attempted to investigate the reason why many Japanese people have a negative impression on genetic engineering. We made a questionnaire below, asking about the impressions on genetic engineering and words related to iGEM, or Synthetic biology.
Advantages
By combining the results from different teams located in the different regions to share some steps of human practice activities, we can avoid labor-intensive but also improve the quality of the survey result with rich amount of samples.
We can attract public attention such as Mass-media by driving this activity as iGEM Japan, than as one university team. This will be a great help for many purposes, such as announcing the activities of iGEM, inviting sponsors, or further human practices activities.
This project will be a good opportunity to deepen the relationships between each Japanese iGEMers. Actually, we are planning iGEM JAPAN project, which includes not only human practice activities but also construction of iGEM JAPAN Website, PR by magazines and participation in symposiums for example.
[ This is the common Introduction article of participating universities of “iGEM Japan Human Practices”( KIT-Kyoto , Kyoto , Osaka , Tokyo_Metropolitan , and UT-Tokyo ). iGEM Kyoto has the responsibility for the wording. ]

Methods
Five out of the nine Japanese teams, KIT-Kyoto , Kyoto , Osaka , Tokyo_Metropolitan , and UT-Tokyo took part in this project. We all used paper-based questionnaire, but the places and terms are different depending on teams.

Gold Medal and Integrated Human Practices
This page will contain information for your Gold medal Human Practices work, which you can also use to nominate your team for the Best Integrated Human Practices page. To make things easier, we have combined the Gold medal page with the Best Integrated Human Practices page since we expect the work to overlap considerably.
iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.
For more information, please see the Human Practices page .
Gold Medal Criterion #1
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.

As a control, HEK293 cells were also transiently transfected with carrying the original CMV promoter, submitted by the team Freiburg in 2012, followed by the EGFP reporter.

Fig.17 EGFP signal under the regulate of HRE in normoxia situation
Fig.18 EGFP signal under the regulate of HRE in hypoxia situation
Under normoxia condition, we observed weaker green fluorescence under the control of HRE, the hypoxia responsive promotor, than that under the control of the original CMV promoter. Moreover, under the control of HRE, more cells exhibited green fluorescence under hypoxia condition than under normoxia condition. The results suggested that our HRE is working.
Fig.19  Left：The transcription level of hypoxia responsive promotor under hypoxia and normoxia situation.
Right: The transcription level of hypoxia responsive CMV promotor and orginal CMV promoter under normoxia situation.
The overall florescent intensity under the control of HRE, however, were similar between hypoxia and normoxia conditions. After discussion, we thought there may be several issues in the model, i.e. slower growth of cells or weaker activity of EGFP under the hypoxia condition. Thus, we also measured expression of EGFP by real-time PCR. That data further proved that the HRE device worked as we expected, although not as strict. We believe we can improve this promotor and make it more sensitive in our future work."

Why iGEM ? I wanted to participate in the iGEM contest as it is an ambitious project that requires initiative, creativity and scientific knowledge. It is an experience filled with sensation : iGEM provides an emotional and intellectual mixture of exhilaration, adventure and inspiration. As synthetic biology is the art of creating what the nature does not give us at the beginning, this contest enables us to create absolutely what we dream of. This participation makes me personally grow and makes me go further in my convictions that share sciences is a beautiful way to make our world a better place to live for everyone.

""Adventure may hurt you but monotony will kill you.""
Born in Bulgaria, once I saw the opportunity to study in France, I took it without hesitations. I learnt to enjoy every single step of every adventure, no matter how challenging it might be.
Why iGEM ? Finding out about the iGEM competition, I realized that this might be a possibility that comes once in a lifetime – being able to create whatever I want just by using biology methods and a lot of imagination. I wanted to develop even more my creativity and to find out where my limits are. Being part of this enormous project, helped me to meet people as passionated by science as I am.

Henri Samueli said ""Passion is what gives meaning to our lives. It's what allows us to achieve success beyond our wildest  imagination. Try to find a career path that you have a passion for."" Software development and sport are my passions and the fuel of my life.

UNAM-Genomics_Mexico,2010,Team:UNAM-Genomics Mexico#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"; the resulting purification would contain only luxAB genes so it should avoid the ligation of unspecific products to the vector, nonetheless these ligations never resulted so at the end we were unable to get luxAB genes from Vibrio fischeri.
(It is worthy to note that these ligations were carried out several times by several people, some of them with a lot of experience and it never was successful).
Our collaborator team from Cambridge University sent us a plasmid carrying the whole operon lux (except the regulatory genes) this is luxA, luxB, luxC, luxD, luxE, which means that an E.coli transformated with this plasmid would glow without the need of any exogenous input because it has the genes coding for the bacterial luciferase as well as the genes coding for the enzymes needed for substrate synthesis. This operon was under control of PBAD promoter depending on arabinose to be active so the bacteria transformated with this plasmid had to be grown on arabinose medium in order to observe the blue glowing phenotype.
LuxY (YFP protein)
In order to transfer LuxY construction from Mr. Gene plasmid to pSB1C3 backbone and test that it works correctly, the next protocol was implemented:
Experimental Procedure
19 August 2010
1. Amplify by PCR reaction the LuxY construction, using Mr. Gene plasmid as template and the  prefix and suffix sequences as primers.
2.Digest the PCR product with EcoRI and PstI and ligate it to pSB1C3 backbone previously digested (EcoRI/PstI) and dephosphatated.
3. Incubate the ligation mixture at 16°C overnight.
4. Transform the cells.
5. Culture the cells in the proper selective medium.
6. Incubate the petri dishes at 37°C overnight.
7. Re-culture the resultant colonies in the proper selective medium; incubate them at 37°C overnight.
This ligation was intented several times due to problems with the pSB1C3 backbone samples used and to the ligase enzyme.
8. Analyze the colonies with Colony PCR to confirm that they contain the correct ligation  Primers:  Forward (5'->3'): Preffix primer.  Reverse:(5'->3'): Suffix primer.
9.Isolate the corresponding plasmid and digest it, to test that the insert is around the expected size.
10. Co-transform the plasmid haboring LuxY with LuxAB genes from"

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Project#Labwork#Week1#Week3_-_-_TEXT.html,"After analysis of the gel photographs and comparison with the expected band sizes for the plasmids, plasmid backbones and BioBricks, we decided that cultures 2(GFP) and 3(RFP) were to be used for a larger scale plasmid prep.
To 2 tubes of sterile LB nutrient broth, a sample of cultures 2 and 3 were introduced. They were then placed into the shaking incubator overnight.
Introduction
Today's procedure is straightforward. Using aseptic technique, we are to innoculate 2 flasks containing LB nutrient broth with the 2 cultures grown overnight. Once carried out, these flasks will be incubated overnight and used in tomorrow's larger scale plasmid prep.
Procedure
Mathew pipetting 50ml LB into a flask
Prepare 2 sterile flasks and to each of them, add 50ml of sterile LB.
Remember to use aseptic technique throughout, i.e. flame the lids of the flask and the LB bottle with a Bunsen burner before and after transferring liquids
Label the flasks appropriately. To one flask, pipette 100 microlitres of the first culture and to the second flask, pipette 100 microlitres of the second culture. (In this case, they are cultures 2 and 3 - GFP and RFP transformed E.coli respectively)
Place flasks in shaking incubator. To ensure that the right amount of cells grow in the media for the plasmid prep, the incubation period should be limited to 16 hours.

Experimental reproducibility is hindered by current protocols. So we fixed it!
Project
ProtoCat 2.0 is a free, open-source online catalog of laboratory protocols with improvements upon last year’s project including a larger protocol database and a website with more advanced features.  By using ProtoCat 2.0, users can find tested, reliable protocols from across the globe all in one place.
Outreach
In order to create the most helpful, effective protocol catalog possible, we created a survey asking other labs and other iGEM teams what struggles they have had with using protocols in the past, how ProtoCat 2.0 could address these problems, and what they would like to see in ProtoCat 2.0.

Stage 03: Transforming E. coli with Azo-Dye Degrading Plasmids from Lisbon
Transforming E. coli with Azo-Dye Degrading Plasmids
Protocols   competent cells transformation miniprep
The five azo dye degrading enzymes from Lisbon arrived as the respective genes in pET-21a (+) ampicillin resistant (ampR) expression vectors/plasmids (size: 5443 bp) [1] [2] . The DNA concentrations of these plasmids, however, were insufficient to perform PCR amplification, therefore we transformed each into our own E. coli competent cells (grown from NEB DH5α derivatives). After growing the cells overnight, we made bacterial glycerol stocks and miniprepped the cells to obtain plasmids at sufficient concentrations for further work.
Diagnostic Digest of Azo-Dye Degrading Plasmids
Protocols   digest gel
A diagnostic digest was performed to ascertain that these pET-21a (+) plasmids contained the gene we expected. As each plasmid possessed EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites close to the genes of interest, we performed double-digests using these recognition enzymes and predicted the digest fragments. The digestion products were visualised using gel electrophoresis (see image right).
Stage 04: Creation of Azo-Reductase BioBrick Parts from Plasmids
Protocols   analytical digest gel
After isolating our genes of interest we attempted to use PCR as a method of prefix and suffix generation to fit the BioBrick standard assembly parts format.
Achieving a successful PCR proved difficult; this may have been due to poor PCR reagent quality. We repeated the PCR using various polymerases (Taq, Phusion and Pfu) and also different dNTP mixes. Eventually, we succeeded in amplifying AzoR 1B6, BsDyP, and ispB asDNA with the required BioBrick Prefix and Suffix. Given the time-constraints, we did not succeed in also amplifying AzoR, CotA, and PpDyP with the Prefix and Suffix.
Protocols   digestion ligation transformation inoculation analytical digest gel
Our next step was to ligate these into the required pSB1C3 backbone. For BsDyP and ispB asDNA, this proved to be fairly straightforward"

Synthetic promoter collection responsive to L-lactate
Figure 1: Lactate sensor design
One central point of our system, the detection of lactate produced by cancer cells, depends on the sensitivity of the LldR-promoter which is responsive to L-lactate. The LldR-promoter is part of the E. Coli LldPRD operon, which is used by the bacteria for the metabolic utilization of lactate. LldR is a regulatory protein that binds to the two operators of the LldR-promoter, O1 and O2. This interaction leads to formation of a DNA loop , preventing any transcription from the following open reading frame.
To tune our system towards an optimal response to L-lactate in the surroundings of our bacteria, we decided to modify the natural version of the LldR-promoter (BBa_K822000) to reach the highest possible ON/OFF ratio and a KM value consitstent with the expected levels of lactate. If the KM value of the promoter is too high, transcription will always be supressed even in the presene of lactate, which would result in a reduced sensitivity of our system. If the promoter KM value is too"

Alcanivorax Borkumensis is the bacteria that releases enzyme that can decompose oil. And we can design something like insulin producing system to solve oil spilling problems in ocean.
Problem: Similar system already exists.
Idea 2
Virus targeting-specific cells; they generally have one specific host. We can make drug delivery system. We can use receptor of coronavirus to target. Since we commonly catch cold, but we don't get seriously hurt, we could use this system for DDS.
Problem: It has to be tested to be proved to be a drug (require clinical study, etcs.; out of our range).
Idea 3
We can make new bacteria that imitate photosynthesis. We can extract only chloroplast part of photosynthesizing organisms – for instance, plants – or use cyanobacteria to make some kind of energy generating building parts: paint (cyanobacteria is the photosynthesizing bacteria). In case of stromatolite, we can use it as building structure.
Problem: We have to make e.coli to be as big as chloroplast. Also, since it physically surrounds building, there is problem when there is no sun or in bad weather. When it rains it could mess up sewage system.
Idea 4
Making a NAND gate with E.coli. We can use 0/1 logic with some kind of chemicals as input and output. And, we can make intermediate phase to prevent unintentional mix up of input and output chemical. We are thinking of lactose tryptophan as input. Since Stanford has done some basic works on this, we can take that advantage. If we make this, we can make a flip flop which is the basic component of memory system.
Problem: If we use chemical as input and output we have to control chemical level. We have to make a system threshold to differentiate 0 or 1.
Idea 5
Making a photographer with yeast. We are making a photographer with RGB cone cells and fluorescence. There already exists a study on cone cell receptors. We can make RGB ratio as 40:20:1 like human retina. Film would be yeast. Therefore, it can grow infinitely.
Problem: Film cannot be copied. We have to be careful not to get light on"
Penn,2014,Team:Penn State#Daily Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," Digested gblocks and pFTV ligated and cells transformed, then plated on antibiotic selective plates.
Wednesday, July 2, 2014
Ashlee worked remotely on the website and is awaiting sequencing results. Plasmids with all four junctions correct (ColE1, KanR, Overlap 1, and Overlap 2) will be used to re-attempt the insertion of dCas9.
Colonies observed on plates with G1 and G4 transformed cells. More plates made, more centrifuge tubes autoclaved. Rescue PCR ran to increase stocks of gblocks. Unfortunately, very faint bands are noticed. Decision to lower annealing temperature next time to increase output. Salis lab manual updated with protocol for making antibiotic plates. Six colonies from each plate of cells that grew used to inoculate a culture.
Thursday, July 3, 2014
Ashlee updated the Notebook and Project pages. She added shortcuts to the Notebook page to make it more user-friendly. She is also constructing more figures to display the design process and ""Plasmid 1"", ""Plasmid 2"", and ""Plasmid 3"" constructs.
Realized mistake of adding six individual colonies to the same culture. Never, ever do that again. That was really stupid. Inoculated six individual cultures with one colony each, as it should have been done the first time.Prepared more electrocompetent cells. Plasmid prepped the 12 tubes (six each of GFP1 and GFP4, the cells that grew from transformation on 7/1. Streaked plates with media from the 12 cultures.

'MERICA. Ashlee began to update the Safety page.
Clay exercised his right to do synthetic biology by digesting the plasmids prepped from 7/3 using two enzymes, then running them in a gel to determine if the expected bands were present. One of the six samples had the right bands.
Saturday, July 5, 2014
Ashlee updated the project page and worked through a CSS tutorial to better organize all the pages. She is still working to improve the Biodetoxification figures.
Worked on updating the lab notebook and website.
Sunday, July 6, 2014
Sam started another rescue PCR, using an annealing temp lowered by 3 degrees, to increase stocks of gblocks.Clay and Sam met to discuss the state of the project.

Imperial_College,2018,Team:Imperial College#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," redox molecules.  We know that the voltage is the right one, but are we sure the solution is oxidising?
Friday
First thing in the morning we checked the plate reder. No fluorescence and no cell growth either... The blank showed increase in Absorbance (?!) so presumably we observed a contamination. We did a lot of gel extraction today (really a lot)... all of them worked fine. Also we prepared comptent cells agains. Very busy day in the lab. Now we have all the parts in the freezer for construct 2.  Also we received a transilluminator as gift from the Teaching Lab.  Fortunately most of the PCRs today worked.  The dry lab has been looking for components for more detailed design. And it seems that it's possible to have most of the components from Nexperia, which makes sense as it has the monopoly of transistors! T.O. suggests that the modelling could be the patterining of pyocyanin as a function of potential. Also the stuff about the device screening is good. Actually there's plenty of material for modelling.  At 5:30 meeting with T.O. and then off to the union for the quiz night.   PixCell Social: QUIZ NIGHT  After several rounds of gel extractions, we managed to leave for the Union. We were supposed to have the quiz in Hyde Park.

In the morning we started drilling some holes in other 6 eppendorf tubes to fill in other electrodes and redo the electrode experiment in solution. This time with improved sterility techniques !! and just pyocyanin as redox molecule (no ferricyanide). Cells with Construct 1A inside (hopefully) have been suspended in the modified eppendorfs in a Amp + LB + Pyo solution. Positive controls with constitive GFP have also been suspended. To test the electrode set up we are oxidising /reducing a pyocyanin solution. Results tomorrow. Josh is ill. Rodrigo is back !

FAU_Erlangen,2015,Team:FAU Erlangen#Tour21_-_-_TEXT.html,". This intramolecular bond can be turned into an intermolecular bond by splitting the protein in two, which is exactly what Howarth's group did.
During the course of several steps, the Catcher was optimized and shortened from 138 to 84 amino acids (Zakeri et al. 2012, and Li et al., 2014). The Catcher we decided to use shares its 113 amino acids with the protein from the Registry part BBa_K1159200, which was submitted in 2013 by the team from the TU Munich.  Since there are more different DNA binding proteins than histone modificating proteins, we paired the Tag with the former and the Catcher with the latter. This way, one could perform the same epigenetic modification at several gene loci without needing to produce the larger binding partner, the Catcher, several times. Once different Tag/Catcher systems are discovered or designed and become widely available, as will surely be the case in the near future, our method could be expanded to faciliate two or more kinds of modifications simultaneously.

This was symptomatic of a potential saturation of the detection system and led us to a new hypothesis, which is explained in details in “Promiscuous Cas12a activation: probes as a target”.
In short, we suspected that the probe itself (Probe 1 in our case) was causing activation of the Cas/gRNA complex, due to the fact that, although it did not contain the PAM sequence, it was perfectly complementary to the gRNA.
We therefore decided to test a new gRNA targeting the loop region of the amplicon (more details in “Detailed Design”), designed to have no complementarity with the probe and perfect complementarity with the amplicon. Even though we                       were not able to reach reproducible results at the stage, we observed the expected signal in one of our iterations (Figure 6). Based on this preliminary success, we believe that with further optimization of our protocol we should                       be able to successfully detect samples with different miRNA concentrations.
Figure 6. Unsuccessful (left) and successful trial (right) for fluorescent measurements of Cas12a detection assay by means of DNase Alert. RCA products with different concentrations of let-7a were tested with the newly designed                         gRNA “L_1”. Concentrations are referred to the reagents before being put in the RCA solution, the concentration of probe in all samples being 1 μM. All the values are blank-subtracted.
From what we experienced, we therefore hypothesized that the promiscuous activation of Cas12a was most probably a consequence of a too high concentration of DNA in solution.
To attempt to solve this issue we tried to titrate the concentration of probe in the RCA reaction to investigate whether a lower concentration of probe was still sufficient to successfully amplify miRNA: starting from the initial concentration                       of 5 μM probe used by Qiu et al., 2018 in their RCA protocol, we were able to show that a concentration of 500 nM - 1 μM is still sufficient whereas, for lower concentrations                       of probe, amplification is not successfully achieved (Figure 7).
Figure 7. Fluorescent measurements of Cas12a detection assay of RCA products by means of DNase Alert. Here probe 1 was titrated from the original concentration of 5 μM to 100 nM, and RCA was conducted in the presence of                           10 nM let-7a in all samples.Concentrations are referred to the reagents before being put in the RCA solution."
Johns_Hopkins-Software,2012,Team:Johns Hopkins-Software#AutoPlasmid_-_-_TEXT.html," messages to the user. For example, if the user tries to import a DNA sequence with incorrect characters. It also will notify users of tasks that are running, such as annotations (and features that have been found) or DNA inverting.
Using AutoPlasmid
First, hand AutoPlasmid a sequence of DNA, however big or small you'd like. Import a file or copy and paste the sequence.
Then get the annotation loaded and started. AutoPlasmid will search through a database containing 40,000 features and look for matches. Not only does it find perfect matches, but if you specify, you can search for imperfect matches with any threshold you'd like (ex. 90% match).
After searching for annotations, open your plasmid to look inside.
Interact with it by selecting features, manipulating the DNA, and adding any custom annotations you'd like. You can even view amino acid translations or oligo matches.
Lastly, you can view the details of an imperfect match.
AutoPlasmid is also compatible with a variety of standard biology tools, such as ApE. A plasmid can be imported as a fasta, gb, and SBOL file, as well as being exported as a fasta, gb, or SBOL file.

TU Delft iGEM
Partnership Program
We did not only organize the Eurasian Meetup with TU Delft iGEM team, but also we collaborated with them through the Partnership Program. As we are participating in iGEM for the first time, we went over their bios and chose our favorite partners. For example, one of the Human Practice captains in our team chose the Human Practice manager in TU Delft team. During the program, the Human Practice manager in TU Delft gave us some advice on how to extend and advertise our product by sending out posters or messages on social media. We also helped them by translating their gene-doping surveys in Chinese so that they could gain more responses. Overall, they gained 130 responses in China.
Bio-Safety Video
Two members--Alexander Armstrong (TU Delft) and Jerry Cheng (BGIC-GLOBAL) worked together and created a biosafety video, which incorporated interviews of participants at the meetup, as well as expert's opinions/attitudes on biosafety and bioethics.
Fujian Normal University (FJNU-China)
After our project presentation during the Eurasian Meetup, we received some advice about the design of our final product. Due to our goal of family-used terminal product, smelling of E.coli should considered as a problem need to be eliminated. Luckily, we found FJNU-China, whose project is aiming to produce a kind of E.coli that emits rose smelling and who have tasteless tnaa E.coli that is knocked out its smelly gene. Meanwhile, FJNU-China expressed their needs for sequence analysis from GBI. As a result, we build up a collaboration with each other. FJNU-China will send us the tasteless E.coli, and we will help them analyze sequence provided by them.
