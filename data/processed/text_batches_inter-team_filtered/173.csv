Biobricks designed
BBa_K836006
Lysis protein S from Enterobacteria phage lambda. This gene codifies for a protein that makes holes in the inner membrane of the bacterial cell. Between the RBS and the CDS a spacer consisting on a scar from a standard suffix and a prefix for CDS was inserted.
Source: http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P03705#section_seq it was optimized for R. opacus (avoiding standard restriction sites)
Part:BBa_K836005
Lysozyme from Rhodococcus phage RER2. Protein involved in the peptidoglycan degradation of the bacterial cell wall. A RBS for Gram positive bacteria (SpoVG) was added at the beginning.A spacer was put between the RBS and the start codon which corresponds to the scar between a normal suffix and the prefix used for CDS to avoid RBS-CDS problems. The sequence has no termination codon since we rely on the double terminators of the scar formed during assembly of biobricks.

Part:BBa_K836007
Nitrilase regulator from R. rhodochrous. Protein in charge to regulate the expression of the genes put under control of nitA promoter. A spacer which consist of the scar left by the assembly of a normal suffix and a CDS prefix was inserted between RBS and CDS. The sequence has no termination codon since we rely on the double terminators of the scar formed during assembly of biobricks.
Source: The amino sequence was obtained from Uniprot ( http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P72312 ) and then the condon usage was optimized for expression in R. opacus.
Part:BBa_K836008
nitA promoter. Promoter inducible by nitrile and similar agents.

8/12/13
The Tecan run stopped after cycle 2 due to an error, so we weren’t able to further characterize BBa_K598010 and BBa_K750000 in the DH10B cells. We decided to redo the Tecan run by growing up some leftover cultures, but they ended up growing very slowly. We decided to instead just start new cultures from the glycerol stocks and restart the Tecan run tomorrow. In addition, we ran several different PCR reactions for our TAL repressors with different polymerases to see if it would result in our amplified product of interest. According to our sequence results of pSB3K3 , the site-directed mutagenesis was successful and now the plasmid no longer has a BsaI site. We began amplifying pSB3K3 for Golden Gate Assembly as well. After running our PCR products on a gel, we are finally getting the correct bands for the TAL repressors; however, there is a certain level of streakiness in each lane. The amplified product for pSB3K3 did not show any bands.

We ran another Tecan trial involving BBa_K598010 and BBa_K750000 with our new strain and will analyze the data tomorrow. In addition, we ran several different PCR reactions involving our TAL repressors and pSB3K3 . We decided to lower the"
BNU-CHINA,2015,Team:BNU-CHINA#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"Da band. There are mainly two reasons for this result.
As Bace16 protein is an extracellular secretion protein in nature [2] , we gathered the supernatant and did ammonium sulfate precipitation, so if the ammonium sulfate precipitation was not successfully conducted, we would not observe the target band in our experiment.
Bace16 is a serine protease containing a presequence signal peptide of 30 amino acids and a propeptide of 77 amino acids [2] . We add the presequence and prosequence when we designing the biobrick, thusmay lead the bace16 not be expressed well in E. coli. Besides, it might be degrased by the proteins from E. coli, so we couldn’t detect the expression of Bace16 in E. coli.
rMpL
Agarose Gel Electrophoresis of rMpL
Firstly, we did restriction digestion analysis to test if we had successfully synthesized rMpL gene with pBAD promoter(BBa_K206000) in its upstream region. We digested the plasmid with restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI. Then we did agarose gel electrophoresis(AGE) and found that the plasimd was digested into two fragments, one of which was about 700bp long, as we expected(Fig.10). It proves that we have successfully built the vector rMpL-pSB1C3 as we planned earlier.
Fig.10 The agarose gel electrophoresis of gene rMpL, the bands pointed by arrows represent rMpL genes. Lane M,DNA marker; Lane 1-4, rMpL-pSB1C3 plasmids digested by EcoRI and PstI.
Besides, we have built another vector including rMpL gene. The backbone of this vector was also pSB1C3, while the promoter of rMpL has been changed into a constitutive promoter(BBa_J23100). We also did restriction endonuclease analysis on this vector either. The agarose gel electrophoresis figure shows that we successfully built this part too.
SDS-PAGE
After the vectors being constructed successfully , we transferred them into different E.coli strains depending on the kinds of vectors .Vectors with pBAD promoter were transferred into E.coli BW25113 and those with constitutive promoter into E.coli BL21(DE3) to express rMpL protein respectively. After rMpl gene was expressed in the bacteria, we did SDS-PAGE to testify the expression of rMpL protein. And"

(2)Cell’s influence keeps unchanged in subsequent iterations as long as the cell exists.
(3)Removal of a cell has inverse effects.
    According to assumption III, concentrations of AHL and nutrient will decline in each iteration if their generative sources are removed.  Different types of cells affecting different kinds of substances are illustrated below:
(1) When a farmer is placed, it will eject nutrient to the surrounding 5×5 grids, and the amount of nutrient in each grid will increase by 1. Then the amount of nutrient will hold on until the farmer is killed. When the farmer is removed, the amount decrease by 1.
(2) When placed on grids, warriors eject AHL molecule to the surrounding 3×3 grids, and the amount in each grid increases by 1; Then the amount of AHL molecule will hold on until the farmer is removed. When warriors is removed, the amount decreases by 1.
VI Iteration rules
    In the ik-th iteration, our program traverses the whole mesh grid and checks for two missions: death penalty and probabilistic growth based on states of the i(k-1)-th iteration. We may call the grid which the program is checking ‘present grid’ for convenience.
VII Death penalty
    There are two and only two cases which cause cell death: nutrient in present grid is depleted; or there are enemy AHLs in the present grid. It is noted that farmers cannot die of case I because they create aliments themselves. As for case II, when AHL-I and AHL-II are in adjacent grid and the colony inside the grid is warrior, one of them will be killed.
VIII Probabilistic growth
    Another mission during iteration is to simulate bacterial growth. Concentration of AHL is excluded in this section, because it only functions in Death Penalty part. Since nutrient contributes to cell growth, a natural idea is to set a probabilistic model of any empty grid, described by a linear equation:
    Pk (x,y)=α∙Ck (x,y)
    Where (x,y) are coordinates of present grid, Pk (x,y) is the probability an adjacent cell can grow into present grid in ik-th iteration, Ck (x,y) is concentration of nutrient in present grid in ikth iteration, α is a coefficient that remains unchanged during simulation.
    This equation helps our program to judge whether or not an adjacent cell can grow into present grid in ik-th iteration; after this judgement is settled, we choose randomly from surrounding grids that have cells in them,"

5. Order the primers from your favourite oligo company. Notice that the price can be a bit higher and delivery time a bit longer, when ordering primers with a uracil incorporated. We have had a good experience with the price, delivery time and quality of the primers ordered from Integrated DNA Technology.
6. After receiving the primers, you are ready to perform the PCR (see protocol Amplification of biobricks by PCR ). Be aware that the addition of the linker to the primer may increase the melting temperature of the primer.
7. Check the band size of the PCR product on an agarose-gel. The new BioBrick can be used directly or purified by agarose-gel purification.
8. The assembly of the new BioBricks should be performed according to the protocol USER cloning .
9. You should now have assembled one new plasmid or linear device.
Seamless assembly
Seamless assembly is often required when constructing fusion protein or if large genetic parts have to be assembled in pieces, e.g. when constructing  complex enzymes and synthases for fungi.
1. If you want to design a construct where all parts are seamlessly assembled go directly to step 2. Otherwise the standard linkers should be added to the parts that do not need to be fused seamless according to the linker table . For more details see the 'creating new parts' section.
2. To design the primers for the seamless assembly the software PHUSER can be used. This software was created by the DTU iGEM team from 2009.
3. The primers are ordered from your favourite company. Notice that the price can be a bit higher and delivery time a bit longer, when ordering primers with a uracil incorporated. We have had a good experience with the price, delivery time and quality of the primers ordered from Integrated DNA Technology.
4. To amplify the BioBricks the protocol Amplification of biobricks by PCR can be used.
5. Check the PCR reaction on an agarose-gel before assembly. The new BioBricks can be used directly or purified by agarose-gel purification.
6. The assembly of new BioBricks is executed according to the protocol USER cloning .
7. A scar free BioBrick device or plasmid should now have been assembled.
Point mutations

5. Take samples after 1 hour, 4 hours, 8 hours and 24 hours, that is, centrifugalizate 0.5 mL of each culture and suspend them by 1 mL of PBS (phosphate-buffered saline).
6. Measure the fluorescence of the samples with the flow cytometer.
Results
From the chart, we can see that cells were hardly induced in the control group, and with the concentration of inducer growing, the intensity of GFP increased by groups. The most efficient concentration of inducer was around 10-5M, and higher concentration may lead to the expression of GFP decreasing. Additionally, to most groups, the intensity of GFP reached its maximum after 4 hours.

Testing the Mop
After confirming that some of the PP1 localises to the periplasm of E. coli when fused to the TorA signal peptide we wanted to test the ability of our mop cells to clean up the toxin. The quantification experiments showed that only about 1/5th of the total PP1 protein was exported to the periplasm, so in our mop-producing cells there will be PP1 present in both periplasmic and cytoplasmic compartments. Since we also wanted to determine whether the cellular location of PP1 was important for the mop to function, we engineered a control plasmid that would produce stable PP1 in the cytoplasm. To achieve this we fused PP1 to the N-terminal 36 amino acids of the E. coli NarG protein. NarG is a cytoplasmic protein that is produced at similar levels to TorA. This plasmid was called pUni-prom NarG-PP1.
Preparing cells for the mop experiment
500 ml cultures of E. coli MG1655 cells carrying either (i) the pUni-prom ‘empty’ vector control, or pUni-prom encoding (ii) TorASP-PP1 or (iii) NarG-PP1 were grown overnight. The following day the cells were harvested and washed, and the cell pellets weighed and re-suspended in TBS buffer to a concentration of 1"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi.

In continuation of the amilCP test circuit, we went back to the stocks and digested T7/amilCP with EcoRI-HF and PstI, again following iGEM protocols. After digesting, we ligated the product, this time with a ratio of backbone to insert at 5:1, in an effort to make the reaction more efficient. We screened with our standard PCR protocol and found that the ligation was a success (fig. 7.).
Fig. 7. T7/amilCP ligation screening. Sample 1 shows a band just under 1000bp, the correct size for ligated product.
Week 15
Now that one colony has been confirmed to contain the spisPink construct, we needed to transform the remaining ligations. Transformations followed the usual protocol, and colony screening by PCR.
With the ligation of the amilCP test circuit was complete, we proceeded to transform it according to iGEM protocols. Visual examination of the plates after incubation showed no signs of bacterial color change. We screened the colonies with our PCR protocol and found that the full circuit was present (fig. 8.). This likely means that there was a flaw in circuit design. Members of our team have speculated that this was due to the lack of spaces in the sequence around the promoters and ribosome binding sites.
Fig. 8. T7/amilCP transformation screening. Bands are visible just under 1000bp for Samples 2, 3, and 4. This corresponds to the size of T7/amilCP.
Week 16
After successfully transforming all our individual parts, we finally were getting ready to do minipreps for them. We used the Promega Wizard Plus SV Miniprep Kit and used the protocol provided by Promega to do our minipreps. The whole process did not take too long and soon after, we now had minipreps for pSB1C3/PcArsR, pSB1C3/PArsR-spisPink, and pSB1C3/PArsR-amilCP and stored them in the -20ºC freezer until it was time to send them to iGEM.
At this point, everyone on the team was back in school. Our subteam leaders were starting college and the rest of us were studying for SATs and preparing college applications. Now the team shifts focus to Jamboree!"

Tsinghua-A::Safety
Question 1
1.Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
The bacteria upon which we have being operating is non-pathogenic E.coli epi300,an organism at BSL-1 according to standards of CDC in the United States. Minor risks are contained in our research since the organism and plasmids, which causes no severe infection to human and animals, will be handled properly by well-trained personnel after every and each experiment, and the chemicals in frequent use are proved to be friendly, except EB ,which is separated along with related devices in a special section, the contact with which requires such protections as a pair of rubber gloves. Prior to the researches of the project, our team members received all basic trainings on biosafety and laboratory safety in turn ,lectured by professors in the laboratory and participants in 2011 iGEM on Tsinghua-A team. Thus no major safety problem will possibly be encountered, which will be under control if they would emerge.
Question 2
2.Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?  If yes,did you document these issues in the Registry? how did you manage to handle the safety issue? How could other teams learn from your experience?
Almost impossible. Primarily they have being used by a large number of researchers and no reports concerning safety issues have being published, nor have we discovered anything insecure. Secondly they are preserved in special containers and separated from the public. So this should be out of the question.
Question 3
3.Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes. We are supported and financed by Department of Automation, instructed and supervised by its professors and engineers studying life sciences. And laboratory assistants give us quite a lot of instructive suggestions including problems on biosafety.
Question 4
4.Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for"

This polycistron is under the regulation of the strong yeast promoter TDH3, and the terminator TEF1. The three genes are involved in the lasts steps of the ß-carotene synthesis and it has have been shown that their addition to Saccharomyces cerevisiae was enough to make it produce ß-carotene.
2A sequences or cis-acting hydrolase element:
2A-like sequences are able to force the ribosome to ""skip"" a codon. The ribosome releases the part that it has already translated and to keep translating the mRNA. It allows transcription of multiple proteins from only 1 mRNA with 1 promoter, like bacterial polycistronic elements, but also with only one kozac sequence (yeast RBS) which ensures that the quantities of all the translated product are the same.
Comparative growth of WT and Vitamin A producing Yeast
No differences were found between the growth rate of the 2 yeasts. This was a concern because a fitness cost would mean that wild type yeast would have slowly replaced the carotenoid producing yeast in the culture.
We are using the strain IME167: Mata ura3-52 HIS3 LEU2 TRPl MAL2-8c SUC2 pUDE269 (2u URA3 pTDH3-crtYB-T2Al-crtl-T2A2-crtE-tTEF) described in ""Polycistronic expression of a beta-carotene biosynthetic pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae coupled to beta-ionone production"" (Beekwilder et al. 2014). This strain is carrying a high copy plasmid with the polycistronic construct.
We were afraid that wild type yeast would have been able to out-compete the vitamin A producer yeast because of the burden that the synthesis could have put on the cell. So we compared the growth speed of both the producer and a WT strain of S. cerevisiae (SK1) in YPD by measuring the variations of OD600nm over time.
Absorption spectrum of yeast extracts
In order to quantify the production of carotenoids of the IME167 strain we extracted the carotenoid content of the cells with hexane. The control was the same SK1 strain that has been used in the growth experiment.
The peak of absorbance at 449nm can be linked to the concentration of carotenoids using the following formula :
Total carotenoids (in µg/g[dw]) = (A449 x mL hexane) / ("

6th Annual Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference
We attended the 6th Annual Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference at the end of July/beginning of August at NCHU (National Chung Hsing University). At the Asia-Pacific iGEM conference, we met over 20 teams from China, Taiwan, and Japan, presented projects, and discussed project issues with other teams during poster sessions and social events. There, we received helpful feedback about our project, and more importantly, we were able to get into contact with an expert in the field of probiotics, Dr. Ying Chieh Tsai.
INTERACTIONS WITH MORE IGEM TEAMS!
TecCem
Majo U. Orozco, a team member of TecCem iGEM 2018, contacted us about our SEM imaging protocol for chitosan nanoparticles. We were able to contact members from the TAS Taipei 2016 iGEM team that worked with chitosan nanoparticles. They ended up using the protocol for TEM imaging but they said that the imaging looks great!

In the end we obtain a unconditionally stable scheme to calculate     the evolution of AHL and leucine concentrations over the domain. Moreover, this     scheme can be computed efficiently by solving banded matrix systems.     The image below illustrates the computational molecule of the ADI     scheme we implemented:

ADI-Molecule. Click to enlarge.
Boundary Conditions
As explained above in the implementation of the agent-based module,    we chose to use periodic boundary conditions for our system. The    field should thus repeat itself in all directions. In the PDE-based    module, this comes down to equating the “missing” neighbor of a    grid point on the edge of the domain to the grid point at the    opposite edge of the domain. Assuming our grid consists of    $J_x\;x\;J_y$    points, the grid point to the “left” of $C_1,j$ is for example    $C_{J_x},j$.    Conversely the grid point to the “right” of $C_{J_x},j$ is $C_1,j$. This    impacts our computational scheme through a modified finite difference    expression for grid points on the edge of the domain. The regular    form is defined as (31).

USP-EEL-Brazil,2016,Team:USP-EEL-Brazil#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," These samples were really turbid and had the white concentrated oil with nutrients, which turned out really white. This meant that as we took samples for measurements, the more viscous and turbid the sample became and higher was the reading, meaning it would not reflect the true cell growth.
Genetic manipulation.
The iGEM kit arrived on June and when we first laid our hands on it, we had no experience with synthetic biology at all… We knew the theory needed to work with it, but when you step inside the lab, there’s a whole new world to explore. A whole new challenge to tackle.
iGEM kit plates. Source: Personal archive.
The constructs design created many discussions and not many methods available to us to do it. Initially we thought about synthesizing the genes all at once, resulting in two operons, one for Lux and the other for the tocopherol. But we then discovered that we had a limit of 2000bp per gBlock we could order. Our choice ended up being to order the genes separately and add them together with Gibson Assembly, this way we could deposit the parts one by one and the whole construct all together.
For the Gibson Assembly, we designed the genes to have around 30bp of overlap at each end of the parts, and the BioBrick prefix and suffix at the beginning and at the end of the operons' border genes. Each part has its own RBS before the gene itself. We also designed the primers, some with and some without the prefix and suffix. The idea was to make PCRs of the plain genes and amplify them for the Gibson. The ones with prefix and suffix would be directly deposited in the Registry.
Unfortunately, every experiment is not a walk in the park. Our assemblies would not work, and we couldn't pinpoint the problem. The products would show some incomprehensible bands. After much revising, we still can't understand why the Gibson Assembly did not work properly.

Some assembly variations were applied to different samples, to no avail. Although the composite parts were giving us a hard time, all the other iGEM protocols, including digestion, 3A assembly and competent cells worked neatly and pretty effectively.

Goettingen,2014,Team:Goettingen#project overview#perspectives_-_-_TEXT.html," information:
- Phagocytes (especially neutrophils) play a very important role in the resolution (clearance) of the fungal infection.
- Antibodies and the complement system are not that effective against fungal pathogens due to the surface of these pathogens being unsuitable to binding.
As such, the modulation of these branches of the immune system should aid in the resolution of the disease.  It is important to mention that since most patients suffering from invasive mycoses are immunocompromised and that there are different types of immunodeficiencies. Depending upon which branch is dysfunctional, an appropriate strategy of immunomodulation can be adopted.
Our peptides can bind to the fungal surface and they can be further modified using the Fc (constant) region of the IgG1 or IgG3 antibody subtype (IgG2a in mice). This region is important as it is recognized by the effector cells (neutrophils and macrophages) of the immune system and thereafter, leads to the death of the target cell. This way, not only can it bind to fungal pathogens but can also “draw attention” towards itself from the immune system. In addition to this, the constant region can also activate the complement cascade via the ""classical"" pathway. Essentially, this set-up functions as a modified antibody with an added bonus of greater affinity.
Homing anti-fungal drugs to the site of infection
Anti-mycotics, such as amphotericin B and fluconazole have been used extensively to treat fungal infections. While they have been effective, they are more toxic to the human body than antibiotics that kill bacteria. This is due to the fact that bacteria are more dissimilar to humans than fungi are. As a result, it is relatively simpler to find targets for antibiotics than anti-mycotics. Simply but, the more we humans have in common with a pathogen, the greater is the difficulty in coming up with a drug that harms only one (in other words, there is a need for selective toxicity).
Thus, yet another potential application of the novel peptides we developed is that they can act as “guides” to these molecules thereby reducing side-effects due to the drug in question.

Since oscillations are a phenomena that require observation at a small scale (level of very few cells or even single cells), we designed microfluidic chambers in order to load our cells and observe oscillations.
We used standard soft lithography techniques to generate microfluidic channels. In brief, SU8 photoresist was spin coated on a silicon wafer to the height of 50μm. The desired pattern was generated using maskless lithography. A silicone elastomer was added with its curing agent in 10:1 volume ratio and poured over the micro-mold. After 4 hours of incubation at 65oC, PDMS was peeled off the silicon wafer and inlet and outlet holes were punched. The surface of PDMS and a cover slip were modified using a plasma cleaner and microfluidic channels were created by bonding the two together.
Cell culture grown overnight containing LB media was loaded directly into the channels, or was diluted 1:50 and flowed through the main channel. Air bubbles were introduced at the T-junction. Hence droplets of water surrounded by air on either side were created in the channel. Cells trapped in these droplets were studied under a fluorescence microscope using a 40x objective.
Two types of fluorescence microscopes were used for our studies. The first had a mercury lamp as the light source, with a black and white camera. We were able to observe fluorescence in cells that were constitutively expressing GFP, containing the reporter under the PhlF repressible promoter. The system was on a high copy, and PhlF was not being produced, thereby rendering the promoter to be constitutively ON.

Human Practices
At iGEM we believe societal considerations should be upfront and integrated throughout the design and execution of synthetic biology projects. “Human Practices” refers to iGEM teams’ efforts to actively consider how the world affects their work and the work affects the world. Through your Human Practices activities, your team should demonstrate how you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your project is responsible and good for the world. We invite you to explore issues relating (but not limited) to the ethics, safety, security, and sustainability of your project, and to show how this exploration feeds back into your project purpose, design and execution.
For more information, please see the Human Practices Hub . There you will find:
an introduction to Human Practices at iGEM
tips on how to succeed including explanations of judging criteria and advice about how to conduct and document your Human Practices work
descriptions of exemplary work to inspire you
links to helpful resources
And more!
On this page, your team should document all of your Human Practices work and activities. You should write about the Human Practices topics you considered in your project, document any activities you conducted to explore these topics (such as engaging with experts and stakeholders), describe why you took a particular approach (including referencing any work you built upon), and explain if and how you integrated takeaways from your Human Practices work back into your project purpose, design and/or execution.
If your team has gone above and beyond in work related to safety, then you should document this work on your Safety wiki page and provide a description and link on this page. If your team has developed education and public engagement efforts that go beyond a focus on your particular project, and for which would like to nominate your team for the Best Education and Public Engagement Special Prize, you should document this work on your Education and Education wiki page and provide a description and link"

NEU-China,2016,Team:NEU-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," when they need help and that interaction led a                                 more closely communication between us. We have often exchange some experience and                                 experimental skills up to now.
At the very beginning of the competition, we had received a tube of plasmid provided by NAU-CHINA before DNA kits’ arriving. That solution contained the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone which could be used to submit parts. We were so grateful for that kindness behavior because we had nothing but the pSB1C3 at that time.
EXPERIMENT SECTION
WITH FAFU-CHINA
What’s more, we were seeking for an experimental cooperation positively until an                                 active team - FAFU-CHINA - stepped into our eyesight. What they were doing really                                 aroused our interests. In the later time, some students of us answered the survey                                 they did and contacted with them full of  enthusiasm.
Then, we proposed that we could help each other to solve some troubles on experimental. So, we send them the vector pBD024-tCas9-CIBN which should be transformed into E.coli, hoping for their generous cooperation. We hoped them to test if the tCas9-CIBN protein we created would be expressed in E.coli and to help us to got the accurate data about the induced concentration of arabinose. What they did acted as control experiments in order to demonstrated the validity of our former data. The result we concluded before was unsatisfactory. We were eager to get their feedback to compare with our idea. Well, facts proved that they were indeed an enthusiastic and efficient team! The feedback they gave had helped us to understand the results better and saved a lot of time for us. The details is shown at FAFU-CHINA .
WITH NEFU-CHINA
In the daily contact with NEFU-China, we thought we can help each other to do something to increase the efficiency of the experiment. Meanwhile, reasonable cooperation can also proved the correctness of the results.
We had did some experiments to help NEFU-China to find out the best induce condition and to observe the total protein we extracted. The details also can be found at progress part we received a tube of plasmid from NEFU-China. According to their description, we designed experiments below to achieve the test goals:
Transformed the plasmid into DH5alpla strain to amplify.
Then miniprep the right vector after culturing.
Transformed the obtained plasmid into Bl21 strain in 3 50ml centrifuge tubes respectively.
Cultured at LB liquid medium with ampicillin antibiotic."

Hong_Kong_HKU,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," project. We were able         to receive instant feedbacks from them regarding to their understanding of synthetic biology and genetically modified         organisms. With more than 75 participants in the survey, 58% claimed to have knowledge about GMOs. Within this group         of participants, 63% knows that genes inside the organism is changed, while an equal percentage of participants also         think that GMOs greatly affects the ecosystem. 54% of the people voiced GMO will negatively affect human health.
However, these responses contradicts to our research findings prior to the events. There is no valid proof that GM         food is harmful to human health. Our team realized that this misconceptions and bias can be an important barrier         to the advancement of synthetic biology, so we had elaborated more on this issue through our project introduction         and written articles about synthetic biology which we had posted on a local science FaceBook page.
Using the same set of questionnaire, we also received feedbacks on opinions about our project, which some parents were         interested and spent time discussing with us at our booth.
From these feedbacks, we were able to draft out an idea on how our future project would look like. We sought to interview         with Prof. Terrence Lau who is knowledgeable about current GMOs situation in Hong Kong. It is also a surprise that         GMO papaya is actually very common in Hong Kong, while our survey conveys that people know GMOs in a broad sense,         but not the GMOs particularly grown in their country.
Throughout the interview, we sparked another similar idea that we can also tackle, which is the Genetic Containment         Strategy, where we also care about preventing accidental release of the genetically engineered organisms, and we         sought more in-depth detail about how to improve our construct to Prof. Matthew Bennett.

Summary
We created new E.coli which hunts and eats insects. As such we named it Carnivorous E.coli. Carnivorous E.coli emits light when it is hungry. This will attract insects to it. Then, it secretes a viscous substance to capture the insects. The captured insects are digested by the chitinase in the secretion. Long story short, our Carnivorous E.coli can hunt!
Team Hunger
Carnivorous E.coli attracts insects by emitting light, but it is a burden for E.coli. To reduce this burden, we use nitrogen regulatory proteins, NtrB and NtrC. They activate σ54 promoter when the supply of nitrogen is not enough.
Team Capture
There are many methods to attract bugs, for instance, using pheromone, smell, and light. In this study, we focused on light as a method to lure insects. Carnivorous E.coli will emit light and attracts bugs like glowworms by using Bioluciferase from 2010 Cambridge .
Team Digestion
An insect body is covered with a hard integument containing mainly chitin. To decompose the integument, we used ChiA gene, which encode chitinase. In order to measure the chitinase activity of the culture supernatant, we evaluated the effects of the medium and cell growth.
Achievement
We confirmed that the wavelength of light emitted by E.coli is suitable to lure drosophilas.
We constructed new biobrick which produces chitinase.
We constructed new biobrick that is controlled by the concentration of glutamine.
We established new method for measurement of promoter activity with RPU.
We held the Japanese iGEM meeting at Kyoto University.
Human Practice
As synthetic biology is a comparatively new way of understanding life, we plan to develop this area much further. However, this area entails problems of bioethics and so we must consider these problems as well. Unfortunately, Japanese high school students do not have many chances to come across these topics."

HUMAN PRACTICES
The human practices team is integrated by: Valery Díaz, José Ng, Arturo Nieves, Naicolette Agudo, Lucia Palma (as advisor) and Grimaldo E. Ureña and other members of the iGEM team interested in the  Human Practices area.
From the earliest stages of human evolution when homo sapiens hominids apart from the others hominids, the ability to create progresively better tools and most importantly, the capability of transfer information between individuals has led the advancement of society. Since the tribes and clans, their ability to frame and transmit knowledge as science is one of the basic human capacities that have decided many scientific discoveries and social changes through  human history. Every new revolution has to embrace the critic eye of the people. Similarly, our team thinks we should treat the introduction of synthetic biology to the society as a factor in the equation that helps our country develop and evolution.
Human Practices Project
Introduction
At the beginning of this journey, the members of the UTP-Panama iGEM team confronted a fundamental question, the same one that all who are involved in the field of Synthetic Biology find: What is Synthetic Biology? This aspect is emphasized more in our team, being a team of members studying engineering careers, not related to biological or ""life sciences"".
In our own attempt to understand what is synthetic biology, for which we got a lot of  help with the good information in all the sites of iGEM.org, syntheticbiology.org, SYNBERC, etc and multiple videos on youtube about what is synthetic biology, and finally the introductory lectures given by our instructor. Although we must admit that there are so broad and diverse views that converge under the term ""synthetic biology"", which is always a challenge to define.
Once this stage was finished, we still felt that there would not be an easy task to explain to others about what is synthetic biology. That was the point when we turn to the future applications and benefits of synthetic biology as a the right way to introduce the topic.
At the same time we began to structure and make our own project of SynBio as part of the iGEM Competition, work that led us to ask ourselves how to bring it on the best"

Integrase parameters
Friday, August 29th
In order to predict accurately the experiments we designed, we defined two different strategies to retrieve parameters for the integrase system.
As we did not find these parameters on the web, we used the data given by Bonnet et al.'s paper ""Amplifying genetic logic gates"" [9] . The figure S4 is particularly interesting, even if it does not give any information on the dynamics of the system. We modeled and wrote the equations corresponding to Bonnet's experiment.
At first, we try to fit the dynamic parameters of the system with only the steady states values.  To fit the parameters with the data, we first try to use a minimum search for the difference between the data and the parametric function. Then, using these first approximations, we tried to do a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to find a more suited curve. As these two methods are strongly prior dependent, we planned another step of screening in order to have meaningful results. However, our knowledge on the parameters, the number of data points compared to the high number of parameters did not give any meaningful results.
We then decided to simplify our system :
We consider that Bxb1a and Bxb1b have the same behavior. Therefore, they don't appear as differentiated in our system anymore.
The paper uses the tet system to induce their system. This was modeled explicitly before. We approximated this part to a Hill function, which takes leakiness into consideration. The parameters for the Hill function are the result from a study of an other iGEM team UCSF from last year. Please visit their page for more information. The same biobrick is indeed used in their work and in Bonnet's paper.
We consider that the dimer of the integrase and the binding to DNA were at quasi steady-state.
As we tried to fit the steady state, we obtained two different models, depending on which assumption we made. As these two models fit the Bonnet's curve well, we used them both to derive more precisely the dissociation constant of the dimerization reaction and the one of the DNA binding reaction. Each of them appear in one of the lump"

Safety
Safety was a top priority for our team, especially because a majority of our research took place in a biochemical laboratory setting. The lab in question was the third floor of the Molecular Plant Sciences building at Michigan State University, classified as a Biosafety Level 1 laboratory.
Once permitted to work in the lab, the team followed the safety protocol outlined in our training, including wearing long pants, closed-toe shoes, and disposable gloves. When working in a fume or laminar  flow hood, team members wore safety glasses/goggles and lab coats. Additionally, safety protocols required that team members could never be in the laboratory if a graduate student, postdoctoral researcher,  or faculty member was not also present. Because the lab space was shared by four different research groups, supervision was rarely an issue. On a day to day basis our research team wore nitrile lab gloves, long pants and closed toed shoes as PPE. Additional PPE of a lab coat was worn when running gel electrophoresis to protect from ethidium bromide. All bacterial work was performed in biosafety cabinets. We worked with Trichoderma spp. and Fusarium spp. in a laminar flow hood because of their high propensity for contamination of other fungal cultures.
Safe Project Design
The team made sure to use a safe, non-pathogenic chassis for our project. We transformed chloramphenicol resistance, GFP and the acds gene into our chassis Enterobacter ludwigii. This species is most closely related to Enterobacter hormaechei which is considered a risk 2 organism. We chose Enterobacter ludwigii for its lack of the acds gene, relatively quick growth, lack of innate resistance to chloramphenicol, and transformability. We decided not to include a kill-switch device in our organism because that would have required us to genetically engineer the plant it was applied to and spray a chemical onto the plants to induce endophyte cell death.
The bad news: no colonies growing. The good news: we stayed safe by wearing disposable gloves!
Erin displays proper safety by working with bacteria in a biosafety cabinet.

Unter der Annahme, dass alle Bakterien entfernt oder zumindest zerstört worden sind, erhoffen wir uns eine verminderte Immunabstoßungsreaktion, da das Material keine Oberflächenantigene präsentiert, wie zum Beispiel andere Säugetierzellen.

Controlled Modification and Intercellular Transmission of a DNA Message
Intercellular messaging in nature allows cells to coordinate and exhibit complex population-level behaviour. Synthetic biologists would like to build this into engineered populations.  Last year, Ortiz and Endy at Stanford University developed a method for messaging using DNA - the master information molecule - to carry information between cells using hijacked M13 bacteriophage. Their proof of principle demonstration opens up an exciting avenue for intercellular messaging and is ripe for development.   We designed methods to advance this intercellular communication system by allowing cells to CONTROL, MODIFY, and RETRANSMIT DNA messages.

Introduction
Intercellular Communication and DNA Messaging
Intercellular communication between cells in nature allows for coordinated population-level behavior, enabling spatial and temporal organization and complex responses to environmental stimuli.
Synthetic biology is continually expanding the range of programmable cellular characteristics and behaviors, and incorporation of intercellular communication into engineered cell populations has extended programmable behavior to a population level.
The Traditional Approach: Engineered AHL-based intercellular communication
Many bacteria naturally secrete acylated homoserine lactone molecules, or AHLs, which can be detected by other members of the bacterial population (Fig 1). Concentration-sensitive detection of AHL brings about significant qualitative changes in cell behavior via transcription regulation, including feedback on AHL production. Such natural quorum sensing systems are associated with coordinated behaviours such as biofilm formation [1] and bioluminescence [2].
These natural bacterial quorum-sensing systems have been successfully modulated to enable programmed intercellular communication in engineered bacterial populations. Genes associated with AHL production, detection, and response are “re-wired” such that they correspond to different input stimuli and output behaviors. Coordinated population-level behaviors including two-dimensional pattern formation [3], coordinated oscillations in gene expression [4], and even a system exhibiting predator-prey dynamics [5] have been demonstrated using this technique.
Fig 1. AHL molecules secreted by bacterial cells are detected by receptors in other bacterial cells
Why DNA messaging?
Ortiz and Endy suggest the use of DNA as an intercellular messaging molecule [6] (Fig 2). They identify several inherent advantages of this as compared to AHL-based messaging, which are summarized here in description of the DIVERSITY and INFORMATION CONTENT of AHL- vs DNA-mediated messaging.

Overview
In ancient Roman myth, Janus is the god of beginnings and transitions, who is depicted as having two faces, respectively to the future and the past.
Our project is focused on another Janus - hydrophobin the protein, who faces the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity. Because of this, a sea of new applications are created.
Firstly, we redesign the structures of two classes of hydrophobins, making expression in E.coli possible.
Secondly, we use its double-sticky-tape-like ability to make two applications. We take this advantage to fix antibodies on a high-flux tumor detection chip. Meanwhile, they are used to catch cutinases for plastic degradation. We even make them into a fusion to test if the enhancement could be better.
Thirdly, we use its amphipathicity to achieve protein separation, where they act as a special purification tag, and the system could be as simple as polymer, detergent and water. With help of this, we could even achieve recovery of cutinases.
Figure 1. The overview of our project
Feel interested about our story? So let's follow Janus and begin our journey from old to new!
 
Background
As is known to us all, for most proteins, hydrophobic residues are buried in the core of proteins stabilizing the folded conformation of the protein. However, as to our Janus - hydrophobin, one part of the surface is consisted nearly entirely of hydrophobic side chains, forming what was called “the hydrophobic patch” [1]. We could then describe the structure of Janus as a ""surfactant"" with one hydrophobic and one hydrophilic part.
Figure 2. The difference between most protein and hydrophobin
Janus are proteins that are produced by filamentous fungi, such as Ascomycetes and Basidiomyc"
Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Ribosense#DesignProcess_-_-_TEXT.html," alternative conformations either affect access to regulatory cis sequences, or which add or remove hairpins and other terminator constructs, we believe there is potential for these to be used in the rational design of new riboswitches. We then searched for new riboswitches to characterise and submit and found these two papers: Breaker et al (2012) , and Dann III et al (2007) .
The reason that we chose to work with two riboswitches is because of their differing mechanisms. The fluoride riboswitch turns on its reporter in the presence of fluoride, through the removal of a rho-independent terminator. This is because its in vivo role is to switch on production of a fluoride efflux pump as the [F-] increases above safe thresholds.
The structure of the fluoride riboswitch in the presence of fluoride as characterised by Breaker et al (2012) DOI: 10.1126/science.1215063
The structure of the fluoride riboswitch in the absence of fluoride as characterised by Breaker et al (2012) DOI: 10.1126/science.1215063
The magnesium riboswitch on the other hand has an influx pump as its effector. Its state in the absence of Mg2+ is to therefore form an antiterminator, this is removed by the anti-antiterminator that forms in the presence of Mg2+.
The structure and mechanism of the Magnesium riboswitch as characterised by Dann III et al (2007) DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2007.06.051
The logic behind these two choices was that, in order to truly be a universal standard as set out by our design goals above, given that response elements, both promoters and riboswitches, can act to turn a response on or off, our system had to be compatible with both. Further details on each riboswitch can be found on their respective pages: Fluoride page and Magnesium page Having identified the riboswitches and designed the constructs to test them we had to obtain the hard DNA to test them. The Magnesium riboswitch is a naturally occurring B.subtilis gene and so was amplified from a sample of genomic DNA previously extracted by PJ Steiner using primers we designed ourselves. The fluoride ribsowitch, however, is a B. cereus gene. Given that this organism is pathogenic we were not permitted to handle it. Therefore, plates of B.subtilis transformed with the gene, as well as a sample of the gene in a shuttle"
St_Andrews,2010,Team:St Andrews#project#safety#GMO_-_-_TEXT.html," biological activity. Where the function of the inserted gene is unknown, it may help to describe the function of any known homologues. Please note that even a normal human gene may be harmful if overexpressed, especially if the overexpression is in tissues that do not normally express the protein.
No virulence factors used, LuxR system extensively tested in E. coli and found to be harmless. The cholera autoinducer synthase has been expressed in E.coli with no concerns arising. CqsA is analogous to LuxI. No resulting strains are therefore expected to cause any hazard to human health.
(iii) Hazards arising from the alteration of existing traits (e.g. alteration of pathogenicity, host range, tissue tropism, mode of transmission or host immune response) One factor to consider is whether the inserted gene encodes a pathogenicity determinant, such as an adhesin, a penetration factor or a surface component providing resistance to host defence mechanisms. Another important consideration is whether the inserted gene encodes a surface component, envelope protein or capsid protein that might bind to a different receptor to that used by the recipient microorganism. Consideration should also be given to whether the inserted DNA (or the plasmid sequence) encodes resistance to a drug or antibiotic that might be used for the treatment of a laboratory-acquired infection. If an animal or plant, will the inserted gene affect the tropism of human pathogens, will the modified organism act as a new ‘reservoir’ for a human pathogen etc.
The inserted genes are unlikely to alter the pathogenicity of the cloning host, E. coli.
(iv)  The potential hazards of sequences within the genetically modified organism being transferred to related organisms Factors to consider include whether widespread dissemination of the inserted gene as a result, for example, of either gene transfer or recombination of the GMM with a wild-type microorganism, would be a matter of concern. If this is the case an important consideration will be whether, in the event of a breach of containment could the genetically modified organism could survive in the environment for long enough for such a gene transfer to take place.
The inserted genes are unlikely to alter the pathogenicity of the cloning host, E. coli. In addition, Escherichia coli DH5 (a K12 derivative) is recognized as being unable to colonize humans and is disabled with respect to growth outside the laboratory.  It is considered to be ACDP a Category 1 pathogen and thus unlikely to cause harm to human health.  The cells have limited survivability in the"

We also made sure that we have enough responses in each category. You can view the survey questionnaire here .
An application for approval of a GMO in India has to go through the following committees:
IBSC: Institutional Biosafety committee
RCGM: Review Committee on Genetic Manipulations
MEC: Monitoring cum Evaluation Committee
GEAC: Genetic Engineering Approval Committee
ICAR: Indian Council of Agricultural Research
Analysis
We believe that GM crops/foods would be a very important part of our life in the future, if not today. Genetic Modification technology would be developed to an extent that all of us would be satisfied with its technical, economical and political implications. In that regime, we believe that the answers to all of our questions would be 'YES'. Therefore, we have looked at the patterns, which give us 'YES' answers in our questionnaire. The percentage of people responding 'YES' have been color coded like: 0-40% red, 40-70% yellow, 70-100% green. In this way, we can also estimate that how close are we to go green! We found interesting results in accordance with our hypothesis. We had divided our participants into six groups: Undergraduates, Graduates and Professors, each from Biotech or non-Biotech. A comprehensive analysis of our results can be obtained here . Below is the tag cloud representation of the comments, which we received in our survey.

Codonut-a game
We were fascinated by the concept of codon bias, which forms the basis for the modelling aspect of our project. We wondered if we could teach this concept with the help of a fun mobile game. We believe games can truly help people of all ages understand core concepts underlying day to day phenomena in a lasting way. This was how the game was born.
In the game, the player guides the ribosome character by tapping on the screen(thus lifting him up). The player must not hit the upper or lower bounds of the playing area(represented by the lipid bilayer). As an analogy to codon bias, we decided to use donuts, with ribosome preferring chocolate donuts above all others(who doesn't love chocolate?).

Lethbridge,2015,Team:Lethbridge HS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," Results of July 6 Recultured Biofilms, Degradation of July 7 Biofilms and Preparation of New Biofilms for Further Testing
Objective: Determine if yesterday’s recultured biofilms were successful. In addition continue to degrade biofilms using the household cleaners brought into lab for testing and see if we can successfully reculture the biofilms created yesterday.
Results: Reculturing of the July 6 Biofilms
We were successful in reculturing the biofilms to varying extents based on the overnight cultures of the degraded RFP biofilms. Based on reference of the biofilm that had been cultured before the cleaners were added, the Truly is the most red in colour. Both bleach and Tilex had a more clear appearncec similar to LB.
PHOTO
Procedure: Degrading the July 7 Biofilms
The biofilms created yesterday successfully grew. To degrade the biofilms, Tilex, Truly and Fantastic cleaner solutions were used that had previously been created. The solutions of biofilms were disposed of in the biohazard waste and the microtiter plates placed in water. They were vigoursly shaken to dry and 300 μL of respective cleaning solution added to each well. Since three plates of biofilms were created, each cleaning solution received its on plate. 15 mins after the solutions was added, they were disposed of in the biohazard waste.
Procedure: Reculturing the July 7 Biofilms
To culture the biofilms from yesterday, 300 μL of LB media was added to one well for one of microtiter plate that had been degraded with cleaner. The media was then pipette up and down to mix with any remnants of the biofilms. The media was then pipetted back into the 5 mL tube of LB media. 5 μL of KAN was added to the 5 mL tube of LB media.
Process was repeated for the remaining two plates that used different cleaners.
Note: Before cultures were degraded using the different cleaners, Kieran had taken a sample of the biofilms and prepared a 5 mL tube of LB to culture the biofilm that would be ensured to grow.
Cultures were left to grow 24 hours in 37˚C incubator.
Procedure: New Biofilms
New biofilms were created for July 9 testing. Same protocol used as June 30. Instead of using crystal violet dye, we are using E.coli DH5α cells with RFP (PSB4K5). 2 μL of KAN was added to 2 mL centrifuge tubes along with "

Tel-Hai shared their ideas on the publicity of synthetic biology with us. They are trying to explain what synthetic biology is in a fresh and more attractive way. That is to put together a trivia game, set of questions from groups doing multiple things. The questions potentially could be shared with local students not involved with the competition but who wish to learn more about synthetic biology and entrepreneurship in the field of biotechnology. To spread the game better and further and to make up the shortcoming that they cannot get the information about what we are doing before October, they need to collaborate with other teams. Once we received their email, we made effort to make a plan to show our understanding about our project and synthetic biology. Then considering Tel Hai’s advice, we finally collected the fun relevant stories and turned them into a range of questions, including the creative ideas in the experiment design, mistakes that should to be avoided. All the contents are collected to educate those who want to enter the stronghold of synthetic biology. Furthermore, we had a deeper understanding towards synthetic biology, which was helpful for us to dig deeper in our project through the collaboration.
What’s more, we sent them a photo where there is a rose. They were collecting 65 roses to make a picture serving their project. Attracted by their creativity, we decided to join their project in such an interesting way.

Part Documentation
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)

IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

Throughout the game, we advertised the iGEM to freshmen, and introduced our project this year. It was worth mentioning that we also collected solicited opinions from all the students about the feasibility of treatment by biological method for water pollution. 66.7% of participants showed positive attitudes towards bio-method, with the common sense of effects caused by microorganisms are easier to handle than chemical hazarders. Besides, only 3.7% students thought two dealing ways were equal. Whole results statistics
The First Synthetic Biology Debate in XMU
Oct 22th
2017
We organized the First Synthetic Biology Debate in XMU in the October 21st. XMU debating team as well as the College of chemistry and chemical engineering college debating team argued about if the disadvantages of artificial transformation of life to human development outweigh the advantages. As this event was faced to whole range of students, it greatly popularized synthetic biology in the whole academy.
-----* Idea and Wisdom *-----
No one can make great progress without advice and golden ideas from their excellent partners. During last six month, we participated in some iGEM conferences or even worked as the innovative online meeting organizers. Hopefully these events contributed greatly to all of us.
The 5th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference
Jul 30th
to Aug 4th
2017
Firstly, we participated in the 5th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference, a big gathering for Asian iGEM teams held by National Chiao Tung University. More than 20 teams have brought their projects there and we all have had our posters and presentations. It was a good opportunity to practice for the final Jamboree and the first time to present our project frankly to iGEMers from Asia. By exchanging ideas and current progresses, we got suggestions from other team members and teachers, which had great influence on our next work.
Peking & Tsinghua & XMU communication
Aug 6th
2017
Secondly, in the afternoon of August 6th, we went to Beijing to meet the iGEM team of the Tsinghua University and the Peking University, communicating and discussing our project designs, human practice, team construction and management. They gave us a variety of advice and, at the same time, practical feedbacks were made by us too. And after the end of the exchanging communication, our team still offered online help about Human Practice part for the Tsinghua University.

Result
- Even no band for the uncut plasmid. There is a problem with plasmid miniprep, we will try again with less (more diluted) cells for plasmid miniprep.
- New plasmid miniprep (the pellets from 20mL of LB is diluted into 1.2ml instead of 0.6)
- New single digest
- New gel (same lanes than before)
Result
- One band for everything, but the same size than the uncut plasmid. Moreover, this uncut plasmid should be 3000bp, and here, it is more. So, we have a problem in the growth of cells, we will try again and check the 10ml tube which is used to inoculate the big flask and also the big flask.

BBa_K568005 - Intermediate optogenetical AND-Gate without T7ptag:
This part is a precursor of the finished optogenetical AND-Gate. You could add any coding sequence carrying one or multiple amber mutations behind this part which would result into expression of the desired protein when irradiated by both blue and red light.
BBa_K568006 - Intermediate synthetic part:
This part is contained in the optogenetical AND-gate. This part consists of 5 subparts which are very small. Because cloning such small parts is difficult and time consuming, we decided to have this part synthesized by GeneArt.
BBa_K568007 - GFP under constitutive promoter:
This part serves as a positive control in our quantitative GFP assays. It consists of gfp with rbs and terminator, which is under control of a constitutive promotor.
BBa_K568008 - Red light promotor with GFP reporter:
This part was constructed so that we were able to characterize our red light promotor with a quantitative GFP assay in addition to our lacZ Miller assay. It consists of gfp with rbs and terminator, which is under control of the red light promotor.
Data For Pre-existing Parts
Experience - BBa_K322127 (Edinburgh, 2010): Phycocyanobilin synthesis genes and red light detection system
We used this part in two ways: First of all, we used PCR to amplify the parts needed for red light detection from this part, generating BBa_K568000. Secondly, we compared parts BBa_K322127 and BBa_K568000 using a Miller Assay. Unfortunately, this part did not produce the results we hoped for.
Experience - BBa_I746907 (Cambridge, 2007): T7 promoter driving 6-his tagged P7 GFP
We used this as additional reporter plasmid and did an IPTG induced GFP assay to verify the part. It worked perfectly for us.

NRPSDesigner 2.0:
REST API: Programatically access the wealth of knowledge available in the NRPSDesigner database, design domains for new peptides or get suggestions for DNA assembly of the former.
Even more modifications: Add cyclizations, heterocyclizations, reductions and oxidations to your final NRP.
More safety: Categorize species according to their safety level and issue appropriate warnings for non-S1 organisms. Automatically disable design of NRPS for known or predicted toxic peptides.
Structure pattern matching: Rather than having to enter the sequence of monomers for the final NRPs, the user will be able to enter the structure of a molecule of choice and the NRPSDesigner will use structure matching algorithms in order to check whether this molecule is a NRP and suggest a cloning strategy if this is the case.
Multiplasmid cloning strategies: For very large NRPS, nature splits the domains on multiple coding sequences and the translated proteins are then combined by N-terminal and C-terminal communication domains. Thus, rather than having to assemble huge constructs on single plasmids, the NRPSDesigner will be able to suggest constructs split across multiple plasmids.
Improved Gibthon: More state of the art algorithms for automated primer suggestions allow synthesis of short DNA sequences, such as RBS, in the 5’ end of the primers and possibly include other cloning techniques, such as Golden Gate assembly.

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!
Zhisheng YU
Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.

Bologna,2008,Team:Bologna#UV radiation#_-_-_TEXT.html," light and Lexa protein controls the expression of 43 genes [2] that cooperate together to repair the extensive genetic  damage. RecA and LexA proteins play an important rule on the regulatory of SOS Recombination System.  A LexA binding site is present in all the SOS promoters genes' and it works as a repressor of SOS system. In presence of DNA damage (DNA Single Strains) RecA becomes active and interacts with LexA protein , the repressor of the SOS genes [3]. This interaction triggers the autocatalytic cleavage of LexA and consequent destruction of its ability to function as a repressor, which results in the derepression of SOS genes [4] [5]
When the damage is repaired, DNA single strains are not present in the cell and the RecA protein no longer promotes the auto-cleavage of the LexA which is restored to its initial repression level.
LAB Experiment
In our genetic bi-stable, the amount of molecules produced to switch the system from the two possible steady state is ruled by LacI and TetR protein. The production of LacI molecules by UV induction can be tested replacing the LacI gene by GFP, so it is possible to have a relation of the strength of LacI synthesis measuring the value of its fluorescence. BBa_K079049 and BBa_K079050  are two new construct submitted to the registry by Bologna’s Igem Team 2008. These UV test circuits can be presented schematically by the following sequence:
Promoter Constitutive Family: BBa_J23118 (1429 strength ) or BBa_23100 (2547 strength);
LexA Operator Site Binding (K079040 ) ;
Rbs with Green fluorescence Protein LVA and Terminator (BBa_I763020)
In order to generate the induction by Uv, a box with UV lamp was realized.

Generally, E. Coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are good platforms to express proteins from eukaryon or prokaryote. But considering the cost of our product in the natural world. Algae will be a better choice for us because they can make use of sunshine to produce proteins by photosynthesis. Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii is a typical genus of green alga. The integrating data of genome, high efficiency of protein express and mature systems of culture and transform. Therefore, we constructed six toxin express devices as Figure9.
 
9.The Culture and Transformation of Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii
The most transformation is based on electro transformation technology. But due to the unknown reasons, we still could not transform Hsp70A-Rbc S2 Promoter-Intron-Cry10Aa-2A-Cyt-Terminator device into Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii. With the help from SZU-China, they helped us to transform it by glass-bead technology. You also can find the culture and transformation protocols in the Protocol page. 
10.Bioassay of Toxins Express Devices
After building toxins express devices and transforming them into Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii, we decided to test the toxicity to the larvae of mosquitoes. You can find the Bioassay process and result in the Proof of Concept.

11.Co-Immunoprecipitation Experiment (BNU-China Collaboration)
BNU-CHINA wanted to detect paclitaxel by using microtubule which expressed in E. coli. As we all know, microtubule which assembled by α-subunit and β-subunit is the Cytoskeleton in eukaryotes, but E. coli is prokaryote. So it is essential to verify whether microtubule assembled successfully or not in E. coli. If microtubule assembled successfully, that’s meaningα-subunit and β-subunit have biological activities and have interaction in E. coli. So, our team planned to use Co-Immunoprecipitation(Co-IP) to confirm their interaction. Because PET30a has the His protein tag"
Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#HumanPractices#Killswitch#Regulation_-_-_TEXT.html," glucose. We could supplement the bioreactor with glucose to inhibit expression of the kill genes in the bioreactor. Escape of bacteria into the tailings ponds would cause expression of the kill genes due to lack of glucose in the surrounding environment.
This promoter, known as pRha ( BBa_K902065 ), is responsible for regulating genes related to rhamnose metabolism and contains a separate promoter on its leading and reverse strands (see Figure 8). RhaR ( BBa_K902069 )  and RhaS ( BBa_K902068 ) serve to regulate expression of the rhamnose metabolism operon rhaBAD. The RhaR transcription factor is activated by L-rhamnose to up-regulate expression rhaSR operon. In turn, the resulting RhaS activates the rhaBAD operon to generate the rhamnose metabolism genes (Egan & Schleif, 1993).
Figure 8: The rhamnose metabolism genes as they exist in Top Ten E. coli
Figure 9: The rhamnose metabolism genes native to E. coli
Our kill system is different from the native rhamnose system with the rhaR and rhaS control genes. We have constitutively expressed RhaS to overcome dependency on rhamnose to cause activation of the kill switch. While RhaS is continuously present, the system is shut off in the presence of glucose. However, in the outside environment glucose levels are lower such that RhaS is able to activate the kill genes.
Building the system
Our team had pRha promoter ( BBa_K902065 ) commercially synthesized as per the sequence given by Jeske and Altenbuchner (2010). The rhaS ( BBa_K902068 ) and rhaR ( BBa_K902069 )  genes were amplified via PCR from Top 10 E. coli using Kapa HiFi polymerase.
We tested the unoptimized rhamnose system using a fluorescent output.
Figure 10: This has Prha-RBS-GFP that was incubated under different conditions. We can see a large increase with 0.2% rhamnose, 0.5% rhamnose whereas there is no GFP expression in the cells incubated with glucose.
Figure 10 shows that the rhamnose system works as expected. The system is turned off with 0.2% glucose whereas GFP is significantly upregulated with 0.2% rhamnose and even more with 0.5%"

They took deep interest and participated actively. We also conducted a survey with a different questionnaire and handed a copy of our documentation on Pollution, so as to make them fully aware of entire issue. Finally, we gave them an insight into the working of iGEM IIT Delhi, and encouraged them to be a part of our team next year. The spirit and enthusiasm shown by them was a sure indicator of the influence our visit had on them.

Introduction
Precise and high-throughput biological part characterization is at the very core of Catalytic Activity Sequencing (CAT-Seq) system. It is the next generation activity measurement system capable of simultaneous recording of large libraries of catalytic biomolecules or regulatory parts. The system output is simple, yet extremely useful - every unique biomolecule sequence receives a parameter, which denotes the activity of that biological part.
CAT-Seq is best explained with an example - we strongly suggest to read the design section first!
Catalytic Biomolecule activity measurement
CAT-Seq provides a way to simultaneously measure the activities of billions of catalytic biomolecules in a single experiment by recording the activity information for each unique biomolecule into its coding DNA sequence. This is achieved by quickly encapsulating single biomolecule templates in separate droplets together with special Substrate Nucleotides. The substrate nucleotides have a substrate attached to them, and they act as a target for the catalytic biomolecule. The catalytic biomolecule can then turn the Substrate Nucleotide into the Product Nucleotide. During the DNA amplification in each droplet, this activity is recorded, and by quantifying the number of product nucleotides we can assess the activity of each individual biomolecule simultaneously.
Regulatory part activity measurement
CAT-Seq can also be effortlessly adjusted to measure the activities and cross-interactions of numerous transcriptional or translational regulatory parts instead. The amount of product nucleotide depends not only on the catalytic biomolecule activity, but also on the amount of the biomolecule.
If we would take a library, wherein all of the constructs have the exact catalytic biomolecule sequence, yet unique regulatory sequences, we would have different amounts of catalytic biomolecule depending on the regulatory sequence in each droplet. Moreover, the amount of product nucle"

Conclusions
By utilising our DNA Degradation Switch Model we were able to verify that our initial design concept was plausible as well as identify exactly those promoters and ribosome binding sites which in combination lead to particular activation times directly informing our part design. Figure 5 shows the results for model run 684 with . Run 684 was selected to be used as the basis for our part design due to its 11.45 hour activation time which we deemed long enough when tested in the wet lab to validate the production of a significant delay before degradation switch activation and yet short enough not to make validation too laborious. To read more about the wet lab protocol we designed in collaboration with Team Vilnius-Lithuania for degradation switch validation see our collaboration page here .
Figure 5 - mRNA and Protein levels for 11.45 hour activation time Degradation Switch
Despite the success of our modelling approach there are some simplifications which were necessary to make due to lack of knowledge about parameter values invloved in a more complex solution. The main simplification which may contribute to inaccurate results was to not account for leakiness in the expression of I-SceI which may cause premature linearization of pImm and hence premature activation of degradation switch due to a lack of data on the leakiness of the arabinose promoter under which I-SceI is expressed. We felt secure that this simplification would not have a major impact on our predictions due to the observation that maxicell progenitor strain DL2524 does not spontaneously decay into maxicells without induction of I-SceI by addition of arabinose as would happen if this promoter was significantly leaky. Despite our inability to evaluate such a system we have designed a system of Ordinary Differential Equations to take leakiness into account which is presented here as our extended model.
Extended Model
Figure 6 - Extended DNA Degradation Switch Ordinary Differential Equations
Examining the extended model we can see the main changes from our simple degradation switch model are in the equations governing:
Rate of Change of Imm2 mRNA - We modulate the production term of Imm2 mRNA based on the percentage of pImm plasmids remaining unlinearized allowing us to keep track of the exact rate of change of Imm2 mRNA as plasmids are linearized.
Rate of Change of I-Sce1 mRNA - I-Sce1 is expressed under an arabinose promoter. The addition term in this equation represents the standard method"

They also offered us the gene which could be added as the kill switch, helping us to notice the importance of using a kill switch to make our bacteria safer. Of course, we  give some methods to help with their experiments and shared some experience about our project. Because this is the first time to attend for the iGEM, we are very appreciated that Unesp_Brazil could share experience with us and adopted our ideas even though we are a new team for iGEM.
Collaboration with XJTLU-CHINA
    At the beginning of the iGEM, we have already contacted with the XJTLU-CHINA since they have rich experience about igem. They held a seminar to introduce the rules of the igem which helped us to start our project in a correct way and they also gave us many instruct in our human practice. They had some problems about website construction,  so we put forward some advice and finally they solved the problems. We also help them make a mind map which you could see in their wiki. We are appreciated XJYLU-CHINA and hope we will have more collaboration in the future.

Date Rape Drugs
Prevention and Diagnostics
Overview
Date rape drugs are a wide-spread issue. Intoxication can have serious effects on health and emotional state. We established a new, easy to use biosensor which is able to detect possible ingredients of date rape drugs. In combination with our cell free designs, the sensor is applicable for everyone in the open field. The usage is not limited to the testing of beverages, but might also be applicable in diagnostics.
The term date rape drug is referring to sedatives, that may cause unconsciousness, loss of will and ability to resist assault ( Jansen and Theron 2006 ). In addition, a frequent consequence of date rape drugs is memory loss. A chemical often used as date rape drug is GHB, gamma-hydroxy butyrate. While GHB is regulated by law in certain countries, precursors are publicly available. One of these precursors is GBL, gamma-butyrolactone. In Germany and the UK this precursor can be purchased by the general public. After ingestion of GBL, the substance is rapidly converted into GHB and therefore has the same effects ( Busardò and Jones 2015 ). Trace amounts of GHB occur naturally in the human body. It is supposed to function as a precursor of one of the main neurotransmitters, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). GABA is a substance available without any restrictions.

We also included a brief history about the development of synthetic biology in the lecture, hoping to impress them about the mechanism in biological world and thus they might be attracted into the field of biology in the future.
After that we showed them around our laboratory and introduce our equipments to them. In addition, procedure and some rules of using peptites were also taught to them. Many of the high school students showed strong interest in our project and biological experiments.
Then we played a video describing our daily experiments in laboratory, which was transcribed in advance. The video consists of four parts, plasmids extraction, making mediums, digging out single colonies and electrolysis, which were completed by four of our team members, respectively. With that video, high school students could gain more detailed and comprehensive knowledge of our experiments and project. In this way, we aimed to enhance their interest about synthetic biology.
Finally, since it is the 10th year that we have attended iGEM, the history of USTCers' participating in iGEM was told to them. We encouraged them to study harder to join us one day, so that our glory will be continued by THEMSELVES.
Although nowadays it become difficult for public to catch up with the rapidly developing science, we still believe few can influence many with their constructive suggestions and going into action so that one day people in China, even all over the world, will go forward with science shoulder by shoulder.
Introduction of iGEM to freshmen
In the beginning of this semester we held a lecture for freshmen of our university to introduce iGEM competition as well as our project to them. By holding this lecture we wish to encourage those new students who are interested in synthetic biology and likely to choose biology as their major to try to learn more about this field and participate in iGEM competition next year.
Kaiyue Ma, the leader of Team USTC, gave them an introduction about molecular biology told them what the scientists do with the technique of synthetic biology. During the lecure, we tried to show that scientists hire the cutting-edge technology to explore the complex metabolic process of organisms and creat new applications for practical use such as Genetically Modified Organisms and treatment for diseases at the same time.
The lecture also included brief introductions of our project this year. The leader shared with them information about the spliting of GFP protein and the aggregation of prions. In addition, he talked about the iGEM competition and our trial and errors and of course achievements in our experiments and researches. In"

Also, when theophylline is absent, clover version 3 shows less fluorescence intensity. It turns out that clover version 3 responses to theophylline more sensitively, thus more efficient to regulate.
Results show that our improvement of clover version 2 succeeds. Clover version 3 behaves more responsive to theophylline than clover version 2 thus more controllable and tunable. See original data . And in clover version 3, primary scaffold function in the absence of theophylline is inconspicuous, which foresees in our future design and optimization, the alloscaffold’s behavior could reach “0-1” step response (when theophylline is absent, alloscaffold almost doesn’t work; when adding theophylline, alloscaffold works as scaffold significantly.)

At the beginning of the experiment, we directly constructed the plasmids of YebF-IL10 and                 YebF-myrosinase, but the effect of extracellular detection was not satisfactory. During the                 participation in CCiC, iGEMer suggested that we first start from testing the performance of the                 secretory tag, so we constructed the plasmid YebF-GFP shown in Figure 5A. To express IL10 and                 myrosinase, we constructed plasmids IL10-flag and myrosinase-his as shown in Figure 5B and Figure 5C.

When testing the validity of the secretory tag YebF, we transformed the constructed YebF-GFP plasmid                 into DH5α and cultured overnight at 37 ℃. The supernatant was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and                 the supernatant was taken for fluorescence detection. The results are shown in the Figure 6. But we                 forgot to set up a positive control group. Due to time constraints, we have no time to repeat this                 experiment.

     In the condition of 13 Celsius degrees and 80% relative humidity (9 hours) the spore germination rate by experiment is 5.41%. And according to our formula that the spore germination is 6.84%.
     The result can proof that our formula is quite precise.

Conclusion:
     Our final formula is:
$$ f_1 \times f_2 = [(-0.0625x_1^3 + 2.9974x_1^2 - 37.865x_1 + 141.8)\div 100]\times [(316.88x_2 - 216.88)\div 100] $$
     where x1 is temperature and x2 is relative humidity.
     According our experiment result, we prove that temperature and relative humidity is an independent event and our formula is quite precise.
Combined with IoTtalk
     IoT immediately detects temperature and humidity (per hour detection), and we put the temperature and humidity condition that IoT detected into the formula we developed to calculate spore germination. If the spore germination rate exceeds a certain value, we will inform the user that the disease may occur.
     If both of the predicted results are above the threshold, the user will be advised to spray the pesticide. The data sent back to IoT system simultaneously and the user can decide whether to automatically spray.
     When the germination rate exceeds the threshold, we will advise the user to spray the corresponding peptide.

Abstract: We have synthesized a 582,970–base pair Mycoplasma genitalium genome. This synthetic genome, named M. genitalium JCVI-1.0, contains all the genes of wild-type M. genitalium G37 except MG408, which was disrupted by an antibiotic marker to block pathogenicity and to allow for selection. To identify the genome as synthetic, we inserted “watermarks” at intergenic sites known to tolerate transposon insertions. Overlapping “cassettes” of 5 to 7 kilobases (kb), assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides, were joined by in vitro recombination to produce intermediate assemblies of approximately 24 kb, 72 kb (“1/8 genome”), and 144 kb (“1/4 genome”), which were all cloned as bacterial artificial chromosomes in Escherichia coli. Most of these intermediate clones were sequenced, and clones of all four 1/4 genomes with the correct sequence were identified. The complete synthetic genome was assembled by transformation-associated recombination cloning in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, then isolated and sequenced. A clone with the correct sequence was identified. The methods described here will be generally useful for constructing large DNA molecules from chemically synthesized pieces and also from combinations of natural and synthetic DNA segments.

Transformed <partinfo>BBa_J61101</partinfo> from the iGEM-plate into KRX and plated it on AMP-selection-dish.
Team Cultivation & Purification:
Made precultures of E. coli KRX without plasmid (negative control) and with plasmids containing BBa_K863020 , BBa_K863000 , BBa_K863005 , BBa_K863010 , and BBa_K863015 . As positive control we used BBa_K525710 (Ligase A) .

XMU-China,2012,Team:XMU-China#wetlabjournal_-_-_TEXT.html," increased at first and fade gradually. Maybe Ca-Alginate beads  without LB medium can live and product green fluorescence protein in Arabinose.
Fluorescence  Test:
 We  took fluorescence measurements in a time interval of 15 minutes in the same  gradient as last test. Although every curve still kept a good tendency, they  showed that top values were totally low. We thought the new plate with week  colonies should take the blame after a discussion. By now, on the other hand,  we have gotten enough data so that we can determine the most suitable level of  arabinose concentration.

Digit  Display:
When  Sophia add 100μL aliquot DH5α liquid culture to new LB medium, she also performed a negative control by  adding same aliquot to LB with Amp. But after 1h45min incubation, the negative  control turned opaque. So she had no choice but to give up newly made  competence cells, using the one made two weeks ago to instead, which preserved  in -80ºC. We held little hope for this transformation.

Experiment:
Goal:
1. To  prepare intra-hollow Ca-alginate capsules.
2. To  prepare blank capsules: SA: 1%, CaCl2: 10%, CMC: 1.2%. 10mL CaCl2 +10mL CMC,  mixing thoroughly. Drew  the mixture in a 10mL injector, then dropped it one by one through the pinhead  into 100mL  SA solution, gel  for 10 min. Then rinsed the capsules.
3. To  prepare  intra-hollow capsules: SA: 1%,  CaCl2: 2%, CMC: 1.2%. 1mL sterile water + 5mL CaCl2 + CMC  mixture, mixing thoroughly. Drew the  mixture in a 10mL injector, then dropped it one by one through the  pinhead into 100mL  SA solution,  gel for 5 min. Then rinsed the capsules and put them into 3% CaCl2 solution,  stirring for 20 min.
Prepared  calcium alginate and embed engineering bacteria with plasmid PBAD-RLT. Modified  the ratio of cells and sterile water to 1:5.
Design:
The  design of the card is undergoing extensive modification.

It has already been told that this protein is the most potent and efficient thrombolytic agent popular in clinical practice. It does this by activating plasminogen, a common anticoagulative factor zymogen found in normal bloodstream. By the conversion of plasminogen into plasmin, an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of the cleavage of fibrin, the main clot component, thrombolysis begins to degrade the clot. (IUBMB Enzyme Nomeclature 1992; MetaCyc 2014) This activity has been shown synthetically in E.coli and experimentally in vitro. (Pennica et al. 1983; Van de Werf et al. 1984)
Superoxide Dismutase-1 (SOD-1)
SOD is a powerful and essential antioxidant enzyme which converts and scavenges free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), slightly less harmful compound in order to convey it to the second step reaction which detoxifies H2O2 into water. (Batelli et al. 1972; Baudry et al. 1993; Gonzalez et al. 1995; Doctrow et al. 1996)
In our body cells, there are three different subtypes of SOD enzyme in different cellular levels. SOD-1 exists in cytoplasm, SOD-2 in mitochondria and SOD-3 is in extracellular matrix. We have chosen SOD-1 to take advantage of easy interference and activity capacity due to its location. Additionally , there is evidence in the literature for the synthetic production of SOD-1 enzyme by transfecting human cells. (Shuvaev et al. 2013)
Glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1)
GPx is a known antioxidant enzyme abundant in human body cells which drives the H2O2 scavenge into water. (Mills 1957; Sunde 1997, IUBMB Enzyme Nomenclature 1989)
Glutathione (GSH) is a peptide consisting of three amino acid residues, glutamate, cysteine and glycine, respectively. It is a natural cellular component for preventing damage to organelles caused by reactive oxygen species, free radicals or peroxides.
In cell, GSH appears in different components or biochemical structures. GSH is a cofactor for GPx enzyme that the thiol group of cysteine in GSH is able"
