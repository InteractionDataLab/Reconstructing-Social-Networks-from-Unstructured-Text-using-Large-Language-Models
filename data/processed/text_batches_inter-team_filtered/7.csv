However, when asked about their knowledge of more specific cancer immunotherapy concepts, the proportion of “smatter”, “only hear of” or “blind” answers increased. Furthermore, doctors have a somewhat prudent attitude towards immunotherapy. Among all of 74 replies, only twelve of doctors agreed on “immunotherapy has strong specificity”, eight agreed on “immunotherapy has a slight side effect”, six agreed on “immunotherapy has a good effect”. The majority hold a neutral or even negative opinion. In contrast, the public showed a rather positive attitude towards immunotherapy. 74 out of 126 stayed neutral, only 3 showed an obvious rejection, while 49 were for this new therapy. Unfortunately, the public sample had a rather low frequency about knowing the information about cancer immunotherapy. 44 out of 124 had learned related information in the last month, while 62 had learned in the last half year."",""74 medical professionals surveyed, 191 public surveys completed"",""Doctors generally have a negative attitude toward immunotherapy. In part, this shows that immunotherapy requires more research and clinical trials; real technological advances are key to the development of therapies. This belief led Fudan iGEM to work on SwordS, their 2017 project. Furthermore, though the frequency of doctors' knowledge is satisfactory, it can still be strengthened. As could be expected, knowledge of cancer immunotherapy is even lower among the general public. The insufficiency of bio-engineering knowledge in public is an important reason why people have antipathy to new drugs or therapies, though they are helpful."",,""Fudan iGEM created two questionnaires, one for the general public and one for medical experts, to gauge knowledge of, attitudes towards, and attention to immunotherapy-based cancer treatments."",,,

Tianjin,2011,Team:Tianjin#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," in food consumers. However, it is unjustifiable to veto the whole technology because of unfamiliarity of SB. Synthetic biology, which has its application in medicine, research, industrial, agriculture, has contributed to relevant fields besides food industry. The mass production of vaccine are made possible by genetically engineered E. coli; the specific function of a particular gene causing a diseaseare revealed by the adding or removing fragments of gene using GM technology; industrial applications involving GE bacteria being investigated involve making the bacteria perform tasks outside their natural cycle, such as cleaning up oil spills, carbon and other toxic waste; etc.. There is a whole universe of Synthetic Biology waiting for the public to discover and understand.
This time, the revolution of biofuel offered us a great opportunity to change the view of the public about GE technology and to promote the understanding and application of the technology at the same time. On the verge of the new energy revolution, public are frequently exposed under the news of the development, and they have many chances and wills to absorb new terms and ideas. Therefore, companies from various fields should join hands together to launch a campaign to promote the impression of GE technology in public’s mind. This is about not only the marketing of one specific company, but also concerning the advance of the technology that have already reshaped our world.
Although we still have to take serious precautions about the potential hazard of GMOs, we should hide no more. In the process of promoting GM biofuel, we should emphasize the GM traits of the yeast; letting public knows that synthetic biotechnology is always by their side. By overtly telling customs that SB is around them and contributing to their living environment, people will come to realize the presence of SB, judge it for themselves. For instance, every gas station that sells GM-yeast-produce biofuel should present a clear label saying ‘Made Possible and Better by Synthetic biotechnology’; capsules and vaccines that are produced by GM organisms can label that ‘thousands of lives are saved by Synthetic biotechnology’. Those progressive campaigns may shock the public in the beginning, but in the end, they may understand and appreciate the magnificence of the technology.
A new era has been unveiled. Together with the public, let us embrace the unprecedented scientific leap with our passion for synthetic engineering for a better future.

Reductionism in Synthetic Biology, an Ethical Issue
Since genetic engineering was first applied in 1973, research on enhancing micro-organisms has taken a leap. The ability to change the behavior of biological systems by modifying the genetic code has been the basis for research in synthetic biology. Although the possibilities of synthetic biology seem promising and applications are virtually endless, concerns are raised about the fast progression, possible risks and ethical implications.
A rough division of the different main concerns in synthetic biology is shown in Figure 1. Ethical and political issues concerning bio-safety, bio-security and intellectual property rights have been discussed elaborately. Ethical discussions concerning the top-down (reductionist) approach towards understanding living systems and the bottom-up approach of enhancing/creating biological systems are lagging behind. Craig Venter, one of the lead researchers in synthetic biology, is working on a controversial project with a goal to create artificial life. He is one of many that use the reductionist and bottom-up approach in biology to search for the foundation of life.
Figure 1. Road map illustrating a rough division of the main issues in synthetic biology, based on a presentation of Dr. Arthur Caplan.
Reductionism can be explained as an approach to understand complex systems by reducing them to their subsystems. In biology, a way to understand the nature of complex living entities is by looking at the function of individual components (e.g. DNA, proteins) and their relations. The bottom-up approach of (re-)engineering biological systems is the modifying of such components, mainly by genetic engineering techniques. How the different approaches are related to understanding life and creating artificial life is shown in Figure 2. More information on ethical issues in synthetic biology can be found in the Background section.
Figure 2. Road map illustrating the connection between the reductionist and bottom-up approaches in understanding and creating life respectively.
How do the public and the scientific community feel and think about life-related questions and the reductionism approach in biology? These are difficult questions. But now that we are"

We emailed Dr. Grose the contact information for two research groups that have worked with Bacillus lentus. The first group is based out of South Africa and is working on using Subtilisin Savinase to break down a variety of biofilms. However, Dr. Grose remembered that they attempted to contact this team last year and were unable to get any kind of response. Also, shipping the bacteria samples that we need from South Africa would be tricky so we found a research group at John Hopkin's University that was doing research with Bacillus lentus. They weren't doing anything related to biofilms, but were using the bacteria that we need. I emailed the contact info to Dr. Grose and she sent them an email. We are now just waiting to hear back from them.

Even though this disease is long known, researchers have still not been able to develop a good diagnostic tool. However, alternatives are available, meaning viral diagnostics have higher priority. As a lot is known about HAT, it is a good example to prove that our device can be used in fighting parasitic diseases. In his opinion, our device should contain a positive control, and an LED-screen for quantitation of the result would be a good addition.
"",1 expert,""Dr. Philippe Büscher is an expert on Trypanosomiasis and part of the WHO Collaborating Center for Research and Training on Human African Trypanosomiasis Diagnostics; OIE Reference Laboratory for Surra. He told an in-depth story about the history of HAT in Africa. After the colonizers left Africa, e.g. after the independence of Congo from Belgium, the health system collapsed and Sleeping Sickness re-emerged. This shows that these countries largely rely on western NGOs. To this day, the WHO, other NGOs, and companies are providing free diagnostics and treatment for HAT patients in Congo. This is expensive and costs US$ 100-200 per patient.
Currently mobile teams leave from a central point, after which they travel up to 20 days a month to remote villages on motorbikes or 4x4s. The tests they are carrying is either the Card Agglutination Test, with a high false positive rate, or an antibody dipstick test, without positive control. It is important that our device does not need much equipment, is stable at 40 degrees Celsius and has a positive control.
Moreover, he gave some technical details on the detection limit of current devices, and on HAT protein production. He showed us the current tests and explained how they are exactly performed. Finally, some suggestions for alternative use of our device were made. For example to test antibiotic resistance or to be used in reference laboratories. Here, sensitivity of detection is more important than speed of producing a result.
He endorsed our 3D-printed device prototype and was surprised by the ease of use and to observe the fluorescence. He thought it would be a nice addition to quantify the fluorescent signal and to add an LED-screen. This is in line with the opinions of prof. dr. Wim van de Poel and dr. Jeroen Kortekaas in previous talks. Finally, he suggested to increase the readability of the text on the device, and to indicate the place to insert the controls and the samples.

Due to the DIY and open-sourced nature of TERRA, we believed that TERRA could be adopted by DIY bio labs to streamline their workflows and increase the accessibility of microfluidics. To learn more about the greater DIY bio space and the obstacles they face in regards to adopting microfluidics, we reached out to BosLab and Cap City Biohackers, which are DIY bio labs located in Boston and Columbus respectively.
Our discussion with BosLab gave our team insight to the obstacles inhibiting widespread adoption of microfluidics. While many scientists are aware of microfluidics and its
potential advantages, the lack of standardization and useful demonstrations have left scientists skeptical to adopting a microfluidic platform. For example, past microfluidic workshops at BosLab did not effectively demonstrate and explain how to utilize microfluidics for general scientists.
Because of this gap in communication, we realized that the user’s experience with TERRA is essential for its adoption for both DIY bio labs and synthetic biologists. To support users, we created extensive documentation on how to assemble and use TERRA, accompanied with descriptions, pictures, and videos. In addition, we designed the UI under the assumption that users are not microfluidics experts to ensure that scientists in a variety of fields can use TERRA.
Cap City Biohackers gave us a different perspective of the greater DIY bio space because, unlike BosLab, they are newer and currently in the process of setting up their center. We learned the general process of how labs
acquire second-hand equipment and the wide range of resources and equipment DIY bio labs have. Because TERRA is DIY and open-sourced, it was important for us to know potential manufacturing and assembly constraints of DIY bio labs. In addition, we learned different experimental applications Cap City Biohackers had in mind for both TERRA and microfluidics in general, such as small-scale fed batch experiments and automated molecular cloning. Due to a wide array of potential applications, we designed TERRA to be application-agnostic as opposed to a device for specific microfluidic experiments. To handle a wide variety of potential applications, we included flush functionality for sterility and the TERRA Adapter.

The ethnographic method in this case study primarily consists of conducting participant observation as a team of UCL iGEM 2014, in which I, the author of Sociological Imaginations takes part in the case study itself while still maintaining a semi-outsider position. The idea of combining ethnography and participant observation came in first instance from an e-mail conversation with previous contestant Sara Aguiton, from the iGEM Paris 2009 team, who demonstrated the use of this method in the iGEM competition of that year. While she primarily applied it to ethical issues, I have attempted to focus on how to use it for sustainability research (Aguiton 2009). Being a participant of the team entails various channels of observation. The team convenes on an almost daily basis during the summer of 2014, usually in the Biosciences Common Room of UCL, initially handling specific issues of the project on specific days of the week. During the month of June, I attended meetings about two times a week to discuss Human Practice topics as they were the most relevant to my work. When I eventually noticed that the level of saturation was reached in the covered topics and themes, I started focussing more on online presence, primarily to the general public. Media such as Facebook – both internal communication and public communication, Twitter, e-mails and plenty of material on the team’s collective Google Drive folder. In addition to the offline and online ethnographic material, I conducted an extensive focus group with ten members of the team with the support of Alberto.
The qualitative data collected from these previous methods subsequently needs to be subjected to a method of analysis. This research will draw on Maarten Hajer’s (2000) conception of discourse analysis to answer the stated research questions through the lens of an environmental controversy. The issue of how synthetic biology is constructed and understood in relation to solving an environmental problem, in this case the leaching of azo dyes into the environment, has to be discussed by considering the contexts, social practices and contents attributed to the discourse. As a consequence, it will constitute a ""specific ensemble of ideas, concepts, and categorisations that are produced, reproduced, and transformed in a particular set of practices and through which meaning is given to physical and social realities"" (Hajer 2000: 44). Coherence is here not necessarily seen as a prerequisite to a discourse considering that the complexity and uncertainty of environmental problems usually engender a multitude of possible statements coming from different pockets of knowledge. For instance, synthetic biology for the prevention of azo dye pollution, consists of"

The Light System
Light inducible systems allow spatial and temporal control over gene expression.     Our goal is the expression of the mCAT-1 receptor through a light inducible     system to allow spatiotemporal control of the virus entry into the target cells.     We used two different systems: expression is induced by light of the blue and     red wavelength range. To test the performance of the light systems, we used an     assay where the cells express secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP).     The amount of produced SEAP can be measured by its enzymatic activity. It     breaks down the substrate para-nitrophenylphosphate to the yellow para-nitrophenol,     which can be measured with a spectrophotometer.
Function of the Light System
Because the proper function of the light system is important for our project,       we tested two different light systems. The red light system is based on the protein       phytochrome B (PhyB) from Arabidopsis thaliana and is activated by light around 660 nm,       whereas the blue light system contains a protein from Avena sativa (AsLOV2) which       requires 465 nm light for activation.
To test the function of the red light system, we used Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO)       that are known to work better for this purpose than other cell lines. For the blue       light system, we tested  CHO cells and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T).       As reporter the gene se"

2µl of each stock solution were diluted in Milli-Q water to achieve final solution volumes of 20µl to make 10µM reaction solutions. (The solutions are labelled as ""Prefix primer"" and ""suffix primer"" in eppendorf tubes in the fridge.)
Polymerase Chain Reaction
25µl reactions were run according to the PCR protocol here
* The final concentrations of the primers were noted as they are needed to determine the annealing temperatures for the primers, which can be done using NEB’s online tool here.
** Add components in order of decreasing volume for maximum ease-of-pipetting.
*** When reaction mixture is being made up, all components as well as the mixture itself are to be kept on ice, as the Master Mix is a high-fidelity polymerase that will recognize the primers as being incorrectly base-paired and be able to hydrolyse the primers if kept at room temperature.
**** Use Q5 enzyme in the cold room to avoid defrosting and freezing the original stock of Q5 enzyme. This could decrease the activity of Q5 enzyme. Bring ice bucket to the cold room to bring Q5 into the bench.
***** Make sure that the primer and small amounts of DNA and primer doesn’t stick onto the side of the tube or the tip.
The reaction mixture tubes were positioned in an Eppendorf Mastercycler nexus X2 and the PCR program was run.
* DNA denaturation can be performed at 98℃ because of the high thermal stability"

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

The Gist
For millions of years, bacteria have only transmitted information in a chemical fashion (i.e. Quorum sensing). It is now time to start a paradigm shift where communication is mediated by light , not only  through its presence or absence, but also through the wavelength(color) emitted, thus breaking spacial and chemical barriers.
We have implemented 3 emission and 3 reception modules for red, green, and blue light, and interconnected them so as to construct a light-based feedback loop of red-green-blue light, which will make the proof of concept of  communication over distance and proper signal decoding.
We are sure that this new level will soon change reasoning and design in synthetic biology while interfacing living systems with themselves and informational systems, as computers.
The time has come to embrace possibilities like intercontinental cell synchronization, bio cables, cuaternary (as opposed to binary) logic gates, computer controlled gene expression, and anything within the reach of human imagination.

Chapter II: Designing the Library
Figure 12: Library design of the quikchanged chemoreceptor Tar. (A) Schematic representation of the applied procedure for library generation of the quikchanged Tar_QC under a strong promoter. Saturated PCR mutagenesis was performed in two rounds. In the first step the mutagenesis primers, that randomly mutate three triplets and introduce a BsaI restriction site (scarless mutagenesis), were designed. In the second step the parent plasmid was amplified with these primers hybridizing to the parent plasmid pSB1C3_18C_TAR_QC. In step three, the parent plasmid was digested with DpnI and the mutated plasmid with BsaI to provide sticky ends. BsaI cuts outside the restriction site. In step four the plasmid was ligated and afterwards transformed with the mutated DNA into electrocompetent DH10B cells. Subsequently, the DNA was isolated for the second round of mutagenesis PCR (step five), where two other triplets were mutagenized repeating the previous steps. After finishing the 2nd round the plasmid library was isolated from the liquid culture. The 1st and 2nd round of the mutation library covered 105 clones. The two rounds were combined to one library with a final diversity of 2x 105. (B) Representative pictures of 0.8% Agarose gels from the 2nd saturated PCR mutagenesis round of step two after PCR (2), step three after double digest with DpnI and BsaI (3) and step four after ligation of the mutant plasmid (4).

Brown-Stanford,2011,Team:Brown-Stanford#PowerCell#NutrientSecretion_-_-_TEXT.html," fluorescence from chlorophyll is visible.
Transformed Anabaena with heterocysts stained by alcian blue. Heterocyst spacing corresponds to the ""off"" cells from the GFP image, implying that the sucrose secretion construct in not active in heterocysts, as desired.
After about 2 weeks of growth, we can confirm the correct regulation of our sugar secretion construct by our pSac promoter by observing the presence of the GFP reporter. GFP expression is on in vegetative cells, and off in heterocysts, which implies that the sugar secretion construct is only active in vegetative cells, as we desire. Work is currently underway to assay the sucrose concentrations that are generated by our construct. We hope that these concentrations will be high enough to support growth of E. coli W; our experiments suggest the minimum concentration is around 5 mM (see section below). If the concentrations are high enough, we intend to grow E. coli W hosting several arbitrary active BioBrick plasmids to show that PowerCell can power general biological tools. Updates will be posted here as they become available!
Utilizing sucrose from PowerCell
E. coli W
Sugarcane is an extremely low-cost source of bulk sucrose used in production
An essential aspect of the PowerCell project lies in microorganisms being able to survive off the nutrients being secreted by our genetically engineered Anabaena. Our carbon source, sucrose, is a disaccharide that is not necessarily able to be metabolized by all species.
Here our project intersects with current trends of bioproduction on Earth; sucrose is a cheap and easily obtained sugar, so there is interest in engineerable strains of microorganisms able to survive on it as a sole carbon source.
We came across research suggesting that E. coli W is one such promising strain. It is one of the few strains of non-pathogenic E. coli able to metabolize sucrose, has good tolerance for environmental stresses, and grows rapidly. (Archer 2011) There have been papers describing the process of adapting E. coli W as a bioreactor organism, and methods of growing them to high density and productivity using fed-batch cultures. (Lee 1993, Lee 1997).
In fact, the strain has already been used to produce a number of useful products. These include D(-)-lactate, a precursor to the formation of certain biodegradable plastic polymers, and L-alanine, a food additive and nutritional supplement. (Shukla 2004, Zhang 2007) With these examples, it is not"

During a couple of months spent on IGEM competition. She came across many outstanding teammates, from whom she harvested many new pieces of knowledge and experience. Though she may not continue the research work in the biological field, the precious experience thought she what ""scientific research"" really is.
Her summer vacation was spent in the laboratory where she served as an assistant. Out of lab she also did some paperwork such as translation and collecting some materials. She did some trivial works in HP and Hardware.
Although most of the time she acted as a ""manual worker"", she is willing to contribute to the team.

Tomorcolumn is another day.
Yuqing is a sophomore majoring in biology at UCAS.
The year just passed witnessed the vigorous gcolumnth of her, which was due to the learning and working experience with iGEM team members.
While she used to be quiet and nervous, experience in iGEM really changed her a lot. Now, she has been more outgoing and warm-hearted, and never afraid to face challenges and difficulties.
She still enjoys reading and traveling alone, but becomes more open to new friends and new ideas.

The expression of protein was then induced by adding 1mM of IPTG then the cells were grown for a further 6 hours at 20°C. Cells were then pelleted and washed in a buffer of 50mM Tris-HCl pH7.5. Cells were then lysed and centrifuged to remove any cell debris. A crude extract was loaded onto a nickel affinity column and the protein was eluted with an imidazole gradient. The results from this can be seen in Figure 3.

Finally, the success rate of this diagnostic kit in third-world countries was compared to western countries (The Netherlands) by asking the opinion of the students. Fifty percent believed that the use would be more accepted in The Netherlands because the Dutch population has a higher education level and would understand the purpose and the action of this kit and are thus more open to it. Here, people can afford health care and are used to novel techniques. About 30% believed that the use of this kit would be less accepted in The Netherlands because people are more aware of the dangers of GMO’s. Moreover, the health care in The Netherlands is satisfactory as it is. The other students were indecisive or thought there would not be a difference in acceptance levels.
When such a diagnostic kit would be available in The Netherlands, the ideal antigens to be detected according to the students are cancer and STDs. Moreover, Mono, HIV and Hepatitis B were mentioned, as well as tropical diseases for travelers.

Even better suitable for our purpose Prof. Wanner has developed a method in which he can correlate the fluorescence signal of a sample with the high resolution images obtained in SEM. As this kind of sample preparation, sample processing and imaging takes a while, we had to start 2 weeks before wiki freeze and at that point we did not have enough stably integrated T-REx 2cells, yet. Thus we used transient transfected, semi-stable MEXi HEK 293T cells that were pulled down with magnetic beads in order to increase the number of transgenic cells in the preparation and to show the specific binding of the beads to the cells. For this immunoprecipitation we incubated scAvidin-receptor and eMA-receptor cells with biotinylated magnetic beads and on the other side cells transfected with the BAP-receptor together with streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads. After the immunoprecipitation the cells were washed twice with PBS and it was visible that the portion of transgenic (red fluorescent) cells was largely increased after this procedure. The depicted SEM image shows two BAP-receptor transfected MEXi cells which have a cluster of magnetic streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads at their cellular interface. At the border of the cells the superimposed fluorescence image of these cells shows red fluorescence located at the periphery of the cells indicating the presence of mRuby3 fluorescent protein at the cellular membrane. The green fluorescence is caused by biotinylated eGFP that was used for other preparations on the same microscopic slide and came into contact with these cells when the suspension cells were sedimented on the microscopic slide by centrifugation. Although for a reliable conclusion one would have to evaluate several such images this figure already gives a valuable evidence that the BAP-receptor is present on the cells (although perhaps at lower levels) and can bind to strepavidin that was conjugated to the beads.
Design of an autotransporter construct for bacterial surface display
Besides the design of biotinylated and biotin-binding receptors for eukaryotic cells, we also wanted to apply our biotINK approach for prokaryotic cells. For this purpose, we designed an autotransporter device that is able to present biotinylated or biotin-binding protein domains on the surface of E. coli.

Most studies however involved the lysis of the enzyme-synthesizing bacterial chassis after the synthetic biological production of biofilm-degrading enzymes, either for the isolation and purification of said enzymes or for direct one-off release of enzymes into the extracellular environment for therapeutic purposes.
Our team is interested in not only a one-off pathogen-responsive antibiofilm/antimicrobial-releasing system as described above, but also a design with an enzyme secretion system that can exert its antibiofilm/antimicrobial effect without killing the chassis cell. This design would be especially useful in prophylactic applications, whereby these engineered antibiofilm bacteria can, for example, be immobilised on the surface of medical catheters or implants where the formation of biofilms are highly undesirable and autonomously secrete enzymes that destroy the pathogens' protective biofilms as well as the pathogenic bacteria themselves.
We will house our designed antibiofilm/antimicrobial system within E. coli K12, which is an extensively-studied, safe-to-use standard model organism widely adopted in both microbial genetic research as well as industrial applications. To achieve the design aims outlined above, we will need to functionalize our K12 with the following biological components:
Promoters that can trigger protein synthesis in response to the quorum sensors of pathogenic bacteria. In our case, we are targeting pathogenic P. aeruginosa and E. coli.
Antibiofilm enzymes, specifically those that can hydrolyse the biofilms of P.aeruginosa and E. coli.
Antimicrobial enzymes that can kill P. aeruginosa and E.coli.
Secretion tags which mark the synthesised enzymes for secretion from the bacteria.
Lysins that destroy our K12 to allow the release of the synthesised enzymes in a one-off, high concentration pulse.
We will be discussing the technical details of these parts mentioned here as well as some important underlying biochemical concepts in our next post, so please do stay tuned!
THE RISE AND FALL OF SHEWY
The project Shewy has its name from Shewanella, a bacteria that seemingly can carry out electrosynthesis. Based on the paper ""Towards Electrosynthesis in Shewanella"", we decided to further investigate the scheme for electron transfer in Shewy and to look at reversing it so that the bacteria were passing electrons into their environment.

Open University
     The Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar) organizes a popular (and free entry) meeting named “Universidade Aberta” (translated as “Open University”) since 1998. The major goal of Open University is to increase the interest of young citizens for the knowledge, science, as well as for academic careers that lead to a profession. People of all ages can attend the event, but the main target audience are high school students. The Open University is one of the most important academic event in the north-central region of São Paulo State, where live nearly 2 million inhabitants. This year, in September 22th and 23th, around 15,000 visitors from São Carlos and neighbor cities attended to the meeting, a special moment that integrated people from society and academy.
      We (members of Brasil-SP Team) presented about the perspectives of the Biotechnology career in Brazil, the Biotechnology Course offered by UFSCar, and as well as about Synthetic Biology. Presentations include one lecture, eight guided visits to molecular biology and microbiology local laboratories, and a total of 24 hours of interaction activities, from reception to dialogue with visitors at our stall, based on a rotating schedule of members (14 hours in Sept 22th and 10 hours in Sept 23th). In the labs, attendees received information about infrastructure, basic and applied research, and observed the differences between non-transformed bacteria compared to recombinant bacteria expressing GFP. In the stall, iGEMers presented different strategies to publicize both Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology, such as: plastic parts for assembly of three-dimensional structure of DNA and proteins; models of recombinant plasmid, E. coli, restriction enzymes, and BioBricks.

Results
In the pursuit of a possible linker and reporter method for our biosensor, we did a number of experiments.
AMC and linker substrate experiments
The AMC (a fluorescent molecule tied with a linker) experiment showed that we were able to detect a significant difference between the Bitis species and Naja nigricollis. The initial AMC substrate experiment led to a more comprehensive substrate screening experiment that resulted in multiple substrate candidates.
Assembly
We managed to assemble the peptide sequences into the plasmid backbone (pSB1C3), producing a number of basic parts. Overall, we submitted 11 linker parts and 2 composite parts to the biobrick registry.
Stability in presence of venom
The venom degradation test of the reporter molecules amilCP and β-galactosidase showed no reduction in the colorimetric or enzymatic properties.
Improving a previous part
Furthermore, we improved the part BBa_K592009 (purple-blue chromoprotein amilCP from Uppsala, Sweden) by adding a His-tag on its C-terminus. The expression of color was not reduced and the color protein could easily be retained by a His-tag purification.
Further improvement
To further improve our diagnostic device, a reduction on the response time for the result was undertaken. Instead of the amilCP reporter, the enzyme β-galactosidase was to be attached to the substrate linker. However, there was no successful assembly of ScAvidin with the linker to β-galactosidase.

Week 6: June 2 - 6
This week we requested parts specific to B. subtilis through the iGEM registry, as they were absent on the 2013 and 2014 plates we already had in our possession. Meanwhile, we performed plasmid mini-preps and confirmation digests, also designing primers for lacA, thrC, and amyE. Doing this was necessary because the necessary B. subtilis integration vectors were unavailable on current distribution plates.We then decided to submit these sequences to the iGEM registry for the benefit of future teams who may want to use them.
We dedicated an entire day to primer design and uploaded our newly developed primer sequences to Benchling, an online, cloud-based sequencing tool. Benchling was especially useful for our purposes as it allowed the easy sharing of numerous sequences amongst the whole team sans the hassle of word processors and e-mails. Due to Benchling’s numerous built-in features (e.g.the  displaying of enzyme cut sites, base pair tracking, automatic melting point calculations, illustrated sequence maps, etc.) productivity increased dramatically and a significant amount of time was saved during the designing of the primers. Once the necessary primers were designed, a request was sent out for them.
Colony PCRs were performed on the plasmids the Detective team had constructed thus far, but the colonies harbouring GFP and LacI ultimately failed. However, the failure of these colonies led us to the discovery that the plasmid containing LacI with a Chloramphenicol resistance grew better on Ampicillin agar plates. This strange phenomenon was explained by the hypothesis that ampicillin may have been more easily diffused by the bacteria.
Towards the latter half of the week , our Transformer team determined the components of the BioBrick we wished to construct. We decided to construct this BioBrick in order to gauge the transformation efficiency of B. subtilis and prepare ourselves for the insertion of the actual pathogen detection system in the coming weeks. It was crucial that we determine beforehand the loci into which we would insert our BioBrick. Simply put, our BioBrick was designed to “knock out” and replace the original gene within the receiving locus. This would mean that upon the successful insertion of our BioBrick, the bacteria would lose a certain inherent function, such as the metabolization of starch or the synthesis of threonine, at the cost of integrating our BioBrick. This “loss of function” strategy would allow us to determine which cells were successfully transformed.  After much research, we"

Cell-free, synthetic biology systems open new horizons in engineering biomolecular systems which feature complex, cell-like behaviors in the absence of living entities. Having no superior genetic control, user-controllable mechanisms to regulate gene expression are necessary to successfully operate these systems. We have created a small collection of synthetic RNA thermometers that enable temperature-dependent translation of membrane proteins, work well in cells and display great potential to be transferred to any in vitro protein synthesis system.

Liposomes as closed containers for bottom up research
At the core of SynDrop lays a liposome. Liposomes are essentially synthetic vesicles, artificially synthesized droplets of liquid, separated from the environment by a lipid bilayer (Fig. 1). They act as containers that encapsulate purified transcriptional and translational machinery and other vital elements that enable complex circuitry design. They have become increasingly popular due to various applications such as being carriers for medicinal drugs1, closed environments for protein engineering2 and characterization of RNAs3, as biosensors4 and molecular diagnostic tools5. The growing perspectives of liposomes as scaffolds for synthetic circuitry and membrane protein research are compelling as they have a multitude of different parameters that can be controlled. These include size, composition of a lipid membrane and interior composition.
Fig. 1 The composition of a liposome with encapsulated machinery for membrane protein integration. Size, membrane composition and interior composition can be easily varied.
Requirements for liposomes
There are many different ways to synthesize liposomes, resulting in a vast range of diverse outputs. For our project, we set particular requirements to suit our scientific design. Ideally, our liposomes must be stable, cell-sized, monodisperse, have a single bilayered membrane and demonstrate excellent encapsulation efficiency. The only approach to optimally combine these attributes proved to be microfluidics. In recent years, droplet-based microfluidic techniques have proved to achieve a robust control over physical parameters of the final product, therefore showing superiority compared to the macroscale bulk methods6. We successfully customized and integrated a novel octanol-assisted liposome assembly (OLA)7 method for high-throughput production of our liposomes.

iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.

With all three reactions being reversible, MATLABs dsolve function was not able to solve our differential equations. We tried them by hand but were not able to solve them analytically. We had to solve numerically and chose the Euler method. This involves iterating with short time intervals (here we used dt ≈ 1s) between each calculation using a loop to keep a record of how the substances changed over time. We then graphed these values as follows:

We’ve recreated this model so it’s actually running in the browser - try dragging the sliders above the graph to modify the rate constants.
Mass action kinetics model with transcription and translation
The first simple model neglected transcription and translation completely, which meant it was an excessive simplification and consequently was not that useful. To address these shortcomings, we created a second model, derived from parts of Tobias Stögbauer’s PhD, with many more species. [5]
This model was very slow to run (so slow we’re not going to try run it in the browser), as there were many species and thus more calculations needed to be done per loop. However, it primarily was slow as we needed a small dt value to keep the model accurate so there were more loops in total.
We had to use a very small dt value or errors could easily add up with so many species. It ended up taking about a minute to run each simulation which wasn’t acceptable for us, as we wanted to be able to quickly change parameters and ideally test a range of parameters. Speeding up the model would make it more useful to the wetlab team. They then could vary each of our parameters and see how they affected GFP output, for example seeing the effects of different switch designs and experimental setups.
Having lots of species also made it harder to find accurate rate constants for all the steps in the reaction. Tobias Stögbauer’s PhD was very useful for this, although many of his values weren’t that applicable to us as we used a different cell-free system leading to inaccuracies -  which were amplified when dt was increased.
It was also difficult to get useful data from the model as there were so many parameters that changing just one was unlikely to have a significant effect on the final result. This made it harder to draw conclusions from the model. For similar reasons it would also have made it hard to adjust the parameters to fit to our lab data when we had it. More parameters also increased the total uncertainty, decreasing the precision of our model.

Conjugation and traI
As is described in project,we use Hfr with traI knocked out.The gene was then added in the biobrick under control of blue-light sensor.Now that we’ve already known necessity of traI on the process of conjugation[1],it’s critical that we build a model for it.
These functions below are directly from UCSF 2013[2].
[D] represents for the concentration of donor cells
[R] represents for the concentration of recipient cells
[T] represents for the concentration of transconjugant cells
γrepresents for conjugation rate
φ represents for cell growth rate
However,we have a more complex situation.The parameterγ become a variant because of traI. We consider traI as kind of a catalyzer in this reaction and get the following
One thing to mention,here we made assumption that [traI] always dominates the rate of conjugation,but this may not be true.It’s highly possible that traI is not the speed-limiting enzyme.Then after a critical moment,γbecomes steady and reach its maximum.To prove this may need lots of experiments and data,and makes little difference to the result.
Assumption of stepped expression
In this section,we are going to discuss about the producing curve of GFP after conjugation.First we need to figure out the concentration of GFP in single cell.
Functions are
[mGFP] represents for the concentration of mRNA
V represents for the maximum transcription rate of promoter
D represents for the degration rate
The convolution method
At most of the time,we choose single cell model to simulate the situation of whole system.Cells grow different but we can still find a statistical average for them.But the single cell model may not fit situation of conjugation,because transconjugation cells of different time has different state of producing GFP,and is difficult to find an average.So we use convolution method to simulate it.
The expression of GFP is stepped,every single cell conjugated at different time shows a different state of producing GFP. The raw function is
Modeling for whole process
We made every step of the write-in system together to estimate the controlling efficiency of our system.We assume that the biological reaction share most of the features"

Overview
Ni2+ is one of the heavy metal pollutants in our environment. In order to detect the concentration of the Ni2+, our team are going to use the NcrB protein operon to achieve this goal. In this system, the nikABCDE gene will express the NikABCDE protein, which belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transporter. It can transport Ni2+ from the environment into the cell consuming ATP at the same time. And Ni2+ is the signal we need to detect. At the same time the ncrB gene will express NcrB protein, which is a repressor combining with the pncrA promoter, inhibiting the expression of the downstream gene luxCDABE. However Ni2+ will bind with the NcrB protein, causing the NcrB protein drop from the pncrA promoter. In this way, the luxCDABE gene will express. And the LuxCDABE protein can give out light by consuming energy in the cell. Thus we can detect the concentration of Ni2+ by measuring the luminescence intensity.
Hypothesis
1. The hypothesis on the diffusion equilibrium of Ni2+
We assume that the ions distribute uniformly inside the cell immediately after they are transported into it through NikABCDE. As long as the speed of transportation is lower than the speed of diffusion, the ions are unlikely to aggregate around the transporter protein(e.g., NikABCDE). According to our knowledge, most of the transporter proteins do not possess such a high transporting efficiency, which means this hypothesis is valid in a larger degree.
2. The hypothesis on the relationship between NcrB concentration and the copy number of the recombinant vector
Since each of the recombinant vector contains only one copy of the target gene, we can assume that the vectors have the same ability of expressing NcrB. Furthermore, it’s reasonable to assume that the final concentration of NcrB is proportional to the copy number of the recombinant vector.
3. The hypothesis on the concentration of NcrB during the process in which Ni and pncrA bind with NcrB competitively
There are three subtypes of NcrB in the cell: the free state NcrB, the NcrB binding with pncrA and the NcrB binding with Ni2+. We assume that the concentration of total NcrB is not influenced by the expression of NcrB gene or its degradation process, because the speed of these two processes is relatively low compared with the competitively binding"

Abstract

Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances,"

There is only one week left to complete our survey on complexity and try to win the collaboration badges (only 20 answers are needed to get the first badge). You can find our survey on our Facebook page, on our wiki and on our twitter. Thanks a lot for your help!
Our project is based on the conjugation of quorum sensing, integrasebased logic gates and diffusion. We have been investigating quorum sensing for the past few weeks. We want to find two orthogonal quorum sensing systems. Our system has two inputs, which correspond to two different homoserine lactones (HSL) concentrations. Each sensing system should be sensitive to only one HSL and should not react if the other HSL is added. We want to avoid a phenomenon called cross-talk.
We investigated three different systems: the Lux system, the Las system and the Rhl system. For each system, we built one plasmid consisting of the promoter, which can be induced by a specific signaling molecule, and of a gene coding for fast folding green fluorescent protein (GFP). Each colony was induced by different concentrations of its native HSL and also by different concentrations of HSL of the two other systems, in order to investigate cross-talk. The read-out is green fluorescence.
From the gathered experimental data, we can observe steady state, as well as the dynamic behavior of the inducing process, thanks to the fast folding property of GFP. We modeled the steady state as a Hill function of the native HSL + a constant modeling the leakiness + other Hill functions depending on other HSLs, if cross-talk was observed. The model allows a quantification of leakiness and cross-talk.

METU_HS_Ankara,2018,Team:METU HS Ankara#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,". These radicals are an inseparable deadly byproduct of anaerobic life and many other reactions essential to organisms. (Free Radicals and Reactive Oxygen, n.d., “oxygen radicals”; Livingstone, 2001). Although easy to come by, ROS are responsible for mutagenesis, cancerogenesis and aging on multicellular organisms (Halliwell, 1993).
Cells utilize antioxidants to stabilize the distorted electron balance of free radicals by donating an excess electron (Pizzorno, 2014). Thus, overexpression of the master antioxidant, Glutathione, improves the tolerance of the bacteria to free radicals, reactive oxygen species and ultimately enhances cell growth (Pizzorno, 2014).
Figure 8: Our representation of free radicals, lacking an electron.
When furfural, another byproduct is present in the field, its reduction mechanism by NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases goes active (Zheng, 2013). In this mechanism, the expression of oxidoreductases that are NADPH-dependent, such as YqhD, are shown to inhibit the growth and fermentation in E.coli by competing with biosynthesis for NADPH (Zheng, 2013). The native conversion of NADH to NADPH in E. coli is already insufficient to revitalize the NADPH pool during fermentation, so the actions shouldn’t be interfering with NADPH metabolism as it leads to reduced cell mass followed by cell death (Wang et al., 2011).
Thus, the overexpression of plasmid-based NADH-dependent propanediol oxidoreductase (FucO) gene will reduce the need for oxidoreductases that are NADPH dependent, and convert furfural to furfuryl alcohol without interfering with the biosynthesis of NADPH (Wang et al., 2011).
In normal circumstances, both the detoxification of ROS and the conversion of HMF & furfural result in a more oxidized intracellular environment; by interfering with the NADPH metabolism thus deteriorating the antioxidant defense system of the cell, decreasing its mass and ultimately resulting in death. With these considered, we have come to the conclusion that the solution to this problem was in the dual overexpression of GSH and FucO (Ask et al., 2013).
Conclusion
For a more efficient production of bioethanol and bacteria with higher tolerance to toxicity and oxidative stress, our research has shown that the system is in need of a genomic improvement that can be provided with GSH and FucO (Kim &"

We successfully created a 6-mer ligation product without beads, although the results is far from efficient due to the presence of a number of bands that correspond to other ligation events.
We excised the 712 bp band for gel extraction tomorrow.
We plan to PCR amplify the 6-mer and ligate it into pSB1C3.
This result indicates that successive ligation can only be perfomed twice, as ligation efficiency decreases dramatically. This means that for creating larger MaSp constructs such as 12- or 15-mers, we would need successive ligation and purification steps to achieve efficient construction."

, where J is a positive flux.
[Concentration] is the concentration of molecules inside the bandage, in our case the GzmB inhibitor. The thickness of the membrane is inversely related to J. D is the diffusivity, or the diffusion constant, of a certain configuration – a greater D generally represents a greater rate of diffusion. In our model, the diffusivity of our cellulose ester membrane was found to be 5.7x10^-6 cm^2/sec. Therefore, our diffusion model is
.
When graphed, the 3-dimensional equation looks like Figure 3 below:
Figure 3. Flux relative to concentration and membrane thickness. Fick's first law was used to predict the rate of flow across the membrane.
As demonstrated by the graph, thickness is inversely related to the diffusion rate; on the other hand, concentration is directly related to the diffusion rate. As part of future work, we can try to combine this model with the calculator to find proper treatment concentration, perhaps mathematically integrating the flux to determine an effective concentration that the bandage delivers. However, this would likely require experimental data to verify the accuracy of our current models.

NTU-Singapore,2009,Team:NTU-Singapore#HPA#Essay_-_-_TEXT.html," reductionist method in biological research for a good reason.
Non-supporters ask if DIYbiologists are able to handle the situation if an accident occurs? In a traditional lab at least, there would be some system of regulation of materials, equipment and consumables. All researchers would be certified competent, and safety standards and protocol can be enforced. Such regulations are our first line of defense against biological accidents; and it is not obvious whether DIYbio labs can offer this assurance.
Also, in a traditional lab, consumables are inventoried and their use is monitored. So, any unauthorised activity can be minimized or tracked. If DIYbio is made simplistic and easy, people with malicious intent may misuse such knowledge anonymously. Even a simple act like contaminating water supplies would be enough to cause great damage. Non-supporters are convinced that DIYbio cannot guarantee against such misuse.
in DIYbio's defense
Mackenzie Cowell feels that some of these concerns are unfounded or unfair. Only by ensuring that the DIYbio community's activities are open and transparent can these misconceptions be dispelled. For example, malicious users who want to use dangerous gene sequences, such as those from Ebola, could do so just as easily, without DIYbio. However the general public seems to be unaware of the fact that these gene sequences are in the public domain.
In that sense, DIYbio should not be held pre-emptively responsible for misuse only because of ignorance & irrational fear.
Cowell also feels that the DIYbio community should welcome the public to engage them by being open and transparent. In this way, anyone who needs to or wants to monitor DIYbio, will find it easy to do so. If DIYbio manages to convince the majority, then this majority will be DIYbio’s first and best line of defense against naysayers.
Our internal Debate
Even our team was split on our views about DIYbio. We had a heated debate on the matter, and compiled the main points of each side's argument.
Opposition’s views
The opposition against DIYbio, felt that there were too many risks to DIYbio to justify pursuing it. For example, if accidents were to occur, containing the contamination would be significantly harder than contamination in a lab. The potential hazards, accidental or malicious, are far too numerous to avoid without proper regulation.
The bulk of the scientific establishment is based in institutionalized laboratories for a reason. DIYbiologists should be strongly encouraged to follow the ""right path"" as it were, and only engage in biological experiments in proper labs under supervision. Moreover, laboratories are governed by special panels who also decide on"

Our projects include Biosearch and Biodesign. Biosearch is an iPhone app which substantially increases the efficiency of searching biobricks in partsregistry.org. Biodesign is a graphics editing application specific to synthetic biology for both iPhone and iPad. Both of them combine efficiency with portability, showing that a new era of mobile biology researching is coming.

Key Features in BioSearch V2.0
  BioSearch is just a 2-month old software developed entirely by a group of passionate undergraduate novices from SUSTC who dare to challenge the unchallengeable. During the past 2 months, we are making every effort to optimize it incessantly. BioSearch still has a long way to go. With careful analysis and prudent evaluation of our application, here we make a list of improvements waiting to be implemented in next version.
  
iPad version
  To better satisfy the need of increasing iPad user.
  
Merge BioSearch with BioDesign
  We expect to import data from BioSearch to BioDesign to do biochemical reaction simulation. Then BioSearch will be even stronger and comprehensive.
  
Discussion Zone
  Since the discussion zone on Partsregistry rarely has been visited. In order to promote academic communication between iGEM participants and synthetic biologists, we believe a discussion zone on mobile platform will be more popular and more convenient. That involves the management of discussion record on web server that might be achieved in the future.
  
History View
  If achieved, BioSearch will be even better than a web explorer.
  
Rating
  We hope users could vote for their favorite biobrick as an encouragement to its author.
  
Synchronization of database with Partsregistry
  In our current version, database is directly downloaded from the official website as xml file and saved as SQLite file in local system.Since the website doesn't update very often, our database may not satisfy the need of all users. Therefore, we plan to add database-update function to our next version of BioSearch.

Genetic Algorithm (GA)
Introduction to GA
What's GA
Genetic algorithms are powerful methods for complex optimization problems. They are essentially evolution in a computer. A population of GA population random candidate solutions is generated and scored. These solutions are allowed to mate with each other, generating offspring that are hybrids of both parental solutions. The mating frequencies are related to a boltzmann-like probability term; akin to simulated annealing, the simulation temperature required for calculating these is high early in the run, and cools down. Since the mating probability for a given candidate solution is related to its score, better solutions mate more frequently, making their components more numerous in the offspring. This new population of candidate solutions is scored, ranked, and allowed to mate.
Why GA?
Genetic algorithm (GA) is utilized to identify the topology of the network. A rate term can be described as two parts: signal and function type. The former usually indicates the positive and negative interaction from reactants to products which strongly correlate with the SBGN entity relationship diagram. The later reflects the biochemical reaction type. GA searches an optimized solution by mimicking the process of evolution. Members of an initial population compete for the privilege to mate and produce offspring for successive generations. The probability of an individual mating is proportional to the fitness of the environment. The generation with better fitness will be obtained generation by"

Module III - Isobutanol production
Overview
Isobutanol
Genetical Approach
Results
Short summary
The aim of the third module of our project is the production of isobutanol in Escherichia coli , which was already shown by Atsumi et al. The bacteria should use the products of the carbon dioxide fixation from module II to produce the key metabolite pyruvate. Pyruvate is then further used in metabolic pathways of the cell. Pyruvate is considered as a key metabolite because it can be used as a precursor for different industrially relevant products.
We decided to introduce an isobutanol production pathway which starts with pyruvate and is called 2-keto-acid, or Ehrlich, pathway ( Peralta-Yahya et al., 2012 , Atsumi et al., 2008 ). For this we want to use and improve existing BioBricks from iGEM team NCTU Formosa 2011/2012.
Different production pathways of variable high value products derive from pyruvate. For further purpose the modularity of BioBricks can be used to enable the exchange of those producing systems. Other, than isobutanol, thinkable products would be isoprene, putrescine or even antibiotics.
Here you will find our results of the isobutanol production.

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," Catastrophic Precautionary Principle is proposed by Hartzell-Nichols HARTZELL-NICHOLS, L. 2012. Precaution and solar radiation management. Ethics, Policy & Environment, 15, 158-171. and states: “Appropriate precautionary measures should be taken against threats of catastrophe” with definitions and restrictions to follow. Some of his requirements are very similar to the parts of the Precautionary Principle that we have already defined: e.g. “A precise probability of a threat of harm is not needed to warrant taking precautionary measures so long as the mechanism by which the threat would be realized is well understood and the conditions for the function of the mechanism are accumulating”. The requirement meets the demand imposed by the Meta-Precautionary Principle, which stated that one should not be paralyzed from taking action by lacking scientific evidence. The demand about consistency is also present in one of his requirements.
The Catastrophic Precautionary Principle then compiles fine with the Precautionary Principle we already have defined and it then seems to be a version of the Precautionary Principle. A version because the damage and epistemological conditions, that are parts of the Tripod, are specified. The damage condition is set to be only “catastrophe” and the epistemological condition to be “the mechanism by which the threat would be realized is well understood and the conditions for the function of the mechanism are accumulating”. As a positive effect, the Catastrophic Precautionary Principle is more well-defined and easier to apply but it is also more limited, where the Precautionary Principle normally is thought of as having a broader range than catastrophes - e.g. genetically modified organisms (GMO’s).
The maximin rule comes from a different background than the Precautionary Principle, i.e. political philosophy rather than bioethics. It has then been transformed for a use in bioethics. The maximin rule is an expression for choosing the action that has the smallest chances of resulting in ‘worst case’ scenarios. It is almost always very restricted and one of the most central restrictions is ‘pure uncertainty’ STEEL, D. 2014. Philosophy and the precautionary principle, Cambridge University Press. . By pure uncertainty is meant “a total lack of information about the probabilities of the relevant possible scenarios” - then the maximin rule is applied to make sure that one assures the highest minimum of good. The proposal for which conditions has to be satisfied before recommending precaution are STEEL, D. 2014"

STRUCTURE MODEL
STRUCTURE MODEL
Purpose
In order to confirm whether this “radar” T1R2/T1R3 can “sense” the sweetness of different sweetener, we simulated the model of receptor's structure[1] [2]. It was helpful to observe how the sweeteners binding to T1R2/T1R3 receptor visually. Moreover, we expected to find some unknown sweeteners binding sites based on this model, even some ideal sweeteners are still unknown.
Methods
To make the signal input more accurate and reliable, we simulated the T1R2/T1R3 receptor's structure model through SWISS-MODEL. Meanwhile, according to Chemdraw 2D and Chemdraw 3D, we constructed some sweetners' model. And the docking process was performed by using Autodock Vina.
Results
We used homology modeling to obtain the structure of human sweet receptor T1R2/T1R3. According to the crystal protein structure of similar receptor in mice, we only simulated ligand-binding-domain of our receptor.
Fig. 3 The simulated structure of human sweetness receptors' ligand-binding domain (LBD)
Then, taking advantage of software Chemdraw 2D and Chemdraw 3D, we established some natural or artificial sweeteners' structure.
Fig. 4 Three dimensional structure of some sweeteners
Docking process was carried out under Autodock Vina (Fig. 5-7).
Fig. 5． Docking result of different sweeteners Fig. 6． Docking result of aspartame Fig. 7． Docking result of stevioside
Discussion
Our docking results estimated that ligand-binding domain (LBD) of human T1R2/T1R3 receptors could bind with almost all kinds of known sweeteners. It provided evidence that this receptor has an ability to “taste” the sweetness. Meanwhile, our results also helped us to speculate that the number of both binding-site and binding-molecule also might influence the sense of sweetness.
However, our model still needs optimization. We plan to enhance the docking model"

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Indigoidine_-_-_TEXT.html," and #4 from 2 ml liquid culture. Purified plasmid pRB12 was transformed to TOP10, DH5alpha and OneShot on LB+Cm to check CCDB functionality. OneShot should grow whereas plates of DH5alpha and TOP10 were expected to stay empty since ccdb causes cell death.
All strains grow on LB+Cm which shows that ccdb doesn't work as expected. ccdb with RBS was amplified from pDONR
plasmid.
Results and Discussion
Assembly and/or Transformation were inefficient, blue colonies on each plate suggest that a lot of template was in
the Transformation mix. The positive control doesn't provide information on whether the assembly was successful.
CCDB screenig of pRB12 was positive but transformation in DH5alpha, TOP10 and OneShot ccdb survival cells showed

From the above data, it is shown that 60 % of the respondents have an ambivalent view on the use of laboratory animals in scientific research. When asked specifically on the use of laboratory animals to produce antibodies, 87 % of the respondents answered ‘Yes’ and think it is okay to use them. At first sight, this data indicates that people actually do not mind the use of laboratory animals when it concern production of antibodies. However, when asked if they would prefer if antibodies were produced in an alternative organism like Escherichia coli, 71 % of the respondents agreed.
85 % of the respondents do not know of any alternative to antibodies. This could suggest that the people’s attitude towards the use of laboratory animals to produce antibodies reflect their lack of knowledge of alternatives, and not their general opinion. One person even states: ""the use of animals is okay. We don't have any other opportunities at the moment"".
When looking at the elaborated opinions towards laboratory animals, different concerns is expressed. These concerns are : The quality, price, and animal ethics. Some people even state the environmental impact as an issue.
Conclusion
From this questionnaire, it is indicated that an alternative to the current method for antibody production would be appreciated. People are in general ambivalent about the use of laboratory animals, but they incline to the view that it is “better to use animals than not being able to help humans 100 %”, as one respondent writes. However, most people would prefer if E. coli produced antibodies rather than mice and rabbits. The fact that almost 90 % didn’t know of any antibody alternative (remember that 2/3 of the respondents worked / studied in the field of life sciences) also suggests that people have accepted the current way of antibody production - even though they understand the issue with antibody production.
When analyzing the survey data one has to consider the response group and whether or not the data can be transferred into a general opinion. Our aim with the survey was to determine the opinion of the general population on the use of laboratory animals to produce antibodies. Since 2/3 of the respondents are people of science (either by education or job), the data is not representative for the general public. Furthermore, only 291 people responded the survey. From a statistical point of view, more responses would have been preferred. Even though the data is not as credible as we would have liked, it still gives us a strong indication that a change in the strong tradition-based antibody production is needed.

Mathematical modeling of genetic circuits
With the help of CONACYT, we brought Jesús Siller, Oxford Ph.D. candidate, to our Campus, where he imparted a two session workshop about mathematical modeling of genetic circuits to a selected group of undergraduate students from Tec de Monterrey, UANL and UDEM.
Petri dish art
As a team, we imparted a petri dish art workshop where undergraduate and high school students created their own artwork after having a theoretical session of synthetic biology.
Science Seminar
Dates: September 14 & 15, 2018
As we got more involved into presentations, conferences and symposiums we saw the value and impact that this type of activities had on the way students where learning and getting interested in various thematics, that where not exactly their own. This feedback stimulated in us the desire to link STEM fields into one place to discuss the different approaches of a single thematic and show them how we all complement each other as one to create great things.
In collaboration with SACI (Science and Engineering Alumni Society) from Tec de Monterrey we created Seminar of Science, a tuition free course for regional universities of Nuevo León as: Tecnológico de Monterrey, Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León (Schools of Chemistry, Biology and Physics)  and Universidad de Monterrey, where experts in different science fields from around the world shared with the student community their experience and trayectory.
We had an attendance of over 130 people per session , all from different majors such as: B. S. Biotechnology Engineering, B. S. Physics, B. S. Chemistry and Nanotechnology Engineering, B.S. Food Industry Engineering, B.S. Sustainable Development Engineering, B.S. Mechanical Engineering with minor in Industrial Engineering, B.S.

The bulky, volatile Phe162, Phe332 and Phe337 amino acids were replaced by isoleucine residues. These modifications were suggested by the results of rational design analysis. The core of the beads, which is approximately 200 nm in size, consists of magnetite (Fe3O4) giving ferromagnetic properties to the final product. The recovery from the water and re-use of Biotic Blue is based on these magnetic properties, as it is illustrated in Figure 4.
Figure 4. The immobilization process of mutant enzymes on the magnetic bead.
The magnetite core is coated by a layer of polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) which in turn is covered by Chitosan (Chi). PSS is an ionomer and mediates the adherence of Chi to the magnetic core since Chi cannot be adsorbed or form covalent bonds directly with the magnetite. Chi, a polysaccharide, offers a suitable surface to the bead for covalent bond formation. Although part of the Chi surface may be covered by adsorbed or covalently bound enzymes, the largest surface area is covered by Glutaraldehyde (GA), an agent used for the cross-linking of the enzymes. Cross-linking increases the capacity of each bead in regard to the number of enzymes it can bear, vastly improving its efficiency. Macroscopically, Biotic Blue has the form of a black powder and can be effortlessly discerned from clean water. The powder form enables uncomplicated integration of Biotic Blue in every wastewater treatment process system and makes its operation fairly handy. As Christian Baresel voiced: “Every plant is unique, thus, it is important to have a tailor-made solution for each one. The treatment technology is based on dosing, motion, etc., and therefore the tailor-made solution makes the most impact. For example, some hospitals have infection departments, and some do not, which requires different treatment of the waste” (Personal Communication C Baresel 20 Jun 2018).
... in the wastewater treatment process
The implementation site of Biotic Blue is the WWTP. Although the wastewater treatment process is not the same in every WWTP, in general, three stages can be distinguished: the mechanical, the biological and the chemical as it is illustrated in Figure 5. After considering all the feedback we received from experts in the field of wastewater treatment management, we decided that the point of implementation of Biotic Blue"

My name is Bomiao Hu, a junior student from the School of Life Science, Nanjing University.  I participated in the Kuang Yaming's Honor Elite Program and hoped to learn more about basic scientific researches.  Others may complain about the boredom of researches because of doing the same thing day by day.  But I do not regard this intolerable because every attempt to verify our thoughts is to approach the truth of nature, although these experiments are carried out with similar procedures.  So I like doing experiments and will do it for a relatively long time.

Insole 3 also has a hydrogel based main part.  Yet, it is divided into two different parts to realize different functions. The first part locates in the areas where most force apply when people are moving,like the sole ,heel and the toe. In this area, high mechanical strength gel containing bacteria lysis solution made the skeleton, with the particle of super absorbent polymers ( SAP particle) on the top gap of it. These SAP particles swelled with culture solution can provide enough nutrients for the bacterial growth. The first type E.coli witch can produce Cecropin XJ grow on the surface of the SAP particles.when temperature beyond the critical value, it will lyse to release the Cecropin to realize the antibacterial function. The other area of the insole consists of the another hydrogel contain less water with the second type E.coli grow on it can absorb the foot sweat of people to reach the goal of both deodorant and arefaction.

Rewarding Collaborations
UC Davis and UC Santa Cruz iGem teams (Photo provided by the UC Davis iGEM Team)
We the UCSC iGEM Team were fortunate to have had the opportunity to engage in multiple rewarding collaborations with other talented, hard-working iGEM teams. Our collaboration story began at the 17th Annual UC Systemwide Bioengineering Symposium hosted by the Bioengineering Institute of California. The iGEM team at the University of California, San Diego, were kind enough to invite the UCLA iGEM team, the UC Davis iGEM team, and ourselves to meet at the Symposium in San Francisco. Each morning of the Symposium, June 13th-15th, we all met in a reserved room at the Symposium to present and discuss our projects with another. It was a valuable and much-appreciated opportunity to connect with other iGEM students, engage in exciting discussion, and form relationships with passionate, creative, and intelligent individuals. It was over the course of these few days that we first met the UC Davis iGEM team in person, who became our long-term collaborators over the course of the summer.
Due to both the UCSC and UC Davis iGEM teams using the same organism, B. subtilis, collaboration at a more technical level was possible. Discussion with UC Davis helped our team make specific strain decisions for our project. From them we then acquired B. subtilis 3NA and B. subtilis PY79 . Using the same organism also allowed protocol collaboration, where we confirmed that electroporation was the best general approach for transforming a non-sporulating strain of B. subtilis, such as 3NA. Although it turned out that for integrative plasmids such as ours natural transformation is more optimal, this collaboration gave us a better understanding of the specific strains we had chosen.
Santa Cruz Farmers Market
In collaboration with the UC Davis iGEM team, we also conducted a research study on public opinion for the definition of ‘Natural’, and its relationship to GMOs. Each team traveled to the local farmer markets in our respective cities to interview the key demographic that we hoped had the greatest connection towards ‘all-natural’ movement, and could provide the best insight into these key questions. This intervention collected valuable information on public opinion, in addition to"

Overview
Science is a richly collaborative endeavor. Our achievements were also symbolic for the many important suggestions and contributions made by a cadre of talented team members from other universities of iGEM 2016. Meanwhile, we went great length to provide our help as more as possible. So glad we’ve received warm friendship with each other.
Fundan ~ Tongji
Team Fudan need tet-on or tet-of promoter to get tetO element and miniCMV as the promoter to drive their genes of interest. Vice professor Wenwen Jia in our school works on apparent heredity field, happens to have tet-on kit for his work. We made contact with Pro. Wenwen Jia and gained 3μl.
We also asked him for the associating kit that responses to panmycin and send the signal to promoter. Team Fudan used these two kits to PCR and continued their experiments. At the same time, Team Fudan had provided great help either. They built their kit ahead of us, and they generously provided almost all of the materials that we gonna need for kit submitting.(15 ml of chloromycetin powder,8 chloramphenicol resistance plates,80ml chloramphenicol resistance LB,Enzyme of XbaI and SpeI each 3μl)

Then, we gel extracted and quantified it.
After using so much pSB1C3 as template for PCR we ran out of it and had to streak plates from the Glycerol stocks, run minipreps, digest, clean up and finally continue with our PCRs  :) We ran ligation PCR of J23107-09 AB-EB, J23119AB-EB and J23113AB, J23103AB.

Week 1
We ran a gel to check the ligation PCRs from last week: 23107-09 AB-EB, J23119AB-EB and J23113AB. Then, we performed gel extraction.
We quantified the samples
.
We also repeated the PCR of lacZ with to add the fusion sites and build our DVL2s. We ran a PCR clean up and quantified the samples.
We digested the samples with SpeI and ran a gel of the digested samples to check sizes. Then, we ran a gel extraction.
And quantified the samples
September  Week 2
We continued to work with DVL2s. We ran ligation of lacZ  amplified with level 2 fusion sites and pSB1A2 as backbone and transformed them. However, they did not grow blue, we could only see white colonies. We tried once more but they are still not growing. We are working on troubleshooting them.
We kept troubleshooting the DVL0s that didn`t work. We picked colonies of DVL0_BFCR plate and miniprepped 3 samples to check the correct sequence. We submmited them for sequencing along with previous MoClo reactions 1 and 14-22. We continued with the MoClo reactions and we ran reactions 23-49.
We transformed all MoClo reactions (23-49) with Zymo cells. Unfortunately, the cells were not very competent and none of plates grew sufficiently.  We tried transforming once more with Bioline Gold Cells, this time we included Moclo 50-54 .

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With"

Congress
FATUBAT is a prominent congress which has a record breaking attendant number of 1,500 participants each year. Seeing this as a valuable opportunity, we introduced iGEM to the congress attendants and acquainted them on our previous project. Additionally, two workshops on Synthetic Biology and IGEM were held. Our intention in issuing the workshops was to gather the more interested individuals, divert and persuade them to become a member of the synthetic biology community. Different activities such as playing the Canvas Town game designed by Fatih Medical 2011 iGEM team, watching videos and holding a question-answer platform took place which enabled us to exchange ideas and maybe spark a light of interest.
The Dean and Doctors
Our faculty’s dean was only familiar to the word iGEM and nothing else. Therefore a meeting was organised with the university hospital doctors and the dean. Upon listening to our presentation of iGEM and Oncoli, some doctors offered the opportunity of working with tissues they will specially design for oncoli in which we will be able to continue our experiments. Their enthusiasm and support was essential and motivating. National Union We attended the national union organised by the METU-Turkey team and presented our project. This enabled us to practice for the jamboree as well as answering the questions asked by them. Following this a discussion panel was held on how to spread Synthetic Biology in Turkey.

Synbio Class at University Summer Camp for Kids
Each year our University hosts a summer camp for children aged 12 - 16 years. Modules run during the camp vary each year and are chosen to reflect the many interests catered for at university. Although most years include a science and engineering themed module, there had yet to be a Synthetic Biology based class available. This year, UCC iGEM worked with the University Summer camp to include Synbio activities for the kids at camp.
Over the course of 7 weeks, over 250 children attended camp and took part in our Synbio activities as part of the camp Science module. Two 1.5 hour sessions were held where kids got the chance to learn about the structure and function of DNA, how scientists study DNA in the lab and how genes have been used to genetically engineer organisms. Kids got to extract DNA from their own cheek cells and study digested DNA on an agarose gel. After learning how the process of genetic engineering was carried out and discussing some examples, kids also got to paint pictures with genetically modified bacteria expressing fluorescent proteins. Kids debated the pros and cons of genetically engineered products such as synthetic milk. They also got to play a game to encourage thinking of ways organisms could be modified by genetic engineering.
Painting with Genetically Modified Bacteria
E. coli expressing fluorescent proteins were used to create living paintings or “Bio Art”. Modified bacteria were grown in pure culture overnight in 10ml LB broth. Kids could paint with this culture using pipette tips or plastic loops. Examples of paintings may be seen below.
Protocol for BioArt
Competent DH5a E. coli cells were transformed with biobricks BBa_ J04450 and BBa_E0240 to express RFP and GFP respectively.
Cells were grown overnight on Chloramphenicol containing media.
Overnight stocks were prepared using single coloured colonies in 10ml LB"
