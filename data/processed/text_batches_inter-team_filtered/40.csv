UC_Davis,2015,Team:UC Davis#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"] we were unable to see triclosan inhibition, which suggests there is a different biological mechanism of action for triclosan inhibition. However, nanomolar inhibition was also not observed with H. influenza, and E.coli, even though previously reported [6][7][10]. Therefore more detailed studies on conditional dependencies of inhibition are needed in order to elucidate the mechanism of action. However, the A. protothecoides inhibition data clearly indicates that triclosan effects FabI from algae and that this could be the biological mechanism of toxicity.
For our biosensor, P. falciparum FabI, being the enzyme most inhibited by triclosan, appears to be the best enzyme to use for our biosensor!  Additionally, we further characterized the previously submitted E. coli FabI biobrick Bba_K771303 . We have added our characterization data to the experience section on the parts registry! Sources:

We calculated the cost to run the enzyme assay using the native substrate analog crotonyl-CoA, and calculated it costs 67 cents. A report published in 2002 by the American Association of Physics Teachers recommended that the budget for high school laboratories to be $1 per student per week[20]. Assuming this is the recommended budget for other laboratory courses, students would be unable to run our assay more than once in a given week. We calculated the cost of our enzyme assay:
and found that 89% of the cost actually came from crotonyl CoA.  In addition to being expensive, Coenzyme A (CoA) is not very stable in solution. Sigma has reported that solutions stored at -20C are only stable for 2 weeks! [21]
In order to implement our device in a high school laboratory setting, we wanted our assay to be under 10 cents to run. This would allow a student to run our assay ~ 10 times. We couldn’t change the cost to produce the enzyme, nor its cofactor NADH, but it seemed feasible to try to find a cheaper substrate to use that did not involve CoA. Just like our enzyme screening process above, we needed to understand the chemistry behind how crotonyl CoA reacted in order to find cheaper substrates to use. We knew the reaction involved the reduction of the C2-C3 double bond. Rafferty et al first proposed the mechanism in which a hydride from NADH transferred to C3, which formed an enolate anion on the carbonyl oxygen. A proton transfer from tyrosine"

We also talked about iGEM  competition and its international character. In the article attending of 130  teams throughout the world, seperation of competition to stages by continents  and the teams from Turkey attending to iGEM were mentioned. The article took  place in the magazine published on July- August- September 2011.  Considering its innovation and presentation  for synthetic biology and iGEM competition, we found this work too important.

PROJECT OVERVIEW
Introduction
This report shows an analysis of the impacts attributed by the launch of a bio-synthetic palm kernel oil to the global markets. It will discuss the benefits and disadvantages to the economies in Malaysia and Indonesia where the palm oil industry is very important. To accentuate the importance of this project we will calculate the impacts on the prices of crude palm kernel oil (CPKO) and other products. It is important to have a detailed analysis about the impacts of synthetic biology in every sector. For this reason, we considered about the impact on not only economy, but also on environment and society in Malaysia and Indonesia.
Project Description
In the last decades, the palm oil industry increased on an extreme level and, because of great demand, it still does. The main products from the palm plant, palm oil and palm kernel oil, are not dispensable in today`s society, Because of their characteristic properties, they are widely used in food-, material-, beauty- and fuel industry. The aim of our project: We are working on a way to produce palm kernel oil using microorganisms, especially E. coli. The production of fatty acids and their esterification to triglycerides as energy storage is a natural process in all organisms. We make use of this natural way of synthesis by modifying the expression of fatty acids with appropriate carbohydrate chain length on a molecular level.
Summary of the palm oil industry (2018)
The following is a summary of the current situation of the economy and palm oil industry in Malaysia and Indonesia. These two countries are the two largest producers of palm oil and palm kernel oil in the world (Tab. 1).
In 2017, Malaysia recorded 5.81 million hectares for oil palm plantations, a 1.28% growth compared to last year. The University of Manchester iGEM Team 2013 predicted a limited arable land, however the area used for planting rose by 13.94% from 5 million hectares to 5.81 million hectares [7].  Because of acreage limitations in the future, even with an improvement in efficiency of production of palm oil and palm oil related products, the future supply will not even achieve half of the global demand.

- tRNA specific for tyrosine and UAG codon in E. coli For incorporating non-canonical amino acids into a protein, an orthogonal tRNA/synthetase pair is needed, that does not crossreact with the cognate tRNA/synthetase pairs. This tRNA can be assembled with a variety of synthetases into a plasmid to incorporate ncAA in E. coli in response to an amber stop codon. This tRNA derives from the wild type tyrosyl Methanococcus janaschii tRNA/synthetase pair. It was proven to not crossreact with the cognate E. coli tRNA/synthetase pairs. The tRNA is used together with a tRNA synthetase. It has been proven to work with various synthetases for incorporation of ncAA by iGEM Team Austin Texas 2014

USTC,2009,Team:USTC#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,". Computer-aided design have to be used to accomplish more complex tasks. Space shuttle and microprocessor are seen as the most complex systems engineered, but they are far too simple when compared with the complexity of biological systems created by evolution.
On the other side, evolution is a completely different process. Variation is random, selection is directional based on the fitness to the environment, that is all. However, all the amazing things on our planet is emerged from this simple process, no more thing is needed.
Why? All the complexity is solved by this simple process without any input of knowledge?
Yes. The answer is on the scale. The evolution process is so simple that it can be scaled up infinitely. The complex problem can be solved in the distributed evolution system. Any success in the distributed system can be amplified by the selection process. Therefore, although the variation is random, it will be powerful enough to search for the solutions, when the scale of the system is big enough.
In the design process, the variation is directional based on the knowledge, but the process is not scalable, because of its requirement of intelligence. As a result, it is much more difficult to solve complex problems by design.
Directed Evolution
Although Darwin's theory was published 150 years ago, people have been using the power of evolution for more than ten thousand years. Domestication of plants and animals is done by artificial selection , which is the process of intentional breeding for certain traits, therefore changing the direction of evolution.
Directed evolution is a method using the similar principle to create new biomolecules with desired properties. The targets of directed evolution include enzymes, antibodies, aptamer s, ribozyme s, biosynthetic pathways, and synthetic genetic circuits. More information can be found on the Frances H. Arnold research group , the Ellington lab , and the Szostak lab .
The directed evolution experiment contains several rounds of 3 steps: variation, selection, and amplification. Variation is the mutation or recombination of the information encoded in the DNA, usually by error-prone PCR and DNA shuffling respectively. Selection is the process of separating the variants with desired phenotypes from others, it can either refer to screening (isolate good variants) or selection (eliminate bad variants), either in vivo or in vitro. Amplification is the replication of the variants after selection, which recovers the population size for the new round of directed evolution.
New function of biomolecules or biological systems is difficult to be rationally designed, but directed evolution is successfully used in solving these problems.

We continued our C# programming study, improved our program to calculate d score and nt.
Web Group:
1. We learned how to use dreamweaver to design a simple web page.
2. We learned how to build a database.
7.18.2012
Paper Group:
1. We visited some terminator structure and mechanism websites.
2. We read a paper about terminator; contacted several researchers to get information. We tried to imitate existing algorithm to determine terminator’s secondary structure. The first version of the program has been developed and we are going to test it.
3. We added more records to the TE database.
Software Group:
We improved the input validation program and made the class-”d_score_calculator” more usable. We read the manual of mfold and calculated the free energy of 1-loop by ourselves. But the free energy of 2-loop is still a problem.
Web Group:
1. We designed our team logo; learned how to build a server for our website.
2. We obtained and installed all the softwares we are going to use.
3. We were still trying to design a user-friendly web page.
7.19.2012
Paper Group:
1. We read some paper on terminator efficiency and found lots of models about the mechanism of terminator.
2. We learned some knowledge about double terminator which we didn’t know before. He also built a database about terminator efficiency which is a big contribution to our group.
Software Group:
1. We converted Liu Xing’s C++ program into C#, added the input validation function. Then we created an interface for the hairpin score calculation.
2. We calculated the free energy of 2-loop containing a bulge loop and a hairpin loop.
Web Group:
1. We learned how to use WPF to build a windows program and updated our server.
2. We built up the basic structure of our web page.
7.20.2012
Paper Group:
1. We read some paper on two RNA polymerase termination models, which has a higher view of terminator mechanism; and paper on termination mechanism models.
2. We updated and optimized TE database.
3. We improved the stem loop determination algorithm and modularized program.
Software Group:
We programmed the algorithm to make sure the structure of the terminator is clear.

Introduction
We, NCTU Formosa team did a lot of works on Human Practice, endeavoring to get people in other areas to know the great power of Synthetic Biology. We held a Bio-camp for high school students and did iGEM Cooperation throughout the country. We even tried to do Surveys from high school students, netizens around the world and professors from National Chiao Tung University and made L-shaped folders to preach our word to the world. By the way, we've created a Facebook Page for those interested in Synthetic Biology. Feel free to click in and stay tune to our works.

Environmental Impact
With SynthetINK, our primary focus is a drastically reduced environmental footprint compared to modern ink pigment production. Quite possibly the worst of all inorganic pigments due to its widespread use and production methods, carbon black, is what we generally compare our own project to. Carbon black is produced using the incomplete combustion of petroleum, for which energy is produced, and the remaining matter from the burning is the pigment. This is a very important problem as this type of production has many harmful consequences, including very significant emission of greenhouse gases, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) as well a large production of VOCs (volatile organic compounds). SynthetINK will only produce cellular debris and a miniscule amount of carbon dioxide compared to that of carbon black, as we will only be using bacteria to produce our own pigment. We do this with the goal of reducing the need for pigments like carbon black, especially in a world where energy sources like petroleum are no longer the norm, which is what we are progressing towards currently.

The Founder interviews had many similarities and differences in their stories behind business creation. While none of the reasons mentioned in Table 4 are not necessarily more significant than others, there is a general trend.  First, the teams all shared a similarity of being highly ambitious in finding funding through external sources (accelerators, banks, sponsors), as well as having a large passion for their projects, sometimes even deferring their studies. Second, the teams expressed having a quality team was useful for a successful business. Third, the teams differed slightly on how much knowledge exchange they had with industry partners during their iGEM; however, once business creation became an idea the teams heavily sought out expert advising in entrepreneurship and from industry experts. Interestingly, some of the teams were not aware of their product’s advantage until later in iGEM and many had no idea about the market characteristics until they sought"

TAL Improvement
——More Effective Golden Gate Cloning
This year our team not only focused on our project and bioparts but also improved several existing parts designed by iGEM12_Freiburg. When we used their parts and followed their protocols, we found that it was hard for us to repeat their success. There were a lot of difficulties on our way to constructing a TALE. After discussion and thinking, our team decided to improve the existing TAL parts by finding out new and better sticky ends. Moreover, our method can be used in border ways when people want to connect some components by Golden Gate method.
Why improve it?
How to connect monomer?
Why not other sticky ends?
How to improve the Golden Gate sticky ends?
Best choice for seven sticky ends on TALE protein
Reconstruct DNA sequences
Why we want to improve it?
Whether the Freiburg's design is efficient or not
According to the experimental record of Freiburg, the success rate is higher than 95%(32/33). However, this result, to some degree, lacks statistical significance.
In the result section, they emphasize that there is a light band at 1200bp, which they believe could indicate that the Golden Gate connection works well. However, after conducting several experiments by ourselves, we found that the key point to indicate whether Golden Gate connection works is not the band at 1200bp. If the band is not clear and specific in the gel, it indicates the experiment doesn’t go well. We can easily find several light bands under the band of 1200bp. Moreover, the second light band is somewhat lighter than the band at 1200bp. Although the Freiburg can explain the results with the repeatability of the TALE sequence, we suppose that the possibility of the mismatch of the sticky ends still can’t be excluded. Frankly speaking, we try to believe that they really made it, but if the success cannot be repeated, there must be something wrong with their system. You can view Detail information in i"

Heidelberg,2010,Team:Heidelberg#Project#miRNA Kit_-_-_TEXT.html," our pSMB_miTuner Plasmid HD3 . It turned out, that there was no obvious effect of different binding sites on reporter gene expression (data not shown). We assume that the RSV driving the shRNA miR is too weak for tight regulation of the referring binding site behind the GOI which is driven by the very strong CMV promoter. Only if a sufficient amount of shRNA miR binds to its target, translation is significantly repressed. Thus, we expressed the shRNA miR from a separate plasmid which was always co-transfected with the original tuning construct. The reporter genes - i. e. hFluc and hRluc - were also expressed from separate plasmids to get a reference as well as a transfection control. Then, we conducted a Dual Luciferase Assay for quantification of gene expression.
On- and Off-Targeting
Measurements were done in HeLa cells overexpressing miR122 from plasmid. Besides that, even endogenous miR122 levels were sufficient for off-targeting HuH cells (Fig. 4). A single perfect binding site leads to 95% knockdown, which seems to be maximum, since even a perfect binding site duplicate results in the same reporter gene expression.

Although my major seems nothing to do with synthetic biology, I experience and learn a lot from my team members, and I really appreciate their amicability, endeavor and help.  My responsibility in the team is HP. At the beginning of our project, I have listed several aspects as our goals. And thanks to our whole team’s cooperation, we have participated and held several events. These events not only make our project more complete, but also let us know more about iGEM, synthetic biology and other teams related.  iGEM is more than a contest. It is an important journey. During this whole year, we learn cooperation, time management, communication, and the most important one, friendship, because we are a whole.

Note
In order to be considered for the Best New Basic Part award , you must fill out this page. Please give links to the Registry entries for the Basic parts you have made. Please see the Registry's Help:Parts page for more information on part types.
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts."
Toulouse,2015,Team:Toulouse#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," were able to explain the basics of synthetic biology, the idea of biobricks and spark a quick debate about GMO use. Most of the children were not antagonized to the use of a modified bacterium as long as it was confined in our Trapicoli, but we felt that the biological knowledge needed to fully understand synthetic biology was a little foreign to them, so we switched our lecture to focus more on bees and the colony collapse disorder.
An unexpected advice
During the Q and A, we were asked about our studies and the kind of diploma we had. One question leading to another, without realising it we where already giving a full guidance lecture on the choices these children would have to make in the following years (which school to attend and why, why study science, etc...). Having a first hand account from students who had to go through the same process not so long ago reassured them and gave them some perspective on their future studies.
We hope that our intervention helped create a few scientific vocations (and even maybe a future iGEMer!)
The main aim of this intervention was to teach children about varroa and synthetic biology while trying to spark an interest in science in general. But to us it was a time that taught us how to adapt our speech to a young audience. Indeed we had to stop taking for granted notions such as genes and even DNA. The experience we acquired there was put to good use later and made us able to switch from a full science explanation to a simpler overview of our project without getting boring or simplistic.
Giant Jamboree training: International Exposciences in Brussels
Our team had the wonderful opportunity to take part in the International ExpoSciences in Brussels.  During this science fair we had the chance to meet people from all around the world and exchange knowledge and ideas. This happened at the end of July and our project had matured a lot thus the ExpoSciences was the occasion for us to test its welcome in the real world by exchanging with scientists.
We also spent a good deal of our time explaining the iGEM competition to visitors and participants alike, bringing the synthetic biology field, still quite unknown, into light.
This communication experience was fully integrated to the Apicoli project, enhancing its exposure and credibility towards the public. This experience also enabled us to meet his Excellency M. Bernard Valero, the ambassador of France in Belgium, and M. Jean-Claude Guiraudon, CIRASTI President and MILSET Honorary President. Both of them wished us luck in our endeavours.

Rhl: Order of new optimized primers. Temperature gradient PCR with different template concentrations.
Nis:The vector pSB1C3 with the araBAD promotor was amplified using new PCR components. Finally it worked. Gibson Assembly was performed for both our NisA inserts and the products were transformed into E. coli .
Chi:Adding a His6-Tag to COD by PCR using BBa_K2380043, and -044 respectively, as templates. PCR was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis.
Testing of a chitosan assay in the presence of proteins. Standard calibration curves for chitosan and BSA in the range of 20-100 µg mL-1 were recorded.

Work in the lab
Rhl: Temperature gradient PCR of all templates with different concentrations.
Nis: We decided for a new approach: cloning our NisA-inserts into pSB1C3 that already contains an arabinose promoter and a RBS (araBAD promotor). Design of new primers for our construct. PCRs were performed for our inserts and the vector + araBAD promotor and checked on an agarose gel. Again only the amplification of the NisA inserts worked.
Chi:Expression of BBa_K2380002/-042 and the combined construct BBa_K2848000 was repeated using a higher culture volume (100 mL). Cells were disrupted in phosphate buffer by high pressure homogenization using an EmulsiFlex C5 (Avestin, ATA Scientific). Proteins were purified by their His-Tag using HPLC (HisTrap column, ÄKTA, GE Healthcare).
Link:IR analysis of samples from chemical linkage.

Rhl: Overnight cultivation of transformed E. coli DH5α and Miniprep for higher DNA concentrations. Control of templates by restriction digest of biobricks with EcoRI and SpeI. RhlC was loaded without digestion  since it does not have the same restriction sites. Sizes of fragments accorded with theoretical values leading to the conclusion of having the correct templates. To verify these results, all biobricks were sequenced with positive results. Sequencing of rhlC.
Nis: We changed every parameter possible in our PCR to amplify pSB1C3 for Gibson cloning but nothing worked.

Gold Medal Requirements
UMN iGEM has strived to produce Gold Medal level work through the duration of our project. Here we outline our work that specifically pertains to each of the gold medal requirements. Scroll to the right to see how we met each requirement!
Requirement 1: Improving function or characterization of an existing part
To compliment the UMN iGEM 2014 bioremediation project, we chose to improve the ""phsABC"" biological system first added to the registry by the Yale 2010 team (BBa_K393001). The operon produces hydrogen sulfide to allow for the biological precipitation of heavy metals, such as copper used for the Yale team's biological circuit. We sought to both improve and characterize the part for future utilization in our filtration device. To improve ""phsABC"", we added a modified lac promoter to allow for constitutive expression rather than IPTG induction within the biological system, and thus make it more applicable in a real world environmental setting where an induction strategy would be costly and inefficient for remediation purposes. We also improved the characterization of their part by testing its application for biological precipitation of Iron and Cadmium in addition to the Yale team's Copper testing to add to the functionality of the part..

Fig. 4-1-2. Overview of “Wolfcoli” system
(Fig. 4-1-1) We have succeeded in designing 2 new osmoregulative promoters, POmpC(CB) and POmpC(CS1), which can also be utilized in red-light-dependent gene expression network (Fig.4-1-2).
Introduction
What is OmpC promoter?
Fig.4-1-3. PompC(WT) and the two-component system
OmpC(WT) promoter (BBa_R0082) is positively regulated by phosphorylated OmpR, a response regulator in EnvZ-OmpR osmosensing two-component system. The EnvZ-OmpR system of E. coli regulates the transcriptional activity of this promoter in response to change in extracellular osmolarity. The OmpC(WT) promoter consists of 3 distinct phosphorylated OmpR recognition sites which are binding site 1, binding site 2 and binding site 3.
Result
Construction of new series of OmpC promoters
Fig.4-1-4. PompC(WT) and the two-component system
Three new promoters, PompC(CS1) BBa_395303, PompC(C) BBa_395301, PompC(CB) BBa_395302 were designed based on previous paper[1]. The second promoter, PompC(CS1), comprises only binding site1 fused to the canonical -35 and -10 region. PompC(C) is a composite of binding site 1 and additional 4 base pairs before the canonical -35 and -10 region. Likewise, PompC(CB) consists of binding site1 and the additional 10 base pairs before the -35 and -10 consensus sequence.

3.In-plate culture fluorescence and OD600 was recorded at 20min intervals from 0 to 275min and the GFP intensity of 20min before inducement was also measured. Temperature was constant at 37°C.
The result is shown in Fig.5.
Fig.5. Time and dose response of  GFP and OD 600. The data was measured every 20 minutes since 20 minutes before supplement of different dose of Hg(II) to the wells and the plates was incubated in the shaker at 37℃during the interval of measurement. For both plates, the volume of LB medium with bacteria was 100uL per well. A: GFP intensity was measured by Tecan Microplate Reader with excitation wavelength at 470nm and emission wavelength at 509nm. A black 96-well plate was used to minimize the interference of different well. B: OD 600 was also measured by Tecan Microplate Reader in a transparent 96-well plate, since the depth of 100uL in the well did not reach 1 centimeter, the OD 600 value here was smaller than that was measured by a spectrophotometer.
Construction of merOP Library
In our project, we planned to analyze the behavior of merOP thoroughly, and it could be expected that mutation at the dyad domain II would change the Ka of MerR-DNA interactions. Thus we mutated the semiconserved sites and left the conserved sites constant.
The approach is generally based upon degenerate primer PCR, with the combination of a ‘DNA shuffling’ procedure, that is performed on the target DNA sequence; the resulting library of variants is then screened for the desired feature, and selected isolates are subjected to a repeated procedure(Fig.6).
Fig.6. Library construction. We performed a degenerate primer PCR on the merTPCAD wild-type promoter region of the alterable sites. The resulting PCR fragments, each potentially contained one or more mutation sites at a restricted location.
Fig.7. Dose-response curves of mutants. Among all these candidates, mutant1, 3, 25, 44, 85, 88 (also shown in Fig 3) were selected for the final careful characterization during which a higher concentration resolution was exploited. Then the dose-response curves were fitted by Hill function.

DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Achivements_-_-_TEXT.html," the iGEM teams were mixed and half of the groups used the USER-cloning technique while the other half used traditional restriction enzyme cloning techniques. As safety is of great importance in our human practice  a basic safety guide  along with specific guidelines for working within the  DTU GMO lab  were provided before attendance.
The BioBrick Workshop was also a great opportunity to extract the hard-earned knowledge from previous iGEM alumni. Our own Kristian Davidsen was instrumental in running the experimental work and discussing the theory behind our lab work. SDU was kind enough to provide two alumni presenters for a session on how to create an effective wiki.
The complete agenda for the workshop can be found here  along with the SOPs , both of which can be used to inspire future teams to host their own BioBrick workshop.
 
No Money, No Project!
Getting the money to run such a big project as the one we have undertaken is not cheap. Therefore we have used many hours on getting sponsors and applying for different grants to make sure that we were able to participate in the iGEM competition.
The iGEM 2015 team from Københavns Universitet did not have as much time to apply for grants as we had therefor we sent them our list of grants and our template for grant applications so that they would be able to apply for the money and consumables that whey would need to make there project a reality.

Ich habe meine Bachelor of Science auf dem Gebiet der Molekularbiologie im Jahr 2011 auch an der Fakultät für Biologie der Universität Göttingen gemacht. Für meine Bachelorarbeit ""Insights into Mammalian SIRT6 Function in Cellular Stress Response"" arbeitete ich am Max-Planck-Institut für biophysikalische Chemie. Während meiner Zeit als Bachelor-Student am Max-Planck-Institut hatte ich die Gelegenheit, in einem Umfeld mit Menschen aus unterschiedlichen Ländern mit verschiedenen sowie vielfältigen Kulturen zu arbeiten. Es war eine tolle Zeit für mich und motivierte mich wieder an einem Projekt zu arbeiten, welches persönliche Herausforderung und Planung mit sich bringt. Also, ich freue mich schon sehr auf unser iGEM Projekt und die Gelegenheit, selbstständig zu arbeiten in einem Team junger Studenten sowie die Möglichkeit, unsere Arbeit und die Ergebnisse vor einem multikulturellen Publikum zu präsentieren und auf einen  Austausch von Erfahrungen während der Zeit des iGEM Projekts mit den anderen Teams.

Background
Team Aachen has consistently been successful in the iGEM competition, winning three gold medals in a row. I wanted to see how, as part of a team that had just won its first gold medal in 2016, how we could improve our team. Our main obstacles this year were fundraising and group dynamic.
Project Discussion
We held a short interview over the summer (find date in journal) where we went over a general summary of each other’s projects. They described to us the following details: The Aachen team will be taking ion channels from plants and yeast and overexpressing these in order to lead to hyper sequestration of salts. They wanted to see the effects of using each channel as well as in tandem. They mentioned use of mRFP in vacuoles for colocalization of ion channels. We suggested looking at increased salt tolerance with using seawater bacteria. The Aachen team had actually concluded from literature that yeast was more effective at salt sequestration than bacteria. They integrated these parts into the genome and were trying to implement a kill switch to prevent the organism from running loose.
Team Improvement
To improve the group dynamic, Team Aachen suggested that we try to understand the team more on a personal level. They did this by hanging out together, playing video games, and cooking meals. This allowed the team members to bond with each other and understand each other to a point where they could work better together to accomplish a common goal. Also, they suggested that all new recruits must be made aware of the commitment required for iGEM, so that they could leave the team before the research process began. This would result in a smaller team at the end, but the team would have highly committed team members that would be sufficient to accomplish the goal.
Our team struggled greatly to secure sufficient fundraising to cover all costs. We did fundraising throughout the summer whereas Team Aachen tackled fundraising much earlier in the process. Our team members were assigned several"

Figure 6: Growth Curve of Uninduced and Induced Cultures (0.5 mM, 1 mM and 2 mM IPTG) The graph shows that on comparison with the uninduced control, after reaching an OD600 of 0.6,  the induced cultures stop growing when SBP starts to be expressed. Similar to the previous growth curve assay, after ~7 hours, it is possible that the emergence of mutants causes the the OD to rise again or the cells have adapted to the production of the foreign protein.

Keratinase A (KerA) contained two illegal cut sites, but a silent mutation was introduced to solve the issue. Keratinase US (KerUS) did not contain any.
The genes optimized for expression in E.coli and in standard biobrick format are the sequences listed in the parts pages on the registry.
Keratinase A (BBa_K1717171)
Keratinases are proteolytic enzymes which mainly break the disulphide bonds in various keratin substrates. KerA is a basic part comprised from a synthesized KerA protein coding sequence, optimized for expression in E. coli and most active in degrading keratin in feathers. This gene, when expressed in cells, can be tested for activity through looking for zones of clearing on skim milk agar plates where cells are growing, as well as by looking at degradation of keratin-containing substrates (feathers, hair, chemically synthesized keratin, etc.) when grown with cells.

Our program falls into 3 major components. The first component is User Interface . Users could give their assembling of parts by drag-and-drop function and setup initial conditions as well. System behavior as output will also be shown there. The second component is database written in MoDeL , which is the kernel of our automatic modeling idea. The last component is our designed to support MoDeL language. It functions as a driver: completing system network based on users' input and data stored in our database to give dynamic analysis as output.

== Welcome to the world of creation and imagination! ==
As the world enters upon an age of human nature destructions, of resource starvation and the ignorance of ecological balance, the earth is more and more under the control of human beings, there is less room for the survival of animals, various kinds of microorganism are being killed and regenerated circulatory in laboratory.
However, there exsits a special kind of bacterial, who is too diligent to be willing to be controlled by human, they use their magic power to learn certain skills to being survived successfully. Reviewing their developmental history, their ancestors made great contribution to the world under successive human experiments. They show us the meaning of Biobrick, they grasp the ability to adapt themselves better to the outside world, they know how to realize their value furthest and greatly, they are the E.COLI!
Now let us begin the E.COLI magical mystery tour~~
Input
In order to give users a clear and definite goal on input. The whole input process is divided into two main steps: Compartment Construction and Plasmid Construction. In the first step, users only need to focus on the input of environmental condition, compartment, spatial structure of compartments, and the species contained in each compartment. In the second step, only plasmids are editable, and users can click on each of them to assemble biobricks into functional device. Of course, useful tips will be given along with your input process.
We here give a design of our user interface of input. It is under construction.
Step#1 Compartment Construction

When you enter in our interface,the first step is to choose the environment of our system . A flask is like a container , all the  reactions are happening in it . After that you may pick a appropriate condition for our lovely E.Coli . One E.Coli isn't enough for some specific problem , so you have to decide how many you will pick up . Small molecule is"

Was an interesting day as there was a mash of meetings, one of which was a rather important meeting with the Webcomms and human practice people. We decided on what graphics were needed for the new website design and how they would be taken and then implemented. Also we had a bit of a kerfuffle regarding the deadline of the final site. All in all it was a hectic day but a lot was organized.

Attended meeting with Darren in the morning. He stressed that we should get at least one BioBrick moving which I am taking into account for planning next steps in the lab. After the meeting I read up on the use of microbial fuel cells in degradation of azo-dyes for the meeting in the afternoon.
Went to Westminster with Bioprocessing team (Joy, Maurice, Sanjay) to talk to Godfrey about MFCs and see how this could fit in with our project. Asked a lot of questions as to feasibility and he was extremely forthcoming with help about contacts and papers related to our project. He showed us the MFC prototypes and even offered some materials if we should need them. Told us that university of Reading may have some ready-to-use MFCs which we could procure.
After the meeting we re-grouped at Costa to plan our next steps. Decided that we most probably will not pursue the MFC angle as it does not really include azoreductase and current generated is not much. But we will keep it in mind as a possible secondary idea to build on our regular bioprocess. I will be doing literature reviews and research as to how to set up our bioprocess.

Expansion Introduction
    The MerR family of transcription activators includes those that respond to the presence of essential and toxic metals; and those that respond to the presence of drugs and other chemical species which cause cellular damage(Brown et al., 2003). The bacterial metal sensing MerR regulators directly bind metals and then activate transcription from unusual promoters as a result of metal binding. A recent phylogenetic analysis of the predicted protein sequences of metal responsive MerR regulators (COG0789) classifies them into several groups – a subgroup of which sense Hg2+ (MerR), Cu+ (CueR/SctR), Cd2+ (CadR), Pb2+ (PbrR), or Zn2+ (ZntR) with high specificity (Fig 1) etc. (Permina et al., 2006).

Comparison of Spinach2 and Spinach2.1
Since we introduced a mutation in the Spinach2 sequence to overcome a SpeI restriction site, our first task was to confirm that this modified sequence, Spinach2.1, was performing comparably to Spinach2, by performing fluorescence measurements on RNA produced in vitro. We encountered some complications when generating the spinach RNA by in vitro transcription. This can be due to different parameters e.g. the instability of RNA and presence of RNases.  We therefore had to work with what small amounts of RNA we could produce, and we were not able to perform as many replicates as we would have liked.
To test the ability of Spinach2.1 to activate DFHBI-1T fluorescence compared to Spinach2, we added DFHBI-1T to excess amounts of RNA and calculated to slope of the linear relationship between DFHBI-1T concentration and fluorescence
Figure 1: The plots show the relationship between DFHBI-1T concentration and fluorescence in the presence of excess Spinach2 (top) or Spinach2.1 (bottom) RNA.
The slopes of the curves in Figure 1 are 1.5 μM-1 for Spinach2 and 1.0 μM-1 for Spinach2.1. Since these two slopes are of the same order of magnitude we concluded that Spinach2.1 did not have a dramatically reduced ability to activate DFHBI-1T fluorescence, but in order to determine whether it is significantly reduced, experiments with more replicates should be carried out.
We also compared the fluorescence of Spinach2 and Spin"
DTU-Denmark,2013,Team:DTU-Denmark#HelloWorld_-_-_TEXT.html," of 3 fragments. The starting point was a plasmid construct with RFP and GFP SF respectively. The RFP and GFP SF were amplified out with their associated RBS (the same in both cases).
The TAT signal peptide was bought as a gBlock from IDT. All fragments were assembled into an expression vector specially designed to have a tight on/off mechanism.  For this we used a promoter constructed from our synthetic promoter library ( BBa_K1067007 ). Primers were design by the program PHUSER [5] so that we got a seamless assembly.
Visualization
To visualize that GFP SF actually is exported, we constructed a procedure for growing the cells and tracing the GFP SF to the periplasm (Skoog, Karl, et al.). As we initially found, if you just grow cells in LB and induce the GFP SF/RFP expression, there will be too much GFP SF in the cytoplasm to get a good resolution between cytoplasm and periplasm. That is why it’s important to devise a procedure for stopping the production for GFP SP and thereafter tracing it from the cytoplasm into the periplasm. This underlines the importance of having a non-leaky inducible expression system; when expression is stopped by removing the inducer it would spoil the procedure if the system kept leaking out GFP SF into the cytoplasm.
After optimizing the procedure we made a final version which can be found in the methods page . This also includes how to use background subtraction to get a better resolution.
Results
We used different methods for testing that our construct actually did work and also for verifying the model we did before the test.
Periplasmic vs. cytoplasmic fraction
The first test we did was to purify the periplasmic fraction of the cells and then to compare them with the cytoplasmic fraction ( lab notebook entry ). We did this with the cold osmotic shock method and viewed the fraction under UV-light.
Periplasmic fractions are clear green fluorescent while the pellet with the cytoplasmic fraction is red fluorescent
Fluorescent microscope images
Next test was the ""real thing"". We wanted water-tight evidence that GFP SF was actually exported; and what better way to do this than getting pictures of it? After following our procedure for chasing GFP SF to the periplasm, we observed these images after background subtraction. Following is an image with no zoom:

Next to test our model we picked a cell this good resolution and zoomed in on this:

This year we managed to collaborate with two iGEM teams: Team Buenos_Aires, and Team UC_Chile. For team Buenos_Aires, we manage to characterize their part BBa_K1106003 consisting of an mRFP generator under the Ars Promoter, all our characterization information can be found at our results Tab. For Team UC_Chile we helped them increase the outreach of their video game in our country, being visited by several of our wiki, and facebook followers.
Taking into consideration several implications regarding ownership and sharing of iGEM projects, we decided to develop a guide, novel to iGEM, referring to patenting issues in our country and an useful tool which many teams can use to understand more about the commercial value of their project, if they wish to continue working on it, or even develop a starter project. We’ve provided some guidelines and the link to our very own “QuickLook” in the “Project” tab of our webpage.
Collaboration
One of the most important parts of science and scientific progress is commonly forgotten by researchers. Working and communication between teams is not only beneficial for both in technical terms, but also opens a bridge that is essential for science; collaboration.
This year we crossed words with a fellow Latin American team. Team: Buenos_Aires started the conversation and our ideas began to flow we talked about how we were achieving hypoxia for our hypoxic promoters characterization and how they were measuring their arsenic sensitive promoters. After some discussion we concluded that we could improve each other’s measurements and agreed to make the collaboration.
When we received the part Team: Buenos_Aires we proceeded with transforming its DNA into Escherichia coli TOP10 chemocompetent cells. Selection of transformants was done with Tetracicline and we continued with a restriction analysis using EcoRI and PstI enzymes. The resulting agarose gel is shown by duplicate in the following pictures.
After transformants were proven to have the correct plasmid by restriction analysis, we started induction with sodium arsenite. Different concentrations ranging from 0 ppb to 1000ppb were used as induction and measurements were done at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 hours.
In each column, 10mL cultures of E.coli transformed with the measurement device were grown until 0.5 OD600. After that, cultures were induced with different concentrations (in ppb) of sodium arsenite. Measurements of RFP fluorescence (AU) and OD600 were taken every time specified in"

Scope and Future Aspect
The partsregistry.org is a continuously growing collection of genetic parts that can be mixed and matched to build synthetic biology devices and systems. The Registry is based on the principle of ""get some, give some"". Registry users benefit from using the parts and information available from the Registry in designing their engineered biological systems. In exchange, the expectation is that Registry users will, in turn, contribute back information and data on existing parts and new parts that they make to grow and improve this community resource.As a growing databes partsrgistry.org need to be more organized and improved.Huge collection of parts requires some algoritms not to get lost in database. According to this needs, BIO-Guide is the first designed software that enable huge amount of parts in partsregistry.org to be organized as a possible biological device and system construct member based on graph theory. Application of synthetic biology is emerging field and these kinds of softwares are inevitable needs in that field. Making parts standards as suitable is the focus of synthetic biology and our innovative approach make parts in partsregistry.org  easy to use. After designing algoritm we understand that present standards are inadequate and partsregistry form must be improved. We need new form format during parts registry, some additional features make database more handleable. In future , we think to develop BIO-GUIDE 2.0 after revising parts registry form. Our final aim is to make a software making intended device and systems automatically. All you will do is writing your needs as a output and input or more complex networks and BIOGUIDE will give you all possible construct. It is not a dream because we made this software algorithm fundamentals this year and next year we will improve it

Grant continued research regarding stochastic promoters and random systems of activation.
Tuesday
Yuan found an antiport chloride and hydrogen ion pump that responds to high extracellular hydrogen ion concentration by pumping hydrogen ions out of the cell against the gradient and pumping chloride ions into the cell. Coupling this part to the Pgad promoter, which detects intracellular chloride ion concentration, should allow for a pH sensitive promoter to be made. At low pH’s the Pgad promoter will turn on while at higher pH’s it will turn off.

Abstract
To transform the lysine signal to the kind of signal which is easy to be detected, we chose to use a lysine deficient E.coli. It can hardly grow without lysine. But when the medium contains lysine released from the complementary chain, the E.coli ΔLysA begins to grow. Meanwhile, we transformed a plasmid with fluorescent protein gene into the E.coli ΔLysA. So with the growth of the E.coli ΔLysA, there will be fluorescence which is easy to be detected.       In this way, we can transform the lysine signal to the fluorescence signal. Consider that the lysine concentration could be weak, we decided to use a strong promoter(BBa_J23100) and a cyclic amplifier to improve the signal, and a dual fluorescence system to improve the sensitivity.
Introduction
1
After the lysine has been dissociated from complementary chain, it will induce the growth of E.coli ΔLysA, which can hardly grow without the addition of lysine. Thus we have transformed our own-designed circuit to the E.coli ΔLysA, which can express fluorescent protein as it grows. In this way, we can transform the concentration of lysine to the fluorescent intensity which can be detected through the machine.
4.
Besides the luxR and luxI generator, there are also lacI generator and GFP reporter downstream the plux promoter. LacI represses plac promoter, leading to an inhibition to the RFP expression. So with the induction of plux promoter, there will be a higher GFP fluorescence and a lower RFP fluorescence.
2.
But the concentration of the lysine is very low, resulting in a low fluorescent intensity. To solve this problem, we designed a strong promoter, cyclic amplifier system and a dual fluorescence system in our genetic circuit to ensure a much higher signal strength and sensitivity, which is definitely beneficial to our detection of AFP.
Figure 1：BIT_Figure_About genetic circiut.
3.
As shown, pcat is a strong constitutive promoter, which can promote the induced promoter plux. Promoter plux can be induced by the compound of LuxR and AHL. Downstream the plux, we designed the a cyclic amplifier system: luxR generator codes LuxR, and LuxI generator codes luxI, which can catalyze the synthesis of AHL. When the concentration of AHL has reached the threshold value, AHL combines Lux"
Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 Float Gas_-_-_TEXT.html,"] where a reversible hydrogenase enzyme catalyzes a reaction between photosystem II and ferredoxin. The water-splitting reaction of photosystem II creates electrons that are sent to ferredoxin, and the reversible hydrogenase in the stroma of the chloroplast combines these electrons with free-floating protons in the medium to create H2. [5] Our problem was that C. reinhardtii’s reversible hydrogenase is extremely sensitive to O2 pressure, and will irreversibly inactivate upon sensing oxygen. Thus the alga's photosynthetic production of H2 and O2 must be temporally separated, and can be done upon inducing two-stage direct biophotolysis. CO2 is fixed normally through oxygenic photosynthesis during Stage 1, and H2 is then generated under anaerobic conditions in Stage 2. This can be easily done by depleting sulfur from the culture medium. [6]
Prior research by Jo et al. (2006) [7] has shown that optimizing growth conditions for C. reinhardtii can result in a little over 2 mL of H2 produced for a 10 mL culture of alga after 96 hours. This optimized process gave a hydrogen production rate approximately 1.55 times higher than typical cultivation in sulfur deprived TAP medium. Our process was not perfectly optimized, so we expected a gas production rate of approximately 1.33 mL of H2 for a 10 mL culture of algae after 96 hours.
Experimental design & data
Figure 2: Our uncovered flask of C. reinhardtii, filled with BG-11 media and topped with a commercial latex balloon.
Figure 3: Our covered flask of C. reinhardtii with the balloon-filling mechanism in place.
Our C. reinhardtii strain 90 was ordered from UTEX in glass tubes filled with agar. All cultures for testing were grown from this original stock. To begin, we scraped C. reinhardtii from the original agar stock and added it in 10 mL sulfur-free BG-11 media, with exposure to light at 21 W/m2 in 12 hour cycles. BG-11 ( recipe ) was chosen for being a commonly-used medium for growing freshwater algae. After the algae had grown to a sufficient density, the flask was covered in aluminum foil to briefly deprive the algae of light, and a commercial latex water balloon was inserted over the mouth of the flask for gas collection.
After waiting several days for the balloon to expand and re-reviewing existing literature, we realized that the latex balloon used, despite having a very thin"

Greensboro-Austin,2013,Team:Greensboro-Austin#Standard Proposal_-_-_TEXT.html,", the chance of one of the four restriction sites popping up in your sequence is rapidly surpasses 50%. We concluded from this analysis that restriction site mutagenesis likely burdens a majority of teams wishing to submit novel parts to the registry.
Survey Results
Fixing restriction sites requires both time and money because in order for anyone to utilize your part using the same standard you need to mutate away those unwanted restriction sites in your construct. For iGEM teams who have both limited time and funding, this is a real problem and nonetheless an obstacle for any research group trying to share their work using the Biobrick database. Furthermore, it draws resources away from better characterization of parts - a well-known deficiency of constructs submitted to the registry. Due to these major drawbacks, we speculated that other teams might be having the same issues with regards to part submission and illegal restriction sites. To find out we made a survey asking other teams if they ever come across the same sorts of problems as our team. This survey was distributed through emails to all faculty member emails found for iGEM teams, and through social media to contact student team members. As 9/27/13, we have received responses from 43 teams.
Figure 2: Survey responses, N=43
Notable Responses
Many of our respondents experienced difficulties with unwanted restriction sites in their parts, which results in fewer parts entering the the registry each year. However, some respondents were hesitant or even hostile towards the idea of changing the standard. Some notable responses from individuals at other institutions are shown below.
""I strongly agree with this statement. Having to perform site-directed mutagenesis in order to submit parts to the Registry is a complete waste of time"" Student
""Comment: the intent of the assembly standard is to lower the technical barrier for synthetic biology, not to prevent teams from getting awards. The repository is a collection of *sharable*, ready-to-use parts, not just a storage space for Team X's project. "" Faculty Instructor
""We need to train our students on the way science is being done now, not back in 1980."" Faculty Instructor
""If you have problems with cloning or the presence of 'illegal' restriction sites, stop complaining and deal with it."" Graduate Advisor
""We started our experiments using restriction-ligation but all of these failed. Next we tried Gibson assembly and were almost immediately successful"" Student

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

Emails were sent to all current members of the IGSC asking them to screen twelve sequences for us. Of the five companies that were willing to help us, all of them correctly identified the un-encrypted toxic proteins.
However, no organization could correctly identify the encrypted toxins.
While this result is unsettling, it is not unexpected. All genomic science relies heavily on the assumption that there is a known relationship between DNA and protein. Though the technology for large-scale recoding does not presently exist, it is prudent to be prepared instead of ignoring a potentially dangerous problem.
This experiment was repeated using each variation of the BLAST software hosted on the NCBI website. Again, the software could not identify any of the completely recoded sequences. If you are curious about the results, the sequences that we sent are available for you to try as well.
Get Data
Since the initial testing, we have maintained correspondence with individuals at these companies and are looking forward to working closely with them to ensure that DNA synthesis remains a safe and secure practice. We would also like to thank the companies and the wonderful individuals that we had the chance to interact with for their tremendous assistance in identifying and dealing with this problem before it becomes a pressing security issue. Synthetic biologists need DNA, and DNA synthesis needs new bioinformatic screening tools.
Beating BLAST
Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
To the best of our knowledge, the only tool maintaining the safety and security of DNA synthesis is BLAST. We have shown earlier that complete genetic recoding completely nullifies the ability of BLAST to detect a sequence, but it remains to be seen how much recoding BLAST can tolerate before a sequence becomes totally unrecognizable. BLAST works by breaking a query sequence into small ‘words’ of a specified length. Words that exactly match a sequence within the database are ‘high-scoring pairs’ and contribute to a positive scoring alignment. In essence, the more exact word matches in a query sequence to a database sequence, the better the alignment score will be.
However, it is not intuitively obvious what degree of genetic recoding is"

The final category, Impact, includes working with organizations and infrastructure that is already in place to actually help people who suffer from Cataracts. We have raised funds, through bake sales and other events, to donate to the Himalayan Cataracts Project, a non-profit organization based in Nepal.  With the help of our business and economics teacher, we have also created a marketing plan and started discussions with several biotech investors about the possibility of getting our project to market.
Research
Professional Help
In order to improve our research and prototype, we needed to get in contact with experts in the fields of eye surgery and cataract research. Our first step was to contact eye doctors to discuss any problems associated with current cataract treatments. Finally, while developing our project we realized that cataracts are a major issue in pets and other animals as well. As a result, we contacted local veterinarians to discuss what pet owners do when their pets develop cataracts. As our project developed, we needed more specific information regarding our genes of interest, cataract development, and our delivery mechanism. We contacted scientists doing research similar to our own to get their opinions on our projects as well.
Contact with Eye Doctors
We contacted local Taiwanese eye doctors to ask them about cataracts surgery. Here is a list of the doctors we contacted along with the information they provided:
Dr. Wei-Chi Wu is a retina specialist and an associate professor at Chang Gung memorial hospital in Taiwan.
Dr. Tsu Chieh Cheng is a opthamologist at Chang Cheng eye hospital in Taiwan.
According to Dr. Wu current cataract surgery methods are efficient and effective, but are not without their issues. Beside the high cost of surgery, there can also be several different post-surgery complications such as infection, hemorrhaging, or secondary glaucoma. In regards to our project, he said one of the biggest issues we would face is non-invasive delivery. Currently, injections and incisions are the only methods for delivery because all current potential methods of noninvasive delivery either lack efficiency or induce side effects.
Dr. Cheng points out that aside from possibly causing complications such as astigmatism, myopia, and hyperopia, cataract surgeries have risks, such as wound infections, dislodgement of lens, and massive bleeding during surgeries are not uncommon. He remarked that our project sounded very promising, but the effect that the drug has on other parts of the eye must be checked. Furthermore, he suggested that we use rabbits or"

4. Prepare 1% agarose gel in Conical flask. Weigh 0.6 g agarose and add 60 ml 1x TAE (diluted from 50x TAE). Cover the Conical flask with silver paper to avoid the loss of water vapor. Place the Conical flask in the microwave and microwave for 1 minute with a middle power. Take it out and shake gently till the solution is homogeneous,(BE CAREFUL to watch the solution closely when shake it–it superheats and can boil over and cause severe burns). Continue microwave and swirl until solution is seen clear and homogeneous with no existence of solid. After cool down the agarose gel briefly, add 3 μl of Gelred (10000x ) and mix well. Pour the agarose gel in gel casting apparatus and insert combs.

NYMU-Taipei,2016,Team:NYMU-Taipei#HP#Gold-Media Analysis_-_-_TEXT.html," is not what scientists, journalist and those engaged in science communication hope to compose. Science news often focus on latest research, and put less attention on presenting multiple viewpoints[3] which may resulting in impartial reports leading audience astray. In addition, attribution of responsibility is also important for helping the audience recognize and conceive an issue with different aspects, while many correspondents tend to display only one attribution. Though it may give the audience with quick access to an issue, it would help less to build the basis for further science communication. And as additional reading is given, those who are interested can search for more information right away, decreasing the difficulty and time consumption in out reaching. In the part of sufficiency, we would consider if multiple viewpoints and attribution of responsibility are presented and whether additional reading material is offered.
Understandability determines whether or not the encoding information can be decoding, that is, whether is in a form that they can comprehend.[4][5] High understandability allows educated layman and non-experts to access to information and knowledge transferred. Definition and explanation of technical term is strongly recommended by National Cancer Institute[6]. Moreover, since today’s reader is not tomorrow’s reader, we can’t expect the audience of carry-on learning.  The assistance of illustration or infographics can enhance the audience’s comprehension of an issue[7]. For Newspaper and Journals in Taiwan, providing alternative language for technical terms can be important. Generic category label, or Schema, helps people activate proper and related structure of information. Offering terminology in more than one language can help people acquainted with different language and different knowledge level to reactivate the right structure and storing place of knowledge[8]. We would consider if terminology explanation, additional assistance and terminological translation are provided in the context.
Besides information sufficiency and understandability, we also want to know in what attitude is the information being transferred to the audience. In the sub-study of the attitude part, we perform consistency test on the analyzer and our instructor who are also a sociologist, Professor Tsai.
Research Limit
There are three main limit to our research:
1. The limit of transfer effectiveness access. Information sufficiency is highly related to the audience needs, thus it is challenging to define and                     measure whether or not the information presented is sufficient. In addition, in our research, we are not going to do any experiment and survey testing                     whether the 2 elements we investigating in would really affect the transfer effectiveness. All we could do is cite it from paper. Here are some cases we                     consider it helpful for iGEMers who are also interested in social research.

Teambuilding at TeamEscape Düsseldorf
After an initial month of getting to know each other a few of our team wanted to experience a live escape game at Team Escape Düsseldorf under the motto “one team - one room - one goal: Escape”.  Some people say that live escape games are not for the faint of heart or for claustrophobic people because people are locked inside a room until they manage to break out. But it’s actually super fun as you don’t have to escape by using force or by jumping out the windows but by solving a bunch of riddles with your team members within 60 minutes!
The most exciting part in our escape game was that we were actually locked inside a laboratory!
But why? The story went as follows:  The day has arrived. A global pandemic outbreak has sent the world into chaos. One third of the human population has been infected by a deadly virus. Millions of people are on the brink of death. But there are good and bad news.  The good news first: One Professor - Professor Dr. Hofman - has been experimenting with this virus for a while and seemed to have found a serum against it in time.  The bad news are that he was kidnapped right before he was about to publish his results. The world is doomed!  Now a team of talented scientist - us - were granted access to his laboratories to create the cure based on his lab book. The difficult part: His notes are hidden and put behind locks by the kidnappers. The team has only one hour to create the serum until the pandemic will be unstoppable.  Are they going to save the world in time?
Of course we weren’t dealing with real viruses and scientific research in a real laboratory because otherwise it would have taken a much longer time to save the world.  Instead our most important task was to get out by solving several riddles in time.
Our strategy: Search - collect - combine.  At first we looked through the entire room to find as many hints as possible. Then we gathered them in one place and started combining them one by one, in order to find codes to open the locks. Behind those locks we"

Discussion and Conclusion
We found that while the controls had a fairly uniform interior, the lumazine expressing cells did not (Figure 2). In the lumazine cells there were homogenous areas of grey as well as darker spots, whereas the controls contained a more uniform interior.
We hypothesized that the lumazine accumulated together, which caused the isolation of other cellular elements. If this is the case, the microcompartments should most likely be the homogenous areas of grey not seen in the controls, and can’t be distinguished by contrast staining because they are aggregated together.
To see if this is the case we will look at cells expressing BBa_K542008 under the spectral confocal (fluorescence) microscope. We hypothesize that if the microcompartments are segregated from other cellular elements then the fluorescent proteins will also be segregated and therefore we should see areas within the cell with brighter fluorescence.
Fluorescence Microscopy
E. coli DH5α cells containing BBa_K542008 were viewed with fluorescence microscopy. This was done in order to determine if the distribution of fluorescent proteins within the cells was similar to the homogenous grey regions seen in the cells under TEM.
Materials and Methods
E. coli DH5α cells containing the BBa_K542008 construct were grown overnight at 37°C. They were spun down at 10,000 rpm and then resuspended in 1X phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The solution was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm, decanted and resuspended in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight. This solution was then centrifuged at 10000 rpm and cells were resuspended in glycerol. The glycerol-cell mixtures were then placed on slides, coverslipped and sealed.
The slides were viewed with an Olympus FV1000 spectral confocal at 60X magnification. Pictures were taken using the ECFP and EYFP filters.
Results
Figure 4.E. coli DH5a cells containing the BBa_K542008 construct as viewed under spectral confocal microscope with 60X magnification. The left picture corresponds to the ECFP filter and the right picture corresponds to the EYFP filter.
Conclusion
Figure 4 shows that the fluorescent proteins were expressed in the cells. It is also evident that the fluorescence was segmented in a way that looks similar to that found in the homogenous grey areas in the TEM micrographs of the cells.

Symposium: European Practice Jamboree
Since none of our team members had any experience when it came to extravagant events such as the giant jamboree, we wanted to recreate this atmosphere in Leuven. A presentation in front of hundreds of people sounds rather scary and overwhelming, so what better way to overcome such a feeling than by imitating it? So, to prepare our team and the other teams in the best way possible, we planned to bring as many teams together in Leuven for the European Practice Jamboree. The goal of this meet-up was to practice the presentations so the team members who are presenting in Boston get comfortable presenting to a rather sizable crowd. Of course, we could never reach the same number of attendees as the Giant Jamboree in Boston, but we could tried to bring together as many people as possible.
We planned this event from the beginning of our journey, because we were very enthusiastic to meet fellow iGEM participants. First, we went to the Benelux meet-up at Wageningen University, there we had a great time and got to know the Dutch teams. It was really nice to interact with so many young and enthusiastic people, all enrolled in the iGEM competition. The atmosphere there couldn’t be described. This meet-up took place in the beginning of the summer, so the only thing we could present was our project ideas since we weren’t able to start until the summer holidays.
We wanted to take it a step further and waited till the 7th of October to make sure the teams finished or were nearly done with their projects. In that way they could present everything they had done during the summer. We invited all teams located in the European region to the European Practice Jamboree, eventually 4 teams responded and attended this event. Representatives of iGEM team Amsterdam, Ionis Paris, Aachen and Munich attended the event. They had prepared a presentation and a poster, every team had the chance to present their project and get feedback from the crowd. In this way the teams were able to adjust their presentation based on the critique and feedback from the other iGEM teams. In between the presentations we were given to remarkable talks by two keynote speakers (Professor Jos Vander Sloten and Professor Johan Swinnen). The latter, Prof, Swinnen, inspired us all with his life story as researcher. This summer he ran 2400 kilometers from Leuven to Santiago de Compostela, as a tribute to cancer patients all over the world. His story inspired the iGEM teams to go further"

First steps in implementing even simple systems of equations into MatLab are being taken slow.
Implementing in TinkerCell was successful. However, its results need to be verified by coding in MatLab later on. We hoped to  be able to generate set of equations for MatLab after creating the visual network in TinkerCell, but this functionality was not working in the program.

We didn't manage to find many information on relveant constants. We decided to arrange meeting with advisers for next day to help us with the issue.
We need to look for estimates of the necessary values. It is very unlikely that we will be able to find the exact constants without performing experiments.
During the meeting, it was discovered that there is a major error in our model. Our system does not obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics. We have to remodel using the law of Mass Action.

Building competent mealworms with the ability to disintegrate PET in addition to polystyrene
   We were interested in solving the problem of processing excess plastic waste, and while contemplating about ways to go about it in the most nature-friendly manner, we came across mealworms, which were found to have the ability to digest plastic. At first, our team wished to devise a mechanism that would fasten the process of plastic digestion, thus increasing efficiency of degradation. However, that would have required significant amount of time spent on just discovering the single enzyme responsible for degradation and additional time studying about enzyme transformation, which seemed too much of a challenge for the first-year bio-engineers we were. Then, after some more research into mealworms, we found out that mealworms do not degrade just ANY plastic. They would only digest polystyrene, more commonly known as styrofoam. So we thought, how about we give these mealworms the ability to degrade a more variety of plastic? If we could make this a reality that would mean the areas of mealworm application would be expanded and more diverse usage may be possible! So for our bio-machine, we decided to build a more competent mealworm that could also digest PET, another common plastic that troubles the globe.

1.3 Gene Doping DNA Extraction
Design: We spiked samples with artificial gene doping DNA and confirmed its extraction with PCR.
Results and interpretation: Guided by our gene doping model, we spiked samples with 2x10^8 fragments/ml of either linear or plasmid EPO cDNA. We performed extraction, followed by PCR to verify it. Two EPO internal primer combinations were used. For the primer set 072 & 073 the expected band size was 297 bp and for the primer set 074 & 075 the expected band size was 140 bp. figure 4 confirmed the successful extraction of gene doping EPO DNA. The difference in intensity between the linear DNA spiked (sample 3 & 4) and the plasmid spiked (sample 5 & 6) indicates that the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit has a lower extraction efficiency for plasmids, since the same amount of fragments were spiked.

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer1_-_-_TEXT.html,"-pAlst-RFP CLONING
We cloned IDT G-Blocks GadE gene into PSB1C3 vector in order to make it ready to be submitted and have many copies of it. For this purpose we digested PSB1C3 vector and TnrA-pAlst-RFP G-Blocks with ECoRI and PstI restriction enzymes. Then we ligated these cut genes into the plasmid by using T4 DNA Ligase . Ocurring products were transformed into BL21 competent cell strain.
To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was perfomed with Verify Forward and Verify Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly t the band should be 314 bp long, but if colony PCR worked, then bands should be 1800 bp long.
As the result of Colony PCR experiments, we observed bands are either negative or less molecule-weighted than we expected. We made liquid cultures of the not negative colonies, and isolated DNA from these colonies after incubating for 16 hours. we did cut-check with EcoRI and PstI enzymes in order to control occurring DNA’s.
After  cut-check, we observed less molecule-weighted bands again. Therefore we decided to control our ordered G-Blocks and did a PCR experiment with CMV forward and SV40 reverse primers. The gel  image of this PCR is shown below.
TnrA-pTnrA-RFP PCR
After that PCR, we observed less molecule-weighted bands than normal.
pET45 -TnrA-pTnrA-RFP CLONNING
We questioned if the plasmid is incorrect because the results of PSB1C3 cloning weren’t matching with our expected results. We cut the G-Block with BamHI and XhoI and ligated it with pET45-b which was cut with same enzymes. We transformed this ligated product into BL21 bacteria strain, which has T7 RNA polymerase.
In order to control if the cloning is made correctly, we did a colony PCR with T7 Promoter reverse and T7 promoter forward. If cloning isn’t made properly, the band should be at 360 bp line and if is made properly the band should be at 1779 bp line.
In colony PCR results, we observed lower molecule-weighted bands than expected, again. In this case we realized that this gene sequence was wrong.
We didn’t have enough time to order and clone this gene so we didn’t continue to do this part’s experiments.

This was amongst other factors due to the establishment of rubber plantations. These particular rubber plantations only account for a very small fraction of the worlds total rubber production, so one can imagine the global deforestation due to the creation of rubber plantations. Source: Li, H., et al: Demand for rubber is causing the loss of high diversity rain forest in SW China. Biodivers Conserv (2007) 16:1731–1745 (Link)
Another issue is the growing need for agriculture. Even when plantations are established in areas with no rainforest, they constitute a problem. It is not hard to imagine the future needs for arable lands in a world of a fast growing global population, Fast Growing Global Population UN projects the global population to grow from 6.1 billion (2000) to 8.9 billions in 2050. source: UN 2300 report and the establishment of rubber plantations may well take up these areas, which are perfect for agriculture.
Synthetic rubber is mostly made from scarce fossil fuel resources, which increases the pollution of our planet. Furthermore, synthetic rubber does not always degrade well in nature. On the other hand, being a natural compound, natural rubber is biodegradable.

STAR
Small transcription activating RNA (STAR) is the part B of our feedback loop (NFBL), which works as a buffer in our three-node feedback loop. STAR is a significant switch which determines whether the gene of interest downstream could be expressed or not. With the presence of STAR, the target gene will be activated due to the combination of it with the terminator RNA upstream the gene of interest. While the target gene is inhibited without STAR. STAR is a good part as small RNA to construct synthetic gene networks that precisely control gene expression.
Key Achievements
Characterization of STAR-mediated target gene activation over a period of time.
Overview
As the Three-node Negative Feedback Loop is needed for the precise control of the transcriptional level, a buffer is necessary to be the upstream of the target gene. STAR is chosen to play that role.
The STAR contains a terminator and a STAR antisense.
The terminator resides in the 5΄ untranslated region of the target gene. In the absence of the STAR antisense, the terminator will be allowed to form, which will prevent the transcription of the target gene.
With STAR antisense present, it will anneal with the 5’ region of the terminator stem, which will prevent the formation of the terminator. In this way, the RNA polymerase is able to start transcribe.
There are obvious advantages for introducing STAR into our system, including:
Low metabolic burden: Compared to the universal protein-based regulatory systems, STAR dispense with translation step as a RNA regulator, which saves a great amount of resources.
High efficiency: The presence of STAR produces an expression of the downstream gene whose activation is 100-fold compared with the condition when STAR is absent, which provides the efficiency and validity.
Fast response: STAR acts quickly when receiving signal molecules and causes little delay in the circuit because of rapid RNA degradation.
Our approach
STAR is the part B in our negative feedback loop. With the existence of the part B, which works as a buffer in our system, our three-node feedback loop will show higher fidelity than the simple two-node feedback loop.
STAR will be activated by part A, since it is regulated by the Lac I promoter. Meanwhile, STAR will upregulate the expression of part C since the terminator part of the STAR, which will be regulated by the STAR antisense is upstream the gene for part C. Consequently, the upregulation of part A caused by the input signal will indirectly activate part C with the help of the buffer - STAR. In this"

Parts Overview
The most significant hazard in the RAINmaker project would be the use of chemicals containing arsenic. Pure arsenic is not only toxic to humans, but it can also be highly toxic to aquatic life with lasting environmental and ecological effects. Sigma Aldrich warns that arsenic may also cause cancer. To work more safely, Tacoma RAINmakers used the sodium arsenate and sodium arsenite, which are the inorganic derivatives of arsenic that shows significantly less toxicity than the pure arsenic. When using sodium arsenate/sodium arsenite, Tacoma RAINmakers are engaging in a series of stringent safety practices. First, safety glasses will always be used to protect eyes. For hand protection, our team will wear nitrile gloves that equal or exceed required layer thickness (0.11mm). Contaminated gloves will be disposed of with proper glove removal technique (without touching glove's outer surface). To protect the body, our team will wear lab coats during all arsenic-related experiments. RAINmakers have considered air-purifying respirators, but have deemed this precaution unnecessary with proper lab technique use of a biosafety cabinet. Arsenic waste solutions or powder will not be allowed to enter drains or any location outside the lab.

Exeter
The collaboration between our team and the Exeter iGEM team was two-fold. As one of our reporter modules for the Sensynova multicellular biosensor framework, we standardised and characterised a variant of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) not submitted to the registry before; deGFP. The Exeter team collected single cell data for E. coli cells expressing deGFP. To see more about this data, check out our results page .
The Exeter iGEM team have been working on a filtration system for water from mines using modified bacteria. A feature of their system will be to use UV to kill any bacteria in the system after use. To assist the team, we performed an experiment to independently determine the effectiveness of UV as a method to sterilise their system. We grew up Top10 E. coli cells and subjected them to UV for 0, 1,2.5, 5, or 10 mins, before plating out the culture. The cultures were static incubated overnight and the number of colonies on the plate were counted. This data was then sent to Exeter for further analysis.
Evry Paris-Saclay
We were initially contacted by Jérémy Armetta from the Evry Paris-Saclay team as our team was working on a synthetic promoter library and they were wondering if we could work together as they aimed to make a psicose synthetic promoter in order to create a biosensor.
We organised a Skype call to discuss how our projects intertwined. After a little chat, it was clear that we were taking different approaches to achieving our synthetic promoters and therefore could not help each other in such a manner.
We suggested that, once working, we could take the biosensor created by the Evry Paris-Saclay team and implement it to our framework as a variant to the IPTG biosensor currently used as our proof of concept. By co-culturing this biosensor module to the framework's other modules, we would be able to come up with various variants of the psicose biosensor for the Evry team.
However, due to synthesis issues causing delays and therefore time constraints, we have been able to implement the psicose biosensor into our framework but lacked the time to co-culture this part with the Sensynova platform's multiple"
