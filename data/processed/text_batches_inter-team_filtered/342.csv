Once the full length genes came, we tried amplifying the genes using the forward and the reverse primers from the OE PCR reactions. We used thermocycler settings that had worked for past reactions but still saw multiple bands for some of the genes, suggesting that the primers had non-specific annealing at those annealing temperatures. We started making touch-down thermocycler settings for each gene to determine what annealing temperature would yield the least amount of non-specific bands.
After outgrowth in liquid selective media, our cultures repeatedly failed to show colonies when plated on selective media. In order to address this, we redid our protocol for making chemicompetent Y. lipolytica cells after performing a final plating with the last of our transformant cell stock. We also performed transformations to reamplify our D17 plasmid in anticipation of beginning Gibson Assembly trials.
For our second yeast transformation attempt, we accidentally used less plasmid DNA; we obtained no growth. For our third attempt, we made sure to use the sufficient amount of plasmid DNA and to eliminate the outgrowth step, which was not necessary for leucine-marker selection. This yielded a successful transformation.

Over the weekend our final Y. lipolytica plating showed a large amount of growth, indicating that our old stock was indeed competent. Our E. coli amplification, however, showed no growth. It was found that this was because of an error in the media used. To save time, we thawed our previous glycerol stock of transformed cells and used it to inoculate a culture for outgrowth and plasmid isolation. DNA yields of this culture were lower than previous amplifications. We reasoned that this was due to the glycerol stock not having been plated on selective media before freezing. This would have resulted in some population of non-transformants existing in the stock and lowering plasmid yields. To remedy this, we plated our glycerol stock on selective media to isolate colonies and inoculated cultures with these colonies. We left these cultures to incubate over the weekend.
We began PCR experiments to amplify our riboswitch inserts in anticipation of our Gibson Assembly trials. Trials initially showed mixed results, which was perplexing since all PCR trials used the same primers and overhangs, but were confirmed as successful on 0.8% agarose gels by"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," a prior probability is necessary. The prior probability for effective gene silencing of mammalian genes can be obtained from former siRNA experiments and is approximately 0.1 (Takasaki, 2009). Since we have no data on prokaryotic siRNAs, we use the same prior probability for our predictions. The gene silencing probability \(P(eff|X)\) is described as:    $$ P(eff|X) = \frac{P^{eff} P(X|eff)}{P^{eff} P(X|eff) + P^{inf} P(X|inf)}  \qquad (1)$$    The 19 nt siRNA binding sequence is represented by X, where \(x_i^n\) corresponds to the bases adenine, guanine, cytosine or uracil (indexes 1≤n≤4) at sequence position i. The probabilities P(X|eff) and P(X|inf) are calculated based on prior knowledge about siRNA sequences that were shown to be effective respectively ineffective in silencing their target mRNAs. Based on the analysis of 833 effective and 847 ineffective siRNAs, Takasaki et al. determined the likelyhood with which base n occures at position i in an effective/ineffective siRNA sequences, represented by the coefficients \(q_{x_i^n}^{eff}\) and \(q_{x_i^n}^{inf}\) respectively (Takasaki, 2009). These coeffecients are often referred to as frequency ratios of n at position i.
\(P(X|eff)\) and \(P(X|inf)\) are computed as the product of the frequency ratios for each base n at position i in the siRNA binding sequence:  $$ P(X|inf) = \prod_{i=1}^{19} q_{x_i^n}^{eff} \qquad  (2)$$ $$ P(X|inf) = \prod_{i=1}^{19} q_{x_i^n}^{inf} \qquad  (3)$$
Both probabilities are weighted with their prior probabilities, \(P^{eff}\) and \(P^{inf} = 1-P^{eff}\), where \(P^{eff}\) is set to 0.1 as mentioned previously. With all defined formulas (1), (2) and (3), the gene silencing probability \(P(eff|X)\) is calculated as follows:  $$P(eff|X) = \frac{P^{eff} P(X|eff"

BYU_Provo,2014,Team:BYU Provo#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the oxidative pathway that converts ammonia to nitrite and then nitrate. This process occurs naturally in sewage bioreactors due to ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) like N. multiformis that thrive in regions of anaerobic conditions. Since ammonia is toxic to many aquatic and terrestrial lifeforms, AOBs play a critical role in cleaning wastewater by effectively removing the majority of the ammonia that enters the treatment facility. According to chemical analysis performed on the influent and effluent at the Silver Creek Water Reclamation Facility in Park City, Utah, ammonia enters the facility at a concentration of 34.0 mg/l and leaves at a concentration of 0.50 mg/l. These values display that current practices in sewage treatment are quite effective in ammonia removal, cleaning out about 99% of the ammonia deposited and produced in sewage. At the same time though, nitrate, the end product of ammonia oxidation, is released from these facilities at high concentrations. Although not as toxic as ammonia, nitrate also has harmful impacts on the environment including the acidification of waterways, unbalanced expansion of primary producers in the ecosystem causing eutrophication (see photograph below), and even growth and developmental challenges for several organisms. The chemical analysis of the effluent from the Silver Creek Water Reclamation Facility revealed that nitrate and nitrite, a less prevalent but even more toxic compound, entered the environment at an average concentration of 23.9 mg/l. This concentration of nitrate over doubles the limit set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for safe drinking water (10 mg/l) and is sufficient to retard the development of multiple species of freshwater fish, illustrating just how harmful this water actually is as it first enters the waterways.
To prevent eutrophication downstream from water treatment facilities, we have designed a plan to engineer N. multiformis to also perform denitrification, the process of converting nitrate into nitrogen gas, as a means of removing nitrogen without negative effects on the environment. According to scientific literature (see below), denitrification can be accomplished by the proteins coded by the nirS, norB, norC, and nosZ genes from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. These genes convert nitrite (NO2-) to nitric oxide (NO), then to nitrous oxide (N2O), and finally to nitrogen gas (N2). The nitrification pathway in N. multiformis converts ammonia (NH3) to nitrite (NO2-) and then to nitrate (NO3-), meaning that the denitrification pathway begins with an intermediate"

Our team’s intention was to promote the interdisciplinary character of the iGEM competition and to encourage undergraduate physics students to get involved in the scientific field of synthetic biology as well as systems biology. We presented the modeling part of our project, explained the use of ODEs in dynamical systems and the in situ modeling of fluid dynamics, and provided an overview of the entire project in order to showcase the contributions of an aspiring physicist in synthetic biology. Both students and professors were excited about the field of synthetic biology and the role of physics in such an interdisciplinary field. In fact, a lot of students in the audience were interested to join the forthcoming 2018 iGEM team. Thus, it is safe to conclude that our mission to encourage student participation in the iGEM competition and promote research in the field of synthetic biology was crowned with success.

Anyone, not just students, was free to join this event to converse, learn about the possible opportunities as well as participate in the short activities that were planned by Comvos. iGEM Greece explained its project, the options for future development and how it could transcend from the proof-of-concept phase to a real-life application. However, the better part of the two days was focused in explaining how Synthetic Biology is a distinct field and not a subdiscipline of Biology and how the ensemble of engineering principles combined with Biology is an exciting way to go for novel ideas that could not be grasped before.

This is my second year of iGEM and I must say that I am excited to do this for a second round! I am a student in City College of San Francisco with an intent on transferring to UC Davis. Early on I had a passion for the arts and pursued it up until high school where I was introduced to biotechnology and science as an industry. This is when I realized that science is more than just reading and memorization - it is life and the most basic fundamentals of each and every one of us. iGEM allowed me to bring forth my passion for creativity in correlation with synthetic biology. iGEM has encapsulated synthetic biology into such a fun and innovative experience that getting the opportunity to participate once again is truly a blessing.

After finding out UCSF's project for the 2010 year, I knew I wanted to come back. Throughout this summer, I have learned to work with mammalian cells. Before the iGEM experience, I was only familiar with prokaryotic cells. iGEM has expanded my skills and knowledge in so many ways.

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html,"% whilst the slightly longer asRNA Construct Two reduces it by 85% over wild type. This demonstrates the validity of this approach for engineering a toxin-suppressing phage. It also suggests that the longer asRNA molecule may be beneficial, though it is also more likely to exhibit off-target effects. We designed CRISPR/Cas9 vectors to modify the phage genome in order to express our asRNA constructs. It was with regret that work on this project had to cease at this point.
Future work would focus on optimising toxin suppression further by fully assessing the strength of the CRISPRi approach through cytotoxicity assays in C. difficile. The possibility of combining the two approaches would be investigated with a view to more tightly repressing toxin production. The phage genome would be modified to integrate firstly each approach separately and then both approaches together. This would depend on the amount of phage DNA that can be packaged by the phage head and would be tested confirming the production of infectious phage particles. Currently the long term repression of toxin is unknown with these approaches therefore, cytotoxicity assays would be completed to determine whether long term repression is obtained when the approaches are used in combination. Finally, if the engineered phage containing the combination approach is successful, in vivo testing would be conducted to ensure that the therapy would work in the “real world”. At this stage the process for delivery of the phage therapeutic would be investigated and the production of a capsule that could withstand the harsh conditions of the stomach would begin.

Reliability of the output as a function of α for different ratios ($ \frac{\Sigma_{on}\mathcal{R}}{\Sigma_{off}\mathcal{R}} $). The intersection between the different graphs and $\beta$, which we set to 95% as per example, allows reading off the required amplification factor required to achieve the desired reliability.
Collaboration iGEM LMU-TUM Munich
Both the iGEM TU Delft and iGEM LMU-TUM Munich teams realized that optimal crRNA is a prerequisite in utilizing Cas13a for their respective detection purposes. In addition to sensitively detecting a sequence of interest, modeling the off-target effects of a chosen crRNA is important in assessing the reliability of the system, as it provides information about the probability of a false positive output. Both teams took a different approach: we employed a kinetic model ( Klein et al. 2017 ) while iGEM LMU-TUM Munich applied an alignment algorithm.
Biophysical modeling has the advantage of providing a unified targeting framework that is able to take into account tiny (local) off-target effects that together may add to affect the reliability of the system. However, it is computationally intensive as compared to homology search and requires the development of the software, which is already available from NCBI for homology search.
We ran 4 off-target simulations for 2 different crRNAs spacer sequences (crRNA1-3 and crRNA4) designed by iGEM LMU-TUM Munich for targeting the 16s ribosomal RNA of two different bacterial species (DH5α and B. subtilis). The on and off-target activities are modeled for sequences on all possible frames on the genome (Figure 10). From the simulation results, we deduce that the crRNAs specifically target the different bacterial species.

A) crRNA 1-3 yield 7 on-target hits (blue) on the DH5α genome, while off-target probabilities (orange) remain below 1 in 10 million per site.

Fusion protein functionality testing: integration assay
From previous reaction, we saw that we were able to amplify the specific integration product that we expected, which, together with the results of the negative control, confirmed the ability of our fusion protein to perform specific integration. In this experiment, we would like to confirm this further by using a longer target DNA. If specific integration indeed occur, one of the new amplified fragment should also get longer by the same increase. Moreover, more sgRNA were tested to check whether other parts of the target EPO is also accessible. The following will therefore be done:
Incubation time of 1 hour will be implemented
3 different EPO fragments were used. The original EPO cDNA, longer EPO with ""intron"" on the third junction, longer EPO with ""intron"" on the fourth junction
4 different sgRNA was used, targeting junction 1-4

Miniprep and transformation of K274210 in pSB1A2
Start date: July 14.th
Methods: Fermentas GeneJET plasmid miniprep kit
Protocol: MP1.1
Experiment done by: LC
Notes: No pellet after step 4, but still continued. Later we got a small pellet at step 6.
Results:
The miniprep failed as expected, since there was no pellet after the second centrifugation.
Analysis:The experiment will be repeated in the afternoon.
Second try:
Methods and protocol as in the first try.
Notes: We only had 3,5 ml of overnight culture for the miniprep, so we had to manage with that.
Results: Insert gel picture and nanodrop table.
Analysis: The second try worked, so we went on to make transformations with the plasmid. It is in the freezer as nr. 3 (white).
Transformation of the miniprepped plasmid:
Experiment done by: LC, Maria
Protocol: TR 1.1
Notes: Transformed K274210 in pSB1A2 on LA plates with 100 microgram/ml ampicillin into E. coli MG1655. We used 2 microliter from the miniprep product for each sample.
Our suspicion that the agar plates we made are faulty got confirmed, three more plates were destroyed while spreading the bacteria on them (Sample 1a, 2b, 2pellet and the positive control)
Results: Cells grew just fine and the negative control was as expected. After a night at 37° the cells seemed a little more yellowish to the eye, than the usual.
Analysis: The transformations succeeded.

Check the content below to find out how we have integrated the investigated issues into the design of our project.
1.The topic of our project: Overview
This summer, our team aimed to engineer bacteria for supplement and absorption of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) in the natural environment. We mainly design two cell machines: AI-2 Supplier is the cell machine which can directly supply and enrich the AI-2 molecular level; AI-2 Consumer is another cell machine which can sense, absorb and degrade the AI-2 in the environment. By taking advantage of the special characteristics of AI-2 controllers, we hope to directly control the population behaviors of bacteria in group levels.
What's more, biosafety is further taken into account in our project. By applying gene circuits to control essential gene expression under the assigned biocontainment conditions, we can block essential gene expression to kill the cell upon loss of the biocontainment signal.
2. The interviews in The Ministry Key Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology and Technology: greatly helped us on the execution of our project
In our project, we designed AI-2 Controllers aiming to use these 'controller cells' to modulate the external AI-2 environment. But it's hard for us to apply this project to real world problems. At the same time, we still had some questions on LuxS/AI-2 quorum sensing systems. In order to get professional opinions on our project and to learn more about quorum sensing, we conducted an interview with two specialists, Ms Weixia Gao and Ms Yufen Quan.
Weixia Gao & Yulei Dang
After the introduction of our project idea, we discussed some particularly interesting points. We received advice that helped us to improve our project. This interview was not only helpful and enriching but also led to an agreement to collaborate with the Laboratory of Metabolic Engineering and Environmental Microbiology.
Here are some key points we got from these two specialists:
1. They suggested us to design a response device, which can be an alternative way of testing the AI-2 level in the natural or artificial environment due to the instability of the current measurement method (BB170 test).
2. They suggested us a good way to apply AI-2 Controllers into real world problems: to focus on biofilm. Biofilm formation is a collective behavior in which AI-2 has a significant influence.
After this helpful and enriching interview, we became clearer of our whole project. This interview greatly helped us on the design and actual execution of our project.
3. The dialogue"

Figure 1. Establish and characterize two surface antigen density heterogeneity models.
(A) Sketch map outlines the surface-expressed EGFP density heterogeneity model. (B) Microscopy images show K562-surEGFP cells successfully express surEGFP. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane has strong fluorescence while the plasma membrane has relatively weak signal probably due to oxidation in the extracellular environment causing surEGFP to bleach really fast. The yellow arrowheads indicate surEGFP on the ER membrane facing ER lumen, before transporting to the plasma membrane. (C) K562 EGFP stable lines were sorted into three subtypes depending on EGFP fluorescence intensity by FACS. (D) FACS-ed cell lines have different EGFP expression. GAPDH (internal reference) shows the loading between lanes was equal. (E) Huh-7 cells highly express GPC3, while SMMC-7721 cells express no GPC3 - our HCC density heterogeneity model.
Engineering SynNotch with antigen-density dependent response
Engineered Notch has been used in a previous project (iGEM 2011 MIT) . They replaced the intracellular domain of Notch1 by Gal4-VP16 (BBa_K511301) . When the extracellular domain of Notch1 binding to the Delta ligand, Gal4-VP64 would be cleavage, located into nucleus, started transcription of its corresponding promoter Gal4-UAS (BBa_K511003) .  This year, we took a step forward on their achievement. Referring to a latest publication(2), we engineered a SynNotch that could recognize surEGFP and response with tTa (Figure 2) .
Figure 2. SynNotch with LaG16 was used to recognize surEGFP.
HeLa cell stably expresses anti-EGFP synNotch with an activating-form transcription factor (tTa) whose corresponding promoter is pTight. The HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid containing pTight-mCherry. When LaG16 (an anti-EGFP scFv ) binds to surEGFP, Cleavages occur. Then, in the same cell, tTa will translocate into the nucleus and activate pTight, driving mCherry expression.
In HeLa with LaG16-SynNotch-tTa and pTight cells, the tTa, which originally linked to the intracellular domain of SynNotch, after LaG16 (scFv against GFP) binds to surEGFP, will trans"

Is a blood sample a good alternative you may think? According to our survey concerning the blood sample for sobriety test, people thought spending time and going to the hospital are the two most troublesome things they don’t want to do. In addition, to get and analyze the blood samples, you need a nurse drawing your blood
An alcohol biosensor project we discussed in our iGEM project brainstorming meeting. And we considered the possibility to create the biosensor designed with an ethanol-inducible promoter and the GFP reporter gene. However, some of our members said such a biosensor needs that the live bacteria grow in an optimized environment (i.e., 37 incubator) and express the reporter genes following by analyzing in an expensive microplate reader.
We have to search another possible approach to overcome the problem as mentioned. One of our member told a story in her childhood about her grandma with diabetes and loss of feeling in her extremities caused by poor circulation. Take a look at the video below.
Sobriety test conducted by an alcohol breathalyzer met some problems as mentioned previously. Blood glucose meter is a smart design to measure the glucose concentration in the blood. We’d like to apply this technique to innovate IGEM BLOOD ALCOHOL METER (iMeter).
BLOOD GLUCOSE METER
Blood glucose meter (BGM) is a common commercialized household health care appliance. It is small, hand-held, portable. It is “smart” with an easy-to-use operation interface. Data processing is quick, accurate and reliable. You can obtain the measures within 5-8 seconds.
PRINCIPLE OF BGM
The BGM is an electronic device built with electrodes covered by the enzyme of glucose oxidase (GOX), which catalyzes the oxidation of glucose, and converts it to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). When H2O2 meets electrode (e.g., Ag/AgCl), the electrons are generated and give a strength of current which can be measured in amperometry.
GLUCOSE OXIDASE (GOX)
 
 
 
 
 
Glucose oxidase (GOX) is an oxido-reductase existing in several insects and fungi. The redox reaction performed by GOX can generate hydrogen peroxide as antibacterial materials when glucose and oxygen are present. GOX extracted from Aspergillus niger is widely used in glucose-related diagnostics and biotechnologies including biosensors and food industries. In the redox reaction"

Future Applications
Targeting
Previous researchers who have worked on minicells have attached Protein A/G Fc receptors to an OmpA autotransporter located on the surface of minicells. This patented approach allowed them to add antibodies specific to their target host cell to purified minicells, thereby creating targeted minicells. Additionally, the antibody coating serves to protect the minicells from the host immune system and induce endocytosis when binding to certain target cell receptors. Such a modular targeting system is ideal for such a versatile vector. We hope to create a similar system that allows our minicells utilize the vast library of commercial antibodies available as highly specific receptors for a variety of applications.

Substrate supply
Background
There are three enzymes needed in our chassis. Propionyl-CoA carboxylase(pcc), an enzyme needed in the biosynthesis of polyketides, is an enzyme complex containing two components playing the core role in our chassis, of which accA is the α biotinylated subunit functioning as the acetyl-CoA or propionyl-CoA carboxylase while pccB，the β subunit，acts as the carboxyl transferase【1】. BirA is a biotin ligase that improves the activity of accA, acts as an enhancer like sfp, the phosphopantetheinyl transferase facilitating posttranslational modification of the DEBS proteins in E.coli BL21(DE3) [2]. With the pcc and sfp genes transformed into E.coli BL21(DE3), it will express DEBS genes at the comparable level to S. erythraea or S.coelicolor [2].
Design
As the three enzymes are suitable to produce the substrate for all of our polyketide synthases(PKS), we decided to co-express them in one plasmid—the low copy plasmid pSB4A5 and make it the chassis for our expression of PKSs.
Figure 2: Our design of the desired genes on pSB4A5. Sfp was originally desigened to be knocked into the prp operon of E.coli BL21(DE3) by homologous recombination but was frame shifted, so we put it on pSB4A5 with individual PT7 and T7T.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," no TALE-DNA dissociation, with no noise or false DNA possible for binding, and with no DNA and strip interaction. But those are future directions that I can work on to make the model more sophisticated.
Week 18: August 26 - August 30
After the quantitative modelling was presented to the entire team on Monday, some senior members gave us some great suggestions. One of them requested the implementation of the concept of saturation of TALE such that each TALE can only bing one DNA. It looks simple to implement, but in reality it increases the computational effort significantly. If there are n possible states for DNA to be with an unsaturated TALE, then another n states with saturated TALE needs to be included in the state transition matrix. This effectively doubles the number of states needed and quadruples the number of calculations. Given that TALE and DNA will be much smaller than the space we consider, a large number of states will be necessary, which translates that the computational effort will be enormous. Here Dr. Nygren's suggestion of using partial differential equations for the modelling of diffusion and reaction might be appropriate, except that we were unable to find the parameters needed for a detailed DNA TALE binding scheme.
After a few days of research and thinking, two approaches seem to be worth a try: either do Monte Carlo simulations of the discretized system, or Bayesian network to exploit the overlapping sub-problems. The Monte Carlo simulations would be the more straight forward to code, for it simply describes the system in computer language then runs thousands of simulations to empirically determine the probabilities. The Bayesian network it would be a little bit complicated. For an investigation of a DNA and b TALE, we first compute the probabilities of 1 DNA binding, existing on the same space with {b,b-1,b-2,¡­,1} TALE respectively. Then to find the probabilities of n DNA we assume no interaction and apply binomial distribution to get the result from the corresponding 1 DNA case. Thus we obtained the probability of moving from the state of n DNA with m TALE to, the state of n-1 DNA with m TALE (if DNA exists) or the state of n-1 DNA with m-1 TALE (if DNA binds). Then the entire network from n DNA with m TALE to 0 DNA m-x TALE will give us the distribution where we can ask the expected number of DNA binds.
For now the simulation method is very easy to code so work has been started on that front. The Bayesian network approach is very interesting in its own right and we wish to"

phsABC gene: Important part of anaerobic bacterial respiration/metabolism • Studied since 1970's; several plasmids found (ie: phs pEB40, pSB103, pSB77, pSB107 etc) • Thiosulfate reductase is a transmembrane protein involved in the second step of the Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria pathway of thiosulfate reduction. Thiosulfate reductase catalyzes the dissimilatory reduction of inorganic thiosulfate to hydrogen sulfide and sulfite. • 1995, phs locus of Salmonella chromosome located, sequenced, and confered H2S production to E.Coli. – Sequence similar to reductases in other bacteria – Later confirmed to contain structural gene for thiosulfate reductase • Since before 1970 people have observed bacteria producing H2S. The earliest samples were taken from patients (Stoleru and Bouanehaud of Institut Pasteur, 1972 and 1975). Better yet, they showed that H2S production was mediated by a plasmid! A later study in 1978 by Jones et al of Texas Tech characterized another one of these plasmids, saw that it could be used in and transferred between E. Coli as well! • In 1987 an extensive review was written collecting lots of existing research about sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). In this broad review of SFB, it mentioned that sulfate reductases are membrane bound. Possibly useful for us, purified samples of thiosulfate reductase can also apparently be controlled, stopped in the presence of NADH , NADPH, and cysteine. Anyhow, the main development in this paper showed that thiosulfate-reduction ability is fairly common, usually used by anaerobic bacteria as an energy source (although some aerobic variants have been reported) and that one of the key players is thiosulfate reductase, which by this point had been isolated and had some characterization"

Testing of arsenic biosensor
Background
Arsenic is a serious groundwater contaminant of major public health significance. During the 1970s, due to a high incidence of waterborne disease, millions of tube wells were drilled in Bangladesh to provide drinking water. Unfortunately, years later, many instances of ill health were found to be associated with consumption of this water, and it became apparent that many of the wells had inadvertently been drilled through arsenic bearing sediments and that the water was contaminated with arsenic in the form of arsenate and arsenite anions. Arsenic is a serious poison, and chronic consumption leads to arsenicosis, with symptoms such as skin lesions and cancers. The WHO limit for arsenic in drinking water is 10 ppb, though a more relaxed limit of 50 ppb is still in operation in many countries. Many wells exceed these limits. Similar contaminated groundwater has also been found to occur in many other countries, and one estimate suggests that 100 million people worldwide may be at risk. There is therefore a need for methods for testing and monitoring arsenic levels. Various highly accurate laboratory methods are available, but for large scale use in less developed regions, it would be preferable to have simple and cheap test kits which can be used in the field.
In 2006, Team Edinburgh have developed a genetically engineered machine which was able to detect arsenite/arsenate ions in water samples. They particitaped first time and won first prize in the Best Real World Application category.To see the part (BBa_33203) visit the Registry of Standard Biological Parts here: [1] .
As the South-East of Hungary is highly affected by the arsenic problem (there are wells in which the level of arsenic exceeds the allowed limit), we had the possibility to use real-world samples for testing. The current situation of the arseinc problem in the drinking water of the south east region of Hungary can be found here: [2]

Harvest cells:
Pellet 1-5 mL of an overnight recombinant E.coli culture by centrifugation. The optimal volume of culture to use depends upon the plasmid and culture density. For best yields, follow the instructions in the note below. Transfer the appropriate volume of the recombinant E.coli culture to a microcentrifuge tube and pellet cells at &#8805 12,000 3g for 1 minute. Discard the supernatant.
Note: For best results with recombinant E.coli grown in LB (Luria Broth), use 1-3 mL of culture for high copy plasmids or 1-5 mL of culture for low copy plasmids. With recombinant E.coli grown in rich media such as TB (Terrific Broth)or 2X YT, use only 1 mL of culture. Higher volumes can cause a reducition in yield.
1) Resuspend cells:
❗ Important reminder: Verify that appropriate volume RNAase A Solution was added to the Resuspension Solution.
Completely resuspend the bacterial pellet with 200 μL of the Resuspension Solution.  Vortex or pipette up and down to thoroughly resuspend the cells until homogeneous. Incomplete resuspension will result in poor recovery.
2) Lyse cells:
Lyse the resuspended cells by adding 200μL of the Lysis Solution. Immediately mix the contents by gentle inversion (6–8 times) until the mixture becomes clear and viscous. Do not vortex. Harsh mixing will shear genomic DNA, resulting in chromosomal DNA contamination in the final recovered plasmid DNA. Do not allow the lysis reaction to exceed 5 minutes. Prolonged alkaline lysis may permanently denature supercoiled plasmid DNA that may render it unsuitable for most downstream applications.
3) Neutralize:
Precipitate the cell debris by adding 350 μL of the Neutralization/Binding Solution. Gently invert the tube 4–6 times. Pellet the cell debris by centrifuging at ≥ 12,000 xg or maximum speed for 10 minutes. Cell debris, proteins, lipids, SDS, and chromosomal DNA should fall out of solution"

With E. coli BL21(DE3) no cell growth occurred which might be due to high metabolic stress caused by maintenance of two plasmids. This observation is supported by literature data [6]. In contrast, E. coli JM109 grew normally allowing Western blot analysis for detection of the subunits followed by immunostaining.
The use of chaperone plasmid C1 resulted in partly soluble expression of the subunits MMOX, MMOY and, to a smaller degree, MMOZ. No bands corresponding to the other subunits were visible (figure 6, upper panel). A slightly different result was obtained for the subunits coexpressed with chaperone plasmid C3. In this case, all subunits except MMOD could be detected. However, bands corresponding to subunits MMOB and MMOZ were still very weak (figure 6, lower panel)

In contrast, using chaperone plasmid C2 resulted in expression of all MMO subunits. Although a substantial amount was still detected in inclusion bodies these results indicate soluble expression of all His-tagged components of the enzyme complex (Figure 6). Therefore, we used E. coli JM109 cotransformed with chaperone plasmid C2 and our final construct encoding all six MMO subunits for further experiments and activity assays.

Mammalian cells
Mammalian cells are the cells of higher eukaryotes. Eukaryotic cells can modify proteins post-translationally, and they contain a large number of membrane bound compartments such as mitochondria, endoplasmatic reticulum, and the Golgi apparatus. Compared to microbes, mammalian cells are fragile, have a slow doubling time (app. 24h), and need complex and expensive growth media. The cells are moreover easily contaminated with mycoplasma, therefore it is necessary to work as aseptic as possible, when handling mammalian cells (1). So what is the deal with these high maintenance cells? Microbial cells are excellent for production of different compounds like peptides and simple proteins such as insulin and growth hormones. Why work with mammalian cells at all?
Mammalian cell factories
Mammalian cell cultures represent a suitable and stable gene expression system and are often used as cell factories for production of biopharmaceuticals. Heterologous protein expression in a suitable host is central in production of biopharmaceuticals, therefore mammalian cell cultures are  widely used for production of therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies, growth hormones, and cytokines used for a wide array of diseases(4). Heterologous proteins require complex post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, gamma-carboxylation, and site specific proteolysis, which only mammalian cells are capable of performing. Moreover, mammalian cells have the unique capability to authentically process, fold and modify secreted human proteins (1). The effect of post-translationally modifications are protein stability"

The highest concentration of 0.1M is pH 1.0 of malate and 2.0 of succinate, which leads to weakest chemotaxis, for oxidative stress induces its protective responses more than chemotaixs genes expression; while the curves reach maximum at concentration of 0.01M because of the opposite reason.
Fig.5 The pH of the concentration gradients of malate and succinate. The pH of  malate is lower than succinate at high concentration (10-1 and 10-2 M), and is equal with succinate at lower concentration. Both of them remain pH 6.4 at low concentration(10-5, 10-7 and 0 M).
On the other hand, the E. coli chemotaxis along gradients is influenced by reversible MCPs methylation and related proteins phosphorylation (Fig. 6 A). Such adaptation is achieved in E. coli by modulating the methylation state of the MCPs using two proteins, a constitutively active methyltransferase CheR and a methylesterase CheB (Fig.6 B), the activity of which is stimulated after phosphorylation by CheA-P. Increased methylation of the MCPs dampens the response to ligand binding, whereas decreased methylation restores their high binding affinities for their attractants(Butler, S. M., & Camilli, A., et al.).
Fig. 6  The mechanism of E. coli chemotaxis along gradients
A: Chemotaxis pathway. Reactions and components that augment CW rotation are depicted in green; those that augment CCW rotation are depicted in red. The flagellar motors of E. coli spin CCW by default of Che-Y. MCPs in response to chemoeffector stimuli transfer the signals and make CheA autophosphorylated via the adapter protein CheW. Then phospho-CheA molecules serve as donors that transfer phosphoryl groups to specific aspartate residues in CheY and CheB. Phospho-CheY enhances CW rotation of the flagellar motors FliM; phospho-CheB has high MCP methylesterase activity that helps to change the CW rotation to CCW rotation, and they will be inactive because of loss of phosphoryl group through spontaneous self-hydrolysis. CheZ further enhances the dephosphorylation rate of phospho-CheY to ensure rapid locomotor responses to changes in the supply of signaling phosphoryl groups to CheY.

Ethanol Precipitation
This protocol is designed to remove the ethanol which is likely to be present in a DNA sample once it has been midi-prepped (the ethanol is found in Wash Solution 2).
What you will need
3M Sodium Acetate (pH 5.2)
100% ethanol
70% ethanol
Deionised water
Ice bucket (with ice)
Eppendorf Tubes
Centrifuge
Procedure
1) Measure the DNA sample volume and then calculate 1/10 of this volume. This is the amount of sodium acetate that needs to be added to the sample - pipette this volume of sodium acetate into the DNA sample.
For example if the DNA sample measures 2ml calculate 10% of this volume (which is 0.2ml). Take up 0.2ml of the sodium acetate and add it to the DNA sample - this should make up a total volume of 2.2ml.
2) Add 100% ethanol to the solution. To work out the amount of 100% ethanol needed, multiply the volume of the DNA sample (plus sodium acetate) by 3.
For example if the DNA sample (plus sodium acetate) makes up a volume of 2.2ml, multiply the 2.2ml by 3, which gives the amount of 6.6ml. Add this volume of ethanol to the DNA (plus sodium acetate) solution, which should now give a total volume of 8.8ml.
3) Place the tubes of DNA sample solutions into the ice bucket and leave them for 15 minutes.
Alternatively, if you are pushed for time, you could incub"

HP SILVER
Our project this year aims to remove nanoparticles (NPs) from wastewater systems. The increasing industrial and commercial use of NPs are a potential health issue, because the small size of NPs can negatively impact biological systems. We interviewed several NP experts, such as Dr. Gwo-Dong Roam and Dr. Eric Lee to gather  viewpoints on the impact of NPs in wastewater systems. Both of them agreed that NP waste is an issue that requires more attention and is difficult to control. We visited two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to study their current treatment and biosafety protocols as well as the design of the treatment plant. Aside from lab work, our team felt a responsibility to raise awareness on the potential health risks associated with the use of NPs. We held an interactive role-playing bioethics panel where participants learned about different perspectives of producers and consumers of NPs. During a tour around Taipei and at our school’s annual spring fair, we handed out fliers and asked people to take surveys in order to gain an understanding of public knowledge on NP usage. Lastly, we created and distributed a policy brief regarding how NPs are currently regulated. We also gave suggestions on how to improve NP definition in current policy. The Minister of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) replied and said that he would take our policy brief into consideration for future decisions. Also, The China Post and The News Lens International Edition published an article about our brief to over 200,000 daily readers.
Dr. Gwo-Dong Roam
We interviewed Professor Roam of National Central University and former general director of the Environmental Analysis Labs (EAL) of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) to learn more about the background and potential threat of NPs. Dr. Roam informed us that the most common NPs used in Taiwan include: TiO2, ZnO, Ag, Au, Fe, Carbon Nanotubes, Fullerenes, Clay, and Graphene. He also told us that the toxicity of a NP is directly related to its size, but there"

Discussion
Taking the results described above into account, we are able to sense the presence of a Gram positive species with the use of E. coli transformed with our AIP receiver GFP construct. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the interspecies communication between Gram negative and Gram positive bacterial species. In this case the sensing of the AIP of S. aureus by E. coli. For the final application described in the introduction (link) page though, the level of activation of the pP2 promoter by AgrA might be too low. In order to make the sensing system able to activate a peptide production system capable of producing a concentration high enough to kill or inhibit the growth of S. aureus, an amplification circuit could be used.

Although the new AntABC primers were designed using the correct gene the PCR may not be working due to the length of the operon so the design of new individual primers may be necessary. Finally, we also aimed to grow up the freeze dried culture of Rhodococcus erythroplois (source of the AmdA gene) that we received from DSMZ. The reactivation media was produced and autoclaved to begin the process next week.

Catechol Degradation
The colony PCR of part J33204 (XylE with a native rbs site) was done again and all five colonies looked like they contained the plasmid after running the products on a gel.  After miniprepping and running a restriction digest on these five colonies two of them were sent to sequencing.    An assay using the compound catechol was also started this week.  E.coli cells (top 10) transformed with the part K118021 (XylE with a Pcst promoter) were used in this assay. Six overnight cultures were made, 3 using M9-MM and 3 using LB.  These were spun down and resuspended in fresh M9-MM and LB and brought to a concentration of 0.1 M catechol by using a 1M stock solution.  There seemed to be an initial colour change in the reactions from clear to yellow which was only visible in the cultures using M9-MM.  All of the cultures were incubated overnight and they turned a black green colour. For this assay we should have used the supernatant because the reaction takes place outside of the cell so this is what we did next week.

Ashee and Emily constructed parts of Plasmid 1 via PCR Rescue and colony PCR. Genome overlaps 1, 2 and the kanamycin resistance cassette and ColE1 replication origin were constructed and assembled via Gibson CBA. Other plasmids necessary for the completion of the project were prepared.
Decisions made to use restriction site cloning to introduce synthetic GFPs into pFTV. Also, determined that best method of obtaining the genes is ordering them as gblocks from IDT. Problem of RBS library anticipated, synthetic leader sequence developed in order to work around the problem of the coding sequences being different.
Week 4
Monday, June 9 - Sunday, June 15

The 4-Part Gibson CBA was sequenced and determined to have all the correct junctions - our Plasmid 1 is complete. Attempts were made to insert the dCas9 system into the Plasmid 1 construct via ligation.
Project Plan updated extensively as mistake in design of gblocks realized (truncation) as well as the addition of a fifth gblock (slow insertion time). Programs written to optimize for insertion time as well as total the insertion time for existing genes. Restriction enzymes re-chosen and gblocks ordered. Project plan modified to include a gene first, RBS later strategy.
Week 5
Monday, June 16 - Sunday, June 22

However, the ligation from the previous week was not successful. We believe this was due to recently expired ClaI restriction enzyme or expired DNA ligase buffer. Both were replaced. We attempted to insert the dCas9 system and Lambda Red Recombinase system simultaneously (bypassing the need for ClaI) by performing a 2-part Gibson CBA. Upon PCR amplifying and running on a gel, the CBA also failed.
Gblocks amplified with rescue PCR, digested along with pFTV, ligated and transformed into cells. Additional design steps taken toward finding suitable RBS library. Began to work on website and other iGEM forms.

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots,"

Insights
Burn wounds are always colonized, meaning that it is crucial to control and limit the bacteria growing in the wound.
Burn wounds are colonized and potentially infected by several bacterial strains. Particularly the Gram-negative strains and bacteria growing in biofilms are virulent and difficult to target.
S. aureus is increasingly challenging doctors treating burn wounds because of a surge in toxin-producing strains.
Current burn wound treatments are mostly mechanic in combination with antibacterial creams.
A hydrogel forms a perfect environment for wounds, considering that burn wounds benefit from a gel-like environment. We must check that liquid produced by edema can be absorbed. Burn wounds do not need oxygen to heal.
The use of systemic antibiotics while researching the type of bacteria colonizing a wound contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance, but is not always effective against the bacteria present on the wound. The development of targeted treatments in combination with a detection method for specific bacterial strains would thus be very useful, as it will increase efficacy while lowering the risk of resistance against the treatment.
Follow-up
We researched bacteriocins to target Pseudonomas and other Gram-negative bacteria, without affecting our own E. coli bacteria. This resulted in our pyocin S5 BioBrick.
We researched a combination of sensing and secretion. See Applied Design.

Sept 21, 2018. Ethical analysis  – update
After a summer of reflection, we finished our ethical analysis . In this ethical analysis, we reflected on our Gelcatraz design with respect to five values: public beneficence, responsible stewardship, intellectual freedom and responsibility, democratic deliberation and justice & fairness. We conclude that our product benefits individuals as well as society, and that its benefits and burdens are well-distributed.  We identified some issues that need to be addressed, such as the use of Gelcatraz by amateurs and the yet unidentified risks introduced by synthetic biochemistries. However, we believe that these risks are mostly covered by the several safety levels we integrated in the design.
Insights
Our design benefits individuals as well as society. Its benefits and burdens seem well-distributed.
We are aware that the use of alternative biochemical systems such as artificial amino acids comes with yet-unknown risks.
Our platform may accelerate the use of GMOs in more and less regulated environments, which may have consequences we cannot yet oversee"
Hong_Kong_HKUST,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," the system can be flipped dependent of the inducers applied. Therefore, focusing on the regulation and the stability of the system, we aim to establish a model to describe, analyze, and predict the behavior of the system.
Model Equations and Derivation
In order to study the system dynamics and to achieve a better simulation result, we consider every part of the switch by setting the strength of every part as a parameter, which constituted a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
Based on mass action kinetics (Phillips, 2013) , a model of genetic circuits, which considered transcription and translation, is constructed. By so doing can we derive the basic equations that describe the change of mRNA and proteins over time:
Transcription level model:
Inducer-repressor interaction term:
Translation level model:
However, our case, in which three circuits are involved, is much more complicated, as it requires a system with 6 ODEs. Therefore, we sought to reduce the complexity of the system. Grounded on mathematical model of bistable toggle switch in  (Gardner, Cantor, & Collins, 2000), we developed a series of three equations to describe the switch.
(I) Quasi Steady –State Approximation:
The modelling begins with the application of Quasi Steady-State Approximation on mRNA dynamic. Assumed that the time scale of mRNA dynamic is much smaller than that of protein dynamic, we then consider the concentration of mRNAs remains constant over time (i.e.$\frac{dr_x}{dt}=\frac{dr_y}{dt}=\frac{dr_z}{dt}=0$, the system of ODEs then reduces into the following form:
(II) Non-dimensionalisation
In this model, every part is regarded as unique. Having an independent parameter in each part, though gives a better description of the system; apparently increases the complexity of the ODE system. Therefore, additional assumptions were made to simplify this model by reducing the parameters.
Firstly, it is assumed that each protein has the same degradation rate because of the negligible differences between them. Under this condition, we could apply non-dimensionalization to integrate a series of parameters that model the same circuit into one main parameter represented by ""k"". In spite of this assumption, six main parameters in the system are remained. In order to further simplify it, these main parameters are generalised to one changeable core parameter on the ground that three circuits of the same strength are the basic requirements for a tristable switch. Furthermore, the Hill’s coefficient of each repressor-protein interaction are close to each other"

6/28:  The plates from yesterday's ligation/transformation did not grow anything.  This is increasing our troubles with our ligation protocol.  Something is either going wrong with our ligation or restriction digest of the plasmids.  However, since we are still seeing separation and appropriate band size in gel electrophoresis a from restriction digest, I think that it is most likely a problem with our ligation procedure.  So today I did a ligation of RFP and BFP with terminator.  This time I set up two reactions for each, one to run at 16 C for 1 hour and one at 4 C overnight.  The hope was that an increased reaction time for the ligation would slow down the reaction and provide more time and a better ligation.  An increased amount of ligase enzyme ( 2 ul instead of 1 ul) was also used.
6/29: Today I took the ligation reactions from yesterday (RFP + Term and BFP + Term) and did transformations with them.  After I was half way through the transformation protocol, I realized that I had not heat inactivated the ligation mixtures from the 4 C overnight.  Thus, I took what was left in those tubes, heat inactivated at 65 C for 10 mins, and then transformed them into competent cells.  The volume of ligation reaction was 4.5 ul and 7.5 ul for RFP+term and BFP+term respectively.  This is much less that our usual volume of 10 ul per transformation reaction.  i also plated a negative control of competent cells on KAN plate.
-20 C Frozen Glycerol Stock
Today I also took record of our frozen glycerol stock of transformed plasmids in the -20 C freezer.  In attempt to organize and optimize lab space, we are setting up boxes and online databases to keep a record of samples we have, their location in these plasmid boxes, and other important information such as concentration and volume.  Eventually we would like to have a Clotho tool similar to the current app Batterboard to keep this online database.  Right now we are just using Microsoft Excel and google documents, but today we spoke to members of the computational team about modifying Batterboard to include certain features like a 81-box interface rather than the 96-well plate and a search option.

S. pneumoniae σx Promoters Module
Overview
The activity of Com-Box promoter is turned on by a specific sigma factor that is produced by a regulatory gene comX. The σx will bind to the Com-Box promoter region and activate gene expression. σx serve as an inducer with high specificity as it binds to an area of several specific 8 base pairs (TACGAATA) on the Com-Box promoter. This σx-Com-Box system could be used as a highly specific reporting system in our S.pneumonia detection platform. However in nature, ComX protein will be degraded by ClpXP enzyme which exists in E. coli and some other bacteria. Hence, to ensure the induction of Com-Box promoter by σx, ComW protein is needed as it functions to protect σx from being degraded by ClpXP. ComW protein will be degraded instead, increasing the amount of σx produced.
Construct
The three main components of the construct are comX gene, comW gene, and Com-Box promoter. We assembled comX and Com-Box promoter in one vector plasmid, while comW in a different plasmid. The system will be fused with a tagging protein and a reporting protein. Tagging protein is essential for detecting the σx and ComW protein expression by means of western blot. Reporting protein which is fluorescence protein is needed for reporting purpose, hence σx-Com-Box system could serve as a specific reporting system that will be useful for many synthetic constructs. σx generator and Com-Box promoter construct will be assembled separately in different plasmid before being combined into one plasmid.
σx Generator construct ( BBa_K1379006 ) and comW construct
Backbone pSB1C3 was used for σx generator construct and comW construct"

Improving on Neptune
Improving Upon the 2016 BostonU HW Project: Neptune
During the course of our 2017 iGEM Project, the BostonU HW team worked to improve upon the 2016 BostonU HW Project: Neptune . Neptune allow uses to specify, design, and control a microfluidic chip. For more information regarding specific elements within Neptune, please refer to their wiki.  Our team worked to improve the specify and design portion of the Neptune software workflow. This Neptune can be broken down into five basic blocks:
The portion of Neptune’s workflow we contributed to was Fluigi. Fluigi is a place-and-route software that receives a detailed microfluidic description in the form of MINT code, and outputs a fully routed chip design with accompanying SVG and JSON files.  During the process of our iGEM project, 17 distinct microfluidic chip designs were coded in MINT and routed using Fluigi. These chips ranged from designs replicated from various journals to original designs for the MARS Repository.  While designing and routing these chips we were able to identify issues, limitations, and areas for improvement in the Fluigi and Neptune software system. These issues were identified as elements of Fluigi to fix or improve upon. During the course of our 2017 iGEM project, we altered design rules that would be necessary to integrate into the layout algorithms, some of them in particular are:
Ports are no longer automatically pushed to the edges of a design. When manufacturing a chip using photolithography ports must be at the edges of the chip. However, when using the Makerfluidics workflow this is no longer a requirement; ports can be located anywhere on a chip, within reason. In fact, many designs benefit from or rely on ports being placed in nontraditional locations. Therefore, the pre-existing design rule that ports must be pushed to the edges of a chip needed to be updated. Instead of automatically pushing all ports to the edges of a design, Fluigi can now infer whether or not doing so would be beneficial/required. Thus, the design rule was updated to be more relaxed and accurate for the Makerfluidics workflow.
Primitive locations can be set in the X and/or"
ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer1_-_-_TEXT.html,"ianxuan Zhou and Baolin Sun).
In quorum sensing (QS) process, bacteria regulate gene expression by utilizing small signaling molecules called autoinducers in response to a variety of environmental cues. QS molecules secreted by bacteria are small, diffusible signaling molecules called autoinducers that accumulate in the external environment. When the concentration of the autoinducers reaches a threshold, an alteration of gene expression is induced, allowing the bacteria to adopt behaviors that are only productive when the bacteria are working together as a group [8].
Many quorum sensing molecules have been identified until now. In contrast to other autoinducers that are specific for a narrow range of organisms, the widely conserved AI-2 has been hypothesized to be a universal language for interspecies communication [9]. In every case, AI-2 is synthesized by LuxS, which functions in the pathway for metabolism of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a major cellular methyl donor. In a metabolic pathway known as the activated methyl cycle, SAM is metabolized to S-adenosylhomocysteine, which is subsequently converted to adenine, homocysteine, and 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD, the precursor of AI-2) by the sequential action of the enzymes Pfs and LuxS [10].
The regulatory network for AI-2 uptake is comprised of two other important components, lsrR and lsrK, which are located adjacent, but divergently transcribed from the lsr operon (Figure 1). LsrR is the repressor of the lsr operon and itself. LsrK is a kinase responsible for converting AI-2 to phospho-AI-2, which is required for relieving LsrR repression. It has also been postulated that phospho- AI-2 binds to LsrR and inactivates it to derepress the transcription of lsr [11].Since LsrR contains a helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain, it was hypothesized that LsrR represses the expression of lsr operon and itself by binding to their promoter regions [12].
Two independent groups demonstrated that H. pylori secretes AI-2 into its extracellular environment by a luxS-dependent mechanism.[13,14] Therefore we planned to use LsrR system to sense AI-2 molecules synthesized by H. Pylori.
In the absence of Autoinducer-2, LsrR repress the Lsr"

For instance, providing pre-coated reaction tubes for diagnostic PCR of samples may be a viable optional. An example of this pre-coating is already commercially available for mycoplasma . As entering these markets becomes a more viable option, kit design can be carried out in collaboration with potential users.
Reagent Safety
In order to ensure the safety of our users, Material Safety Data Sheets for the reagents have been compiled, and Standard Operating Procedures and Risk Assessments for using the reagents and Darwin Toolbox have been written. Detailed information can be found under Safety .
CU Boulder iGEM 2013 Collaboration
Reagent Constructs
The CU Boulder iGEM 2013 team have developed a series of constructs and purification methods necessary to produce and isolate restriction enzymes. This would further reduce the cost of reagents for our customers.
Protocols
Experiment design is a key barrier in using our toolbox. Our target markets vary in their previous experience of laboratory work; therefore they require simple proven protocols and troubleshooting advice. The CU Boulder iGEM 2013 team have developed a series of tested protocols as a resource for future iGEM students. We spoke with Phil from their team and discussed using their protocols as a resource for our toolbox users.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html,". If the forest structure has changed, we must find some ways to determine which tree structure is preferred and based on this to arrange them. We know each tree could be uniquely converted to a binary tree by taking the first child of each node as the left child and its siblings as its right child. The Huffman algorithm is used to generate the Huffman code of each node in the binary tree. Since the Huffman code of each node represents its path to the root node, we can restore the tree structure from the Huffman codes of all leaf nodes. Hence, the Huffman codes of leaf nodes could uniquely determine a tree structure. With help of Huffman codes, it is simple to compare the forest structure after and before exchange of both chains.
To go further, we must define the preference of each forest structure due to exchange of chains: compare each node of the first tree by their Huffman codes and weights in the same way as comparison of strings and if equal, compare the next until difference appears or to the end of either forest. If one is less than another, it has higher priority. With this definition, the order of those equal chains in the first-stage sorting is determined by the one which generates the forest strucuture with highest priority among all possibilities. By performing this algorithm for all groups of equal chains obtained from the first-stage sorting, we could find both the unique order of the chains and the groups of equivalent chains (exchange of the order fo several chains in the same equivalent group will not change the forest structure). The figure illustrates this idea graphically.
It is easy to compare two structures with help of chain sorting. We only need to compare first the chain list in order, chain by chain, and if equal, compare both associated forest structures. If two structures are same, the comparison must be equal since chains and trees are all in their unique order. If the comparison is equal, they must be the same structures since we could uniquely generate a Chain-Node structure from the chains as well as its associated forest structure.
Structural pattern match of template species
We assume that if a combination of species in the species list could be structurally matched to reactants and modifiers templates defined within a reaction, they are possible to react with each other in the way as the reaction template describes. Hence, it is important to find such matchings between species in the species list and template ones defined in the database. We will first give the basic idea and then some modifications.
Blocks of ST and NST part on a template chain
Combinations of NST block matchings form a region restriction for ST part blocks
The template ST block contains 3 ANY parts."
SCU_China,2017,Team:SCU China#Repressilator#Repressilator_-_-_TEXT.html," As the first repressilator reported in 2000,                                     ssrA tag is added to repressors in                                     repressilator in order to bring the effective repressor protein lifetimes to that of                                     mRNA.
      However, the research in 2016 showed that the                                     ssrA                                     tag induced ‘retroactivity’ effects                                     on oscillations owing to competition for shared proteases, and removing this                                     interference created very regular oscillations, with longer periods.
      Hence we decide to knock out the clpXP to                                     create                                     a                                     more regular oscillation with                                     longer periods.
      Because the pKD3 plasmid we have was wrong, we                                     use                                     one part of Red recombination system.                                     The biggest difference between our method and the traditional method is that our PCR                                     production doesn’t have FRT site so we don’t need to transform the pCP20 plasmid                                     into                                     the bacterial to remove the reporter gene. Our RED recombination system utilize the                                     pKD46 plasmid to express three proteins: Exo can produce 3’-overhang, Bet can induce                                     two                                     single strand DNA molecule becoming double strand DNA and Gam can inhibit the                                     function                                     of RecBCD protein. The pKD46 plasmid is then transformed into E.coli, with these                                     three                                     proteins expressing under the induction of L-Arabinose. Then the PCR production of                                     reporter gene, Kanamycin resistance gene, which is flanked by two 57bp homologous                                     arm of                                     clpXP, is transformed into the bacteria expressiong Exo, Bet and Gam by                                     electroporation,                                     leading to the substitution of Kanamycin resistance gene for clpXP.

Monday August 6th
Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
No positive colonies after transformation of our assemblies from August 1st but we realized that the primers we used for making the promoter parts can’t ligate with our backbone because the primers are dephosphorylated and the plasmid backbone is dephosphorylated, too. Much effort in a mission which can't work but at least we know now why it doesn't work.
Picking positive colonies from transformation of ecol and ecol_HIS in pSB1C3 for plasmid isolation.
Team Fungal and Plant Laccases: Plating positive colonies from cloning of tvel5 in pSb1C3 backbone.
Team Site Directed Mutagenesis:
Plasmid-isolation of two more ecol-g2307a colonies.
Team Cellulose Binding Domain:
Plated one colony of <partinfo>BBa_I13522</partinfo> on selection-agar.
Dephosphorylation of pSB1C3 Backbone.
Ligation of CBDcex(T7) with the pSB1C3-Backbone and CBDclos(T7) with the pSB1C3-Backbone.
Transformed both in KRX and plated on CM-selection-agar.
Team Immobilization:
CPC beads have just arrived! We couldn’t wait any longer to start our new experiments. Since the amount of beads used and the incubation period varied from one paper to another (see Literature), we decided to find out ourselves the most convenient conditions for our laccases. We started with different bead concentrations: 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08 mg/mL. The beads were first immersed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and incubated for 2 hours under light vacuum in order to allow as much beads’ surface area to be coated with aldehyde groups, which crosslink the laccases to the beads. After that, the beads were washed 3 times with Britton-Robinson Buffer and then immersed in 1mg/mL laccases from TVEL0 and placed on a rotator at 4°C for 18h and 36h respectively. For further information see Protocol .

Figure 7.  These  curves compare fusion proteins’ performance with normal cutinase in different concentration. We can see that the fusion protein Cut1-sJanus-m perform  much better when concentration are over 1mg/ml.
We also conduct our experiments in different pH by using different Tris-HCl. Just as picture shows, the activity of our fusion protein doesn’t change a lot in different pH which is similar with Thc_Cut1.
Figure 8. These two proteins are stable when pH changes, especially when pH is between 6.0 and 9.0. And the concentration of Thc_Cut1 and Thc_Cut1-sJanus-m are 0.2mg/ml.
We drew a curve about detect time and compared it with Thc_Cut1, we can see the hydrolysis rate rose sharply after 5h,while Thc_Cut1 still in the low level. Which represent our Janus works well!
And our fusion protein does improve a lot!
Figure 9. We detect absorbance of liquid every 3h, red line refers to our fusion protein, and the blue line is former enzyme. The performance of cutinase are highly improved when fuse to the sJanus-m.
Figure 10 &11. The picture shows 5mg/ml enzyme have react with one piece of plastic（3*3*0.25mm）for 3h, before and after centrifugation. We can see clearly in the pic. After 3hs the tube of Thc_Cut1-sJanus-m had much more sediment than Thc_Cut1.
Conclusion
What we solved?
1.   We successfully expressed cutinase (Fsc, Cut1) in E.coli.
2.   We structured fusion protein connecting Cut1 with sJanus-m, and expressed it successfully in E.coli, which has extraordinary performance as our data shows.
3.   We successfully find out optimal conditions (pH, temperature, concentration) of PET hydrolysis by cutinase(Cut1,FsC). 
4.   We use different mix method to verify our Janus (sJanus&inJanus) can promote hydrolysis rate. And we confirmed the best way is incubating PET with Janus before hydrolysis.
5.   We found out after incubation, sJanus usually performed better than inJanus. 
What we unsolved?

Paris_Bettencourt,2013,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Human Practice#Gender Study_-_-_TEXT.html," have to face major challenges but when the team existed for a few years and general organization or funding problems have been dealt with , diversity could be a factor for success.
In order to check if this could be seen in the best iGEM teams that existed, the sex ratio of of prize winner teams was compared to the one of participating teams with boostrap resampling giving a p-value of 0.035 This means that the sex ratio of winning teams (45%) is significantly different from the one of participating teams (37%)
Clues to improve mixity
   Women are not as represented as men in iGEM. Why should this be a problem ? Indeed, even if it might lead to success as explained above, the need to have gender equality could be questioned. However iGEM is an international competition. One of its main goals is to attract and educate young people as well as trying to have them solve real issues. Synthetic biology might be a key technology to solve the main challenges of the 21st century.
The world will need science and if iGEM only succeeds in motivating half of the population that could be interested, this would be a major failure to achieve its mission. Therefore, the last part of the study was aimed at understanding how could iGEM improve mixity within its own ranks.
From the data
   By looking at correlation between sex ratios and other variables, the most striking result is the link between team size and sex ratio. Teams of 2 or 3 people are almost only male teams. Even when taking out those very small teams, out of the data set the correlation holds up. This is a first lead.
The second analysis that was made regarding the data was to compare the detailed statistics of the 100 most female teams and 100 male teams. Again, it is found that the total team member is lower for male team (9,7 vs 7,8 (p-value 0,0019) we can hypothesize that having women instructors does matter to attract girls in teams. They serve as role models. Having a woman capable of studying and realizing a synthetic biology project is a direct signal to female students that it is also possible for them to do it. Having a woman adviser might also help girls better adapt in a group and reduce their fears about having to endure constant teasing or ""male "" ambiance.
From a survey
   Finally, a survey was conducted among iGEMers and former iGEMers to understand their motivations and activities in iGEM. The study was designed to  be unbiased and to avoid stereotype threat (for example by putting the"

Promoters of human elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1alpha), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor–alpha (PPAR-alpha), liver fatty acid binding protein 1 (FABP1) and glucose regulated protein (GRP78) are of human origins, and they govern basic metabolic reactions. Based on their functions and origin, we believe these BioBricks pose no threats to the public.
Bacterial Fatty Acid Metabolism Regular Protein
Fatty acid metabolism regular protein (fadR) is a bacterial transcription factor that regulates lipid metabolism of fatty acid biosynthesis and beta-oxidation. fadR and fatty acid dependent promoter (PfadBA) are obtained from the 2013 distribution kit and iGEM headquarters, submitted by the NTU-Taida 2012 team. fadR and PfadBA are native to E. coli and no study has been conducted in introducing them into a mammalian system. Based on the native functions of fadR and PfadBA, we believe that these two BioBricks will not raise any safety issues when introduced into a heterologous system.
Researcher Safety
This year, our team was authorized to work with two non-pathogenic bacterial strains, the Escherichia coli DH10B and SURE strains. Both strains are regularly employed in research, industry and study. Biosafety Level 1 standard regulations were strictly followed while using these strains.
The characterization part of our project involved human liver HepG2 and HEK293FT cell lines. Only three of our trained members were allowed to enter the Tissue Culture Room and conducted experiments with HEK293FT and HepG2 cells in level 2 biosafety cabinets. They received special training about biosafety and clearly understood potential risks and methods of resolution. Gloves and lab coats were worn while researchers were in lab to avoid contamination and corrosion.
Additionally, some toxic or mutagenic substances were involved in procedures like genomic DNA extraction, cell fixation and fatty acid quantification. Phenol, chloroform, formaldehyde, BF3, n-heptane, diethyl ether and petroleum ether were used in the experiments mentioned above. Our team members who were dealing with these chemicals had received full supervision from lab technicians. Gloves, lab coats and protective goggles were worn during these procedures.

Today we started our work with some literature research about enzyme activity tests, laccases and its substrates. So today was filled with online research, reading papers and collecting information about the laccases our team decided to use.
Thursday May 3th
Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
After the vector with the laccase gene bpul from Bacillus pumilus arrived, we transformed it into the competent E. coli KRX to have a larger amount of vector. The protocol we used was as followed:
The electroporation setup: U = 2,5 kV, C = 25 µF and R = 400 Ω
Since we did not know the efficient of our competent KRX we used two different E.coli volumes for the transformation, 50 µL and 100 µL. We gave 50 µL 10% glycerol to the reaction tubes with 1 µL of the vector DNA (Bacillus pumilus). After the transformation we plated them into ampicillin plates.
PCR with the Xanthomonas campestris B100 and E. coli BL21(DE3) genomic DNA to isolate the laccases. Therefore we used the primers Xcc_LAC_FW_T7, Xcc_LAC_RV_HIS, E.coli_LAC_FW_T7 and E.coli_LAC_RV_HIS which are listed under Materials.
Friday May 4th
Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases: We did Colony PCR on the transformed the Bacillus pumilus CotA plasmid. Unfortunately the control with colony PCR didn't work. So we just picked some colonies for plasmid isolation in the hope that on the AMP plate were no false positives colonies.

However, the fluorescence output from their switch was inefficient. As a result, we started to look for potential problems and corresponding improvements that can be applied to the Brown design.
Potential Problem of the Brown's Design
After reviewing some literature, we found out that the potential problem of their design might be due to the use of BAD/AraCp. The major problem of BAD/AraCp is the dual function of AraC protein, which can both activate and repress BADp. In the absence of arabinose, the dimeric AraC protein molecule will contact I2 and O2 half-sites on the DNA, which generates a DNA loop, interfering the access of RNA polymerase to the 2 promoters , repressing BADp. When arabinose is present, AraC binds to I1 and I2 half-sites on the DNA, which allows the binding of RNA polymerase; thus, will stimulate the transcription of BADp. The dual function of AraC protein complicates the behavior of BAD/AraCp which pose potential threat to the stability of the Tristable Switch.
In contrast, both TetR and LacI, can only act as repressors to their corresponding promoters. In the presence of their corresponding inducers, aTc and IPTG, respectively, the affinity of the repressor binding to the operator sites of the promoter will be reduced and thus activate transcription.
Our Design
Our design aims to achieve three main characteristics:  stable and distinct signal output, and fast state-switching rate. In which stability is the major goal that we would like to achieve. As a results, strengths of the promoters need to be similar. The Tristable Switch was built in 3 modules, separated according to the promoter that drives its expression. For characterization of all smaller constructs, a medium-strength RBS (BBa_B0032) was used.
phlFp Profile
tetp Profile
lacp Profile
1. phlFp
The major difference between the two designs are that we substituted BAD/AraCp with phlFp. As PhlF is a member of the TetR family repressors, therefore, the repressor behave similar as TetR in which the binding of the inducer DAPG with the repressor will lower the it’s affinity to bind to the operator sites of the promoter, in turn activates promoter transcription."

His advice is not only limited to meetings, but also exceeds to the wet lab at random encounters in the weighing room. And whenever we are down, he reminds us of his own accomplishments 2 years ago, when they finished in the top 16 while they hardly had any results. This is very comforting when our transformations failed again for no good reason.

BananaGuard came all the way from the warm soils of Indonesia to Wageningen to help our team fight Fusarium oxysporum. He explained us how strong and resistant is F. oxysporum and how farmers are struggling to fight this fungus. Thanks to his broad experience in infected areas he gave us a many suggestions on the best way of applying the product on the soil and the most optimal antifungals to use. He had never been abroad before, so he is very much interested in Dutch culture. Now he is an unconditional lover of stroopwafels and uses the bicycle to go everywhere. After the big Boston jamboree he will fly back to his country full of genes and knowledge to fight the Panama disease.

He supervises all greenhouse related experiments and finds last minute solutions for us when the ordered plants don't arrive or when we forgot to book the right greenhouse space. Seemingly ever happy will he always take the time to help us. Working with him is a great pleasure because he makes digging in soil fun.

Clearly, such magnificent abilities raise ideas and opportunities for developing novel and progressive bacterial applications. Choosing from a range of somewhat diverse projects, we have decided to study the formation of the magnetosomes. Hereby, we hope to be able to suggest a strategy for new types of selections markers based on magnetism. This will hopefully stand as a convenient alternative to the general standard of working with antibiotic resistance for selections markers. During the project we hope to succeed in performing a series of proof-of-concept experiments, whilst also attaching the importance of public outreach. In this way, we hope to be able to display the fascinating world of applied bioscience to the general public.

WHAT IS SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY?
In synthetic biology, biomedicine, chemistry, biophysics, nanosciences and genetic engineering combine together. The final aim is to create new biological systems or re-design existing systems to build new non existing functions. In order to achieve this, synthetic biology follows rational engineering processes based on highly characterized genetic parts, the so-called BioBricks. The resulting new devices display functions which lead the way to breakthrough innovations that both have positive effect on our everyday life and push further ahead the boundaries of our scientific knowledge about the complexity of life.
WHAT IS iGEM?
The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) is an annual competition in synthetic biology organized by MIT. The competition is open to motivated undergraduate students who want to work in a team and develop a project of their own exclusive design. The teams are provided with a kit of biological parts from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts to create new functional biological devices in living cells. In turn, new parts built by each team can be submitted to the Registry . The project is developed mainly over the summer break and will culminate with the presentation of team results at the Regional Jamboree . A few lucky and talented teams will go onto the World Championship Jamboree . This experience is extremely stimulating for the students that have the chance to improve their skills and knowledge working on different aspects of the project as well as making new friends.

Extraction of the protein DiphTox from recombinant E. coli was done by prominent lysis of cells grown that is grown overnight. Native lysis buffer was utilized to maintain specific protein configuration for its function for binding. To measure protein concentration, our team would use Bradford assay using Coomassie Brilliant Blue solution and placed within plate reader for 595 nm absorbance test. Standard curve of the assay was produced using Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) as concentration standards.

Part III: DT-HT Binding Assays
Effect of Temperatures on DT-HT Binding Kinetics
Upon confirmation of DT and HT expression, our team would like to testify the interaction of those proteins. Prior to binding assay, the recombinant E. coli possessing HT expression should be uncoated from the outer membrane layer. This lets huge molecules or proteins accessing the periplasmic layer or inner plasma membrane of the bacteria. Transforming E. coli into intact spheroplast could be a disadvantageous for the cell itself, since the membrane is more fragile to extracellular extremes. This would be one of the major challenges of the binding assays in determining specific pH and temperatures for keeping the spheroplasts alive. Methods for making spheroplasts could be accessed in the protocol page
Spheroplasts were subjected to different DT concentration during one hour incubation with different temperatures (Table 2). Binding of HT receptor towards intact DT in Magne-His beads would prevent spheroplasts elimination during washing process. Elution of spheroplasts would be the final variable in quantifying DT-HT binding strength.

InterLab
InterLab section is the biggest interlaboratory studies in synthetic biology starting from 2014 launched by iGEM. We were invited to participate in the Fourth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study as an 2017 iGEM team and finished all the experiments and measurements in early July.
As a half-engineering discipline, synthetic biology requires reliable and repeatable measurement, and that is the aim for the Measurement Committee of iGEM. By developing a robust measurement procedure for GFP, it enables people to directly compare measurements to debug engineered biological constructs.
In the fourth InterLab, we used a clear and precise GFP measurement protocol offered by the Measurement Committee and followed the steps. All the results have been submitted to the committee on time, which will contribute to the analysis and improvement on the protocol.

These results highlight how feasible (and safe ) it can be for a iGEM team to start a paratransgenesis project completely from scratch! Other chassis can even be more interesting depending on the specifics of what the team is targeting.
In september of this year, a Serratia strain was used for paratransgenesis in a paper published in Science[2] from the group that first used P. agglomerans. And it used some of the same effectors we produced on this project! If you want to see more about alternative chassis, check our conceptual framework page!

Protocols
And you can get a protocol by first asking the app to find some. Due to certain restrictions you can't ""one-shot"" the protocols command on Google Assistant (i.e. ""find ligation protocols""). However, this does work on Amazon Alexa.
Find protocols
Sure. What protocol are you looking for?
The app will then prompt you to tell it what protocol you want. For example, if you want a ligation protocol you'd just say
Ligation
Ok, I've found Ligation protocol. Ligation lets you take a strand of DNA that has compatible sticky ends and insert it into a vector. Would you like a step-by-step guide or to exit?
The app will then search the Protocat database and find you relevant protocols. It will then read out the summary for that protocol. You can begin the step-by-step guide for that protcol by saying
A step-by-step guide
Step 1: Label a microcentrifuge tube to perform the reaction in
The app will then proceed to read out the first step. Once you're ready, you can ask the app to move on to the next step. If you missed a step you can ask the app to repeat it, and if you've gone too far you can ask the app to go back.
Next
Step 2: Add 2μL of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer to the tube
Repeat
Step 2: Add 2μL of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer to the tube
Back
Step 1: Label a microcentrifuge tube to perform the reaction in
Where possible, the app will try to remember where you are in the protocol in case you accidentally quit the app.
If you want to add your own protocols simply add them to ProtoCat , a protocols database created by Michigan Software 's iGEM team. Once you’ve added protocols there, you'll be able to use them in the app within a couple of minutes.
Privacy
You can find out how we use data provided to the app in our privacy policy . We think it’s truly a gripping read.

Motivated by the problems we faced in our own project, we decided to work on a database of lesser used organisms.
August 2017
New sem started. Nikhita, Kailash and Mousami participated and won in a hackathon at SVCE where they came up with the prototype for the codon optimisation tool used in the database. Finished the IISc collaboration. An interactive session was organised for students in the 11th grade at Vana Vani School on the IIT campus, explaining what synthetic biology is and what iGEMers do.
Sept 2017
Further tweaking of the codon optimisation tool was made. Kailash, Mousami and Karthik came up with the first prototype for our database. The database was hosted on pythonanywhere.com. Sent out a survey to all iGEM teams asking them about what organism they were using and the problems they faced while working with it. Organised a session for our freshmen undergraduates explaining the nuances of iGEM. After some deliberation, we decided to start a synbio community called GeneSys, with an aim to create a nurturing environment and culture of synbio at IITM and also passing on our knowledge to our juniors.
Oct 2017
Codon optimisation tool was made more user-friendly.Version 2 of the database, courtesy Kailash and Karthik was developed. More sessions of GeneSys (trying to do that on a weekly basis) were conducted. RBS and gRNA tools are being developed. Ten unconventional hosts were selected and team members started filling data for them. Sent the database out for beta testing in our own department and also other iGEM teams. Collaboration with iGEM Michigan Biological Software to use their database of protocols called ProtoCat. Talked to Dr Shashi Bala Prasad and Dr Anantha Barathi, our advisors and they suggested various improvements that were implemented.

Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," of another country , is it right to do so? Certainly, it is clear that Synthetic Biology could have far-reaching consequences, and it is appropriate to spend time carefully thinking about and addressing those consequences thoroughly.
The resources on current research are out there for the public to find, but it was clear from our workshop that outreach needs to be done to engage with the public - the students we were talking to already had an active interest in science and research, yet clearly felt not enough was being done to inform the general public about what was going on. Over the last few years more events that the public can attend have been popping up; we agree this needs to continue and escalate to ensure that interest in modern science continues and reaches a new audience. Most importantly, these events should attempt to seriously address any ethical issues the public have with current research. But it's not just workshops that need to happen - national-media science coverage is important too, not only for having a further audience reach, but because it can genuinely affect public perception . This is probably iGEM’s greatest attribute, as the competition has sufficient gravitas to make its presence felt on a national and international stage . Because of this, it is worth iGEM teams making an effort to contact prominent science-correspondents, writers and presenters about their projects, as well as running smaller-scale, public workshop sessions. The team will continue to document its efforts on this page.
20th August Reach for Excellence
On the 20th August, Emily, Jonah, Jenni and Sabrina presented to a group of sixth form students at the Reach for Excellence Summer School held at Leeds University. The group talked about what Synthetic Biology and the iGEM competition is, and also explained our own Micro-Beagle iGEM project and its possible future uses. We then went on to talk about the ethics concerned with Synthetic Biology.
After the presentation the students had a debate about the ethical issues that arises with Synthetic Biology, where students suggested the main issues involved with the ethics of Synthetic Biology and wrote them down in groups of 4-5 people. The students identified a range of ethical issues including animal testing, bioterrorism, environmental issues, political influences and religious issues such as playing god. The students then chose whether they agreed, disagreed or were neutral for each issue that was brought up.
We then showed the students around the undergraduate labs and gave them a chance to learn a new skill - how to pipette and load gels for electrophoresis experiments. Each student had a go at loading the gels with our samples, and learnt about how gel electrophoresis"
BCCS-Bristol,2008,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,".  The CpxR promoter was cloned out of the TR235 and MG1655 genomes, and was verified on a gel after restriction digest.  The results of the digest of pSB1A3, however, did not make sense again, and doesn’t appear to correspond to what it is meant to be.  We have now decided to obtain this plasmid by using the T9002 biobrick, cutting out the T9002 part, and inserting our CpxR promoter.
The second biobrick we want to make is luxI and GFP under the control of our CpxR promoter.  Originally the LuxI and GFP portion were to be obtained from the J37015 biobrick, but since this doesn’t appear to be in the plasmid, we have started on building it ourselves using the separate LuxI (I15030) and GFP (E0840) parts.  Transformations of electro-competent DH5α with the I15030 part were carried out.
17th September - 25th September
We had problems using the pSB1A3 BioBrick so instead digested T9002 to remove the insert, leaving the pSB1A3 vector for Biobrick Building.
Building pCpxR_pSB1A3
We digested pCpxR (from both MG1655 and TR235 - see previous entry) to give it sticky ends and ligated it into pSB1A3. There were transformed into DN5 alpha. 4 out of 7 colonies were in the correct orientation. 3 out of the 4 colonies were of the right length when these were analysed by restriction digest. Out of the 3 colonies, 2 were MG1655 pCpxR and 1 was TR235 pCpxR.
Building pCpxR_E0840_pSB1A3
BioBrick BBa_E0840 was cloned and digested to make it sticky. This was ligated into the pCPXR_pSB1A3 (both MG1655 and TR235 pCpxR) vector and transformed into DH5 alpha.
Transformation of DH5 alpha with I15030 (in an attempt to aquire LuxI-GFP this way) showed that the part doesn't appear to be in the BBa_I731014 Biobrick. There are issues with the BBa_I731014 part documented the parts registry. We have contacted the Imperial IGEM group who are sending us the part.
26th September - 16th October
The part from Imperial arrived too"
