Achievement
Our human practice team reached out to the experts to hear their opinions about our project. This outreach had provided us with many insights and knowledges for our team. Through the dialogue and discussions, we also had integrated some of the advices into our project such as a good interfacial tension of biosurfactant criteria. This outreach addressed the issue of biosafety and environmental impact analysis, and our product application criteria.
Biosafety
Fig. 1 A dialogue between our team and biosafety expert, Indra Wibowo, Ph.D.
Biosafety is an important issue when we would like to apply Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) or its products into environment. Taking this into account, we had a dialogue with a biosafety expert from our university, ITB.
According to him, there are many parameters to categorize a product safety to be applied in real environment. Addressing the environmental issue for our project, for instance, we must analyze whether our bioproduct could bring any harm to the organism living in the oil reservoir. In terms of health, the fundamental parameter is whether the product can cause any infections to human. If we could not guarantee these things, our product could not be applied to the environment. In addition, we must also assess the level of our product toxicity, the dose that would be used at the environment, and also the route of application.
Each country has different biosafety regulation, but still, refers to a global biosafety standards. This is because each country has different case, product, and government policies. For example, for transgenes or GMOs product, Indonesia restrict all use of those kind of products. In Indonesia, the risk assessment carried out by experts who are active in independent government institution, academicians, or NGO. Usually, Ministry of Environment and Forestry
In conclusion, we must address the issue of environmental"
BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," selectively dispensing the output of a microfluidic chip into common lab vessels - as a system, TERRA consists of an active XY-plane and UI interface designed to accurately dispense the outputs of a microfluidic chip to a desired location on a laboratory vessel such as a 96 well plate. The ability to accurately dispense the output of the microfluidic chip enables effective integration of TERRA into the workflow of various synthetic biology procedures. Additionally, exporting onto standard laboratory vessels allows researchers to analyze the microfluidic outputs using benchtop equipment already in the lab, such as a plate reader or flow cytometer, reducing the need to incorporate sensors into microfluidic devices.
Works in conjunction with the 2017 BostonU Hardware iGEM team’s project MARS - MARS designed a set of 9 standardized microfluidic chips capable of running 9 common synthetic biology lab protocols. Additionally, MARS created a series of videos and documentation, Microfluidics 101, designed to introduce people to the basic principles and workings of microfluidics. This helps bridge the knowledge gap as well as created microfluidic chips for standardized protocols.
TERRA is application agnostic and cost effective - Since the project is microfluidic based, it has a variety of potential applications from liquid handling to PCR. Due to its DIY and open-sourced nature, TERRA is a low-cost solution, which further serves to increase its accessibility to the community.
TERRA and Other Potential Solutions
Another solution to the problem of microfluidic accessibility is outlined in the 2013 paper “Microfluidics on liquid handling stations (μF-on-LHS): an industry compatible chip interface between microfluidics and automated liquid handling stations.” 3 In this paper, they described how to regulate the inputs and valves of a microfluidic chip using an Tecan EVO 200.
The primary advantage of this solution is that it is better equipped to deal with small volumes, working with pipettes on the scale of 25-5000 μL. 3 In addition to the larger stepping accuracy, this solution is more precise compared to TERRA. Rather than exporting the output of the microfluidic chip, the output is transported downstream to the analytics section where it can be analyzed by the plate reader built into the LHS. However, this method requires a researcher to purchase the necessary hardware which can cost $100,000 or more. 3 This makes it extremely challenging for synthetic biologists to incorporate this process into their workflow.
The two primary advantages that TERRA has over this system are flexibility and cost"
Genspace,2014,Team:Genspace#project_-_-_TEXT.html," is designed to be easily modifiable, and therefore approachable to everyone from weekend researcher to curious high school student. The plasmid is also designed to be easy to cultivate with minimal resources. Unlike most plasmids, it does not need to be grown with antibiotics, significantly increasing accessibility to budget-constrained organizations, and having less negative environmental impact.
As a first step, we have cloned the IP-free fluorescent protein genes. These are meant to be used together with the Open Plasmid. Each gene codes for a differently fluorescent protein: cyan, green, and red. These sequences can be used as teaching tools for classes or workshops or as molecular tools by independent researchers who are part of the community.

  Human Practice
With on going advances, the introduction to consequences of scientific research to the public is becoming an increasingly important task for an iGEM team, as it should be in every scientific community. The potential discoveries and applications in Synthetic Biology will have significant influences on everyday life, therefore a continuous and public dialogue on limitations and allowances is necessary. In our Human Practice work we address this problem in a comprehensive program and discuss benefits as well as dangers of Synthetic Biology.  Therefore，a key point of the human practice work for the iGEM-NEAU Team is to increase the dialogue between science, society and industry.
Peking university meetups
We started with presentations from different teams around China in Peking University. After that we discussed difficulties we met or are having with our projects. At the end of activity, we had a tour of Peking University lab, and we commented on the difficulty to grow cultures. Afterwards, we walked to iGEM Headquarters together. We listened in on experts' discussions about these problems and how iGEM can help them.
science camp
In poster session, we made a introduction about our project this year. To our surprise,we met some old friends last year, by sharing our lab life and experimental progress. We had a great fun with other iGEM teams. With lots of exchange of ideas, they were so nice to give us their suggestions about our project. We had a good opportunity to communicate with different universities having various backgrounds and school generations.
Visit to the pharmaceutica
We visit to the pharmaceutical industrial companies, understanding pharmaceutical plant layout, and the drug production process(from raw materials to finished products). The leading managers strengthen our GMP knowledge and safety knowledge, which inspiredus to hold a scientific exhibition .Cooperated with the Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Bioengineering Co. Ltd, we held a scientific exhibition about synthetic biology in Harbin Science Center.

A school teacher who was interviewed said: ""Your project is beneficial to the whole mankind. This society is able to advance because some people like you. I accept your investigation and support you with my own actions."" All team members were greatly encouraged when they heard the interviewees and they thought that this was a powerful driving force to make us work hard.
Interview Principle Investigators of Shanghai Institute of Biological Sciences
In late July, we interviewed several principle investigators from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, all of whom are engaged in research of cancer-related fields. The team members asked the respondents about cancer, cancer treatment, new therapies, immunotherapy, and the rationality of the pricing of cancer treatments in the current society. The researchers gave detailed answers to us. We harvested a lot about knowledge related to the background of the subject and gained so many guidance opinions. Through interviewing them, we finally formulated our project and make it better continuously. The following is a selection of interviews. 1. Q: What is cancer? Prof. Wang Hongyan: Cancer, also known as tumors, is divided into benign and malignant tumors, the latter called cancer. The damage to the body of a malignant tumor lies in its metastasis. In addition to the damage to the original part of the original lesion, it will cause damage to that place if it is transferred to any place. 2. Q: How is cancer metastasized? Prof. Wang Hongyan: Tumor cells exist in a microenvironment, cell secretory mediators, such as hydrolase and cytokines. These microenvironments can rapidly proliferate tumors; secrete factors that cause lymphatic vessels and blood vessels to form. When tumors grow up, they can Through the formation of blood vessels, fresh blood enters, brings nutrients, grows tumor cells, and opens up a new path for tumor cells to metastasize. During the metastasis process, the tumor will ""domesticize"" the immune cells into ""friends"" of the tumor cells, making the tumor cells more convenient to transfer. 3. Q: What are the current methods of cancer treatment? Prof. Meng Feilong: First of all, surgery. Some can't do it. For example, after the spread of cancer, it is difficult and has certain damage to the human body. Secondly, chemotherapy and radiotherapy: side effects are serious, threatening normal cells and producing resistance. Thired, targeted therapy. It will bring drug resistance and doctors may not be able to find a suitable target. Nowadays, immunotherapy are developing fast. Although the efficacy is excellent"

Safety/Human practice
Overview
We all know that Yamanaka won the Nobel Prize in 2012 for his research on iPSCs. It is a milestone in the history of biology and medicine which opens up so much possibility. iPSCs are important in the research of stem cells and potentially have therapeutic uses, which can prevent the controversial use of embryos. However, there are potential risks about iPSCs applying in medicine, because the genes that were used to reprogram the somatic cells include oncogenes. The potential of oncogenicity is one of the problems that hindered the application of iPSCs in clinical applications. Thus, safety about application of iPSCs is our main concern. This year, we come up with a solution using synthetic biology methods to promote the application of iPSCs. Based on our project, we have done some outreach relating to iPSCs and human health.
It has been many years since the word ‘synthetic biology’ emerged, but we find that the concept of synthetic biology is still unfamiliar to the public. So we carried out four activities through out the year to spread the concept of synthetic biology, iGEM and iPSCs. These activities also allowed us to share our ideas with people who are already familiar with related knowledge.
As transgenic techniques have not been completely accepted by the public, the question about synthetic biology methods may be even tougher. People may be more concern about the biosafety of synthetic biology, because in synthetic biology methods we not only transform a single gene into the organism, but sometimes a completely artificial device. This kind of methods may also raise an ethical issue, because human beings create life just like the God.
With the concern about human health, we cooperated with Guangdong International Life Science Foundation, GDILSF. In order to share our opinions about human health and synthetic biology, we carried out a campus popularization, a TEDx Salon, and participate in a workshop for iGEM teams.
A Visit to the Hospital
There are some cases about using stem cells to cure disease in several countries, while the technique is not yet widely spread. What’s more, embryonic stem cells have controversy in its ethical rights and may have the risk of rejection. iPSCs, which are free of controversy and unlikely to cause rejection, may have a wider application than ESCs.
However, as iPSCs is a newly emerged technique, people who"

Cultivation
Figure 2: Comparison of the cultivated E. coli KRX  and E. coli KRX containing <partinfo>K729006</partinfo> cultivations. The OD600 was measured each hour for 12 h.
E. coli KRX was transformed with the  BioBrick <partinfo>K729006</partinfo> of the UCL team. The cells were characterized by growth kinetics and activity test. E. coli KRX containing <partinfo>K729006</partinfo> was cultivated in LB-medium with a total volume of  60 mL  for 12 h at 37 °C (120 rpm) in 250 mL shaking flasks without baffles. To produce a higher amount of the protein we also cultivated a total volume of 200 mL in a 1 L shaking flask without baffles. The OD600 values were determined each hour. To measure the influence of the transformed BioBrick on the growth of the cells a negative control (E. coli KRX) was cultivated identically.
In Fig. 2 the growth curves ofE. coli KRX containing <partinfo>K729006</partinfo> and of the negative control E. coli KRX are plotted. As expected the E. coli KRX containing <partinfo>K729006</partinfo> grew slower than the negative control. This can be explained by the protein expression.
The cells were harvested and centrifuged after 12 h. The pellets were resuspended in 100 mM Na-Acetat-buffer, lysed by sonication and centrifuged. The supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and laccase activity assay.

Outlook
Principle of Operation
Cellock Holmes is designed upon a SynBio approach comprising a two-dimensional biosensor and a measurement unit. The two-dimensional biosensor is devised to recognize quorum sensing molecules secreted by the pathogen cells and to generate a distinct fluorescence signal; while the measurement device recognizes and analyzes the produced signal. On the molecular side, we use the REACh construct to transform regular E. coli cells into Cellocks.
The principle of quorum sensing
Microorganisms can sense the presence of their own kind based on quorum sensing which is a form of chemical communication. Depending on their cell density, quorum sensing allows these cells to activate or deactivate certain gene expression cascades (Waters and Bassler, 2005) for a specific function.
Our sensor cells, Cellocks, are immobilized in agar chips. To make the chips, we mix the Cellocks with liquid LB agar.  In the course of our project, we designed a casting mold specifically for the production of our agar chips. When the agar has cooled down, the chips are cut out of the mold and are ready to use. Storage of the readily usable sensor chips is"

OVERVIEW
The way we live today has been deeply revolutionized through rapid developments of low-cost drugs, novel chemicals and clean energies by various newly engineered microorganisms. However, the problem of high risks of potential ecological contamination and accidental commercial loss continues threatening the scientists, industrialists and the public as synthetic biology makes progress. Can the important strains be genetically locked up in the molecular level even when their physical lock boxes are broken up? The 2014 project of BIT-China, E.co-Lock mimicking the electronic combination lock, focused on the bio-security and bio-economy of all engineered microorganisms, is novelly designed to meet this challenge.
Layered AND Gates, sRNA regulatory System and Min System are the three main parts to build up the E.co-Lock. The layered logic AND gates are constructed and connected to realize different combinations of ""the password"" - here three different inducers. The sRNA regulation system is then implemented to control the order of the ""password"" by inhibiting the mRNAs built in the layered AND gates, thus to precisely mimic the password of a real digital lock. Currently, a three-inducer-password is built up and ideally in the future, many more layers of AND gates containing new inducers with newly synthesized sRNAs could be added up to increase the complexity of the password.Finally, Min system, representing a cell division inhibiting system, is re-designed to maintain industrial strains to an extremely low density given an initial locked state. In the future, other similar systems can be introduced to replace Min system to fulfill this function of inhibiting cell division. Therefore, commercially valuable or potentially hazardous strains will be under much more strict control with different customized E.co-Locks.
Thus, when genetically locked up with E.co-Lock, important industrial strains or dangerous strains will be under better protection from suffering loss, even at the occasions of unexpected leaking out or stolen, only when right password is put in, when suitable inducers are added in set order, strains can multiply properly. Much better safety of microorganism can be achieved both ecologically and commercially.
BACKGROUND
Synthetic biology is a real interdisciplinary ﬁeld, involving chemists, biologists, engineers, physicists or computer scientists [1]. As an emerging discipline, synthetic biology really brought us a lots of challenges and opportunities. However, plenty of problems also occurred in society.
The biggest problems are biosecurity and biosafety.

PROTEIN PRODUCTION, ISOLATION AND MODIFICATION
  
The complete coding regions of H. pylori flaA from the H. pylori SS1 strain and fliC from Escherichia coli K12 were amplified by PCR and cloned into AK3 or pET19b vector (Novagen). Chimeric flagellins were constructed via PCR ligation and Biobrick assembly methods. For the DNA cloning experiments E. coli  DH5α strain was used. After DNA sequences verification E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS were transformed with specific constructs for the overexpression of flagellar proteins. Cultures were grown in LB media (Luria-Bertani) supplemented with ampicillin at 37°C with shaking at 180 rpm until the OD600 was 0.4-0.5. At this point temperature was shifted to 25°C for maximal yield of native protein in supernatant. To induce protein expression 1 mM IPTG (isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) was added when OD600  was 0.7-1. Bacterial cells were further cultivated overnight and then harvested by centrifugation (5000g, 10 min at 4°C). Bacteria were resuspended in lysis buffer (0.1% sodium deoxicholate, 10 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0) with protease inhibitors (CPI, Sigma) and sonicated for homogenisation. After centrifugation, supernatant with soluble fraction of His-tagged recombinant flagellin was loaded on a pre-conditioned Ni-NTA column (Ni-NTA Agarose, Qiagen), which was then washed in 50 mM Tris/HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8.0. Proteins were eluted with buffers, containing 50 mM Tris/HCl, 100 mM NaCl, and imidazole with concentrations of 50 mM"

FLAVORATOR: New food preservation method by rose odor E. coli
Abstract
Food problems are a serious matter in the world. Among them, food preservation is the one. Ideal food preservation is keeping food without causing quality change for longer time with cost effectively. A plenty of preservation methods have been used so far, we created a new one to solve it. It is ""Flavorator"". The concept of “Flavorator” is a food-keeping box, in which a kind of flavor is released to suppress microbes’ growth. For a flavor-producer in a ""Flavorator"", the most plausible candidate is an engineered E. coli that produces antimicrobial and/or bacteriostatic volatile gaseous substances (flavors) to suppress unwanted microbial growth. terpenes, such as geraniol and/or farnesol, are the ones that are produced by the plants. Here, we show our strategy following three sequential steps towards accomplishing our goal. (1) In E. coli, terpene's precursors, such as isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), are produced by non-mevalonate (MEP) pathway. In MEP pathway, there are four enzymes, (ispD, ispF, idi, and dxs) that are rate-limiting enzymes to produce terpene’s procursors in E. coil. In order to create a high-yield strains producing IPP and DMAPP, we exogenously engineer to superimpose these genes into E. coli to"

1. Glycerol Stock
Glycerol stocks of R0040, B0015 J13002, and Pqrr4 were made in order to preserve them long term. The addition of glycerl is important because otherwise the cellular membrane would shear.
2. Plasmid Isolation
To obtain more isolated R0040, B0015, J1302, and Pqrr4, miniprep (plasmid isolation) was done on them.

Marketing & Sponsorship
After constantly following up with companies over the past few weeks, I successfully recruited Alberta Research Council to sponsor the University of Calgary's iGEM team. They have generously donated %250 dollars this year.
We also edited the June newsletter and discussed it with the rest of the marketing team prior to sending it to all the companies we had contacted (including those who have declined our proposal).

Sequencing of what I hope will be LuxOD47A BBK
I prepared a sample of the recently-formed-and-colony-PCR'd-and-NotI-restriction-digested LuxOD47A BBk for sequencing. This was done with BBk sequencing primers, in accordance with the sequencing protocol.

What do these areas mean to you? Which status do they have in your life? – Basis of existence, tradition, culture, additional income?
It is an investment for me - a side income in addition to my construction business. It is a good source of passive income because I earn money without doing anything. A piece of land with palm oil growing there is worth three times more than the same piece of land without it. The trees grow without me doing anything. Some of my land was passed down to me from my parents, so in a way it is also tradition. In Chinese culture we pass down land to our sons so it stays in the family’s name. When I die I cannot bring it with me, but my son can live a successful life from what I pass down to them. Then I don’t have to worry about my family’s wellbeing when I am gone.
What does cultivation of palm trees mean to Malaysian community in general, other farmers or plantation workers? What role does it play for Malaysian economy?
Is palm oil an important raw material? In which products is it mainly used in Malaysia? Are there any efforts for reducing the consumption?
Growing palm oil is a large part of the Malaysian economy. It is a major export as we sell the palm oil internationally. Some rural communities rely on harvesting palm oil for their day labour. However, more recently immigrants from Indonesia are imported for this labour because their wage is much cheaper. Most businesses have been hiring immigrants for their labour in recent years because of the cheap labour cost. The majority of my workers are Indonesian although some are Malay. In Malaysia we use palm oil for cooking I believe. Mostly for export. Also some cosmetics businesses buy palm oil from me. There is no effort to reduce the consumption. We don’t see a reason why. It supports our local economy and there is money in the business, always demand. Other companies and countries are waiting for us to produce and send our oil to them.
What is your opinion on the clearing of rainforest through industrial companies in order to create space for new plantation areas? What do you think of problems regarding deforestation especially on vegetation, animals (orangutan), environment and indigenous cultures?
We have national park areas, which are protected by the government. I believe the government has a pretty strong control over it. Since palm oil is not a new business in Malaysia, I don’t think deforestation is a current issue as all of the available land is surely already used.
What are the benefits of palm tree cultivation for Malaysia? How are the people prof"

Update on systematic classification of previous year iGEM projects.
Most of them are done.
Brainstorming next week
As a starting point use the classification of the previous iGEM projects. Members should present ideas to the advisors next meeting, prepare a few ppt slides/wiki entries.
Meeting 4
Wednesday May 28 12:30-13:30

Action points:
Systematic classification of iGEM projects of previous year. Apparently a webpage already exists on openwetware that has initiated this effort; therefore we will add on that. Bastiaan will take the lead: he will assign each student a bunch of projects to claasify. This will facilitate the discussion with the advisors.
Add a description of your competences/expertise on the wiki, so that it is clear what is your contribution to the project (Ruud, Rad, Farzad, Steven).
A planning will be posted on the webpage so that we know when everyone is available (Oscar). (* Filippo Menolascina 05:19, 29 May 2008 (EDT): we could use gmail calendar integration supplied by OWW to work out this...some other users have implemented it. Oscar, if you need help tell me!)
Have a look at the synthetic biology course of the Imperial College (all).
Have a look at the experimental protocols for DNA extraction (Ruud).

In addition to the EHEC biosensor we have been working on, we felt the need to give back to the iGEM community as well. Early in the planning stages of our project our team looked into past projects and found a staggering number of biosensors. By joining forces with Paris-Bettencourt's iGEM team we created the first biosensor database, created exclusively by iGEM teams, named SensiGEM . This tool will aid in streamlining the design process for future teams doing projects with the theme of a biosensor. To learn more about our collaboration click here .
A summary of our approach to designing our biosensor is shown below, highlighting our reliance on modeling to predict our experiments and our collaborations with industry to inform us of what they needed in a final product, as well as how our individual components work together.

Sorbonne_U_Paris,2018,Team:Sorbonne U Paris#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," soil-dwelling, non-pathogenic, naturally competent and nutritionally versatile organism especially known for its ability to degrade aromatic compounds. However, only a few tools are available for its gene manipulation. This year, we plan to expand the toolkit for A. baylyi ADP1 by making a synthetic promoter library along with codon optimized fluorescent reporter proteins to achieve better control over its expression rates. The codon table is not available for this organism. So we obtained sequence data of well-characterised proteins of this organism by filtering manually putative and hypothetical sequences and used this data to generate the codon table using CUTE - a tool of ChassiDex. The codon optimisation is done manually by replacing the less frequent codons with high-frequency codons based on the generated table. This can potentially open up various new exciting synthetic biology opportunities with this unexplored organism.

Stronger Together: An efficient, generalizable approach to design biosensors for small molecules
Abtract
Chemically induced dimerization (CID), in which two proteins dimerize only in the presence of a small molecule, has been widely used to control cell signaling, regulatory, and metabolic pathways, and used as logic gates for biological computation in living mammalian cells. However, few naturally occuring CID systems and their derivatives are currently available. Creating a CID system with desired affinity and specificity for any given small molecule remains an unsolved problem for computational design and other protein engineering approaches. To address this challenge, we have used a novel strategy to select CID binders from a vastly diverse combinatorial nanobody library. We have created new CID systems that can sense cholecalciferol and artemisinin. We are validating CID biosensors by"

Calibration experiments
Before starting cell measurements work, we accomplished three sets of calibration measurements with materials provided by the committee, including an OD600 reference point, a particle standard curve and a fluorenscein standard curve. These tests and data greatly facilitated our following quantitative interlab experiments.
Calibration 1 OD600 reference point and LUDOX
According to the protocol, we performed three calibration experiments (OD600 reference point, particle standard curve and the fluorescence standard curve) before the body part began.
In this experiment, we first uesd LUDOX CL-X provided by the committee to obtain a conversion factor as the intermediate variable between Abs600 and OD600 measurement. The LUDOX solution (45% colloidal silica suspension) is hardly scattering and gives a low absorbance value, making it an ideal material for correct the standard path length of spectrophotometers in different laboratories, which would greatly improve the accuracy of the following volume dependent experiments.
Results shown below.
Table 1. OD600 reference point
4 replicates are measured respectively to acquire the average Abs600 of LUDOX CL-X solution and dH2O. Reference OD600 is given by the iGEM authority. The ratio of OD600/Abs600 is 3.652.
Calibration 2 Particle Standard Curve
After standardizing the absorbance value, we managed to conclude a conversion factor between Abs600 and the estimated number of cells. In this experiment, we used the silica beads delivered by iGEM committee and made a serial dilution in the 96-well plate according to the protocol. The beads’ size and optical charateristics are similar to cells and its concentration (amount of particles per volume)is known, allowing us to conduct a standard curve of particle concentration in 4 replicates.

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"; normally the infection comes from Argentina, which is where the disease most often occurs. In Chile, they mostly struggle with varroa and nosema and for purposes of the SAG and exportations, the varroa mite is treated with organic products, that result inefficient and expensive. Antibiotics are also used against Varroa, getting back to the resistance problem. Regarding this topic, the beekeeper wondered if our product would help against varroa, and we could tell him how one of the most important consequences of varroa is that the immune system is weakened; providing the bee with new immunity components (AMP’s) will greatly help it, so the answer is yes! Our product can help bees get fortified when they are suffering from varroa.
The beekeeper also shared with us the main routes through which the disease is transmitted from Argentina to Chile, how the bee's life duration varies depending on the production stage and also shared with us details about SAC normative.
Regarding the discussed topic on how bee’s longevity varies depending on different production stages, we explained the beekeeper another approach of our project: When the bee uses less energy in the production of antimicrobial peptides it is possible that its longevity increases.2
Bryan Saavedra did not know about synthetic biology and we gave him an approach to this area and how it had so many reaches, one of them being beekeeping. While explaining our project we absent-mindedly use a somewhat technical word that is usually complicated for the community in general. A peptide. The beekeeper, as in other times of the conversation, didn't hesitate to ask us and he attentively listened to us while we explained to him what we were referring to; he was always intrigued by our project.

Anabaena 7120, on the other hand, must take its DNA through a rather circuitous path; the DNA construct must first be placed in a cargo plasmid and transformed into E. coli by traditional means.  Transfer to Anabaena takes place by conjugation, facilitated by a second E. coli strain carrying a plasmid encoding the machinery for bacterial conjugation.
Another problem is the propensity of Anabaena to slice and dice foreign DNA with isoschizomers of the restriction enzymes AvaI, AvaII and AvaIII.  This has been addressed with methyltransferases targeting the same sequences; that means a third E. coli strain carrying these methyltransferases (a helper plasmid) participates in the conjugation.  At the end of all this, a certain number of cyanobacterial cells take up the DNA, and are selected for with neomycin on minimal media.  As soon as the unsuccessful exconjugates and the bacterial parental strains die off, transformant colonies can be picked.  One significant hindrance associated with this process is the slow cyanobacterial doubling time; the transformants can take upwards of a week to grow.
Our first trials were performed with the helper plasmid pDS4101, the conjugative plasmid pRL443 and the cargo plasmid pRL25.  pDS4101 does not possess the methyltransferases which can epigenetically protect the incoming DNA from restriction, and so can only be used to transfer plasmids lacking restriction sites, such as pRL25, as a proof of concept.
Towards the end of the summer we were able to obtain the helper plasmid pRL623 containing the three methyltransferases which together offer complete protection from restriction inside Anabaena.  There was an added obstacle to this new route, however: pRL623 can only be carried against certain E. coli genetic backgrounds lacking methyl-restricting enzymes, in order to prevent restriction of the host genome.  This meant that transfer of the helper plasmid into the cargo plasmid strain before conjugation into Anabaena results in the suicide of that cargo strain, and no transformation.  The solution to this was transformation by more traditional means of the cargo plasmid into the strain already carrying the helper plasmid; the cargo was then be delivered into Anabaena without transfer of the dangerous helper plasmid, and the"

Figure 2 The Hoffman La-Roche process
The Monsanto process was developed by a Nobel Prize laureate (2001), Wiliam S. Kowels, with the first pilot synthesis taking place in 1974. The Monsanto process is notable as the first commercial process that uses asymmetric synthesis with transition metal complexes (Fig 3). It totals four steps, the first being the synthesis of a side chain of azlactone by protection of amine and vanillin followed by condensation. Then the resulting enamine is hydrolysed to enamide. This enamide is then asymmetrically hydrogenated to give the desired (S)-enantiomer. Finally, the (S)-enantiomer is deprotected yielding phenols, amides and L-DOPA [1].
Figure 3 The Monsanto process
The Ajinomoto process is a biosynthetic process that was developed by Kumagai’s group at Kyoto University. It is a three-component one-step process that uses a biocatalytic route (Fig 4). Tyrosine Phenol Lyase (TPL) is an enzyme that uses the non-physiological substrate catechol. TPL installs a side chain consisting of an amino group by forming a carbon-carbon bond and carbon-nitrogen bond at the same time from 3 substrates.  Since the reaction is reversible, L-DOPA crystallization induced by seeding shifts the equilibrium to the product side [1].
Figure 4 The Ajinomoto process
The Sankyo process was developed in 1990 and introduced commercially in 2008. It is predicted to reach an annual yield of 3000 ton and become the leading process by which L-DOPA is manufactured. It is composed of seven reactions in total, making it the longest process considered here (Fig 5), starting with vanillin being protected by methylation to yield an aldehyde. The newly synthesized aldehyde is condensed into hydantoin, which makes benzylidene hydantoin. Subsequent hydrogenation of benzylidene hydantoin gives a racemic mixture that is hydrated, acetylated, and then the enantiomer of interest is selectively deacetylated via an enzymatic reaction. Hydrolysis and deprotection of two methoxy groups yields L-DOPA [1].

DDT, the inventor of which won the Nobel Prize, was used as a pesticide at early time, but after 50 years we found out that it caused irreparable damage to human beings and environment. Therefore, it is necessary to slow the development of genetic engineering and focus on improving its basic research. We should make sure it won't cause side effects to the environment and human beings before its promotion.
2. Establish and improve the related laws and regulations, and strictly implement them

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Project#lungRanger_-_-_TEXT.html,"ium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

First round
Teams battled each other in the five categories Abbreviations, Amino Acids, Bad Science Movies, Part Categories and Sponsor Logos.
Team Darmstadt alias “Darmstadt” lead the second round by finding most questions to the answers in the categories Deadlines, DNA, Molecular Masses, Picture Puzzles and Sounds of Science. However, in the second last question, they stumbled across the last “double jeopardy”, set all their points – and lost, enabling team Braunschweig alias “Carola” and team Bielefeld to proceed to the final round. After coming up with questions to the answer belonging to the categories BioBricks, Chemical Structures, Inheritance, Plots and Propaganda, team Most came out as the winner, while Bier, Bielefeld and Carola came in second, third and forth, respectively.
Picture Puzzles
What could these three pictures stand for?
After a break, all teams came together again at 7 pm to welcome guests to the public part of the event. In 15-minute presentations, the teams from Bielefeld, Darmstand, Braunschweig, Tübingen, Munich and Aachen presented their project ideas to the public audience and answered some questions in the subsequent discussion round. Then the teams walked over to the residence village where we finished the evening with some pizza and drinks.
Take a break!
After the jeopardy meetup participants could enjoy a hearty snack before preparing for the public presentations.
Public presentations
Anna introduces iGEM team Braunschweig at the public presentations.
Although the night was quite short for some people, almost all teams made it to the Couven hall at 10 am on Sunday. We started the day with a presentation about SynBio research by Alexander Grünberg from the Jülich Research Centre, followed by Brian Claudill from IDT Biologica who introduced the concept of the company’s GBlocks® to the audience.
Subsequently, the teams from Munich, Freiburg, Braunschweig, Bielefeld and Aachen gave more detailed presentations than the day before about their this year’s iGEM projects. Each presentation was vividly discussed and some valuable improvement suggestions were brainstormed.

Overview
     Our project ""Plant B"" aims to regulate microbiota. With the help of antimicrobial peptides, we can achieve our goal to inhibit specific bacteria strains. Therefore, we attempt to produce antimicrobial peptides by E. coli.
     We designed BioBricks of antimicrobial peptides, then several experiments were done to test their functions and prove that our system can really work. We provided a collection of antimicrobial peptides and all the new BioBricks had been submitted to the registry of iGEM.

To demonstrate the feasibility of chromoprotein color expression, dependent on the LacI-IPTG system, Lambert iGEM received guidance and the preliminary genetic parts from Monica McNerney, a member of Georgia Institute of Technology, Dr. Styczynski’s laboratory. The supplied genetic sequence: pλR LacI R0011 RFP, transformed into E. coli cells, and then induced with incremental concentrations of IPTG,  would have been an optimal demonstration of the projected constructs. Unfortunately, results could not be successfully visualized. Therefore, methodology commenced with the transformation of standardized DH10-Beta cells with the RFP construct onto kanamycin and carbenicillin plates (received 1ng/uL minipreps in separate kan and carb resistant expression vectors). Once the transformants had successfully grown for 24 hours they were streaked to completion, a single colony was obtained the following day, and trials were run testing the potency of IPTG when indirectly inducing RFP expression. The antibiotic-LB stocks, containing cumulative IPTG concentrations, were made on-site (each time the experiment began) in 50 mL disposable centrifuge tubes in order to preserve the quality of IPTG outside its standard storage temperature. Concentrations of IPTG consisted of 0M, 10uM, 100uM, 500 uM and 1mM where the solvent was antibiotic-LB. The trials were examined in triplicate where each trial consisted of 5mL aliquots of each IPTG solution in individual culture tubes (five tubes/ trial); a fourth, control trial lacked cells and was solely composed of the cumulative IPTG concentrations in antibiotic-LB. In order to regulate the amount of cells placed in each experimental tube, 95uL of diH2O were pipetted into a microcentrifuge tube,  and a single colony was then transferred and briefly vortexed (one or two ""touches"") to evenly distribute the cells; 5uL of diH2O-cell solution was aliquoted into each experimental tube. The 95uL of diH2O measurement accounted for the 5uL placed into each experimental tube (15 tubes x 5uL/tube), as"
BIOTEC_Dresden,2010,Team:BIOTEC Dresden#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," competition as a member of the University of Alberta team last year. What I particularly like about iGEM is that biologists are challenged to think like engineers. To switch mindsets and consider cells instead as machines consisting of individual parts that can be assembled to create an organism with desired phenotypes and functions. By combining the well-established engineering principles with biology, I am certain there will be a new 'golden age' in the field of biology.

Kaj Bernhardt
I received B.A.(Hons) and M.Sci.(Hons) degrees in Natural Sciences (Biochemistry) from the University of Cambridge. As a graduate student in the Genomics Department of the Dresden University of Technology, I am interested in the biology of embryonic stem cells and their differentiation to distinct lineages during early development. My PhD project focuses on how differentiated cells are reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells by a few magic proteins.
As a student, I took part in iGEM 2006, and after being instructor to the Dresden iGEM team 2009, I am now trying to advise the 2010 team on their efforts as best as I can.
Johnson Madrid
I am a Biochemist by training and an Electron Microscopy specialist at the MPI-CBG Dresden, where I study the Mechanosensory transduction, structural and functional aspects of Neuronal networks in Drosophila. I had Industrial R&D exposure in my early days, which gave me an insight into synthetic biology, and its potential. The reason for me to join iGem was also to be with students who are not limited with their ideas and the kind of energy they put into you…its amazing! It’s an experience to understand the psychology of Individuals in an International group. I like biking, “cooking inter cultural dishes” and meeting new people in my free time.
Andrew Oates
I’m a group leader at the MPI-CBG in Dresden, where we study the molecular and cellular mechanisms of vertebrate segmentation.   To understand this complex system of coordinated biochemical oscillators we are integrating theoretical modeling with experimental approaches, such as real-time imaging in the zebrafish embryo. I think iGem is a great platform for young scientists to combine their scientific knowledge with engineering principles to generate and learn about novel biological systems. It is an exciting opportunity to aid these students through the creative process of generating product ideas and developing a well rounded project.

1. Gene clusterFor our gvp gene cluster we use the specificity primer form Walsby 2002 and add the necessary restriction sites that annealed these pieces of DNA have EcoRI and SpeI sticky ends. We use the vector psb4K5 because the uncoordinated expression of the entire gvpA/C cluster from its own constitutive promoter when carried on a high-copy number vector could result in the accumulation of lethal quantities of gas vesicle proteins in the host cells.Hence we use the low-copy number vector to ensure that the gene cluster can in the host to the normal expression.[3] so we use The vector pSB4K5 containing gvp gene cluster was cut with EcoRI and PstI and was ligated with B0015. ( Figure 4 5) After PCR inspection by using Specific primer we get the target fragment.

WHAT S GOING ON?
Termites are widely recognized as the fifth pest around the world, based on its astonishing number and incredible damage towards woods and infrastructure. There are termites all over the five continents. According to the experimental results of computer simulation, average per person holds 0.5 tons of termite resources. Given that a termite weighed 1 gram, then everyone around the world should own about 500 thousand termites! This is really a staggering number and it is the fact.
Wide Geographical Distribution
World Distribution
Termite is an ancient social insect in the world for about 0.13 billion years. They are now filling nearly every corner of the globe, from tropical regions to subtropical ones, which occupies 50% of the earth s area.

The datasets were downloaded in FASTQ format using fastq-dump tool in the SRA toolkit (v. 2.9.1). Documentation and details on how to use this packages can be found here . In general,                   the data from the study appears to show good general indices, with a good overall GC content, in the lower end of the expected 45-50% range of typical exome sequences (MacKinnon). At the same time, the large base size of around 100 times                   bigger than a typical human exome, showing good coverage of the reads.
Limitations of the Dataset
Before starting the analysis there are a few notes to point out about the use of this dataset. First, the accuracy of the genomic analysis highly depends on decoding the and subtracting the noise and artifacts generated during the sequencing                   protocol (Wang et al.). Furthermore, other characteristics, such as coverage, index adapters, number of flow-cells among other parameters are key to avoid false positives. The samples contained in the study PRJEB27635, have limited information                   about these characteristics"

Proudly exhibiting our poster in a dialog with other iGEM teams and researchers.
We were specifically happy to get to know the projects of former iGEM teams, as their presentations will serve us as great inspiration for our own presentation at the Giant Jamboree. The conversation with other iGEM teams from this year motivated us further as the iGEM thought was constantly present at the conference. All in all we are very thankful that we were able to participate in this well organized conference and visit Germanys biggest federal state Bavaria .
Jump of Joy at the third conference of Synthetic Biology in Landshut.
We also took a group photo with all participants of the convention, maybe you can spot every team member (not everyone is wearing the iconic yellow shirt). This picture also occurred in the BioSpektrum journal with a connection to the VAAM, which we know already quite well. We are happy to take part in the research of synthetic biology topics and hope to visit a similar conference soon again in the future.

Influencing the young minds faster than bacteria
Goettingen offers many possibilities for young scientists to enhance their lab skills and work together as a team. One of these is the XLAB where young students in the age of 17-22 have the opportunity to come together for a month and work in groups on current scientific topics. The future scientists pick up new lab skills and discuss issues, while exchanging their knowledge. This reminded us of our own iGEM project. We took the opportunity to present our topic and get in touch with the students and supervisors to gain some extra opinions on our progress.
Our group joins the XLAB students to give insights into our project.

Publication in the BIOspektrum
Sneak peak into the BIOspektrum article.
We had the exciting oppertunity to introduce our project to the public by publishing a short article in the Biospektrum journal. With that we not only gave further insights into our project, but we also expanded our audience from the general public to other scientists all over the country, gaining more and more publicity. This underlines that our topic is of enormous relevance particularly in the science community. We are even present on Researchgate as an official scientific team! This helps us big time in the progression of our careers."

Purification of Full-Length Arc and Minimal Arc Gag
Figure 1. A 15% SDS-PAGE gel of the Arc protein after purification with sucrose and cesium chloride gradients. The RMR002 protein ladder from genemark bio. was used. Lanes 5 and 6 are the purified fractions from the cesium Chloride gradient as seen around the 45kDa mark as expected, and Lanes 1 and 3 show the cell pellet and Lysate respectively.  These samples were then used for transmission electron microscopy.
Purification was also done with a sucrose cushion with size exclusion chromatography afterwards. However concentrations were too low and the gel came up as negative. The chromatogram can be seen below in Figure 2.
Figure 2. Chromatogram of the Arc full Size exclusion chromatography purification on the superdex 75 column. Although fractions were taken from the experiment, the protein amount was too low to be seen on the gel.
Figure 3. A 15% SDS-PAGE gel of the purification of Arc minimal construct first using a sucrose cushion followed by dialysis in 1XPBS and Size Exclusion Chromatography. The confirmed band is at about 40kDa indicating that Arc minimal construct is likely dimerizing.  From left to right Lanes 2-10 contain the elutions taken according to the histograms seen in Figure 2. In Lane 11 there is the sample that was dialyzed. Lane 12 contains the cell pellet and Lane 13 contains the crude fraction from the sucrose cushion.
Figure 4. Chromatogram of Arc minimal construct size exclusion chromatography purification on the superdex 75 purification column. Samples were taken at Fractions 7-10 (whereby the two peaks were isolated), 11-13, 19-20 and 23.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the presence of spherical nanoparticles in both the full-length M. musculus Arc protein and minimal Arc Gag protein samples. Even in the absence of RNA cargo, the Arc-derived PNCs were capable of self-assembly in vitro. In both samples, the average PNC diameter was approximately "

The media (compounds, thermo-conditions) will be manipulated to find the best condition(s) that satisfy the microorganisms to digest the target compounds and reach a good growth rate (say above threshold).
Week 5 (May 28 - June 1)
Decarboxylation
On Tuesday (May 29), a gel was run on the restriction digests of the extracted plasmids from Week 4, which appeared to confirm the successful transformation of the PetroBrick, showing clear bands at the pertinent locations. The gel is as follows:
Lane 1 contained the 1 kb plus ladder, while lanes 2-6 contained the restriction digest results, which had used the five different miniprep tubes with plasmids isolated from five different colonies. As can be observed in the gel, the upper row of bands corresponds to 2392bp, indicating the petrobrick part. The lower set of bands corresponds to the PetroBrick pSB1C3 vector at 2070 bp. These results suggest that the PetroBrick plasmid had been successfully purified. The black circle indicates undigested plasmid in lane 3. There simply means that not all of the plasmid was digested into two separate DNA strands. It indicates the entire size of our PetroBrick plasmid.
Based on the apparent success of the gel, the products were sent away for sequencing. Long-term stocks were prepared for the alkane production medium outlined in University of Washington's PetroBrick protocols from 2011 (see https://2011.igem.org/Team:Washington/alkanebiosynthesis ). These stocks are as follows:
1 L of 1M Tris (pH = 7.25)
10 mL of 1 mg/mL Thiamine
10 mL of 10% Triton x-100
1 M MgSO4
0.1 M FeCl3 (anhydrous)
The medium itself is to be prepared in Week 6 once the results of sequencing are (hopefully) acquired.
Ring Cleavage
This week we redid the previous assay with Pf-5 and butylcyclohexane using glass vials instead of falcon tubes.  These vials allowed for more surface and better containment of the volatile compound.  We carried out this assay using both LB and M9-MM.  After 24 hours we took OD600 readings and obtained similar results as last week.  The growth was considerably decreased in"

Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Public relations_-_-_TEXT.html," groups. Apart from questions about our study courses, how we manage our studies together with iGEM and the job opportunities after graduating, questions concerning SB and ethics came up. Below are some examples:
The audience
“What are your concerns about bioterrorism? What is done to prevent bioterrorism?”
“What were the winning projects from the last years?”
“Is it theoretically possible to build a smelling computer with synthetic biology?”
“Are there any disadvantages for european teams due to stricter laws?”
“What can be done with BioBricks apart from glowing bacteria?”
“Where should the boundaries for SB concerning ethics be set?”
""What kind of job do I get with knowledge in SB? And how does a working day will look like?!""
""How would you describe a typical working day in the lab during the competition?""
This morning in a local high school was an important experience for the high school students and also for us. We got some insights about what pupils think and are concerned about when discussing SB. Surprinsingly there were not so much concerns about our work as aspected, though the pupils already gave thought about general aspects of genetical engineering and SB. With the experience we gained we will improve our human practise work at the next big event we will be participating, the GENIALE , a one week science fair for all ages in Bielefeld. Further we promoted the open source principle behind iGEM, aroused some interest and hopefully prevented some fear when facing SB. All in all it was a great morning and as the public discussion is always an important part of iGEM, we encourage other teams to sometimes leave the lab and communiacte with the public.
We would like to thank Mr. Dirk Paul Stephan and the Ravensberger Gymnasium Herford for giving us the opportunity to hold our presentation as well as to visit and talk to the pupils.

UPF-CRG_Barcelona,2016,Team:UPF-CRG Barcelona#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"amine levels generally increase with inflammation. However, whether they are pro- or anti- inflammatory is still unclear. [1]
High polyamine levels alter histone acetylation and histone acetylases and deacetylases activities in proliferative cells.
Stark et al. [4] investigated whether CK2 was a target of polyamines by which they would modulate the MAPK pathway (Ras, Raf, MERK, Erk pathway). The authors suggested that CK2 could sense relative polyamine levels and translate the information to the MAPK pathway to trigger the appropriate cellular response. [1]
Figure 4: Polyamines functions
Sources
Three main sources for polyamines exist in organisms: Food intake, cellular synthesis, microbial synthesis in the gut. [1]
Food is an important source of polyamines. Polyamines in the intestinal lumen are absorbed quickly and distributed to all organs and tissues. Moreover, continuous intake of polyamine-rich food gradually increases blood polyamine levels. Therefore, the restricted intake of food polyamine and inhibition of polyamine synthesis by microbiota in the intestine with or without inhibitor-induced inhibition of polyamine synthesis is reported to have favorable effects on cancer therapy. [3]
In blood circulation, the majority of polyamines are contained in blood cells, especially in red and white blood cells, and therefore increases in blood polyamine concentration indicate concurrent increases in polyamine levels in blood cells.
Orally administered radiolabeled polyamines have been shown to be immediately distributed to almost all organs and tissues. [3]
Pathway
Polyamines are synthesized from the amino acids ornithine and methionine in animal cells, and lysine and arginine in the case of bacteria cells. The first step in the pathway is the production of ornithine from arginine by the mitochondrial enzyme arginase. Ornithine is then decarboxylated by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) to produce putrescine. In bacteria, another putrescine synthesis pathway exist from L-Arginine, which is converted into agmatine and then hydrolyzed into putrescine by the agmatine ureohydrolase (speB).  In parallel to putrescine production (in both bacteria and animal cells), L-methionine is converted into S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet), which is then decarboxylated by AdoMet decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) to produce decarboxylated AdoMet (DcAdoMet)."
NYU-AD,2016,Team:NYU-AD#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the food sample. If no shift occurs in the SLT migration pattern, this implies the absence of the toxin within the sample, and reflects the safety of the food.
In summary, we will be creating a portable device that would evaluate the safety of food by detecting a specific contaminant, Shiga-like toxin, for street vendors and restaurant owners and even government agencies to use and reassure consumers who rely heavily on their foods. Our device is designed to detect for the Shiga toxin in at most 45 minutes. This is quicker than the fastest laboratory detection method[4].
Initially, our target audience was the consumer, but as we developed our project, there were several factors such as affordability and accessibility that made it difficult for consumers to use the device. We hope that by providing a device that is more convenient and produces results faster than current detection methods, entities responsible for food safety regulation such as governmental agencies and even food vendors themselves will be motivated to take stronger action towards maintaining food safety.
Ideation Process
Before making our final decision, we explored an extremely diverse range of project topics such as blockage of oil pipes, controlling fruit ripening, detecting milk adulteration, biodegradable plastics, bioelectronics, preventing the coral reefs bleaching, bio-art, smoking, monitoring air quality, and more. After extensive research and intense discussion, we decided to move forward with the idea of detecting pathogenic SLT-producing E. coli in street foods. SLT is highly toxic due to its low LD50 and the A subunit’s protein synthesis inhibitory action, so it would have been too dangerous to work with given our lab environments. Keeping the validation process in mind, we decided to use only the SLT B subunit as our method of verification[5].
Gold Medal requirement: Improving a previous iGEM project
In addition to our main project, we have improved the characterization and validated the functionality of a previously submitted part by NYUAD iGEM team 2015. We have performed an Indole detection test to validate proper expression of indole of e.coli cells. Non-transformed cells were used as negative controls and pure indole solution served as positive control. Our experiment showed a highly significant colorimetric change corresponding to a high level synthesis of indole in transformed cells. Figures displaying this outcome and relevant protocols are shown both in our experiments and results pages.

25/8: Performed an anaerobic β-galactosidase assay in order to determine the level of interaction of OBP2A in the bacterial two hybrid vectors: pUT18 and pT25.
Aim of Experiment: Performed an anaerobic β-galactosidase assay of OBP2A in the bacterial two hybrid vectors: pUT18 and pT25. This is to determine the level of interaction that the smaller subunit of OBP2A has with its larger subunit in vivo. This particular assay has two positive controls, two negative controls and one regulatory control.
Protocols Used: β-galactosidase assay
Results: Figure 12
Next Steps: The results have shown that the two subunits of OBP2A in fact don't seem to be interacting in vivo - a possible reason for this might be aggregation of the two subunits preventing interaction. The  next stage of experimentation will be to test out the interaction when the subunit are switch in relation"

HebrewU / HujiGEM
Purpose of collaboration:
We collaborated with HebrewU in lab work and by hosting the team for a mini-jamboree.
Description:
In addition to our lab work, it was important for our team to contact other teams in the iGEM community.  Our team initially participated in the Synthetic Biology Conference at the Weizmann institute that inspire us to use and develop synthetic biology tools to address unsolved problems. Furthermore, a special session was devoted to the iGEM and we had the chance to hear and talk with previous iGEM team members and judges. We were very excited and encouraged about the achievements of previous iGEM teams. At this conference, we also met the HeberwU iGEM team the additional Israeli team participating in the 2018 iGEM contest. As the HeberwU is the first iGEM team of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem that was initiated by students, we reached out thier team members and help them how to build a iGEM team based on our university's iGEM experience and resources. From this point on, we had a constant and efficient collaboration with the HebrewU team.
We provided reagents, advised on how to organize the team, where to look for funding, and how to prioritize tasks according to the given timetable.  For example, the HebrewU team was unable to complete the Interlab task, as they were missing competent cells for the necessary transformations. We invited the HebrewU team to our lab and a team member was hosted by our team. We taught him\her the relevant protocol, and gave several Eppendorfs filled with competent cells Dh5a, so they were able to complete their Interlab task.
HebrewU organized a wonderful Safety Poem competition, to which we gladly added our submission:
This is not a song about safety, this is a song about love!
It's all started when you first wore your gloves
Small, nitrile, in the color of blue
That’s when I realized - I love you
The way that you said 'always use goggles'
Like warm LB my heart turned into a puddle
It's kinda funny how you read the MSD"

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Future#Economic potential analysis_-_-_TEXT.html," early                 stage of the development process in order to satisfy a mass market. (10) In order to commercialize the device, there should also be thought off patenting                 the invention. The Bayh–Dole-inspired legislation made this possible for                 universities and was adopted by many countries in their national regulation. (9)
There comes a time when you can not do everything on your own anymore,                 especially in an industry where multiple disciplines overlap and different                 competences are needed. The interdisciplinary aspect is one way                 to explain the search for the right strategic partner to forge an alliance with.                 The reduction of technological uncertainty in the early phases of a project                 could be a second reason for collaboration with a partner from industry. (10) This will make the search for potential investors a lot easier and reduce the                 time-to-market for the application. This is also often the phase where a                 university spin-off is created, which acts like an independent business.

Anecdotal evidence states that it is very hard to become profitable as a company                 from the start. However the goal of taking market share by aiming at a niche market is                 a much more realistic objective than reaching a positive cash flow. Once this is                 obtained, the company will be considered as an interesting investment for the                 big medical device companies which will be eager to take over the company.                 However if the ultimate goal of market share is not reached, the company will                 not generate a breakthrough and succumb rapidly. (13)

Board Game
We designed a board game called ""Divide and Contaminate"" to highlight key concepts in synthetic biology. The goal of the player is to populate a tile-based board with a special strain of E. coli, adapted to the unknown environment of the tiles. We hope that players, especially younger ones, will appreciate the concepts of modularity, metabolic burden and the impact genes have on cell physiology. These concepts are key to grasping more complicated concepts in synthetic biology for younger people and may get them interested in or aware of the potential of synthetic biology. The rules as well as printable components for the game are available in a PDF below. Rules and Pieces
Socio-ethics Discussion
In response to the need for dealing with bio-ethical considerations of our project, we hosted a socio-ethics discussion in collaboration with the synthetic biology society at Imperial College London. We discussed the socio-ethical implications of synthetic biology as a field, as well as with specific regard to our project. There was a considerable audience turnout (more than a hundred) at the event. We had our team split up to engage in socio-ethics discussions with groups of audiences over pizza and beer. We were able to gather many perspectives on our project as a result of this discussion and will put it to good use integrating it in our project. Notably, biocontainment was raised as a huge concern among members of the audience. Some of the thoughts and questions by the audience for feedback are available below.

Socio-ethical concerns on our project and synthetic biology
Ethics primer for the audiences As scientists, we are often focused on the theoretical and experimental implications of new advances in science and can overlook the socio-ethical impact of said advances. This has led to public push-back against certain advances in science such as with the implementation of GMOs, vaccines and climate science. As a relatively new field, it is important to consider these socio-ethical aspects asking whether synthetic biology projects can improve lives, especially since public funding for technology is highly dependent on public approval.

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Overview

Curve Fitting
Sensitivity
We decided to create a model of the CRISPRi system for two main reasons:
Identifying the parts of the network that could be targeted by our lab team to improve repression efficiency
To approximate time-series mecA repression data for use in modelling the overall vulnerability of a S. aureus population
Model Formation
After a literature review we were able to construct the CRISPR interference system network. The targeted single guide RNA (sgRNA) associates with nuclease-deficient Cas9 protein (dCas9) to form a complex that binds with the DNA complementary to the sgRNA target (Qi et al., 2013). The bound complex prevents transcription elongation by RNA polymerase, repressing YFP mRNA expression (Bikard et al., 2013). The chemical network is shown below:
Using standard mass-action kinetics, the network simplifies into the following set of differential equations:
We chose the model kinetics to be largely first-order; this decision was supported by the findings of several recent studies (Sternberg et al., 2014, Qi et al., 2013). To simplify the model, we assumed that the formation of the dCas9-sgRNA complex is in made a quasi-steady-state. That is, we assume that the association/dissociation of dCas9 and sgRNA occurs on a faster timescale than the other reactions in the network (i.e. transcription, translation and the binding of the complex to the DNA), allowing us to assume that the complex is always at steady-state, relative to the other time-dependent species concentrations. This same assumption was made in previous modelling efforts, e.g. (UCSF 2013).
Under this quasi-steady state assumption, the differential expression for the complex is given by:
Our model then simplifies to:
This is the same assumption made by previous teams.

3.16 Plan of Attack
1. Primary ideas
Direct evolution method
Separation method: ultracentrifugation sedimentation with sucrose gradient, size exclusion chromatography, TEM
Environment that would hasten evolution?
Limit nutrient as Dr. Kooyman suggested – affect host more than phage?
Different strains of E Coli – will phage still infect?
Selected phage can self replicate – storage
Purified product and DNA sequence can direct further engineering for drug delivery purpose (protein team’s job)
Site-directed mutagenesis
Identifying sites to mutate
Modeling: compare CP and scaffolding protein sequence of similar phage that has slightly different size, deduce from this possible sites that can be mutated to produce smaller phage
Capsid production
Introduce genes into E coli for expression and assembly – producing a novel machine that is not naturally found
How many genes to introduce into E coli?
Stability?
In vitro assembly?
Has been done with T7 genome in E coli extract (no cell)
Site directed mutagenesis of a genome (40kbp)
Our parts would be plasmid introduced into E coli, but capsid produced this way won’t need extracting DNA/RNA from capsid to make an empty carrier
2. Refined plans
Get the E coli and T7/Q beta to grow
Test with different Agar concentration – see if selection method works (evolution)
Sequencing if evolution occurs
Compare genome to find targets for point mutation
Playing around with phage genome
Knocking out the polymerase
Change genome size - experiment – could go bigger or smaller

Then we need a COSHH for pyocyanyn. SOP form was not completed. We need to fill it in with our protocols.  Dry lab: exercised on COMSOL again. Alberto spoke with Dr. Andrea Fantuzzi (electrochemist in 7th floor in SECB), he liked the setup but he's worried about the material of the electrode (silver can react with Cl to form AgCL which causes cytotoxicity). However, overall he seemed excited. Free cell free stuff from TXTL cell free.

In the morning, we completed the BIO1 form and all the relevant SOP forms for biosafety. The dry lab team made progresses in the modelling. Basic deterministic TXTL is running, reasonably simplified. Start working on a stochastic model as well. We are still waiting for the electrochemistry package in COMSOL. Wet lab managed to get hold to a new vector that converts Golden gate into BioBricks (developed by Marko, a researcher in Geoff Baldwin's Lab). We have ordered Pyocyanin, petri dishes, glycerol, ethanol, and most importantly primers.

1.2 BsaI Digestion
MaSp ICA Fragments
Iterative Capped Assembly (ICA) requires 50 ng of fragment for each extension cycle.
DNA Amplification
Starting from fully sequenced plasmids, DNA can be amplified in two ways.
PCR Amplification
Amplify 220 pg of each plasmid in a 50 uL reaction with VF2 and VR primers (the biobrick sequencing primers) and using Q5 polymerase and the GC enhancer. Set up 8x 50 uL reactions.
Anneal at 63 C, using 18 cycles.
Pool all 8 reactions together, and PCR purify
Maxiprep (Cloning Amplification)
Streak the glycerol stocks on chloramphenicol plates, and grow overnight at 37 C.
Pick one colony per construct into 100 mL liquid culture. Grow overnight at 37 C.
Harvest and prepare cells according to Qiagen Maxiprep protocol.
BsaI Digestion
Use 4 uL NEB BsaI in a 50 uL reaction to digest either:
1.0 to 1.5 ug of PCR amplified MaSp.
5 ug of whole plasmid.
Digest at 50 C for 2 hrs, then heat kill at 65 C for 20 min.
Run all of the digest mixture on 1.8% gel for purification.
Excise 102 bp band, and use Qiagen Kit to gel extract.
The extracted pieces can be used in ICA later on."
UCLA,2014,Team:UCLA#Project#Customizing Silk_-_-_TEXT.html," two different silk monomers, Major Ampullate Spidroin 1 (MaSp1) and 2 (MaSp2).  The MaSp1 monomer contributes strength to spider silk while the MaSp2 contributes more flexibility. [4] As a proof of principle we hope to show that by assembling these two repeats into one protein at different ratios, we can create silk with a spectrum of strength and extensibility.
Fig 2: Variations of the MaSp1 amino acid sequences between different spider species [6]
Iterative Capped Assembly
Assembling spider silk monomers such as MaSp1 and MaSp2 together can prove to be rather difficult. Due to the repetitiveness of our silk monomers, common techniques such as Gibson assembly and direct synthesis of a full-length gene product could be ineffective and less efficient in building silk sequences. Therefore, a technique called iterative capped assembly (ICA), which allows rapid assembly of repeating monomers, would be a better option in working with our highly repetitive sequences. This technique has previously been applied in order to assemble other repetitive modules.  For example, ICA has been demonstrated to efficiently assemble very repetitive transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) up to 21 monomers long [5] .
ICA allows the assembly of silk monomers in different ratios and orders into a custom gene sequence of modifiable length. Gene monomers are assembled individually into a growing chain that is anchored to a solid foundation through streptavidin-biotin interaction.
Silk monomers for ICA were built using PCR to attach BsaI recognition site onto the MaSp sequences, as well as different end extensions in the form of 4bp overhang that is essential for ligation. BsaI is a type IIs endonuclease that cleaves outside the recognition site and therefore generates overhangs that are still part of the native silk sequence. This leaves our digested products, or building blocks, free of any remaining recognition site, which is usually formed with other types of restriction enzymes.

For the third year in a row the German Ministry of Research and Education invited all German iGEM Teams to join the "" Biotechnology 2020+ conference "" in Berlin on June 27th. “Which products and biotechnological processes are fundamental? “, “How will the next generation accept the biotechnological processes?” and “Which projects are already initiated?”. Experts in the fields economy, politics and science and the German iGEM teams came together at the conference and tried to answer these questions. In his speech, Dr. Helge Braun (parliamentary State Secretary of the BMBF) emphasized that a creative teamwork with an own developed ""language"" is necessary. He introduced the new biotechnological ideas: biological implants, biomimetic desalination plants and microbial fuel cells. In the first discussion round about the topic “result of the previous activities and action recommendations for the continuation of the initiative ""Biotechnology 2020+ conference"", five ambassadors of five research institutions (Frauenhofer Society, Helmholtz Association, Max-Planck Society, Leibniz Association, TU Braunschweig) (see figure 5) presented their recently implemented ideas: printable biotechnology, cell-free bioproduction and synthesis of novel therapeutics. Exemplarily Prof. Dr. H. Jäckle (Max-Planck-Community) introduced the research network for Synthetic Biology MaxSynbio. The second discussion treated the subject ""Open Source in the Biotechnology”. After the presentation there were workshops on the topic “On the way to a Biotechnology 2020+”. Additionally the German iGEM projects 2013 were exhibitied (see Figure 6) and the five research institutions presented their recent research projects.
Figure 7: Biotechnology 2020+ Conference of the Ministry of Research and Education: exhibition of the German IGEM projects 2013
In summary the participation informed us about the practicable operated novel biotechnology ideas. It enabled our cooperations and gave us an insight into projects from market-leading research institutions in Germany. Furthermore we got in contact with other iGEM teams which paved the way for an iteration of the German iGEM day.

iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.

Starting from an agar plate containing a Candida genomic library, we add 1 mL of LB medium and we mix it. Then, the mix was transferred into a tube. We stored part of the culture in glycerine and another part (200 μL) was mixed with 5 mL of LB media and Amp (2:1000).
The tube containing the genomic library was grown at 28°C for 1 hour. Then, we made minipreps.
The electrophoresis gel shows that the colony PCR failed, even the control did not work. Additionally, we test the BbsI restriction enzyme and we found that it does not cut well.

June
Week 1
In the first week of June we observed the laboratory. We made a list of materials that we need for future wetlab activities. We prepared LB medium, searched the antibiotic optimization method and made competent cells using CCMB 80 buffer. We also sterilized all of the equipment needed. We already decided our idea that is  engineer bacteria that can degrade plastic. Previously, we had four main ideas:
1. Microalgae biofuel
2. Synthetic bacteria that can degrade plastic
3. Urine bio-sensor
4. Cyanide bio-sensor
After competent cells were ready and antibiotic optimization had done then we had plan to try re-hydrated some parts and transform it to our Escherichia coli DH5α competent cells. We also had decided our  construct so we would ready to order some synthetic parts and ordered it to iGEM HQ especially for some parts that not provided in the 2014 parts.
Week 2
This was our first time to see the iGEM distribution kit plate which was so exciting. We would make a trial to transform iGEM 2013 distribution kit using our competent cells. That transformation was not good on first, second, and third  trial. Then we concluded that we must try the iGEM distribution kit plate 2014. We also tried to test our competent cells efficiency and we did not face any problem with our competent cells.
Week 3
Finally, we re-hydrated parts from iGEM kit plate 2014 which had many copies to make sure our method was optimal enough to transform those iGEM parts. We had already a plan to make four systems for our"

I also began to learn HTML5 with OpenClassrooms. It is pretty easy for the moment, but that is only because I didn’t go into CSS3 yet. The most difficult part of HTML5 is, it seems, to address correctly the pictures/links etc. This is all about organisation, but I think it’ll be fine.  Lionel Bastard came at the end of the day. It surprised him that I did not want a lens in my device, but 1 cm gap between the sensor and the sample eventually convinced him that it might be not necessary. I still follow the same strategy to not use a lens at first and see later if I really need one. Actually this will be largely determined by the solid angle: this is what will tell me if I chose wisely my sensor. He also advised me to use a monopixel sensor, or a photodiode. Another primordial point is to calculate the noise to signal ratio. To do so I’ll have to test my light source on a LB sample (no bacteria in it) and see “how much” light my sensor can detect. To improve this ratio, he advised me to add another emission filter, to improve the noise attenuation.
05/31/2018
I found 1cm x 1cm photodiodes with good sensibility. I still need to test my current sensor to make sure it does not suit. This will be done tomorrow.  I kept on learning HTML5/CSS3.

Let’s summary everything that has been done since last time.
→ I tested the sensor again: it really does not suit at all, it sucks. It cannot sense fluorescence light. Another sensor has to be found: a photodiode. I ordered one with a large sensor surface and a relatively good responsivity (I cannot compare it to the 1st sensor as its graph is normalised but I expect it to be better)
→ A drawback of the photodiode can be its dark current. The 1st idea was to measure beforehand the light power from fluorescence. It seems easy stated like that but it is actually not, as a light power is usually measured in lux instead of watts which corresponds to the responsivity curve of a photodiode.
→ The previous issue should be solved with the conditioning circuit:

The next company that we visited was LifeCell International, India’s first stem cell bank. Although our project did not have any connections with stem cells or any of its related fields, we managed to impress them with our idea so much that even they decided to sponsor us .
Next, we went to the Center for Medical Genetics, a non-profit, service-oriented professional genetic testing laboratory and presented our idea to its Medical Director and his colleagues. At the end of our presentation they mentioned that they were extremely happy to see undergraduate  students take up such projects and attempting to bring a change in the world of biotechnology. They extended their support to us by funding our project
Finally, we went to Saksin Lifesciences Pvt Ltd and presented our idea to the CEO and President, Dr Ramchand. We then spent the entire day at their facility, of which they gave us a tour. Although they did not financially fund us, they granted permission to use their facilities for any equipment that was  not available in our college, and it was because of them that we were able to carry out some important experiments.

Problems with Current Pest Control Techniques
Small Molecule Pesticides
Small molecule pesticides or bio-pesticides are unconventional pesticides that use substances which make up, or are produced, by plants and animals. Examples of these bio-pesticides include pheromones, enzymes, hormones, and even micro-organisms as a method of pest control [2]. These types of pesticides are excellent alternatives to traditional chemical pesticides. Advantages of this type of pesticide include low inherent-toxicity to target and non-target organisms, low persistence in the environment, and low likelihood of selecting for pest resistance [2]. Disadvantages of bio-pesticides include a typically slower mortality rate for the pests as well as a higher susceptibility to variable environmental conditions [3]. There is also an issue of properly storing pesticides that are made out of biomolecules. One of the most well-known examples of small molecule pesticides is DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane). Short term studies have shown that the potential benefits outweighed the risks. However, the stability of DDT, persistence in the environment, accumulation in adipose tissue, and potential estrogenic properties raise concerns over long term use. Accumulation through the trophic levels leads to adverse side effects such as thinning of falcon eggshells, leading to population decline [4].
Biological Pest Control
Biological pest control involves the use of natural predators against pests. In many cases, the pests are invasive species which have escaped from their natural ecosystem. When the natural predator of the pest is not present, the pest has the opportunity to proliferate without control [5]. Natural predators are then imported after pre- and post-release testing is done. Pre-release testing involves testing the natural predator to ensure it will not take over and proliferate in the ecosystem itself, as well as non-target testing to ensure beneficial species will not be targeted"

3-D Design – DAEDALUS
DAEDALUS: DNA Origami Sequence Design Algorithm for User-defined Structures
This free online resource is developed and maintained by the Laboratory for Computational Biology & Biophysics at MIT, which is directed by Professor Mark Bathe.
Unlike Cadnano2, DAEDALUS uses a top-down approach to designing DNA 3D nanostructures. First the user generates a three-dimensional polygon structure. DAEDALUS, which utilizes MatLab to run its programming code, takes into account the number of edges and vertices. Calculates the length of the edges. Next, the user defines and uploads the scaffold DNA sequence and the number of base pairs that marks the length of each edge. Daedalus program will automatically generate the staples DNA sequences for folding the scaffold DNA. Figure 5 shows the finished product. Grey strands are the scaffold DNA (M13mp18) and blue strands show the DNA staples that binds to the scaffold.
Our DAEDALUS design starts with an octahedron. Our scaffold sequence is ssDNA circular M13mp18 and is 7249 base pairs long. We linearlized it using a 30nt oligonucleotide sequence that complements an unused region of the M13mp18 sequence. This creates a restriction endonuclease cut site, BsrBI, for that 30nt stretch. We then digest using BsrBI (NEB) to linearlize the circular ssDNA to a linear ssDNA. To fold this linear ssDNA into the three-dimensional octahedron nanoparticle, 36 unique DNA staples were added into the folding reaction mix.
 
Figure 5: DAEDALUS workflow. (A) Unlike cadnano2, the user starts with a target geometry. In our case, an octahedron. (B) Next, the program provides a fully automatic sequence design followed by a three-dimensional view of your DNA-based nanoparticle. (C) This last image shows the scaffold strand in grey and the individual staples strand in blue.
 
Afterwards, DAEDALUS provides the option to generate molecular models of the DNA nanoparticle through Chimera ver 1.11.2. Chimera program is designed by the University of California – San Francisco. Daedalus will provide a .PDB file required by Chimera. UCSF Chimera is commonly used by bioinformaticians to generate molecular models of protein structures.

Fig.5 The fluorescence microscopy result of reporter gene, triggered by α factor in MATα yeast supernatant.
Compared with the Non-Induction group, the EGFP intensity inside the yeast gets more and more stronger from the 1h group to 5h group. And, more and more yeast cells in sight finish the process of mating: stretching out mating projection or can say “shmoo,” and then contacting and fusing between mating partners.
But when time goes to 6h, we can see that, basically the EGFP protein particles in sight are all distributed outside the yeast cell. We suppose that those EGFP protein particles are excreted by yeast cells for preparing to enter ascospore period.
Time scale of EGFP expression upon induction of α factor
Similar to the experiment above, we set different culture group and time to measure the time scale of EGFP expression. The sample order is as follow:
Table 1. The set of experiment group
Fig.6 Fig.6a to Fig.6i demonstrate the FCS result of yeast culturing from 9h to 1h.
As can be seen from Fig.5 and Fig.6, we can see clear distribution between the induction group and non-induction group. As for the expression time scale, the supernatant induction group reached the peak at 6h while the MATα yeast induction group maintain at a rather high level starting from 3h.
Fig.7 The average EGFP intensity of each groups.
The above result indicate that the reporter plasmid could function as expected by responding to upstream signal in pheromone pathway, thus could be used to modify yeast to target histamine.
The induce of modified yeast with histamine
After successfully transformed the plasmid ADH1-HRH4-Ter and pFUS1-EGFP into CEN.PK2-1c ura3::far1 his2::sst2 trp3::ste2 △ura3 Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we had already finished the modification process of yeast. Now it’s time to test whether our diagnostic yeast works! Based on our previous design, the modified yeast could respond to different ratio of histamine in environment at corresponding EGFP expression level. At meantime, the protein expression rate is also influence by culturing time after first induction. Due to the modelling, the higher the histamine concentration is, the faster yeast will respond and so is the protein degradation"
