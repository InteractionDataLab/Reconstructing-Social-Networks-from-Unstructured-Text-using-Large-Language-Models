UChile_Biotec,2017,Team:UChile Biotec#HP#Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," that the method of toxin detection currently used in our country is very slow and expensive: being three days implies that the extracted products that cannot be approved until the duration of the test will be rotten. To this, we must add the location of these laboratories, one in Quellón and another in Santiago so that usually the waiting time turns out to be longer.
Actual process of extracting analysis samples
Everyday samples are taken from one of the fishing coves in Chiloé. First, around 9 am the inspector arrives to the place and gets into the fisherman’s boat, then he keeps some seafood in a mesh and takes it to the processing plant. There the seafood is placed in a pool, where a worker comes and takes a little sample. Then, the sample is washed and labeled, and finally sent to the laboratory where it will be studied. It travels in a big truck, and it has to pass by the Chacao channel by ferry.
In the laboratory, a solution of seafood extract is injected into a mouse. If the mouse dies, then marine toxins are present in the samples, and they have to alert the Seremi. It takes at least 3 days, as we said before, to get the result and they use hundreds of mice in a month, which leads to ethical and economic problems.
Another factor to consider is that there are several institutions in charge of watching over the red tide. However, and as noted in the interviews, there was a contradiction in the information thrown by each of these. Here we leave an infographic of the institutions involved.
Making the device
Our purpose as a team was designing a device that responded to the real requirements of the users: Chiloé’s fishermen. According to the user-based product design methodology, we decided to make a research in Los Lagos, interviewing people related to the detection of marine toxins. With the information (lifestyle, behavior, environment) we made a conceptual proposal, being careful with the ergonomy.
The device is easy to use, intuitive, with few parts, and an adequate size, because it must be understood by all the fishermen or every person who needs to know if there’s red tide.That’s why the design is available to be printed in 3D. It has a tray for the lyophilized system, a mortar for grinding the sample, the buffer and a dropper. We hope that the set will be available in retail stores or supermarkets, because the associated cost must be cheap, using materials with low ecological impact.
Our device is shown on the Home of our wiki! (click on the arrow for more surprises!). Now we leave"

Features
Our app works on both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa . We recommend trying it out - the usage instructions below detail how to set it up if you're unfamiliar with the platforms or just want more help. Our app can currently lookup parts and iGEM teams or lead you step-by-step through protocols.
One of the most important features is that it makes you feel like you’re in Star Trek .
Hands free
Being hands free eliminates the need to touch surfaces such as phone screens or keyboards. This reduces the contamination risk, especially while handling biologically hazardous materials. This in turn improves biosafety, but also means you’re less likely to  contaminate your own experiment.
Not requiring books or laptops frees up space on the lab bench. This means you are less likely to knock over tubes when leaning over to look something up (trust us, we’ve done it)!
Integration with existing services
It sources parts data from iGEM’s Registry of Standard Biological Parts API, uses Protocat (Michigan Software 2014-2017 iGEM) for protocols and iGEM’s teams API.

Peking,2010,Team:Peking#Project#Bioabsorbent#FacilitationModule_-_-_TEXT.html,"C. Adapted from [1]
(1) merP
merP is a 72-amino acid periplasmic protein. It is processed from a 91-amino acid precursor by removal of a signal sequence by an energy-dependent process [1]. Structural studies have indicated that merP functions as a monomer and binds a single Hg (II) ion via its two cysteine residues at positions 14 and 17. Because of the quite ancient and wildly disseminated motif, merP is thought to play part in both membrane transiting and cell interior trafficking of metal cations.
Based on a comparison with other bacterial periplasmic binding, protein-dependent transport system, it has been proposed that Hg (II) diffused across the outer membrane. However, the inner membrane of bacteria is impenetrable for Hg (II). The Hg (II) in the periplasm then binds merP by the two cysteine residues. The Kd of fully reduced merP for Hg (II) is 3.7 uM, indicating that the binding affinity of MerP to Hg(II) is high enough. Factors including pH and oxidized level of the environment may influence the function of MerP.
（2）merT
As discussed above, merP binds Hg (II) via two cysteine residues. It it hypothesized based on the structure analysis that merP hands off the bound Hg(II) ion to the cysteine pair in the first transmembran e helix of MerT, so let’s see the structure and function of MerT.
merT is a 116-residue inner membrane protein[1]. By analysis of its structure, it is predicted that merT has three transmembrane motif, of which the first one can receive the Hg(II) from merP via a cysteine pair. This cysteine pair is accessible to the periplasmic side. The second pair of cysteines in MerT is predicted to lie on the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane between the second and the third transmembrane helices. It is hypothesized that this cysteine pair is used to transfer Hg (II) to the cytoplasmic MerA, which is the main reduction agent.
(3) merC
For a long time, merC is considered to be of no use in the resistance to Hg (II) because mutations that affect the expression of MerC did not affect the resistance. The discovery in Thipobac"
BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html,"Fluigi is a powerful algorithm that takes a MINT description of a microfluidic chip, and from this description it outputs a microfluidic chip design. This tool is analogous to a place and route tool for a circuit schematic, allowing for complicated designs to be specified and then realized. Fluigi takes in a MINT specification, and outputs design schematics in the form of SVG’s for CNC mill fabrication, and EPS files for photolithography.
We integrated the MINT file type, along with the Fluigi compiler into Neptune. As a standalone tool Fluigi can be pretty daunting to navigate, requiring shell scripting experience and a solid software background. We eliminated all difficulty from Fluigi by integrating Neptune as a user interface for Fluigi. Users can compile their MINT files through Neptune, and Fluigi will in turn provide the designer feedback in a console. Design errors and design status is all fed back to Neptune. All in all, we integrated Fluigi with Neptune, providing a robust and easy to use UI for editing and compiling MINT files.
Choosing Mechanical System | Zach Lasiuk
Analyzed the pitfalls and advantages of both the rack and pinion system as well as the piston rod system. In order to properly choose a system for Neptune, the overall goals of Neptune were called to mind: Low cost, easy to use, and modular. With these design goals in mind, the piston rod system was ultimately chosen to ensure accuracy, modularity, and the ability to dispense very small to very large amounts of liquid with a feedback control active.
Designing Electrical System | Zach Lasiuk
Focusing in on the overall goals of Neptune’s hardware (low cost, easy to use, and modular), the Arduino Mega was chosen to control Neptune’s hardware. Because Neptune is inherently modular to change with synthetic biologists needs, Neptune’s electronic control circuitry must be equally as modular and scalable. The electronic system is comprised of power inputs, stackable Arduino motor controller shields, an Arduino Mega, and various headers and capacitors to make the system respond appropriately.
Mapping Mechanical Motion & Constant Flow Rate Equation | Zach Lasiuk
In order to accurately control Neptune’s hardware, the mechanical motion of the servo and syringe paring must be completely defined. Therefore, the equation for off-center piston-rod motion was derived. An inherent characteristic of the piston rod mechanical system is a non-linear response from the syringe pump being controlled. Based on where the servo arm is in its circular path of motion, the syringe pump will move different amounts with the same change in theta of the servo arm. This problem was overcome"

Discovery of the zinc finger protein
Jonathon Miller, A. D. McLachlan, and Sir Aaron Klug first identify the repeated binding motif in Transcription Factor IIIA and are the first to use the term ‘zinc finger.'
First crystal structure of a zinc finger
Carl Pabo and Nikola Pavletich of Johns Hopkins University solve the crystal structure of zif268, now the most-commonly studied zinc finger. This paved the way for construction of binding models to describe how zinc fingers bind to DNA, setting the foundation for future custom engineering of zinc finger proteins.
CEO Edward Lanphier founds Sangamo Biosciences
Edward Lanphier leaves Somatix Therapy Corporation and makes a deal for exclusive rights to the work of Srinivan Chandrasegaran of Johns Hopkins University who combined the Fok I nuclease with zinc fingers.
Srinivasan Chandrasegaran publishes work on fusing the Fok I nuclease to zinc fingers
By attaching nuclease proteins to zinc fingers, a new genome editing tool was created. The DNA-binding specificity of zinc fingers combined with the DNA-cutting ability of nucleases opened up possibilities for future research in gene therapy by allowing researchers to directly modify the genome though use of zinc finger nucleases.
Sangamo enters the public sector
In April 2000, five years after its founding, Sangamo Biosciences goes public offering 3.5 million shares at a starting value of $15 per share.
Sangamo patents zinc finger nuclease technology
Sangamo's patent, titled ""Nucleic acid binding proteins (zinc finger proteins design rules)"", ensures that any use or production of zinc fingers with attached nucleases"

Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher, public, environmental safety? Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
With regards to the experimental work that our fabrication team is doing in the laboratory, our project involves the creation of non-pathogenic, transgenic microorganisms for the purpose of studying how multiple biological “parts” inserted into an organism interact with one another.  The parts involved are mainly fluorescent reporter proteins and are present in nature or slightly modified with degradation tags, which are not known to pose risks to researchers, the public, or the environment.  The organisms used - Escherichia coli (DH5α-T1R and TOP10) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (BY4741, BY4733, W303a, INVSc) - are common laboratory strains and are considered safe when used according to laboratory good practice standards.  Any new BioBrick parts or devices that we will submit will be composed of fluorescent proteins and degradation tags, and will again pose no known risks.  Even alterations to our systems, from mutations or other sources, would be unlikely to create safety concerns.
For our in silico work, the design team is characterizing the ways that biological parts interact to achieve more successful assembly. Although these efforts are intended for benevolent purposes, there is always the chance that they could facilitate malicious bioengineering as well.  Like other synthetic biologists, we choose to proceed in a spirit of public beneficence and responsible stewardship, pursuing useful outcomes while remaining watchful for potential misuses of our efforts.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Our work is overseen by the Virginia Tech Environmental Health and Safety Office (EHS) and adheres to its Chemical Hygiene Plan and Biosafety for Laboratory Workers. To ensure that our wet laboratory team members are following EHS biosafety policies they have received the following training:
VBI Health and Safety Orientation: biosafety levels, University Health and Safety Policy 1005, dress code and required practices for laboratory personnel, Material Safety and Data sheets, Biosafety Level 2 Lab-Specific Manual, Personal Protective Equipment

THE IDEA
Our aim in this part of the project is to detect when the yeast starts fermenting. At the end of the project we will be able to “ask”  the yeast if there is still any glucose in the medium or not through the addition of H2O2. Furthermore, we will be able to know for how long the media has been running out of  glucose. In conclusion, this project allows us to know how much time has elapsed since the fermentation began.
To do this, we are going to use two gene constructions:
• The ADH2 promoter is fused to the YAP1 protein coding sequence. The YAP1 protein is a yeast transcription factor regulator of H2O2 adaptive response. It is stored in the cytoplasm in normal conditions and, in the presence of H2O2, it is transported to the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor. The ADH2 promoter is activated in the absence of glucose.
Thus, complete disappearance of glucose triggers the production of YAP1 in the cytoplasm, and YAP1 concentration increases if the lack of glucose continues. Notice that we are working with a delta-yap1 mutant strain as a recipient of our construct.
• The TRR promoter is fused to the GFP (Green Fluorescence Protein) coding sequence. The green fluorescent protein can be detected by fluorescent emission. The tiorredoxin reductase promoter is activated by two transcriptional factors, YAP1 and SKN7 in the oxidative form. Both of them can only bind to the promoter if H2O2 has been previously added to the culture medium.

E. coli XL1 red-aided mutagenesis of plasmid DNA
For the analysis of important residues in a protein of interest (e.g. protein interaction surface, catalytic site) a random mutagenesis approach can be very helpful. One method for randomly inserted mutations in a gene is the error-prone PCR. The E. coli XL1-Red-aided DNA mutagenesis is a very good tool for random mutagenesis of genes, which have been already inserted into vector. Nevertheless, for very small genes (less than 100 bp) or if multiple changes are desired the error-prone PCR is recommended.
The strain XL1-Red is deficient for three of the primary DNA repair pathways. The mutS (error- prone mismatch repair), mutD (deficient in 3´- to 5´-exonuclease of DNA polymerase III) and mutT (unable to hydrolyze 8-oxodGTP) are affected by mutations introduced into the XL1-Red strain. The random mutation rate in this triple mutant strain was measured to be ~ 5,000-fold higher than that of the wild type (Greener & Callahan, 1994; Greener et al., 1997). The mutated DNA repair pathways are especially important during replication. Therefore, it is very important to achieve a certain generation time to allow the emergence of mutations. For high-copy- number plasmids overnight growth (30 generations) results in approximately one base change per 2,000 nucleotides. For a gene with a size of 2 kb every single clone should contain one point mutation and for a gene that is 1 kb half of the clones will harbor a mutation. This should be considered for the experimental setup. Low-copy vectors or vectors containing very small inserts should be propagated for additional generations. The culture may be diluted for continued growth until stationary phase is reached. Mutations achieved by this method were transitions, transversions, and 1-bp insertions.
The E. coli XL1-Red strain grows extremely slowly in rich media (e.g. LB medium), having a doubling time of ~ 90 – 120 minutes. Additionally, the XL1-Red mutator strain should not be propagated on plates for prolonged periods of time. The rapid mutation rate affects the chromosome, and after prolonged growth, the subsequent colonies are probably not genetically identical to"
Pasteur_Paris,2016,Team:Pasteur Paris#Scenario_-_-_TEXT.html," They were all in a panicked state of survival. Everything was changing around them. The economy was also impacted by this Zika scare. A number of suppliers refused to travel to these states, therefore, import/export of goods came to a screeching halt. Not to mention, no one was eager to visit states so tourism drastically declined. People were too afraid! The entire vibe of the states was rapidly declining…the BIG cowboy Texas spirit was over and the artists/hippies scenery in New Mexico was not attracting visitors. Since Senator Smith leaked the news about the fabricated data, The Mos(kit)o company appeared to be at fault for developing a system incapable of accurately reporting data. The director of The Mos(kit)o company decided to send a team of experts to set more traps to determine what went wrong. There were traps everywhere. When the results arrived, there was no sign of any infected mosquitos, therefore, no vector-borne viruses in these states. Six months after the initial scare: Senator Smith is now President of the United States and he had to share the news that this was an unwarranted scare…there had been no cases of infections due to vector-borne transmitted diseases in Texas or New Mexico. The few cases that were reported in Florida were all under control and no new cases had been reported. Basically, the country was safe. However, the worse part of what he had to report was a direct reflection of his actions. He had to announce that the country was safe when he knew that all along. He knew he was the cause of everything that happened.

The activity of the tagged xylE and xylT proteins will be compared to that of the wild type xylE and xylT, respectively, using spectroscopy methods. A final BioBrick construct containing LS and tagged versions of xylE and xylT will be assembled to test localization of the proteins within the MC. A simple assay to verify co-localization will be to use gradient centrifugation to isolate the LS MC followed by SDS-PAGE with markers for LS, xylE, and xylT. Co-localization will be successful if all three proteins of the LS MC purification are visualized by SDS-PAGE and extracellular application of the MC will also be tested.
(2)    Decontamination of heavy metals found in the tailings ponds will be performed using tools already found in nature. The bacteria M. magneticum produce the protein Mms6, which possesses  the ability to reduce heavy metals into magnetic nanoparticles23. Further work will now be done to characterize the formation of the magnetic nanoparticle from the Mms6 BioBrick found in the registry. Expression conditions of Mms6 in vivo will be optimized, exploring conditions such as iron concentration and Mms6 cellular localization. To investigate the effect of Mms6 over-expression in different cellular locations, signal sequences can be used to facilitate targeting of Mms6 to the periplasm or its secretion out of the cell. Four signal sequences are available in the registry that were submitted by the Lethbridge 2010 iGEM team and will be added to the mms6 gene construct to control localization of the over-expressed protein product. Cell growth rates are easily tracked through absorbance measures of cell cultures, and over-expression of Mms6 can be verified by SDS-PAGE. Since cell growth rates can be slowed when under metal ion stress, removing aqueous metals via nanoparticle formation will have an added benefit of improving cell viability while decreasing heavy metal ion stress in the tailings ponds.
(3)    Sedimentation of clay particles found in the tailings ponds can be accelerated by the use of naturally occurring polysaccharides found on the surface of bacterial cell membranes that bind clay particles and form aggregates18. The cell-clay aggregates can then form sediments using Antigen 43 (Ag43). Ag43 is an autotransporter that promotes bacterial cell-to-cell aggregation, which accelerates sedimentation rates19.

Integrated design of peristaltic pump
4.1Working principle of traditional peristaltic pump:
A peristaltic pump consists of a motor-driven wheel with peripherally placed rollers and an adjustable compression cam (or band) which is squeezed against the rollers. One or several pump tubes are affixed so that they rest on a minimum of two rollers at all times . The successive peristaltic movements of the tubes force various fluids through the tubes[6]
Fig.11 Schematic diagram of the working principle of peristaltic pump[6]
4.2 Chip design:
With reference to the traditional peristaltic pump construction, we integrate the rotor and hose into the inside of the chip. The driving part is composed of a rotor, a hose and a nut, wherein the nut is a bonding point of the chip and the screwdriver. Rotating the nut with a stepper motor control screwdriver can drive the rotation of the rotor. When the rotor rotates, it squeezes the hose and drives the liquid to flow.
4.3 Advantages and disadvantages:
Advantages: Compared with the electromagnetic interference that may exist in electromagnetic driving, the magnetic strength is difficult to quantify, etc., the integrated peristaltic pump has fewer potential influencing factors, better working stability, short manufacturing cycle and mature process.
Disadvantages: The volume of the integrated peristaltic pump chip is relatively affected by the driving area, and the function is not as flexible as the electromagnetic driving function. The micro-valve is required to complete the control of the liquid flow.
4.4 Detailed steps to make the chip
PMMA chip production process
Draw a designed chip map using SOLIDWORKS and export it to DXF file format;
Use RDWorksV8 to import the drawn print files into the laser cutting machine.
Place a 2mm thick acrylic plate in the laser cutting machine, set the cutting speed to 5mm/s, start the laser cutting machine, and wait for the chip to be cut.
After cutting the layers of the chip, wash and dry with deionized water;
Arrange, align and align the layers of the chip according to the design;
Clamp the chip with two aluminum plates to make the layers of the chip closely fit together;
Put the aluminum plate and chip into the oven at 170 °C, control the temperature change within ±5 °C, and heat for 14 min.

In this way, it was made sure that the members selected had enough enthusiasm to participate, as well as basic understandings on synthetic biology and iGEM to establish a sound project.
Winter-break training
The winter-break training is our reserved program for every year’s competition. Members with specialties that haven’t taken part in the training may be added into a team later if needed, but the core members of a team always come from the winter-break training. During the 14-day training, possible participants that have passed the previous selection would come together, to brainstorm and discuss their ideas in hopes of bringing forward projects that are both realizable and novel. During this process, members from the previous year’s teams had come and organized multiple workshops on various things like basic experimental methods, widely-used tools in synthetic biology, recent iGEM winners and so on.
Theory training
Theory training lasted for nine days. During this time, members from previous teams selflessly devoted their time and effort in helping us, who knew almost nothing about synthetic biology at that time, to have a full grasp on it. Before the training started, participants were instructed to study molecular biology through online videos and a test was taken to examine our efforts. It signifies the beginning of a tiring but fruitful period.
In the 9-day training, we were introduced to things including but not limited to biological circuits and recombinases, cellular immunology, transcription initiation and termination, logic gates, DNA assembling methods, quorum sensing… It had been the most hard-working and fulfilling time most of us had since entering college. Last year’s members generously imparted their knowledge, experience and competition insights with us. Moreover, in this way, helped us to transform from being ignorant and hesitating to targeted and clear-minded future team leaders/members.
Knowledge only constituted a part of their generous giving. They also helped us in learning how to find researches conducted in our fields of interest, how to quickly have an overall grasp of research literature, the essential constituents of an iGEM project and how to present it through the wiki. They introduced the iBiology website and pointed out the related videos. Whenever we had a question, they were always willing to help, and their advice had always been instructive. Through the group presentation and reading research articles assigned to us, we slowly enriched our understanding of iGEM competition. Though it was only an introduction for us to step into the vast ocean of iGEM and synthetic biology, it was the first step we officially made, and has always motivated us to"

Fig.9 Verify Redox Reversibility of roGFP2-Orp1
As Figure.9 shown, the fluorescence ratio R decreased slightly in the range of 0 to 20 mins,                         because cell itself has the mechanism of scavenging ROS and H2O2 will                         decompose spontaneously. At the 23 mins, we added DTT (strong reducing agent) with the final                         concentration of 5 mM. As a result, the fluorescence ratio R decreased significantly.
Therefore, the redox of our roGFP2-Orp1 is reversible.
Codon optimization of roGFP2-Orp1
Determinate the DTT concentration making                         roGFP2-Orp1 completely reduced.
We added three different concentrations of DTT, 0.5 mM, 3 mM and 5 mM. When DTT was added, the                         roGFP2-Orp1 should be reduced and the fluorescence ratio R should decrease.
Fig.10 Relationship Between R and DTT Concentration (After Codon Optimization)
Fig.11 Relationship Between R and DTT Concentration (Before Odon Optimization)
As shown, when the concentration of DTT was 3 mM, the fluorescence ratio R was no longer                         decreased with the increase of the DTT concentration. At that time, the cells were in reduced                         state completely.
roGFP2-Orp1 protein expression before and after                         codon optimization.
To exclude the influence of individual differences, we made cell be in the same state of redox                         by adding 5mM DTT. In that case, roGFP2-Orp1 proteins were in the complete reduction state.                         Fluorescence intensity can characterize protein expression and we used fluorescence / OD600 to approximate the expression protein of roGFP2-Orp1 in single cell.

To prove that the additional luxG gene can increase luminescence, we conducted experimental tests to compare the relative luminescence of the bacteria with each plasmid under a 0.1M concentration of arabinose, which we have determined from previous characterizations of part BBa_K325909 will result in the brightest light. The bacteria were grown in 37℃ overnight before being taken out and put into a 29℃ shaking incubator over the course of the measurements. Part BBa_K325909 is abbreviated 4L and Part BBa_K2836002 is abbreviated 2G.
As shown from the graphs above, when induced with 0.1M arabinose, part BBa_K2836002 consistently showed an higher level of relative luminescence when compared to part BBa_K325909 over the course of five hours, thus affirming the fact that the additional luxG gene does increase light production in bioluminescent bacteria.

We really appreciate LZU-China’s help in 2015’s iGEM competition. LZU-China is a team supported by Lanzhou University which is the best university in the northwestern region of China, ranking as one of the top 30 among over 1,500 universities across China. And they have taken part in the last 2 years’ iGEM competition. This year, they mentored us and shared their competition experience with us. They provide many valuable suggestions which are about the presentation, the wiki design and the parts construction.
For example, they provided many useful advises for the construction of parts. We are HS team so that we do not have much experience in genetic engineering. LZU-China helped us to solve many problems we met like selecting the clone, assembling the plasmid.
What’s more, they pointed an important mistake for us, which made us avoid adding a wrong part, and told us many things about the part shipping. We completed the part submission form with their assistance. They helped to choose the suitable Part ID and told us how to fill in the Registry.
We are particularly grateful to International Teenage Competition and Communication Center (ITCCC). Dr. Mao Yong helped us to understand match process and how to enter for it in our preparatory phase. And igem team from Tianjing University, which presented handbook to us by post.

Occurrence
Mercury is found in water, typically as methylmercury, which is build out of inorganic mercury by different marine bacteria Pseudomonas spp. under aerobic conditions. Additional mercury(II)chloride with a high solubility, and mercury sulfide are found in water. The main natural source of Mercury exposure is through volcanic activity (WHO 2005). Additional, there are many kinds of emission caused by humans. For example mercury contamination can be caused by medical waste (damaged measurement instruments), fluorescent-lamps, chloralkali plants and thermal power plants (Verma et al., 2013). The natural occurring concentration of mercury in groundwater and surface water are in general less than 0.5 µg/L but can rise to higher concentrations by local mineral deposit. Due to volcanic activity, the mercury concentration in water can rise frequently up to 5.5 µg/L (Izu Oshima"

Part 1: THU-E Mutation Part
A plasmid  used for the construction of high-diversity library in vivo ingenome level. In  this vector, highly error-prone dnaQ mutant, mutD [1] was cloned downstream  of araBAD promoter to control the  mutation rate of the target genome by the concentration of araBAD promoter’s inducer, L-arabinose, in a strict manner.E. Coli JM109 carrying different vectors  of pBAD_B0030-mutD-sfGFP, pBAD_B0032-mutD-sfGFP and pBAD_SDA_RBS-mutD-sfGFP(this RBS sequence was derived  from the RBS sequence upstream of sfGFP in original AraC_pBAD_CI_OR222-sfGFP  vector [2] )were  constructed. By detecting the induced fluorescence intensity, we found that pBAD_B0030-mutD-sfGFP,  andpBAD_SDA_RBS-mutD- sfGFPhave  relatively higher mutD expression. The increaseof mutation rate induced  by our mutation part was measured by quantifying the reversion of rifampinresistance  caused by mutation in genome.pBAD_SDA_RBS-mutD-  sfGFPcould increase the genome mutation rate up to 10 times compared with  negative control with 1g/L induction concentration of L-arabinose.

Getting there by bus
Bus 13A/B
If the bus timetable allows, take bus 13A/B to stop 'Technische Hochschule'. Take the way on the right hand side around the Kármán building and you will find the Couvenhalle on the right.
Bus 3A/B
Most of the times bus 13A/B will not operate. Then either take bus 3A/B to Audimax and walk in direction of RWTH Hauptgebäude/SuperC. You will find the bus stop 'Technische Hochschule' on your way.
More busses
Many buses stop at Driescher Gässchen. Exit the bus there and walk towards the Kármán Auditorium, RWTH Hauptgebäude/SuperC (in direction of a newly built street).
To plan your bus trip visit the ASEAG homepage.
Getting around in Aachen
Aachen is, compared to other cities, quite compact. Basically, every route is well doable by foot."
Dalhousie,2017,Team:Dalhousie#ScienceSam_-_-_TEXT.html," it always. Being in the public eye is hard. Yeah, and you can’t please everyone. So recently you were at the stem cell conference in Boston. Yeah! In Boston, haha my life is so public. I overshare! You had a couple Instagram stories that were surprising but made sense to me. Where you were attending talks about how real people experience real damage from fake science. Specifically, stem cell centres were popping up that don’t work but they take people’s money and do procedures to them. Why do you think media outlets often hype up scientific results and make such extravagant conclusions? Is that where these things stem from? I don’t want to blame media too much, were in a click bait era. I started saying I will never give a hype-y title but now when I’m writing tweets I kind of- well we try and say “Hope not Hype”- but you kind of do this spin because you have seven words, I forget but there’s this limit where people only read the first few words. So You kind of have to [be click bait-y] to an extent. I think media is ok…major media is ok. Then there’s all the crappy ones. The issue with the fake clinics is people will make a website- you and I right now could make a website that could offer a stem cell treatment, or new supplement or new facial to be young, and there’s really no regulation if its not a drug or food item: it fits in an unregulated region. There’s no law against it, it’s not technically illegal. People make these websites and they’ll even have real doctors performing these procedures. And the US has the most of these types of situations. Canada has some too but not as many. Real Drs. will do this and its not considered illegal It’s not malpractice? I’m not sure, I’m sure it’s illegal in some ways but they still exist. The really dramatic ones are in countries where there’s no law. So I don’t think it’s the media too much. I think the media primes people, gets them excited enough. So now people are like “cool you study stem cells, can you cure my disease?”. Yeah I was gonna say you’ve even gotten messages from people before being like “I don’t care about the law” Yeah! So the media primes them And in all these hopeful articles we have to be writing “but we aren’t there yet”. Because then people when they go and see these clinics they think “oh yeah I read in the Globe and Mail that this is a thing!” Did I answer your"

Communicating with Team HFUT
An integral part of learning from each other is the free exchange of ideas and viewpoints among older learners. There’s nothing like listening to or taking part in stimulating discussions to help us see the other side of an issue. That give-and-take opens our minds and brings us to a whole new level of enlightenment. In that case, we communicated with HFUT.             As a software team, they do not have their own lab. So first of all, we showed them around in our lab. After showed them the using methods of some biology experimental devices, we gave them an introduction of how synthetic biology researchers work, which benefited them a lot.             Three team leaders then introduced their project. After hearing their work of literature analysis and gene relationship visualization, we found it an interesting idea. Also, the others thought our prion project a revolution practice.             In the end, we gave suggestions to each other. To make HFUT's project more adorable, we shared our common way of searching and reading documents.

Anthony Forster
Dr. Forster received from the University of Adelaide, Australia, a B.Sc. majoring in Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry in 1983, a B.Sc. Hons. in Biochemistry in 1984, and a Ph.D. in Biochemistry in 1988. He was a post-doctoral fellow with Nobel laureate Sidney Altman at Yale and received an M.D. magna cum laude from Harvard Medical School in 1996. He then completed a residency in Anatomical Pathology followed by research as an Instructor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School.
He was Assistant Professor in the Department of Pharmacology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, from 2005-2011 before moving to Uppsala University, Sweden, as a Professor. Dr. Forster discovered the hammerhead catalytic RNA structure, invented photobiotin for the preparation of nucleic acid diagnostics and external guide sequences for ribonuclease P, and has created unnatural genetic codes de novo. He has published in journals including Cell, JACS, Nature, PNAS and Science, edited a volume of Methods, and has authored patents. His technology has founded 3 biotech companies. He currently researches synthetic biology, protein synthesis and drug discovery.
Anders Virtanen
Anders Virtanen is a professor at the Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology and a member of the Uppsala RNA Research Centre (URRC). Anders studies primarily enzymes involved in regulating the fate of mRNA. In his research, experimental systems based on mammalian and Drosophila cells are employed. A main goal is to understand how mRNA turnover/degradation, through the mRNA specific cap and poly(A) tail, is integrated with other essential mechanisms of gene expression/regulation. Another goal is to identify previously unrecognized small non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) and to determine their functions. These studies will be of importance for the general understanding of mechanisms controlling the fate of eukaryotic mRNA.
The two greatest discoveries made by Anders Virtanen are: the first known mRNA polyA-site in a human virus; and the enzyme in the animal cells that removes polyA-tail from mRNA.

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," use in biotech could be sustainably sourced in the future.
Eric said he was not confident. Due to predictions of increased population as well as water shortages and other shortages e.g. fertiliser, he said land is likely to be needed mostly for agriculture. He sees sustainable biomass sourcing as incompatible with large scale commercialisation of biotech based on that biomass (e.g. production of biofuels); though there might be possibilities for small-scale biotech. He does not see biotech as a very likely way of achieving a replacement for petroleum.
Yassen asked about regulations for the biotech industry.
Eric said we need to have strong containment for synthetic organisms. He thought containment level 2 might be insufficient and these organisms might need to be placed in containment level 3. [For the record, our lab uses containment level 1, the weakest level of containment.]
Eric noted that Europe has stronger regulations; he thought the U.S. regulations were very badly outdated.
He recommends improved democratic involvement of communities that are involved, e.g. communities where the work is done, or communities otherwise impacted (e.g. because they are a biomass source).
There need to be safeguards for community health and worker health, since the workers in the labs are on the frontlines.
Yassen asked what role synthetic biology should have in food production in the future.
Eric said little to no role. He said conventional techniques, proven to work and proven to have high yields, are better, especially if they are developed in a fair and sustainable way, instead of new technologies that benefit just a few people.
Fionn asked what Friends of the Earth would do if biorefineries started to exist on a large scale.
Eric said they would fight for community involvement, risk assessments for health and environment, and life-cycle analysis of the organisms. This means: what happens if they escape? On a commercial scale, organisms are certain to escape. Can the DNA transfer laterally to other organisms?
He does not envisage a future with biorefineries containing (genetically modified organisms) in people's back gardens; government regulations won't allow this.
Fionn asked about the limits of what's sensible in synthetic biology.
Eric said synthetic biology has a future in prokaryotes, but eukaryotes (and especially multi-celled organisms) are too complicated. He mentioned attempts to improve the human genome via synthetic biology. He foresees some people trying this unsuccessfully, possibly causing harm in the process.
Yassen asked what approaches (generally) should be used to solve the world's problems.
Eric said:
Reduce consumption.

Biofilm Viability Assays
Can our constructed cells form biofilms - set up after lunchtime.
PAGE tells us that supernatants aren’t great, so even if we see degradation, results aren’t conclusive.
Biofilm degradation
E. coli and putida plates are drying - test Art-175 supernatants.
Biofilm inhibition
Incubate bacteria together with the stuff that forms biofilm and see if biofilm forms.
Day 39
We have set up viability (on the bench) and is according to Raffy’s toxicity map 12/08, leave another day to grow.
Set up another viability assay same as yesterday
Also have set up degradation for putida and E. coli - write the map down; stain tomorrow afternoon
Grow some more biofilms to degrade
Biofilm inhibition assays - grow E. coli biofilms in DspB and DNase supernatant
Day 40
E. coli biofilms growing on the bench (set up at 5 on 14/08) - leave until Saturday
Read biofilm degradation - retrieve 96 well plates from incubator. Read OD600, then wash and read OD spectra between 500-600
Use the overnight supernatants to degrade the biofilms growing from 12/08

Here we can see that the domains are not well defined. Only the wetlab results could show if the protein is working or not, and if it seems functional .
RFP_CipA (BBa_K1615100)
As we have seen previously, the streptavidin with the 2 CBDs wasn’t the best solution to fix the aptamer onto the paper. Fortunately, in the registry, the 2015 iGEM Edinburgh team made a RFP protein with another Cellulose Binding Domain, CipA (BBa_K1615100) . First, we made the structural model of this chimeric protein to see the differences with the previous one and if it was more promising.
The best model returned a Z-score of -0.73, which means a high absolute quality of the prediction. The graphic below shows that the predicted structure is in the lowest standard deviation of the experimental structures.
Figure 5: Comparison with non redundant set of PDB structures of RFP_CipA model (red cross)
Figure 6: 3D structure of the model, RFP (red), CipA (blue) and linkers (green)
The linker allows the spatial separation of the 2 domains and we obtain a RMSD of 1.84Å for the streptavidin and of 1.37Å for the RFP.
Streptavidin_CipA (BBA_K1934030)
Because the RFP_CipA work well in the wetlab and the model is good, we decide to use a streptavidin with this CipA.
The best model has a Z-score of -1.63 that means a quite good absolute quality of the prediction, the graphic shows that our model is in the standard deviation of the major part of the experimental structures.

Thank you for allowing us free use of the fabrication and electronics equipment such as the 3D printers, laser cutter, and soldering irons.
Mr. MUHAMMED Abdurrahiem bin Abdul lent us 10 Arduino Unos so that we could commence our work immediately, instead of simply waiting idly for our own orders to arrive. Miss TAN Annie gave us food for body and soul, while Mr. YIP Chi Ho, Justin supplied us with his personal brand of sardonic humour and acrylic glue in equal measure. Additionally, we inherited a set of legendary ball bearings from Mr. Brian Shohei TEO, These 4 ancient (much like their original owner) bearings were salvaged from the flying machine he created as part of his undergraduate dissertation, the Phoenix. Both this set of ball bearings and his oft macabre, perpetually facetious jokes helped motivate our hardware team greatly. But most importantly, all of these people were kind.
Mr. SAJJAD Ali introduced us to Russian culture, provided intellectual stimulation, and also lent us acrylic glue. If you’re noticing a theme here, it’s because our life was in pieces and unfortunately we needed acrylic glue in industrial quantities. Not to drink and thus end our misery, but to make our cuvettes watertight. This was accomplished once Mr Jonathan AMBROSE lent us his Acrifix cement, for which we are eternally grateful. The hardware team has no comment on whether we still need to pull ourselves together.
PART 13: MISCELLANEOUS
We thank Mr. TAN Kang Lek, Clarence for generously lending us his prized Pentax K-1 Mark II and tripod, often on very short notice.
We would like the sincerely apologize if we have inadvertently missed anyone out.

RecA Test Circuit: The cI repressor is constitutively produced and binds to the repressible promoter under normal settings.
Activated RecA then cleaves the cI repressor, causing transcription of RFP. However, if RecA exhibits recombinant activity, then the homologous double terminator regions will recombine. This causes the deletion of the repressible promoter and RFP.

Tsinghua-A,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#orthogonality test_-_-_TEXT.html," Therefore, according to results from ETH_Zurich 2014, shown below (Fig. 1), we may design the gene circuit of our E. coli as follows. (Fig. 2)
Fig. 1 Results from ETH_Zurich 2014 . From these results, we may think that the gene circuit designed in Fig. 2 can satisfy our needs. However, from our results, we can see that since E. coli can actually synthesize much more C4HSL than the maximal concentration considered by ETH_Zurich 2014, the gene circuit in Fig. 2 cannot satisfy our needs.
Fig. 2 Designed gene circuit by results from ETH_Zurich 2014
     In conclusion, it is not suitable for us to choose our gene circuit just according to results from ETH_Zurich 2014 since it does not consider the ability of E. coli synthesizing AHL. Therefore, we designed our experiment as follows, which considers the E. coli’s ability to synthesize AHL.
II Experimental design
    To test which kind of AHL, receptor and promoter pair we can choose to keep the gene circuit orthogonal during the time period of our experiment (For example, in our final experiment, we will co-culture six characters in 3ml medium for 48h), we should detect the killing effect of the two warriors in real time.
    Here for simplicity, we used RFP to indicate the amount of LacI inside bacteria, so its intensity inside each bacteria in real time can be used as a relative measurement of the response intensity of specific receptor-promoter to specific AHL and the killing effect of warriors in real time.
    What's more, we let E. coli secrete and receive AHL itself to mimic the real situation of our system approximately.
    The detailed plasmid construction design is shown below.
    First, we cloned three AHL synthases---luxI, lasI and rhlI to the low copy backbone---pSB3K3. At the same time, we cloned nine receptor-promoter combinations to pSB6A1. The three receptors are luxR, lasR and rhlR while the three promoters are Plux, Plas and Prhl. RFP is attached to the promoters, which is used to detect the response of the promoters to AHL molecules via the receptors (Fig. 3). After that, we cotransformed the plasmids containing AHL synthases and plasmids containing receptor-promoter combinations. As a result, we get 27 different combinations.

3. The number of patients required
4. Follow-up testing period
5. Unexpected results or problems with the treatment
For the phage encapsulated silk bandage, it can be anticipated that the clinical trials could proceed more swiftly than other therapeutic products. Because of the nature of the treatment, the results would be visible within several weeks, at the latest. The most likely barrier to this process would be finding patients to test the treatment on. At this time, many medical professionals are unaware of bacteriophage therapy and a majority of those who are, are skeptical. This skepticism comes largely from a negative association due to the majority of research and utilization, until recently, occurring primarily within the former Soviet Union and the current Republic of Georgia. Because of this, it is likely that the patients who would be treated were those for whom antibiotics were unable to help and who had no further options. Even assuming initial success, it will take time for this stigma to be reversed in the medical profession. However, as antibiotic resistance has continued to spread, the number of deaths caused by antibiotic resistant infections has passed 23,000 per year in the United States alone. For this reason, if no other, it can be assumed that the trial will not lack for patients. Combined with the rapid results, it can so be predicted that clinical trials will occur at least relatively swiftly.
Regulatory Approval
While bacteriophage have yet to be approved for human utilization, there is highly encouraging precedent with approval for environmental, food, and agricultural approval being provided by the FDA, EPA, and USDA. If clinical trials can be successfully traversed, it is safe to assume that bacteriophage would be approved for human treatment.

uOttawa,2014,Team:uOttawa#team_-_-_TEXT.html,"6th: With school starting up again, we each spent a significantly less amount of time in the lab, and most of the time that we spent in the lab was concentrated on testing out the constructs that we had obtained during August. Much larger drug concentrations were performed within our flow sessions, so that we could present the modelling team with sufficient data for the figures that they were to create. September overall was largely a month of transformations, testing failures, reconstructions, transformations, and then more disappointments.
September
September 7th to September 13th: All previous constructs failed to flow confirm, have to troubleshoot which parts are non-functional. Entirely new constructs which contained new monomers, and were entirely different from the constructs that we had worked with previously. We also spent some time frustratingly creating the BioBricks that were to be submitted to the iGEM HQ with long-expired endonucleases.
September 14th to September 20th: Transformations were tested, and GFP constructs confirmed. Sadly anything BFP-related along with rTTA did not. BFP will be removed and replaced, as well as the rTTA, meaning more construction.
September 21th to September 27th: Transformations failed again, rTTA will not PCR out properly, and we believe the promoter driving BFP maybe the problem.
September 28th to October 4th: Crunch time for the wet lab. Although we did have enough data to at least present the intricacies of the tri-stable switch, we really wanted to establish one ourselves. The problem is, with all of the time spent in testing colonies, we had little time left to start over again if such a thing was needed. With testing of the construct failing, we decided to shift our primary focus to gathering together all of the data that we did manage to retrieve over the course of the summer so that our wiki could be well completed.
October
October 5th to October 11th: Transformations all failed to confirm last week, last chance to build the final construct with the time left. Ran the all-nighter to end all all-nighters. Biobricks purified and sent in this week on Tuesday.
October 12th to October 18th: Wiki freeze is approaching! Last data on promoters is collected and write ups for the wiki are completed.

- After making two front inserts, we proceed to start with two reverse inserts for where we cut the three genes (Kumamax, RFP, terminator) and we make them a reverse insert, and we took him to the inverse vector of the RBS.
- Finally we proceed to cut the four genes (RBS, Kumamax, RFP, terminator) as insert reverse, to take them to the inverse vector of the promoter, and we finished building our final plasmid, the ""Kumamax Plux""."

Pertaining to size, the average we found was around 18 nm in diameter (d.nm), which differs from the 80-100 d.nm sized vesicles found by the 2016 iGEM team of University of New South Wales (UNSW) Australia . Further, they showed that the size distribution shifts to larger vesicles when TolR is overexpressed in the KEIO strain, which was not evident in our data. A possible reason could be the low amount of IPTG we added. However, due to time constraints, we were not able to test a range of different IPTG concentrations.
Figure 36: Analysed data of the DLS experiment. Vesicles size after induction of TolR (orange) and pET-Duet (blue) in the KEIO strain obtained by DLS measurements. The mean for each measurement was represented with dots and the width of the distribution with bars. The time points in hours is set against the size in nm.
As shown in previous experiments, both pET-Duet and TolR in KEIO seem to produce vesicles. To confirm that the objects measured by DLS are vesicles and not, for example, parts of the cell, we made negative stain Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images following the TEM protocol . We expected that vesicles have a different shape than the cell debris, namely spherical. Furthermore, when vesicles are big enough you should be able the see the lipid bilayer of the membrane.
Figure 37 shows PET-Duet in KEIO (a) and TolR in KEIO (b). Vesicles were identified in the images, indicating that the measured objects were not simply cell debris. As shown in the raw DLS data in Figure 35, the range of vesicules go up to approximately 70 d.nm. Due to the resolution limitations of the TEM, we could only visualize vesicles above the average size of 18 d.nm.
Figure 37: Transmission Electron Microscop (TEM) images of TolR (left) and pET-Duet (right) in the KEIO strain. The red arrows point to vesicles.
The DLS and TEM experiments do not provide any information about the concentration of produced vesicles. Therefore, vesicle concentration was determined through staining the DLS samples with the membrane dye FM4-64 and subsequent fluorescence measurements in a plate reader. The experiment followed the membrane staining protocol . In order to calculate the concentration of ves"

Students plated P. fluorescens onto Pseudomonas-F agar plates containing different concentrations of iron. These type of bacteria produce fluorescing siderophores when iron concentrations are low. After an incubation period of 1 to 2 days, the students should be able to see nice results in form of fluorescing and non-fluorescing bacterial colonies on their plates.
The students also carried out some experiments from the NEAnderLab's workshops , such as Cold Light of the Deep Sea, an experiment on chemiluminscence of luminol catalyzed by a copper wire. Playing around with glowing liquids of different colours in the dark was also a lot of fun!
At the end of the day,  we also answered the students' questions about synthetic biology and the Biology/Biotechnology university programs. As a souvenir, each student got to keep a phosphorescing stone.
Evaluation
The students were also asked to fill out an evaluation sheet. The reception of the program was good, especially when considering that the class consisted of mostly students that chose biology because they are required to select one of either chemistry, physics or biology and thought that biology was the easiest one and that there would be no math involved (haha!).  The results of the evaluation were good, and are shown below.
Summary of the students' evaluation of their experience with us in the NEAnderLab.
a) Questions on how students liked the program (1=very good, 5=poor); b) General questions about MINT (mathematics-informatics-natural sciences-technology) subjects
The results of this evaluation clearly show that our team members did a good job in achieving our goal: explaining synthetic biology in a comprehensible and fun way. The students liked the experiments and lessons. =)
This reflects the enthusiasm we observed when working with the students of this biology class. We therefore recommend school collaborations like ours to other iGEM teams as a successful way to spread knowledge about iGEM and synthetic biology. High school students are a promising target group because they are open-minded, keen to learn more about current developments and they"

Northeastern iGEM Team Meetup (NEGEM)
In collaboration with the BostonU Hardware team, BostonU hosted the Northeastern iGEM Team Meetup, or NEGEM, on July 6th at Boston University. The five teams in attendance (BostonU, BostonU Hardware, MIT, Harvard, and UConn) all made Jamboree-style presentations, with 20 minutes to present and 10 minute question and answer sessions. In addition, all teams received feedback forms from every individual in attendance for teams to see how well their audience understood their project and how they could improve. NEGEM was insightful for old and new teams alike. For instance, we provided substantial feedback and guidance for UConn, a new iGEM team. Overall, NEGEM was successful in giving teams feedback at the third of the way point of the competition. After our meetup, we collected responses from the teams to gain insight on how the meetup could have been run more efficiently or been more effective for participating teams. Although improvements could be made (for instance, lunch arrived late which slightly set us back in our planned schedule), we believe that NEGEM ran smoothly. We hope that future BostonU teams continue to host NEGEM and will use the feedback we received.
Take a look at the feedback forms that the audience filled out for each team's presentation!
Nair Lab at Tufts University
We aimed to incorporate our two light inducible systems, LOV2 and PhiReX, into the xylose isomerase pathway to produce ethanol from cellulose. Our plan to accomplish this was to toggle between growth (high fitness, low ethanol production) and production phases (low fitness, high ethanol production) with the use of our light inducible systems to efficiently convert cellulose into biofuel. Venkatesh Gopinarayanan at the Nair Lab at Tufts University kindly gave us a high XYL-REG strain and DNA. His strain allows for high fitness on xylose, which would have been a prime strain to integrate our promoter systems into. Unfortunately, we did not have the time to use the XYL-REG strain with our systems, but we hope to do so in the future!

After industry, firms in the scientific, clinical, and health categories are most prevalent. Meanwhile, some firms have environmental and educational applications. Five firms are industrial and scientific, because their products can be used in academic or industrial labs. Five firms are industrial and health-promoting, by virtue of all four firms that fall into three categories including those two. This makes sense- three of those firms focus on synthesizing new compounds that can be used in medication, while two have applications in water safety. Four firms are industrial and clinical (two of which are also industrial and health-promoting), and another four are industrial and environmental. One of the many beautiful things about synthetic biology is that industrial applications are often more environmentally friendly than current methods. Only six firms are not industrial. Below is the same figure, but with team name instead of firm name.

Four of seven European firms have scientific applications, driven by three of four London firms, while the same is true for only four of thirteen North American firms. Both Ontarian firms have health and clinical applications. Two of three Albertan firms have environmental applications. So geographical location does seem to have an effect on the kind of products firms provide.
Some firms offer very similar products and might find themselves competing in the future. When Ambercycle and Upcycled Aromatics start operating, they will recycle textiles and plastics into higher value chemicals and wastepaper into aromatics and platform chemicals. Both offer ‘upcycling’ services – turning waste into valuable products – and it is easy to imagine Ambercycle scaling into paper or Upcycled A"
TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," the selling price of the microlens arrays for every single customer.
Figure 5: Advantages and disadvantages for potential customers
As shown in Figure 5, the total benefits of the customer have to be larger than disadvantages. We will discuss with our potential customers in detail what the benefits for both parties could be. Our revenue model will be comparable to the brokerage fee model.  We will ask our customers a fixed price in order to cover the costs, plus a variable price. This variable price will be depending on the benefits of our customers. We aim to get a variable price that is equal to 30%-50% of the extra profit our customers make with the microlens array.
Promotion
BioLens is the result of an iGEM project. One of the main advantages is the fact that the iGEM team gets a lot of media attention. The project acquires the interest of a whole variety of newspapers, magazines and television programs. This makes the public aware of our project. It is important that they know what the benefits of our project are. As can be seen in the customers analysis, most end users would be interested in more environmentally produced solar panels, but it appears that most of them did not think about this before they became aware of our project. It is crucial that also the public becomes aware of our project. When they are interested in more environmentally produced solar panels, indirectly this forces producers to produce them in a more environmentally way.
Furthermore, it is important to promote our product to solar panel manufactures. We are a B2B company and direct promotion will be our main promotion activity. Just as we did for the customer analysis, we will talk to potential customers and show them our product. Eventually, the main goal of our promotion activities is off course to sell our product, but we also have a broader social purpose to make the people aware of the fact that production methods can have a significant influence on the environment.
Realization Schedule
Planning is a difficult but critical part of a successful business plan. To make a strategical efficient plan, we have divided the planning in multiple subcomponents.
Development
In the first year we will continue the development of our product. We have to develop the final microlens array and have to test the properties of it. We will among other things do more research into how we can optimize the MLAs. For example, we will analyze in more detail the influence of shape, size etc. After this, we will build our first prototype. To make this possible we will need experts with experience in the field of solar panels. There are multiple research groups within the"
WashU,2010,Team:WashU#Splicing_-_-_TEXT.html," analysis has shown only 3.8% of S. cerevisiae genes contain introns (Lopez et. al., 1999) and only one example of alternative splicing has been shown (Juneau et. al., 2009).  This differs noticably from humans where the average gene contains 7.8 introns and 35-65% of genes are alternatively spliced (Ast, 2004).
Despite the greatly reduced splicing activity in S. cerevisiae it still contains splicing machinery greatly conserved all the way to human systems (Shen et. al., 2006).  The high conservation of splicing machinery is what allows the use of a Drosophila regulatory protein, SxL, to be used in S. cerevisiae.  Furthermore it makes the designed system highly portable from one organism to the next allowing for widespread application.
Sex-Lethal
Sex Lethal (Sxl) is a gene that is important both for sexual differentiation and dosage compensation in Drosophila melanogaster. As an mRNA binding protein, one of its functions is regulation of mRNA splicing events. (Bell et. al., 1988, Kelley et. al. 1995) The Sxl product can prevent splicing by the splicosome at either the 3’ or 5’ splice sites. This is through competitive binding with U2 Auxiliary Factor (U2AF) to the poly(Y) track within the intron. Normally the U2AF splicing factor binds to the poly(y) tract and recruits the U2 snRNP, a necessary step in spliceosome formation. Having a similar active binding site to U2AF allows Sxl to bind to the same recognition site and block U2AF activity. (Merendino et. al., 1999) When this occurs, two things can happen. The first, as seen in the msl-2 gene of D. melanogaster, is that Sxl binding prevents the excision of an intron.  When translated, the intron will code for a premature stop codon and result in a truncated protein. (Merendino et. al., 1999)  Another outcome of Sxl binding can be seen in the tra-1 gene of D. melanogaster, where suppressed splicing at one site causes the splicosome to prefer a secondary downstream splice site. This causes a larger intron to be excised, and a different protein product. (Bell et. al., 1988) In"

Chain A-B-C will not appear in the mixture. Since node B does not appear in mixed chains, tree with nodes B and E will be removed in the trim process. Because part C and F, A and D, are both bound to nodes, the final product should contain A and B both after split processing.
In the example above, there is only one product finally though two product templates are defined in database. In this case, the corresponding reverse reaction would never be found because it fails to match two templates to only one species. This is a drawback of our MoDeL language -- it does not support description of intra-molecular reactions. If A and C could react as different parts of the product, the reverse reactions would not be lost. However, supporting intra-molecular reactions is one of our future plans for refinement of our MoDeL language.

Argon Design System - Free Design System for Bootstrap 4
Hardware
The goal of our project, TERRA, is to automate and selectively dispense the output of a microfluidic device. In order to do so, we identified two main hardware components:
a system to move the output from location to location
a system to control when the output is dispensed
Our system required a method of moving either the output tube of the microfluidic chip or the vessel that the fluid will be dispensed to. When conducting research on translational systems, we found two common systems: an XY translational stage typically used in microscope systems and a system of timing belts and pulleys typically used in do-it-yourself 3D printers. The XY translational stages, however, cost upwards of $300 and need to be manually operated. We decided to combine the concept of an XY translational stage with the automated and accessibly-priced systems found in DIY printers.  One of the goals is to increase the accessibility of microfluidics to synthetic biologists, and this approach helped accomplish this.
Our team designed an inexpensive, DIY XY translational stage which utilized timing belts, pulleys, motors, and 3D printed parts. To control the motion of the stage, we used an Arduino Mega coupled with motor drivers, as it is a common microcontroller that utilizes a simple programming language and offers enough functionality in order to dictate the rotation of motors.
Click here to learn more about the XY translational stage:
XY-Stage
TERRA also required a system to control when the output of a microfluidic device was dispensed. Microfluidic chips can contain etched structures called valves, which can either allow or block fluid flow when actuated. The valves that we fabricate according to the Boston University CIDAR Lab protocol require manual vacuum pressure via a syringe to actuate. In order to automate the actuation of the valves, we decided to repurpose syringe pumps created by the 2016 iGEM BostonU Hardware team, Neptune . The syringe pumps were initially created to input fluid to microfluidic devices, but our team has utilized them to create a vacuum pressure for valves. These pumps were also controlled by the Arduino Mega.

We had an interview with Team EPFL from Switzerland. The article that was written was published on a website to help raise awareness of our project and for synthetic biology as a whole and allowed for the communication between iGEM teams internationally.
Team Genspace
This year, Team Genspace is investigating the ability of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) to confer desiccation resistance. IDPs are proteins that lack a fixed structure in an aqueous environment but obtain a rigid structure upon drying out. It is hypothesized that these proteins act as a sort of scaffold holding all of the cellular components in place under desiccation and thus protect the cell. They sought to identified genes for various IDPs from organisms such as tardigrades and nematodes, and to express them in E. Coli. But in order to determine whether or not there is an increase in the desiccation resistance of E. Coli, the baseline ability of E. Coli to survive desiccation without the IDPs needs to be established. Because of this, dehydration survivability studies were conducted at the onset of the iGEM competition by Genspace. We are collaborating with the Genspace iGEM team by replicating their experiments in hopes of gaining similar data. This information would prove invaluable to the Genspace iGEM team in that they’ll be able to measure the resistance conferred by the IDPs by comparing the dehydration survivability of the transformed E. Coli to the preliminary data they generated in addition to the data we generated. The strain of E. Coli that was used for the experiment is TOP10 and the protocols followed required placing 20 microliters of E. Coli onto different pieces of parafilm which were left to dry in an incubator for 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours. The E. Coli was subsequently rehydrated and plated. The colonies were then counted and the data is presented below:

Overview
University
The history of Zhejiang University goes back to 114 years ago.As a university founded in 1897, Zhejiang university is one of the earliest Western academic new type schools in China. During the Second World War, Zhejiang University suffered disaster. but insisted on the school's spirits. And moved to the hinterland of China to avoid the aggressor. After called on Zhejiang Univeristy, the British scholar Joseph Needham said, ""I found in this oriental Cambridge.""
Zhejiang University survived the War and gradually become one of the top universities in China. As a truly comprehensive institution with a full range of disciplines, Zhejiang University covers lots of subjects and aims at providing an outstanding education that will enable its students to build a future of professional, intellectual and personal success, capable of leadership in different areas, whether it be political, economic or academic. The elective system of the school is very flexible，so students can enroll whatever the courses they are interested in. That is why we could build such a team with various majors but have no difficulity in understanding each other.
The school locates in the city of Hangzhou. A saying goes that:""Hangzhou is the most beautiful city in the world!""I don't know whether it is true,but it is the the most beautiful city I've ever seen.And I find that the school equips the beauty of this city.We have five campuses. The names are:""Yuquan"", ""Xixi"", ""Huajiachi"", ""Zhijiang"", and""Zijingang"". These names are all ""water"" related. In English,they mean spring, stream, pool, river, and port. Each campus has its own beauty. Yuquan is charming, Xixi is elegant, Huajiachi is simple, Zhijiang is ancient and Zijingang is modern.

Human Practices
Cornell iGEM Human Practices came into the year with much potential. Over the course of the past spring, summer, and fall we developed significant personal and academic investments in the subjects our team was tackling as a whole.
We set out to create Human Practices components that contributed to and complemented with the work our team was doing, had a meaningful impact on our local and global communities, and were innovative, novel, and educational to future teams. To this end, we did the following: (1) engaged in extensive outreach , (2) learned about the environmental, social, economic, and political issues that shaped the world of the biochemistry we were tackling, (3) launched a new social media platform called Humans and SynBio in collaboration with teams from across the world, (4) put together a survey to understand the constructs underlying opinions about synthetic biology, (5) built a Comprehensive Environmental Assessment , following up on our efforts from previous years, (6) facilitated collaborations within our university to put together a portfolio of possible implementation of our genetically engineered technologies, (7) reached out to other iGEM teams to collect water samples for testing, and (8) considered the bioethical and safety implications of our work at large.
Humans and SynBio
This year we aimed to include a Human Practices component that had a global impact, was adaptable, and served to educate both iGEM teams and the communities in which they operated, enhancing their relationships with each other. To this end, we took inspiration from the popular photoblog Humans of New York, which chronicles the personalities, visages, and life experiences of the people of New York City. HONY, as it’s called, has gained a worldwide following and has spawned numerous spin-off projects, including Humans of Ithaca and Humans of Cornell University. We sought to emulate HONY’s singular style, a mode of social media posting that is informative, striking, and familiar: every picture includes"

Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was"
DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Procject#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," derivates of ciclosporin are known  [-1]. Comparing the number of known derivates to the actual potential diversity in compounds of an 11-mer cyclic peptide (11500), only a very little fraction of potential compounds are known. Even substitution of a single amino acid would yield more than 5,000 different compounds that could be screened for improved function.
Hypothesis: Targetted engineering of adenylation domains using OGRE
As highlihgted above, there are multiple potential NRPS candidates that can be used for drug improvement through screening of NRP products, synthesized by modifying the Stachelhaus code of the adenylation domain. The limitation has been the limited genetic tools available for engineering of NRPS. Considering that the Tyrocidine Synthase is 1.25*106 Da which is approximately the size of the large subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome, this is perhaps not surprising. Even though that the changes required to potentially alter the specificity of the A-domain (~1-10 amino acids) according to the Stachelhaus code, transformation requires introduction of selection a casettes. As each NRPS module is ~1,500 amino acid and often multiple modules are encoded in one open reading frame, even few modifications require assembly and introduction of large expression casettes. For example the NRPS responsible to ciclosporin synthesis in Tolypocladium inflatum is encoded in a single gene simA encoding one 45.8 kb exon [-1]. Amplification of 45.8 kb nucleotides is not feasable with standard PCR and would be considerable expensive to synthesize by even cheap errorprone DNA synthesis methods (calculated based on prices from IDT for gblock synthesis).
We hypothesized that NRPS directed evolution targetting the Stachelhaus code could lead to improvement of NRP drugs. We proposed that the recent advantge in oligo mediated reecombineering (OGRE) using short single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) can be applied to generate this diversity. While OGRE has low efficiencies, it is actually an advantge for generation of libraries, as multiplex and automated targetting with a library of oligos will create a library of different compounds.
Oligo mediates recombineering
Recombination-mediated genetic engineering  or recombineering (we call it OGRE) utlises homologous recombination to facilitate genetic modifications at any desired target by flanking the mutated sequence with homologous regions. One system"

Since the sequence of the promoter remains uncharacterized, we extracted a small region of the sequence upstream the chitoporin gene (promoter chiP) and used it as the promoter activated when chitin is present in the environment. To test whether this sequence acts as a promoter in the presence of chitin, we transformed an E. coli K12 with a vector containing GFP downstream this sequence, using GFP without promoter as control. This experiment is currently being performed.
The core and main idea of the whole Cropspirin system is to warn the coffee plant when a potential fungal pathogen lies on its surface. A way of conveying the message of ""alarm"", is to use plant hormones like Salicylic acid ; this hormone can elicit an immune response known as Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) which means that the plant is in a defense state, therefore will be resistant to the majority of infections. To test our system, we first need to probe if the Salycilate generator (MIT iGEM 2006) is able to induce plant defense responses in vivo. In order to do that we used two different approaches:
1. We challenged Arabidopsis thaliana Col 0, a well studied model plant, with a IPTG induced K12 strain carring either Salycilate generator (MIT iGEM 2006) or the empty backbone at different cell densities (1x10 3, 1x10 5, 1x10 6). We harvest the leaves 48h psi and extracted RNA to look for differences in the expression of PR-1 , a protein expressed when the plant defense is induced. We are currently performing the RT-PCR and expecting for good results.
2. We also used our plant pathogen model of study Coffea arabica-Hemileia vastatrix to test if the immunization mediated by Salycilate generator (MIT iGEM 2006) in coffee plants can avoid the development of the rust infection. For this purpose we inoculate by spraying or infiltrating small susceptible plants of coffee with the IPTG induced K12 strain carrying either Salycilate generator (MIT iGEM 2006) or the empty backbone at different cell densities (1x10 3, 1x10 5, 1x10 6. 1 week psi we challenge the plants with a rust spores suspension.

Firstly, because of its big size to fill large volumes with just a few angels of torsion ( Fellouse et al., 2007 ), while smaller amino acids provide the necessary space and protein conformation flexibility ( Koide et al., 2010 ). The size of tyrosine also leads to many van der Waals´ contacts and the -OH group provides electrostatic interactions for binding ( Mian et al., 1991 ). The amphipathic nature of the tyrosine is also helpful in the different hydrophobic and hydrophilic environments in antibody-antigen complexes ( Mian et al., 1991 ).
In contrast to other high affinity providing amino acids, tyrosine does not show an outstanding flexibility. This fact leads to another benefit of tyrosine in binding proteins by providing a high specificity ( Koide et al., 2010 ). Beside high affinity, specificity is another important requirement for a good Evobody.
On these grounds, we designed the randomized codons TMY, KMY, RMR, YWY, NWY and WMY.

Heidelberg,2009,Team:Heidelberg#Eukaryopedia_-_-_TEXT.html," factor involved in the regulation of sterol metabolism. In cells with high concentration of cholestrol SREBP is present in an inactive form anchored to the endoplasmatic reticulum or the nuclear envelop. If the cholesterol concentration decreases SREBP is cleaved by the proteases site-1 protease and site-2 protease resulting in a release of the aminoterminal domain of SREBP. Two additional proteins (Scap and Insig) are needed to regulate this process in a way that the cleavage occurs exclusively during lack of sterol [17] . The aminoterminal domain of SREBP is translocated into the nucleus and binds to the DNA consensus sequence TCACNCCAC. The binding causes an up regulation of the genes needed for cholesterol synthesis.

Sp1
Specificity protein 1 (Sp1) is a transcription factor which belongs to the zinc-finger protein family. It binds to promoter elements containing a central CpG motive with the following consensus sequence; 5'-G/TGGGCGGG/AG/AC/T-3' [18] .  Sp1 is involved in chromatin-remodelling processes [19] as well as in derecruiting repressor proteins from the promoter [20] . For these and for other reasons Sp1 is often considered as a universal transcription supporting protein.  Sp1 was shown to regulate various genes responsible for cellular processes like apoptosis, cell growth and differentiation and immune response [21] . It interacts with several well known proteins, such as c-myc, c-Jun and Stat1 [21] .

AP-1
Activating Protein1 (AP-1) is a transcription factor which is activated by several pathways and extracellular stimuli like UV radiation, growth factors and bacterial and viral infections. AP-1 is a heterodimer consisting of one member of the Fos and one member of the Jun family.  AP-1 composition and activation is mainly controlled by MAP kinase cascades by up regulating the expression of both Fos and Jun proteins. Besides the heterodimerisation process, phosphorylation of the complex is needed to achieve an efficient transcription of the target genes [22] . Activated AP-1 binds to DNA sequences with the consensus sequence 5'-TGAG/CTCA-3' [23] . The genes regulated by AP-1 are involved in cellular processes like apoptosis, cell differentiation, cell proliferation and oncogenic transformation [22] .

At time of writing, this game is an international success- with 14% of the players registered in continental Europe.
RRI Lecture
During the course of our project, we found comprehension of ideas behind responsible research and innovation (integrated human practices) as one of the most challenging areas, as we are a team composed of natural scientists, and so have not had these ideas from social science introduced to us. We also found, from our discussions with Dr Sarah Hartley, that there the social scientists she lectures, from the University of Exeter's Business School, have a lack of understanding of the natural sciences. It is important for them to develop this understanding as these are the people that scientists will be working with to create responsible research in the future. After discovering there is a large barrier created by a lack of multidisciplinary study in an undergraduate program between the social sciences and the natural sciences; we decided that we wanted to begin to bridge this gap.
We thus decided, to deliver a series of presentations which discussed the importance of the ideas in social science that are required in scientific research, mainly responsible research and innovation (RRI) and the AREA framework, which allowed us to use public engagement to express the importance of integrated human practices in scientific research. These presentations were delivered to a range of students from different disciplines to start to break down this barrier. We targeted students from undergraduate degrees in the natural sciences and the social sciences, and also students in an earlier stage of their education, currently doing their A-levels.
The presentation we developed can be viewed in the pdf version below and can be downloaded as a powerpoint presentation using this link.
The presentations were tailored to their audience to ensure the content is appropriate. In the natural sciences we presented to ‘BIO2071 - Research Skills and"

Safety
Safety has always been a major concern through our project, both in the experiments design and operations. We used two kinds of bacterium, one is Escherichia coli JM110 and the other is Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3, which belong to Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillaceae, separately. According to the official iGEM guidelines of Risk Groups, both E. coli and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens are categorized as Risk Group 1 organisms that “do not cause disease in healthy adult humans” when used properly. The safety level of our lab is P2, which is safe enough to perform all our experiments. We highly valued the individual safety, environmental safety and biological safety.
1. Individual Safety and Environmental Safety
All the iGEMers in our project have taken safety training courses in our department experiment center, which include fire-fighting strategies, disposition of biochemical materials, proper usages of microwave oven and so on.
All members have carefully read Safe Project Design, Safe Lab Work, Safe Shipment and other requirements proposed by iGEM Safety Committee.
All members are required to wear nitrile gloves, masks, closed shoes in the lab to prevent potential threats of personal health. What’s more, we separate resting areas from experiment areas and confine eating and drinking in resting areas.
Biological materials were not allowed to be taken outside the laboratory without sterilization. After sterilization, these wastes are collected and decontaminated by the specialists. Regular cleaning of our laboratory trash was arranged every day to maintain a clean and safe environment.
2. Biological Safety Concern Based on the Project
With the advent of synthetic biology, more and more genetically modified microorganisms are used for biomedical, industrial and environmental applications. Both Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and E. coli we use are safety level 1 organism. Besides, we separated our Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3 from Chinese fermented food. Still, we take steps to prevent these genetically engineered organisms' diffusions to the utmost.

Internal interactions within each Spinach molecule take place and eventually the correctly folded structure occur thus allowing the later formation of a fluorophore complex. This process is an equilibrium where about 50 to 60 percent of Spinach is in the proper folded state.
The correctly folded Spinach molecule can interact with the yellow compound DFHBI-1T to form a fluorophore complex with an excitation peak of 482nm and an emission peak at 505nm. The quantified fluorescent signal can then be converted into the absolute activity of the promoter by the means of a standard curve, copy number, stability, cell density and growth rate.

Figure 1: The transcription of the Spinach construct through folding and finally to fluorescence. The illustration is interactive and further description can be found on individual elements.
In our project we have chosen to work with an improved version of Spinach, the so-called Spinach2 . This aptamer has increased folding efficiency compared to the original Spinach. Furthermore we use a modified version of the fluorescent ligand, the DFHBI-1T . This modified fluorophore has increased brightness when bound to Spinach2 and shows spectral properties that more closely resemble GFP, which means that higher signals can be obtained using regular GFP fluorescence filters.
.
Design of Spinach Sequence
Spinach2 contains a SpeI restriction site, which makes it incompatible with the iGEM Standard Assembly protocol . In order to be able to submit Spinach2 as a BioBrick, we decided to remove the SpeI restriction site by introducing specific point-mutations into the Spinach2 sequence (see Figure 2), thereby creating two new Spinach2 versions:
We swapped an A and a U (1st Modified Spinach2, later referred to as Spinach2.1)
We exchanged a U with a C (2nd Modified Spinach2)

Summary
This week we re-organized the project objectives according to a our new                                         chronogram and replanificated our biggest goals to achieve the production and                                         purification of our proteins, also nanoparticles creation was performed. We started our production from ground zero as we were not having any positive                                         results, and as a way to troubleshoot this we made new competent cells to                                         produce our proteins. Nonetheless, the hardware prototype was finally obtained                                         and some tests were performed to get insight into it’s functionality.
Wet lab
The production and purification of RFP was successful by implementing the new                                         lysis buffer, even though, a modification in the buffer must be performed to                                         increase the lysis efficiency given that there was still red color in the                                         pellet. Using the resultant RFP we started the nano encapsulation, the result                                         was store at 4oC. We started the creation of completely new BL21 (DE3)                                         competent cells for the posterious transformations of newly ligated parts. We                                         obtained kanamycin for the implementation of psB1K3 in the ligation of BBCOL5                                         part. We performed the transformation of the new BL21 (DE3) chemocompetent                                         cells and we obtained white colonies, by that mean, we performed induction of                                         protein expression in the new colonies to completely verify the presence of our                                         proteins, for a posterious polyacrylamide gel analysis. Sadly, after the                                         incomplete subculture of L929 given by the loss of functionality of our                                         trypsin, no good cells could be incorporated into the new flask and because of                                         that we lost our cell line, for so on we must obtain another aliquot.

We researched a new lysis protocol for purification of proteins. The protocol we                                         obtained was specific for cell lysis and nickel affinity purification of E.                                         coli BL21. From that protocol we keep special attention in the lysis buffer                                         which is comprised of many reductant agents. Also in"

Background and Problem
Until now, numerous iGEM teams have proposed effective projects against harmful and fatal medical conditions. We believe that synthetic biology poses a promising option to invent robust medications and treatments, this year we have targeted the most lethal disease worldwide and utilized SynBio to be used as a safe and efficient weapon against it. We have tackled the medical disparity that is ischemia.
Briefly, what is ischemia?
Symptoms occur at the end of ischemic cascade
Ischemia, “iskhaimos” in Greek, is the fusion of words “iskho”, keep back, restrain, and “haima”, blood gaining the mean of “staunching blood”.Theoretically, ischemia is the restriction of blood supply to the tissues, generally caused by the blockage of blood movement, which causes shortage of oxygen and nutrition vital for cell metabolism and survival. Since oxygen is carried to tissues only via the blood stream, insufficient blood supply causes tissues to become starved of oxygen. In the highly aerobic tissues of the heart and brain, irreversible damage in tissues can occur in as little as 3–4 minutes at body temperature. The kidneys are also damaged at a rapid rate due to the drop in of blood flow. Also, tissues with respectively slower metabolic rates may undergo such irreversible damage after 20 minutes.
The process known as ischemic cascade is a definition of how ischemia causes tissue damage. The build-up of metabolic waste products is the main cause of damage that inevitably causes inability to maintain cell membranes, mitochondrial damage, and eventual leakage of auto-lysing proteolytic enzymes into the cells and surrounding tissues.
The blockage of bloodstream usually occurs due to a clot; therefore all risk factors that are related to the formation of clot may also contribute to this phenomenon. We can mention that the tendency of clot formation, which is also called thrombophilia, is ench"

Finishes her Ph.D. in L'Universite d'Aix Marseille II in “Infectious Diseases and Tropical Pathology”, she’s been doing a research on breast cancer stem cells and microenvironment, and HIV antiviral drugs. She’s very concerned with biosafety and risk assessment in medical research and currently she’s developing a guideline for safety and risk assessment to be applied all over Indonesia. The coolest thing is: this will be the first one Indonesia ever have! She knows about our project we’re doing in the lab, so her point of view really matters. Find out her thoughts about our project’s safety assessment and the prospect of synthetic biology development in Indonesia!
Synthetic biology has been developing in Indonesia, but actually there are many issues involved. As a developing country, Indonesia hasn’t had a safety guideline regarding research in Synthetic Biology. But luckily, Indonesian are very “easy-going” and people will try to accept it as long as it can solve problems. A prove of it is shown by a biosimilar products such as erythropoietin, diarrhea drug, and other stuffs that has been commercially published. However, many aspects should be reconsidered including ethics, sustainability, and safety. UI is currently developing a guideline for biosafety and risk assessment for the first time ever in Indonesia. For our project, some things that need to be emphasize is we need to go through more specific study of the safety of virulence gene that would be inserted in the bacteria, and for further research we have to try it in in-vitro, preclinical (animal), and even clinical (human) for the last object.
Is it ethical if you’re inserting bacteria to human body?

The sludge must be moved between two separate chambers in the Modified Bardenpho Process (Heufelder 2017), one being anoxic and the other oxygenated. Alternatively, in Sequential Batch Processing a single chamber is intermittently aerated to sustain both the aerobic and anaerobic microbes present in sludge through fluctuations in the dissolved oxygen content.
Device Implementation
Early research suggested that Pc. denitrificans was effective in some sewage treatment designs as a co-culture with N. europaea (Kokufuta; Uemoto). In this design, small amounts of ethanol must be added daily to act as an electron donor so that nitrification reaction can be sustained. Instead, we propose a single-organism sewage treatment system achieved by cloning the entire amo operon from N. europaea to express the nitrification circuit in Pc. denitrificans when under aerobic conditions (Fig. 2, 3). Our initial intent was to tie expression of nitrification genes to dissolved oxygen levels in the sewage. By design, our device would need to increase the expression of nitrification genes in response to increasing oxygen concentrations.
Having a single organism that is capable of both denitrification and nitrification will simplify the maintenance of a bioreactor and increase the efficiency of the wastewater treatment process. Pc. denitrificans is not restricted by the oxygen supply, so it is a superior competitor for space and resources under hypoxic or anoxic conditions when compared with N. europaea, which can only inhabit certain zones where the dissolved oxygen content is high enough. In the previous system, nitrates had to leave N. europaea and be absorbed by Pc. denitrificans before being converted into nitrogen gas (Kokufuta; Uemoto). By confining the nitrites to a single cellular compartment (Fig. 2, 3), they can build up and encounter denitrification enzymes sooner, making the process faster. The oxidative process of nitrification produces reduced electron acceptors sometimes in the form of quinone that can then be used as donors in the reductive denitrification steps. This will negate the need for regular infusions of electron donors.

Under aerobic conditions, the chassis will nitrify ammonia.  Denitrification of nitrates and nitrites at partial capacity, producing more nitrous oxide than nitrogen. During the"
