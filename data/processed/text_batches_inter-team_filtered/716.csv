Calgary,2018,Team:Calgary#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," develop a proof-of-concept for process units that would enable an overall production, to display that microfluidic systems have the potential to be used for the commercial manufacture of gene therapies. Our chosen modules were the Droplet Formation Module (DFM), and the Droplet Electroporation Module (DEM).
Droplet Formation Module
Droplet microfluidics is the use of microdroplets in immiscible phases in laminar flow, which offers very convenient way of handling reagents. Our motivation to develop a monodisperse droplet generator had to do with the need to use isogenic eukaryotic cell cultures in autologous gene therapies. The ability to generate and control cells in droplets would easily enable other downstream processes, such as transfection and purification. If patient cells could be encapsulated in droplets, transfected, then isogenic cell cultures could be created and extracted from those droplets. Those isogenic cultures could then be validated downstream and screened for any off-target integration (Marques, 2017).
The design for our DFM implements flow-focusing to generate droplets. Flow-focusing consists of having channels containing the droplet fluid and the continuous fluid converging at a point. There are four of these junctions on our chip, radially positioned in the interest of reducing the difference in flow resistance at any of the given paths. Droplets would then flow towards the center of the chip, and converge at the outlet.
Initially, we planned to use standard wet lithography techniques to manufacture our chips (glass microscope slides). However, early on Dr. Colin Dalton and Dr. Ebenezer Owusu-Ansah, from the Microsystems Hub at the University of Calgary, had offered guidance in refining our chips, and in the fabrication of the final designs. Dr. Owusu-Ansah engraved the channels onto glass microscope slides with a Spectra-Physics Ti:Saphire femto-second laser micromachining system. The first microscope slides we had received had irregularities in channel depth, which would clearly interfere with the production of droplets.  After many iterations,  designing a new path for the laser, and changing the substrate from a microscope glass slide to borosilicate glass, Dr. Owusu was able to develop channels with the surface profile that would be needed for droplet formation. The channel cross-section is measured to be 100 microns x 100 microns.

INTERVIEWS
From talks with art-major students to survey aiming at science-major students, from interviews with scientists from Chinese Academic of Science to collaboration with artists from Art and Science Research Center, we devoted to making our voice heard by more people outside the lab.
Art-major Student Interview
We have a talk with an art-major student from Academy of Arts & Design, Tsinghua University. Her opinion was absolutely new for us and drove us to think deeper and wider about the relationship of art and science. She told us that there have been a group of artists and art-major students attempted to create art-and-science work. Some of them had been acknowledged widely, but the depth and amount were still limited.

Prof. Pingsheng LIU Interview
To seek the most precise point to cut in, we interviewed Prof. Liu from Institute of Biophysics CAS, who is experienced in popularization of both science and art. He told us that just as Joseph L. Goldstein said in 2015 Lasker Award Ceremony, “The most original scientists (and artists) in our day discover newness by blending existing knowledge with imaginative thinking.” Art and science are connected primely by imagination. That`s exactly the original motivation of our story.

Response
George Eustice
Minister of State for Farming, Food and the Marine Environment
The Department for Environmental, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) is committed to eradicating bTB from the UK by 2038. As our project developed it was important that we had a clear understanding of the current work DEFRA is doing to eradicate bTB. To do this we met with George Eustice, the Minister of State at DEFRA and also the Conservative MP for Redruth and Camborne. We discussed in detail with George the most recent advancements DEFRA have made with bTB testing as well as explaining how we believe our test may have an impact. Furthermore we wanted to gauge how imminent policy changes may be for the UK.

George Eustice
Minister of State for Farming, Food and the Marine Environment
bTB is the UK’s largest animal health problem. As a team we decided it would be important for us to meet Mr George Eustice. We travelled down to the Penryn Campus (Exeter’s Cornwall Campus) where we hosted George. In 2014 DEFRA released the Strategy for achieving Officially Bovine Tuberculosis Free status for England4, a document that outlined exactly what the current problems are and how DEFRA is planning to tackle each individual problem. After a long morning we made sure George fully understood our work, and that we fully understood where out test may fit in with DEFRA’s work.
DEFRA Strategy
George told us how the main aim of DEFRA is to get to a stage where it is possible for the BCG vaccine to be used in the UK. Under current EU regulation it is illegal to vaccinate cattle as the Tuberculin Skin test can not differentiate between infected and vaccinated cattle. Development of a DIVA (Differentiated of Infected and Vaccinated Animals) test is a main priority for DEFRA as this would lay foundations for return of the BCG vaccine. Policy change through the EU takes years. George explained how if the UK wanted to bring the BCG vaccine back sooner it would be possible but it would mean that any UK production would be limited to the UK. The strategy states “bTB-vaccinated cattle would not be able to be traded within the EU” until a ban was lifted across the EU. UK Dairy and Beef trade with the EU is vital to the UK economy, particularly in our local"

Test of proteins production with biobrick BBa_k1951008 using a SDS PAGE and coomassie blue stain
We investigated if the FliC protein was well produced by our biobrick ( BBa_k1951008 ).
To do this we performed SDS PAGE and stained with coomassie blue using cells containing this biobrick.
From an over night starter, cells were diluted and grown from Abs(600nm)=0.2 to Abs(600nm)=0.6.
Then 1UOD of cells (1.67ml at 0.6OD) was collected and centrifuged at 5000g for 5min.
After removal of the supernatant, the cell pellet was resuspended in 50µL SDS-PAGE sample buffer.
The sample was loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel and migrated during 50min at 180V.
Staining was done using coomassie blue.
The FliC is at mass 51,3kDa, and can be seen in the gel photograph.
Proof of swimming recovery
We have made a biobrick BBa_k1951008 ables to produce Flagellin (FliC protein of the flagellum). In the aim to test the flagellin integrity, we made a fliC mutant in a E. coli W3110 strain by transduction using phage P1 ( protocol ).
In the figure the deletion mutant (lower left sector) shows no swimming motility as expected and a small white colony. In contrast the wild-type colony (lower right) has a diffuse halo due to swimming cells around the central white colony.  Finally the complemented strain, the deletion mutant complemented with our biobrick, (top panel) shows two colonies with intense halos surrounding them. This illustrated clearly that our biobrick can restore motility and is functional. The intensity of the halo suggests that a greater proportion of the cells are mobile or swimming is in someway better than the wild-type.
We investigated if swimming motility was recovered by a knockout fliC strain.  To test complementation with our biobrick ( BBa_K"

Collaboration
This summer we collaborated with the iGEM team at Northwestern University on the InterLab project. They were experiencing difficulties successfully transforming the provided InterLab DNA into their competent DH5a cells. We helped them troubleshoot their issues by providing  the protocol we used to transform the DNA. We first rehydrated the provided iGEM DNA from Kit 7 with 10µL sterile water. We then transformed the DNA into JM109 competent cells and miniprepped the colonies to recover the DNA in greater concentrations. We then used this DNA in our InterLab transformations. The transformation procedure we provided the Northwestern iGEM team is as follows: 1. Add 1µL of the appropriate InterLab DNA into 1.5mL Eppendorf tube containing DH5a competent cells 2. Incubate competent cells on ice for 30 minutes 3. Tap gently every 10 minutes 4. Heat shock DH5a competent cells by placing in 42ºC water bath for 45 seconds 5. For recovery, place cells on ice for 2 minutes 6. Add 300µL of SOC media to rescue DH5a competent cells 7. Place cells in 37ºC incubator for 1 hour 8. Spin cells in microcentrifuge at 5K rpm for 2 minutes 9. Remove the upper 200µL of supernatant fluid 10. Resuspend cells in the remaining 100µL of SOC media 11. Plate 50µL of DH5a competent cells with InterLab DNA on LB + CAM plates 12. Incubate transformed DH5a competent cells in 37ºC incubator for 16 hours Using the procedure we provided, the Northwestern iGEM team was able to successfully transform their cells and complete the InterLab study."

i) The constant was estimated from the permeability $p$ using the relation $k = p A / V$ where $A$ is the surface area and $V$ the cell volume.             We assume that the cell is spherical, yielding the constant $\ce{k_\text{dS}=0.281}$ min-1 from the permeability $\ce{p=9 \cdot 10^{-8}}$             cm s-1 [7].
j) The constant was estimated from the diffusion constant $D$ using the relation $k = D/A$ where $A$ is the surface area. Assuming that the cell           is spherical, we obtained $\ce{k_\text{dE}=1.44}$ min-1 from the diffusion constant $\ce{D=10^{7}}$ Å2/s. [8]
k) We set the lifetime of the mRNAs to 10 min, which yields the degradation rate $\lambda=0.2$ [3].
l) Protein degardation rates in E. coli vary a lot [3] and to our knowledge there exist no estimated value of the NahR degradation rate.             We choose to set the half-life of NahR to 2 hours so that it takes a similar degradation rate as the other species in the model.
m)  The half-life for the estrogen receptor ligand binding domain in mammalian cells has been shown to be more than 3 hours in the unbound state              and 1-3 hours for the ligand bound state. Usually, protein lifetimes in E. coli cells vary a lot [3] and in the absence of information and              experimental data we chose a half-life of 2 hours for both the ligand bound and unbound state.
n) The half-life of GFPs in E. coli range from a couple of minutes to hours [Bionumbers]. We set the half-life to 20 minutes.
Initial values
As the solutions to first order ordinary differential equations are not uniquely quantified unless proper initial             conditions is provided, these must be specified prior to solving the system. For our system we have chosen to set the concentrations of all species             to zero except for the gene content which is set at 83.2 nM. This can"

TEAM SPIRIT!
Our team consist of thirteen bright undergrads, working eagerly for nine months, transforming our project design into reality. With the kind help from our advisors and instructors, we managed to make the most out of our time. We learned, grew and bonded over the (most of the times) stressful hours of digestion, gel electrophoresis, PCR and ligation. These are the people whom we celebrated with when we found out the digestion release bands with right length. These are also the people who patted us in the back when we saw no GFP expression under the fluorescence microscope. We wanted YOU to know them and us better. Don't be afraid to say HI if you see us in the Regional Jamboree. Who knew, maybe we could end up doing research together in the future!

The pro-apoptotic proteins are able to express only in a controlled form using the Tetracyclin-controlled transcriptional activation system. The overexpression of these proteins can lead to Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilisation (MOMP) leading Cytochorome c release which is a point of no return in the mitochondrial pathway of Programmed Cell Death (PCD). The goal is to “switch off” the cells, which were genetically modified by us, after they “finished their work” in the recent local environment combining the components of the tetracycline-inducible system in self-contained retroviral and plasmid vectors.
Furthermore human, arthropode or C. elegans nuclear hormone receptor composite constructs can be expressed in an inducible form using Tetracyclin-controlled transcriptional activation (click to find out more about TRE) system rather than using a vector which ensures constitutive expression of the parts. In our system Tetracycline Response Element (TRE) is recognized and bound by the Tetracycline repressor (TetR) protein. The TRE consists of 7 repeats separated by spacer sequences and placed upstream of CMV minimal promoter that has basal expession in the abscence of bound TetR. Tetracycline derivatives (e.g. doxycycline) bind TetR and render it incapable of binding to TRE, thereby forcing the expression of target genes.

Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," strains without LuxAB behind gene III. For the organisation of our runs, we now use a better version of our google docs sheet. We are now documenting any problems and any results of our plaque assays and our phage detection PCRs. Plaque assays are implemented every 24 hours, while the Phage detection PCR is carried out every 12 hours. We could perform this PACE run for seven days, like planed before. After seven days, plaque assays were performed and single plaques were picked. The N-terminal domain of the T7 RNAP was amplified using PCR reaction. PCR product was send to GATC for sequencing analysis. This run did also not yield any mutations. On the one hand we therefore used an PCR on the phage supernatant, while on the other hand using single plaques as implemented before. Both methods showed no mutations, which is why we evaluated most of the parts. Especially the mutagenesis plasmid could be or should be the most probable problem. Calculations of the amount of arabinose used for induction in our PACE device and the original Dickinson-PACE leaded to the finding that we are using only 4 - 6,5 mM Arabinose instead of 30-40 mM which is used in Dickinson-PACE. This underlines the hypothesis that we are using not enough arabinose to induce the MP in a sufficient way.
PREDCEL:
First experiment:
Test the general induction of MP with different arabinose & glucose concentrations
Inoculate 20 different cultures with a bacteria from Stock
0, 5, 12.5 and 25 mM Glucose
0, 6, 12.5, 20 and 31 mM Arabinose
Read-out: time until the cultures reaches OD 0.6 - 0.8
Results:
only the cultures without arabinose reached the OD in sufficient time
all other cultures needed more than 30 hours for growing up Second experiment:
Let a culture with Glucose grow until it reaches OD 0.6
Let it cool on ice and split into 4 ml cultures with different concentrations of glucose (0 mM, 12,5 mM, 25 mM) and arabinose (0 mM, 6 mM, 25 mM)
Read-out: Incubate again and measure OD at different time points
Results:
differences in OD are small (probably due to high glucose concentrations)
Higher arabinose concentrations result in lower ODs Use PREDCEL for induction of mutagenesis and mutations

Peking,2017,Team:Peking#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"Symposium with HZAU
On 6th August, our team leader had a face-to-face conversation with a member from XMU and talked                     quite a lot about the foundation, organization and management of an iGEM team, in which we both                     gave some valuable advice to each other.
Discussion with XMU
In June, our instructor presented the Peking iGEM at the Asian Leader Workshop held by the Hong Kong                     University of Science and Technology. He had deep discussions with a number of other Asian teams                     there.
Mentor High School Teams
This year, we mentored a high-school team, BNDS China, from July to October. We offered them not only             guidance in fundamental molecular laboratory operations, but also experimental materials such as the             expression vector for Repressor Generator, and corresponding primers, as well as all enzymes and laboratory             equipment.
Mentoring BNDS China students to do an experiment
Additionally, we had several face-to-face discussions with other high-school teams, such as RDFZ-China, SDSZ, and HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou, helping them to design their projects.
Helping Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou with their obstacles
Offer Material Help
During the 4th CCiC, we found out that SCU-China is also using a repressilator in their project. We             therefore started in-depth communication from then on. As they faced some difficulties in knocking out the clpXP operon of E. coli, we offered them the E. coli DHL708 ΔclpXP strain,             which was a kind gift from Jahan Paulsson. SCU-China also gave us some valuable suggestions and help in             testing the mutant strains.

Chimeric receptor design
A major hindrance for functional expression of ORs has been that  the receptors did not localize in the membrane or that the downstream coupling of the receptor to the Gα did not work properly. It has been shown that the rat olfactory receptor 17 (R17) that responds to octanal can be functionally expressed in many different cell types, including S. cerevisiae [6].  Earlier research investigated on the question whether the RI7 sequence can be used to functionally express other ORs. Sequence analysis of ORs have shown that the N-termini of the receptor are involved in plasma membrane localization, whereas the C-termini generally define the specificity for G protein interaction [7]. Based on this observations Radhika et al. functionally expressed  a chimeric OR with the N-terminus and the C-terminus of the RI7 sequence. A schematic picture is shown in figure 2. In this iGEM project we use the same approach as Radhika et al. by substituting the receptor termini with the RI7 sequences.

Take a flask of 0.8% up to 1.5% molten agarose from the 70oC stove.
Pour a it in a taped gel tray.
Add ca. 5 ul of SYBRSafe (depending on size gel)
Add a comb and let the gel harden for ca. 15 minutes.
Remove the comb and the tape and put the gel tray in an electrophoresis tray.
Add enough 1x TBE to completely cover the gel.
Add DNA loading buffer to your samples and load them.
Let the gel run at a voltage between 60V and 120V, depending on desired resolution/time available.
Visualize the DNA by putting it in the imager for taking a picture, or if you want to cut out your DNA, put it on the blue light emitter.
Fluorescence Measurements
Back to top
The samples to be tested are cultured from plates in 2ml of the Basal Minimal Medium with appropriate antibiotics and incubated overnight at 37°C at 175 rpm.
The culture is next day checked for OD600 and then diluted to 100 times in a 96 well plate by the same medium with antibiotics.
The plate is then first read at OD600 and is then incubated again at 37°C with medium shaking for around 3 hours.
The plate is then taken out and read at OD600 based on which the cultures are diluted to 10 times which must be around (0.1) with calculated samples induced with 0.1mM IPTG and 0.2mM IPTG.
The plate reader is then read by the automatically repeating protocol with shaking at medium speed created by BioTek Synergy.
The program does the following:
Set Temperature to 37°C
In a kinetic loop of fixed time (We used 2 hour 30 mins or 16 hour 30 mins) following measurements are taken in a time interval of 10 minutes or 20 minutes with shaking: Absorbance (600 nm filter) and Fluorescence (485nm and 520nm for GFP).
Then a delay of 100 seconds is made.

Figure 5. The voltage of MFC with K1755301 (Room temp 25 ℃)
The results above show a significant difference of the voltage output at around 120 min. After 240 min, the voltage output became closer. So, the Cu2+ sensing part proves to be functional.
We can see that the E.coli, modified by the part they constructed can sense the concentration of Cu ions in different labs normally.  The data shows typically consistent.This also indicates the biological component of LZU-China’s “Micro saHolmes” measurement system has nice accessibility and portability.(Table-1)

You can also get these data from their wiki pages.
Moreover, we invited Shenzhen University to evaluate the usability of non- biology components in our system. After received our components, following our protocol, they assembled the device independently and operated the ""Micro Holmes System"" successfully.
Here, we present their results as follows:
LZU-China also sent us the major components of their “Micro Holmes” device (including the pcDuino board, the voltage magnification circuit board, the analogue-to-digital Conversion chip, and the touch screen). So we can help them verify the accessibility and the portability of their device. According to their specification, we successfully connected these electronic components, start the device and tested the software pre-installed in their pcDuino board. Although most functions of their device can work normally, there were also some small bugs. For example, in the “initialization” UI, they put the “concentration” title in front of the “Output Voltage”. We reported these bugs to them, and they correct them.
You can also get these data from their wiki pages.
Future
In this year’s competition, we constructed a series of sensors to measure the pollutant in water. We have added the E.coli-based Cu ions sensor to the MFC and it was proved that the device can sense the Cu ions concentration. Although we have completed the primary goal, we still have much work to do.
Our device can only detect the concentration of the pollutant while it cannot detect which pollution it is. We will couple the device with a system to monitor which pollutant it is before measuring the concentration. Different chromoproteins can be used in the system to"

Week 1: Ideation
During the first week, we tried to come up with ideas that we can work on. After long discussions and much debate, we finally decided to work on an issue that we think is quite relevant not only in our country but also in many developing and developed countries — that of stinking public toilets. For our inspiration and project summary, see the
project description
.
Week 2: Ground Reality
During this week, we decided to approach different NGOs and organizations that are involved in promoting and providing better sanitation. Sulabh International is an India-based NGO that promotes and provides better sanitation by building public pay and use toilets and community toilets. To understand and evaluate the feasibility of our idea and to understand the ground reality, we decided to meet with a representative of Sulabh International. Details of our interaction with this NGO can be found on our

Week 3: We step into the lab!
Week 3, and we step into the lab!
During the first week in the lab, we learnt about the techniques and the principles behind them. It marked our first foray into the world of synthetic biology and it was great fun learning and performing these experiments.
1. Wet lab begins! We learn about different kinds of growth media, composition and their significance.
2. Introduction to agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA quantification methods.
Additionally, we learnt the precautions to follow while handling ethidium bromide containing gels and their disposal procedures. 3. We also kicked off our very first step towards establishing our proof of concept — extracting genomic DNA from Escherichia coli BW25113. We checked the size of the extracted product by agarose gel electrophoresis.
5ul and 10ul of the extracted products were loaded in lanes 1, 3 and 2, 4 respectively.
Week 4:The idea!
Glutamine synthetase (glnA), and the smaller and bigger subunits of glutamate synthetase (gltD and gltB, respectively) were our genes of primary interest. All the three genes of interest were amplified from E. coli BW25113 genomic DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR products were loaded and run on 1% agarose gel to check for the correct sizes of these three genes (g"

Bob McDonald Interview
Interview Transcript
Angela gave a brief description of iGEM, how we are mining porcupine microbiome for genes that can be inserted into E. coli for glucose production and how it can be fed into a bioreactor with yeast to produce ethanol. Bob: What is the advantage of doing it that way over the way ethanol is produced now? Angela: It’s cleaner and more efficient, it is low maintenance, can produce large quantity without people looking over it constantly. It is also low pollution. Bob: I think a lot of ethanol now is produced from corn, isn’t it? You’re saying making it from cellulose? Angela: Yes, because cellulose is a waste product, and especially in Canada, in Atlantic Canada we have a great lumber industry, so we do have a lot of the waste just lying around. Nowadays we are just putting them into landfills just to get rid of them, but we are proposing another innovative idea that we can just utilize the waste and turn it into fuel. Bob: Sounds great. So what do you need to ask me? Angela: We are thinking of asking you about scientific communication. Because we have encountered instances where it is hard to get the audience engaged in the sciences and what we are doing. Sometimes they find it difficult and hard to talk to us. There seems to be a divide between scientific language and what they are used to. So we do want some of your insight on how to engage the public and how to reach out to more people to spread the love of science. Your radio program is good at doing that, so we want your advice on that. Bob: We have a couple of criteria on our program and really what it is is storytelling. Telling a story, and stories have characters, stories have plotlines, stories have a location, a setting of some kind, and you see there is some kind of tension there, this is storytelling. You’ve got to frame your story. And in your case, what you are doing is really neat, this is really great. But before you start talking about cellulose, about bioreactors, and enzymes, and all that scientific jargon, you’ve got to set the stage"

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," the need of synthetic biology outreach, we wanted to see what people know about blue green algae and if it has caused problems for them. All of interviewed people were familiar with it but didn’t know much about the health or economic problems it causes. Still, as each of the interviewed people had encountered blue-green algae, it means that our project can touch their lives and why not to facilitate their life in the future?
We didn’t change much in our project topic itself based on the interviews but we increased the importance of talking to the public. Additionally, as we learned how restricted the knowledge about our topic is, we have been able to adjust our presentations better for the audiences. Some of the most important modifications we did in our presentations to people with little biological background was dismissing almost all scientific terms, assuming no background information, focusing on what we can achieve with our project instead of the exact methodology, and leaving more time for questions. One result of our efforts to communicate with the non-scientific community was our project introduction video “Matti and the cyanobacteria” found on our Project page.
iGEM meetups
We participated in two iGEM meetups, the ones in Stockholm and Paris, which gave us many of things to consider in our project. In Stockholm we participated in an ethics workshop. This gave us a lot to think, since our project’s final product was designed to be a genetically engineered organism used outside the lab. We want to stir up the conversation about GMO legislation, and be part of the discussion about how GMOs could be used outside of the lab and by general public. More about our ethical considerations can be read below.
In both meetups, we were presented with the idea of patenting one’s work. In Stockholm, the SDU team couldn’t present their full project because they were in the process of patenting it. In Paris we participated in a panel discussion where part of the discussion was about patents and the openly communicated nature of iGEM projects. After hearing about this, we reconsidered our project from a broader point of view and decided to look into business aspects of it. Although neither the topic of our project nor the nature of iGEM made patenting seem like a relevant concern, we nevertheless thought it would be useful to gain an understanding of this aspect. We met up with Merja Penttilä from VTT to discuss these subjects. We received a lot of valuable information which would prove useful if at some point our project was developed forward and commercialization was a relevant question.

We can see that the production of BC increases the more we inhibit the enzymes G6PD and PGI, so we can assume this model is correct. However, we cannot say it is the most appropriate to our case since it has not been corroborated with the experiments. We managed, though, to create the basis for a future more precise model."

Implementation
      Although many bacteria require low concentrations of heavy metals, high levels of copper and other heavy metals can be toxic to many bacteria including E. coli. Previous research has indicated that copper may induce the formation of free radicals, which can cause damage to the cell (Rodriguez-Montelongo et al. 1993). This poses a problem when attempting to use E. coli to remove heavy metals from water. It is possible to bypass this problem by using the protein YiaT anchor system designed by Han and Lee to bind and sequester copper outside the cell (2014). YiaT is a surface protein in E. coli. Han and Lee discovered that when truncated at the arginine residue 232 (R232), the Pseudomonas lipase could be fused to the new C-terminal end of YiaT to make a functional fusion protein (2014). Using this anchor system, it is theoretically possible to place a copper binding protein, or any other heavy metal binding protein, to the outside of E. coli.

Current Methods
      Currently, the removal of copper from water is accomplished through a slew of methods ranging from large-scale and industrious technologies to small-scale household friendly products. These technologies can be grouped into three overarching categories: chemical remediation, phytoremediation and microbial remediation. Although each of these methods is successful to a degree in removing copper from water, none exist without detrimental pitfalls (Akpor & Muchie, 2010).  Chemical remediation encompasses chemical precipitation and ion exchange. Both of these methods are readily available for commercial use however, they require corrosive chemicals, and produce large volumes of toxic sludge which must be treated and removed. The treatment-removal process is challenging in an aqueous environment and extremely costly. Furthermore, the solubility of metal hydroxides poses the problem of precipitating one heavy metal out of solution, and another back in due to their individual"

The smart map, a module in order to arrange nodes automatically, depends on codes about force layout in d3.js heavily.
Plugin Units
We use d3.js for data visualization in plugins, in BLAST we build a more user-friendly interface way for user to understand the Blast result fluently, in Simulation d3.js is also used for data visualization and unit mapping. D3.js’s selector and data-unit oriented model mapping tool can accelerate develop process a lot. Plugins use jQuery’s ajax to transfer data asynchronously so you can use the UI fluently without suspend the page while requesting data.
Backend Technology
Framework
Our backend is written in Python3, which is easy to be deployed on either Windows or UNIX-based systems. We use Flask as our web server framework, which provides many fantastic and reliable extensions such as flask-login, a secure flask extension for managing user logins. Mysql or any other relational database can be connected to our system, storing user data and synthetic biology database which can be updated whenever you want.
Plugin System
We have implemented a plugin system which is very easy to use. Any developers can fork our example plugin to write their own plugins, even if they only know little about Python. You can write a plugin for your lab or modify an existing plugin. Plugins can be easily enabled or disabled by editing the plugin list file. Even our official tools are running as plugins, so that you can enable and disable any of them whenever you want to fit the special requirements of your lab.
Continuous Integration & Deployment
Our development is based on Git version control with multiple branches. All pushed commits will be automatically tested on our test server at once and we can see the testing result soon. Besides unit tests, our test server will also process code analyzing to prevent fault codes and ensure that all classes and functions are well composed. When all is done, the new docker image will be generated automatically on DockerHub so that anyone can install and run our program with only one command.

Harvard_BioDesign,2016,Team:Harvard BioDesign#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," mediator helps shuttle these electrons from the anode to the cathode, producing voltage signal. We had to choose an exogenous mediator that would be efficiently reduced, which is shown qualitatively through color change.  Thus we had to run a preliminary test to determine which exogenous mediator type and concentration would be optimal for our microbial fuel cell. Because we wanted to test with a bacteria known to work with exogenous mediators, we ran this preliminary test with E. Coli. We tested two strains of E. Coli (C2566H and C2530H), with two different types of exogenous mediators (methylene blue and neutral) at 6 different concentrations (0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, 0.001, 0.0005). We put either methylene blue or neutral red into a plate reader with the E. Coli overnight to observe which condition would result in the largest reduction of methylene blue or neutral red. The largest color change would indicate that the bacteria had efficiently reduced the exogenous mediator. The image below shows that the best exogenous mediator type and concentration is methylene blue at 0.005. We determined this based on which well had the biggest color change. Additionally, we consulted with Dr. Erika Parra, an MFC expert, to confirm our results.
Exogenous mediator reduction test
TPA can be detected through electrical signal
Our final step in showing that we can produce an electrical signal from TPA was to demonstrate a voltage surge in an actual microbial fuel cell using D. tsuruhatensis, methylene blue, and terephthalic acid. To do this, we set up a MFC with D. tsuruhatensis growing in M9 minimal salts medium and methylene blue. After the voltage of D. tsuruhatensis in the presence of methylene blue and M9 plateaued, we injected terephthalic acid into the mix. Our graph below shows that after adding terephthalic acid, the voltage spikes from just below 90mV to around 120mV. This demonstrates that D. tsuruhatensis and the exogenous mediator are successfully working together in the microbial fuel to produce electricity from terephthalic acid, and that we are able to read out a signal from the presence of terephthalic acid.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html," the technology.   The device itself will be made entirely from plastic, a material that is thought to be undesirable due to the difficulties in its disposal. This is due to plastic being of a xenobiotic nature, making it generally recalcitrant to microbial degradation Fewson CA. Biodegradation of xenobiotic and other persistent compounds: the causes of recalcitrance. Cell. 1988. . Following these concepts, we can identify the following set of criteria for the desired material:
Solar exposure. The material covering the solar cell, must allow sunlight to pass through to reach the bacteria.
UV resistance. As the material will be exposed to the sun, it must be resistant to the UV radiation.
Bacterial growth The material must neither be growth inhibitory, nor toxic to the bacteria.
Easy to mold. The outside of the device could be molded depending on the circumstances, as the device only relies on the bacterial technology.
Durability. The device will be located outside, meaning that the material must be able to withstand hard conditions and heavy weight.
Temperature. The material must allow for an appropriate constant temperature for the bacteria, despite the variations in sun exposure.
Longevity. We would like for the material to have as long a durability as possible, since replacing the device could prove cumbersome. We are aiming for at least twenty years of durability.
Price. We are looking for a material that is as cheap as possible, without sacrificing the necessary criteria.
Environmentally friendly. Considering the goal of this project being the creation of an environmentally friendly energy source, the ideal material would be as green as possible.
Interview with Flemming Christiansen
For the purpose of finding the necessary materials for our prototype, we contacted one of the leading plastic experts in Denmark, Flemming Christiansen , who acts as the market development manager of SP Moulding. He has been acting as a plastics consultant since his graduation as a master of science in Engineering, with a speciality in plastics. A meeting was quickly arranged for the purpose of confirming our criteria, the technical design, the material, and the possible price of creating the PowerLeaf.
In accordance with our established criteria, Mr. Christiansen suggested that we use the plastic known as Polycarbonate, specifically Lexon 103R-III Polycarbonate . Unfortunately, the material cannot fulfil the criteria on its own. He therefore suggested that we take a few liberties with it. In order to prevent UV degradation to the exposed parts, we will be adding certain additives to the surface. This increases the UV resistance of the device, without hindering the sunlight from reaching the bacteria.

The part is an coding sequence for an anti-microbial peptides linked to a mussel-foot protein-linked to superfolder GFP for localization. The mussel foot protein will anneal to surfaces as a wet glue and superfolder GFP will allow for florescence imaging and localization. In order to use this part you can produce it in a TAG recoded organism simultaneously expressing a Tyrosine supressor or L-DOPA orthogonal translational system. In order to purify you can use the 2X Strep tag and strep column and later cleave with enterokinase to remove the sequence supressing LL-37 antimicrobial action.

Bidirectional cooperation
Collaboration
Collaboration plays an important role among iGEMers, for we have become companions with reciprocity interactions. This year, we have done collaborations with NCTU_Formosa iGEM team.
The new iGEM team
NCTU_Formosa started to introduce experiments which is related to iGEM to the science-gifted class of Taichung First Senior High School(TCFSH) since April 14. Gradually, the background knowledge of synthetic biology was adequate, then the cogitation of combination to engineering and biology was shared, the core of the gene regulation, the design of biobricks were taught. What's more, they introduce previous project from NCTU_Formasa, giving us the prospect of the competition.
Learning the progress
The instructor of NCTU_Formosa, Pro. Wen-Liang Chen, invited us to learn about biology to our lab in the last semester. NCTU_Formosa then gave us a series of training, the SOP of NCTU_Formosa's wet lab protocol, including Cultivation of E. Coli, Miniprep, Digestion, Ligation, Transformation, PCR, and Gel Electrophoresis.
Participate in iGEM
We decided to participate in iGEM this year, as the first year of TCFSH_Taiwan. NCTU_Formasa members taught us many things such as useful databases (NCBI, Uniport), useful tools for protein (BLAST, COBALT, CD search), biology experiment design and debug, and write biobricks for synthesis.

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

Adding Biobricks to the Parts Library of Shanghaitech
We provided our three promoter parts constructed this year for Shanghaitech, helping to build up their parts library of input and output biobricks. Shanghaitech is aiming at creating an intercellular connection between bacteria containing different input/output circuits. We are looking forward to more data showing the performance of our input elements working with their system.

Offering Biobricks to RDFZ-China
Biobricks to an iGEM project is like bricks to a skyscraper, without which a project cannot even start. This is why when RDFZ-China asked us for some essential biobricks, we offered without hesitation. This year, RDFZ-China is paying attention to helping solve the petroleum leakage issue in the soil. Rather awesome!

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

LMU-Munich,2014,Team:LMU-Munich#Team#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," for BBa_K823005 compared to BBa_K823012 . Having a closer look at the BBa_I20260 device, the utilization of the low to medium-copy plasmid pSB3K3 explains the lower expression of GFP compared to BBa_K823005 , despite containing the same insert.
Outlook
The LMU-iGEM team is looking forward to the presentation of iGEM HQ results, where we hope to see a mixture of different methods utilized - hopefully with similar outcomes.  We are curious how the absolute and relative results might differ; this might be a milestone towards ensuring reproducibility of scientific data produced by a huge number of different labs and methods.
Collaboration with Team Groningen
On August 1st, not only the collaboration with the Rathenau Instituut but also the cooperation with iGEM Team Groningen , was kicked off. During the first group chat with the Rathenau Institute, we were introduced to members of the iGEM Team Groningen that had with their 'Lacto Aid' a quite similar project idea to our BaKillus. As we pursue the same idea but work with different chassis, different targets and aim for different applications, we decided not to see them as rivals but rather use that chance to learn from their experiences and also support them, when help is required. From then on, we held regular Skype meetings and supported each other by exchanging views and thoughts about the feasibility and social desirability of our applications inspired by the guidelines of the Rathenau scenarios. Encouraged by this first steps, we also helped each other out in the lab.
Efforts of team Groningen
As our BaKillus targets Staphylococcus aureus, but we do not have access to S2 laboratories, and thus unfortunately cannot experiment with this bacterium. Our collaboration partner kindly provided us help by testing the subtilin producer Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633 in a spot-on-lawn assay on different S. aureus strains, including MRSA. Fortunately, the results could prove subtilin has inhibitory impact on S.aureus and thus, serves as excellent killing strategy for our project.

The results are part of our killing subproject and can be seen here or detailed information downloaded here .

DTU-Denmark,2018,Team:DTU-Denmark#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," project stood solidly when going to the faculty to get approved, and also for when sending out funding applications, we needed to have the high schools behind them supporting the CHSS project.
The participants would come from different high schools and conduct their research at DTU. The high schools were chosen based on location compared to DTU, the general level of education and competitiveness, as well as the level of science taught.
It did not take very long until a total of seven high schools had shown interest and so, the search for funding began. To get a strong head-start, we decided to apply for a three-year period. Many hours were spent in perfecting the applications since we knew it was a lot of money to ask for.
As we neared the Giant Jamboree we had gotten several recommendations written for our fond application and it was sent out. The entire team is waiting anxiously for the answer in January as everyone sees the great potential in a high school team.
Priming the Next Generation
In the early months of our iGEM project, Tenna from our team was recognized by her old science teacher from her elementary school from seven years ago. He was delighted that one of his students had been inspired by his teachings and had chosen a career in science. They agreed that back then, the chances of being inspired and learn about different branches of science, such as biology, had been lacking.
It was between the two of them that our project, ‘Priming the Next Generation’, began.
As a part of our community engagement, we embarked on this journey of presenting the many possibilities in biotechnology and its intriguing applications to make the world a better place to ninth graders in elementary school.
Lina, Tenna, and Jacob began the venture with three classes, a total of 60 students, who were all very eager to learn the advantages and capabilities that biotechnology holds in transforming our everyday life. After a short introduction to iGEM and our project, we spent some time learning and talking about subjects such as: Medical microbiology, bioinformatics, astrobiology, and synthetic biology. We wanted to illuminate the wide variety of subjects of biotechnology. and remove the stigma that biotechnology is “only bacteria and yeast”.
We proceeded to teach the students about existing projects, among these were some old iGEM projects from DTU, and what their possibilities with regards to education and careers in Denmark are. After the introduction of what you could do with synthetic biology, a discussion began between the students with what a possible project could be. No ideas were too “out there” and Tenna, Lina"

NJU-China,2017,Team:NJU-China#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," biocompatible with the immune system, they are capable of delivering siRNA to specific cellular environments without bringing cytotoxicity or triggering the immune response. To ensure that exosomes can transport siRNAs to targeted tissues, we redesigned natural exosomes through genetic modification.
We engineered our chassis, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, to express a fusion protein composed of the exosome membrane protein Lamp2b and a white fat tissue-targeted short peptide (tPep). Lamp2b (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2b) is a protein ubiquitously expressed on the surface of exosomes. tPep is a specific ligand to the prohibitin that is abundantly located on the surface of adipocytes. By genetically linking the tPep to the outer membrane portion of Lamp2b, tPep can make its entrance on the surface of exosomes. Through these modifications, exosomes will be allowed to identify and target neuronal cells by binding exosome surface tPep to prohibitin on adipocytes.
We connected tPep to Lamp2b using a glycine-linker to construct our fusion protein and promoted its expression by the promoter Pcmv. Then, our site-specific exosomes could deliver siRNA to brain tissue.
Assembly
By expressing adipocyte-targeting peptide on the surface of exosomes, filling exosomes with BCL2 siRNA, we will harvest a large amount of exosomes targeted to the adipose tissues carrying BCL2 siRNA inside. When the modified exosomes are injected into the bloodstream, the exosomes will specifically identify adipocytes and fuse with them under the direction of the tPep. Once siRNAs get access into adipocytes, they will degrade BCL2 mRNA by base-pairing, resulting in a sharp decrease in BCL2s and thus an increase in apoptosis. Theoretically, the delivery of BCL2 siRNA to the targeted cells will be achieved, whereas non-specific uptake of BCL2 siRNA in other tissues will be avoided. Consequently, the increase of apoptosis will enable the treated animal (in our case, mice) to lose weight successfully.

Q2. What should we do to get the pesticide permit?
Most countries share the similar application process to permit the new pesticide.
Pantide is a new biorepellent so it might be determine whether it is a biopesticide or not. If it belongs to pesticide, we first need to confirm what kind of pesticide we made. In most countries like Taiwan and the USA, Pantide belongs to the category of the biopesticide, while some countries, EU and Japan included, consider that there are no viable bacteria in the Pantide, so it applies to the regulation of the chemical pesticide.
Second, the pesticide and the production plant must be tested to be safe. Finally, the pesticide must be registered with the related government institution before they can be distributed commercially. A registration application must include information regarding testing, the identity of the product, draft labeling, information on tolerance of residues, and other safety-related information.

Q3. Is there any related application to the biopesticide?
In Taiwan, to get the government permit, the laboratory need to get the Good Laboratory Practice Application (GLP) first. GLP regulates the safety and the quality of the laboratory in a manufacturing company.
Besides to the permit from the government, there is an application called MIT Smile application, which means the product is made in Taiwan during the whole process.
In the US, the most important application to food and drugs is FDA application given by the Food and Drug Administration. This application shows the product confirms the regulations and meets the safety level.

Basic Parts
Three different types of basic parts were used to construct our CryoBricks: promoters, ribosome binding sites (RBSes) and coding regions. This page contains information on their purpose in the project. Emphasis is placed on the reason why we selected these particular parts, and in case of the coding regions, the biological function of the encoded protein. For more information on the constructs into which these parts were combined, refer to the composite parts page.
Promoters
Several criteria were considered in selecting promoters for use in our CryoBricks. An ideal promoter would be: available from the parts registry, so that we can easily obtain and incorporate it; active at low temperatures, so that it works when we need it to; and positively regulated, so it won't be active unless we want it to. A search for promoters that matched one or more of these criteria resulted in the following selection:
pLacI
The Lac operon's promoter, which is often used to induce expression of proteins from plasmids artificially transformed into E. coli. Literature has numerous examples of this promoter being used to (over)express proteins at low temperatures, and it's available from the registry as BBa_R0010 . Unfortunately, it's not positively regulated, but its activity can be controlled to a certain extent. It's negatively regulated by the LacI protein, and as such can be stimulated by repressing LacI with IPTG or lactose. However, it will be active constitutively in strains that don't express LacI.
pBAD
The promoter of the araBAD operon. Its biological function is similar to that of pLacI; in its natural context, it activates transcription of enzymes involved with the consumption of a carbon source, when this carbon source is available to the cell. Its activity is mediated by the AraC protein, which either activates of represses expression, depending on the concentration of L-arabinose. [1] The pBAD promoter is available from the registry as BBa"
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," T.et al, 2017 ). This method relies on a technique called nested PCR. Nested PCR is PCR modified to reduce non-specific amplification due to unexpected primer binding. To do this, nested PCR requires two sets of primers that are used in two successive rounds of PCR. Here, the second primer set allows for amplification of a secondary target within the product produced in the first round.
However, gene doping consists of a plethora of possible changes in a plethora of possible genes. Currently more than 200 genes have been identified that are involved in the development of physical performance ( Moran et al, 2017 ). Together, they form a technical challenge that requires enormous versatility in the detection method design. This is where nested PCR, requiring 4 known primers per target site, is hard to extend and a main point of improvement for gene doping detection methods.
2.2 Whole Genome Sequencing
A more extensive alternative to nested PCR is whole genome sequencing as an approach to tackle gene doping. One of the laboratories working on the use of this technique against gene doping is the group of professor Hidde Haisma at Groningen University. With the current technologies however, sequencing all genomes of the participating athletes in the 2016 Rio Olympic Games would cost up to 37 years ( Jain, M. et al, 2018 ), making WGS into a not very realistic solution. Therefore, efficiency is an important design requirement that we improve on.
3. ADOPE: the Ultimate Solution
Our product has been shaped under the influence of many stakeholders . In this way we integrated all design requirements in our comprehensive gene doping method that has the potential to combat gene doping now and in the future. During the complete process we have been working closely together with the Dutch Doping Authority, that amongst others led us to include our prescreening method.
Figure 1. The overview of our product with design the requirements.
“The initial costs are not very important in doping detection development. What does matter is that we should be able to efficiently upscale the detection.”
We also created a VR explanation of the prescreen in use to inform future users of our method.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#EricDesign_-_-_TEXT.html,"6 ). This effect can be used as a tool for engineering membrane permeability by knocking out or overexpress both genes. A knockout would lead to an increased permeability and one could think of an opposite effect in case of overexpression, but this has not been shown yet.
INP1
The INP1 knockout was designed after the skype call of Prof Dueber, who recommended us, decoupling of peroxisomes from cytoskeleton in order to improve the secretion efficiency. INP1 is responsible for the tethering of peroxisome, which would inhibit the secretion of peroxisomes.
POT1
The only protein, which is imported by the Pex7 import machinery in saccharomyces is the 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (POT1). A knockout of POT1 would enable utilizing the Pex7 import for proteins of interest, which cannot be tagged at the C-terminus with pts1, without having unintended import of other enzymes.
Genomic integration of our novel Pex5 import receptor
After testing our new Pex5 import systems, which is completely orthogonal to the natural import, the next step would be to replace the endogenous system with our artificial import system. Therefore, an integration plasmid was designed with help of the previously described yeast toolbox, containing HO locus homologies and a hygromycin resistance (Figure 4). Afterwards the plasmid was transformed into the yeast strain which was created by our collaboration partner Aachen (double knockout strain Pex5 & Pex7).
Figure 4: Design of integration plasmid for integrating our orthogonal Pex5 import receptor.
Therefore, an integration plasmid was designed with help of the previously described yeast toolbox, containing HO locus homologies and a hygromycin resistance
The resulting yeast strain allows full control over the peroxisomal matrix proteome, by replacing the whole protein import machinery, which is the first step for creating our artificial compartment.
Outlook
Besides the genome engineering approaches, which were performed in our project one could think of more radical strategies for peroxisomal engineering. A final goal could be a “minimal peroxisome”, which contains only the proteins that are required for the biogenesis of the peroxisome and import of proteins and metabolites. On the one hand peroxisomal pathways could be redirected to cytosol or other organelles and one the other hand endogenous metabolic pathways could be redirected to our novel artificial compartment by changing the protein localization signal in the yeast genome with help of the Cas9"

Collaborations
This summer, as the UCL iGEM team, we really knew that the sky was the limit! And we knew that to do so, one must aim high and far, and that involves working with people outside your own geographic area and discipline. Not only that, one of the criteria for GOLD is the collaborations with other universities participating in iGEM competition. We did aim to make this project as multidisciplinary as possible, involving people with a variety of background and skills. Our collaboration took multiple forms, from the development of new standards for Parts Registry and user-friendly Parts, to the ethics aspect by filling out surveys of other iGEM teams.
Art & Design Institutes
From the beginning, we have been working very closely with students from both Slade school of Arts and Central Saint Martin's College of Art & Design. They have been an integral part of all the design and artistic aspects of our project from that of the poster, to the wiki page and T-shirts etc. It has been a great challenge to bring individuals from outside are discipline, and introduce them to our work and enable them to understand the prime elements of what we are doing so that they can then grasp this and be able to put it in some sort of artistic form.

Overview
On September 28, 2018, we came to the Gongnongbing primary school which was located in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province. The purpose of this meeting was to popularize the knowledge of synthetic biology and introduce our case to pupils in grade four. Leading teacher - Mr. Zeng, the keynote speaker - captain Pan, and five other members went together. The OUC-China had provided us with a beautiful brochure for this presentation.
First, we briefly explained the structure and application of each part of Escherichia coli (E. coli). What's more, we further encouraged children to think about how to reconstruct E. coli. Engineering bacteria were vividly likened to the 'ship' with different functions - 'E. coli ship'. And the 'blueprint' of 'E. coli ship', which called plasmid, determined its function. In the form of comics, we showed the process of duplication, transcription and translation in E. coli, making it easier for schoolchildren to understand what happened in the 'E. coli ship'.
Secondly, we introduced several famous 'E. coli ship' in the world.  Then, the concept of synthetic biology was introduced in simple language, so that pupils can be aware of the role of engineering bacteria directly.
Besides, we also designed interactive sessions for children, such as drawing their own imaginary 'E. coli ship'.
Last but not least, we introduced our case -- 'secured message transmission by yeast', and demonstrated our program on the spot, which enabled English and the 'language of yeast' to mutual transformation. Accompanied by a warm atmosphere, pupils enthusiastically participated in the interactive session.
In this presentation, we not only publicized our case, but also spread the concept of synthetic biology. With our careful explanation and vivid demonstration, the students in the"

Aims
• Choose a method of cell immobilisation
• Design final biosensor based on consumer needs
Development:
• Initial sketches were done.
• iGEM Hamburg rendered our plate and 3D printed it for us.
Outcomes
• A latex nanoporous coating method on a paper base was chosen.
• A fruit sticker, industrial sticker, and plate design were all chosen as the final designs.
Impact
• Biosensor strips will be biodegradable.
• Interactions with other systems evaluated.
Overview
KEEP FRESH embodies the final biosensor device. The SENSE and EXPRESS elements were first assembled in a plasmid so the function of the overall biocircuit could be tested. Following this, various engineering considerations such as selectivity and specificity were taken into account, along with government policies surrounding GMOs, to design a feasible product with viable real-life applications. APPLIED DESIGN follows the technology and design selection process, and evaluates the impact of the biosensor on the environment.
Biocircuitry: final construct
Circuitry
Once the SENSE and EXPRESS elements of our project were optimised, the final task was to assemble them together as a final construct to create the biosensor circuitry. The genetic function of the biosensor acts like a circuit, as can be seen in the plasmid diagram below.
Activation of the biosensor occurs when the SENSE elements are switched on in the presence of ethylene. EtnR2 binds to ethylene and causes the phosphorylation of EtnR1. This complex binds to promoter DNA to also activate transcription of downstream DNA. In this circuit, the EXPRESS part of the system encapsulates this downstream segment. The expression of amilCP causes a visually perceivable colour change from white to blue. KEEP FRESH uses this circuit as the core of the biosensor device.

Our tool calculated four substitutions shown in Table 5. The calculated immnogenicty reduced from 36.9 to 29.2, which is reduction of about 21 %. The number of T-cell immune epitope for all three alleles reduced from 361 to 285. All four substitutions our tool BERT chose for the best deimmunization, are placed in loops of the protein. Of the four amino acids, only the phenylalanine at position 1042 has its side chain directed to the center of the protein, which could potentially explain the slightly higher change in the free folding energy. The ddG values of all mutations are close to zero and can therefore be interpreted as only a small structural destabilization.

Improve a previous project
As we were making bibliographic researches for our project, we found out that a previous team had a similar project in 2017. It was the D.I.V.E.R.T. project conceived by the BOKU-Vienne team.

D.I.V.E.R.T. Directed In Vivo Evolution via Reverse Transcription
Abtract
In vivo continuous directed evolution offers significant advantages over classic in vitro methods as it drastically reduces the amount of time and actual lab work required. Most current approaches, however, are based on globally accelerated mutagenesis inevitably leading to unwanted off-target mutations. D.I.V.E.R.T. represents the concept of a new continuous in vivo evolution strategy that allows full spatial control of mutagenesis by building systems that resemble the retrotransposon life cycle: The gene of interest’s mRNA is reverse transcribed in an error prone way and reintegrated into the genome at the respective locus replacing the original gene for several cycles. To demonstrate the generalizability of the process we plan on carrying out our proof of concept experiment in yeast and E. coli. By the end of August we are still in the cloning stage. Additionally, we are working on a single plasmid system for CRIS"

Carla and Max were chosen to maintain the wiki updated.
Bernardo and Rolando are going to collaborate with both groups.
Also, we scheduled meetings of the whole team every Friday or Tuesday (depending on the availability of the majority of the team), and meetings with the whole team and our advisor, Professor Rodrigo Gutierrez, every other Thursday. Likewise, each group should have their own meetings.
Finally, we decided to work based on delivery dates. Each member should compromise to complete a task in specific time intervals.
March, 12 - 18, 2012
We registered our team in iGEM. Now we are officially part of iGEM 2012! Also we began to learn how to use our wiki. Our Bactomithril project is still in its initial stage, so we began to read as many papers about recombinant spider silk and protein modeling as we could.
Some of the most relevant papers we found are
- Xia et al. 2010 - “Native-sized recombinant spider silk protein produced in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli results in a strong fiber”
- Widmaier et al. - 2009 - “Engineering the Salmonella type III secretion system to export spider silk monomers”
We learnt about interesting protein modeling and simulation software (e.g. Rosetta, Foldit), and some protein visualization software  (PyMOL, VMD, Chimera)
Additionally, we began to send emails requesting genetic sequences from spider silk to scientists from other countries. According to what we know, in Chile nobody works with natural or recombinant spider silk proteins or its genetic sequences. So that this is a real challenge to us.

For that reason, we sent an email to them asking if they could share their biobricks Bba_K245005 and Bba_K245113 with us.  They answered us and offered their help. But their shipment never arrived.

With attractant concentration decreasing for 8F, the number of cells decreased slowly. McfR stayed stable at range of 10-7 M to 10-3 M, and had only one phase which reached its maximum at attractant concentration of 10-2 M, then it went down sharply at 10-1 M. There was a significant difference among 8F and 5A (p < 0.05), and quantity of cells of 8F was much more than that of 5A. So 8F has chemotaxis towards malate. On the other hand, McfR and 5A were not significantly different and quantity of cells of McfR was little less than it of 5A. So McfR shows no chemotaxis towards malate here.
Succinate: The tendencies of curves of 8F and McfR towards succinate are same. As the attractant concentration increased, the number of cells arose and reached the maximum at attractant concentration of about 10-2 M and fell sharply with the minimum at attractant concentration of 10-1 M. The quantities of cells of 8F and McfR were almost equivalent and did not have significant difference. But there were significant differences among 8F & 5A, and McfR & 5A: the number of cells of 5A are far less than 8F or McfR (p < 0.05), which demonstrated that 8F and McfR have chemotaxis towards succinate and the capacity of chemotaxis of 8F and McfR towards succinate are almost equal. Compared with chemotaxis towards malate, both of 8F and McfR show stronger chemotaxis towards succinate.
Analysis
The tendency of the chemotaxis towards chemical gradient may be influenced by two factors: pH and phosphorylation state of McpS. The motor of flagella is energized by a H＋ (or Na＋ in some species) gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane (Schmitt, 2003) , but the mechanism is not clear. Lisa M. Maurer and Elizabeth Yohannes proved that low pH (at pH 5.0) induced the expression of some flag"

UC_Davis,2015,Team:UC Davis#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"ewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs)[18]. From our literature search, we noticed that there were no characterized FabI’s from algae, nor is it even known whether triclosan exerts its effects on algae by inhibiting its FabI enzyme [19]. Due to their extreme sensitivity, we hypothesized that triclosan exerts its effects on algae through inhibition of the FabI enzyme. Therefore we decided to test 3 FabIs from algae: P. tricornutum, T. pseudonana, and A. protothecoides.
This left us with a candidate list of 7 FabI proteins. 1 previously submitted FabI gene in the registry ( Bba_K771303 ), 3 FabI proteins taken from the literature, and 3 FabI proteins from algae. We decided to codon optimize and synthesize these genes to clone into a common E. coli expression vector pET29b+. A nucleotide alignment showing the codon optimizations to Bba_K771303 is shown below.
We screened each enzyme based on three criteria:
The enzymes had to over-express well in E. coli,
They had to have activity at the nanomolar level,
And they had to be inhibited by nanomolar levels of triclosan, the concentration leaving wastewater plants [18]
1. Overexpression:
Protein purity assessed through SDS-PAGE gels shown below:
Protein concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically from absorbance at 280 nm (A280). A280 readings converted enzyme concentration to mg/ml. The molarity of each enzyme was determined by dividing mg/ml by the enzyme’s extinction coefficient, theoretically derived from each enzyme’s amino acid sequence from http://web.expasy.org/protparam/  Extinction Coefficients used:
influenzae 17,420
falciparum 46,885
protothecoides 34,380
tricornutum 37,360
coli 15,930
B. pseudomallei and T. pseudonana did not express under our conditions, so they were eliminated from our FabI team.
2. Enzyme Activity Screening:
Enzyme activity was measured spectrophotometrically through the decrease in NADH absorbance over time on the native substrate analog crotonyl CoA. Activity is defined as the change in optical density (absorbance) per minute. Activity is normalized by dividing activity by the microgram of enzyme used for the assay. Each enzyme was assayed with 100 uM NADH and 100"

The Team
We are a skillful and persistent group of nine Finns. We started as a group of students who didn't really know each other, assuming that we were going to spend our summer studying synthetic biology with strange colleagues. In the end we got a bunch of new friends and (in addition to studying synthetic biology) we just might have spent one of the best summers of our lives.
Our group is interdisciplinary and it comes from the University of Helsinki and Aalto University; the two big universities located in the capital of Finland, Helsinki. We have expertise in many different fields ranging from genetics to product development and from computer science to food technology. Throughout the project, we basically needed all of the special skills of each member to make our visions come true. The diverse set of skills made it possible to have a broad view on any problem.
There were also moments when we noticed that no one in our team fits a specific task perfectly but we always took it as a possibility to learn something new and there was always someone up for a challenge! While everyone mostly got to do things they enjoyed the most and were good at already, all of us learned a lot during this project - about all kinds of things.
So, even while the team was divided to different subgroups who would focus on a certain part of the project, everyone got the chance to experience and learn something that they had never done before. Being a part of this team has been an amazing opportunity. It's difficult to imagine life without being in this team: how is it possible that we didn't even know each other a year ago?
While we all worked intensely on the project, we wouldn't be here without the amazing support that we received!

Cambridge-JIC,2016,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," we met during the conference from interdisciplinary labs, such as the CRI and the Waag Society in Amsterdam, and the Bio Makespace community.
Presenting our project at the conference
We were inspired by the DIY hacking culture of this community and wanted to lend our support through the engineering side of our project. By developing low-cost open source hardware for the transformation and growth of plant tissue samples, we hope to equip the DIY Bio community with the tools it needs to increase the use of plant chassis. Attracting people from a diverse range of backgrounds,  the Makespace community is a promising way to improve the interaction of non-scientists with the field of plant synthetic biology.
Since our return to Cambridge, we have continued the design of a growth facility and gene gun. Several of our team members are also in the process of establishing Cambridge’s first Bio Makespace, which we hope to support as a team with the hardware we are developing and outreach activities later this summer.
Day Science vs. Night Science - exploring Paris with other syn bio enthusiasts
Bio-Makespace
Biomakespace is an initiative of synthetic biology scientists, students and enthusiasts in Cambridge who are working hard to build a new community laboratory. We aim to have a friendly sharing space where scientists could meet engineers, physicists, computer scientists, medics and other professionals but even public, students and schools. They all could start working together on synthetic biology projects from this academic year already. The iGEM team got involved with establishing of the space, planning and propagation from the very beginning.
A few of us are planning to share with other students what we have learned from synthetic biology over the summer by leading or participating projects based on cell-free systems there in the coming academic year under the flag of the new student-led Cambridge University Synthetic Biology Society
Emerging Biomakespace and similar community labs have also hugely motivated us for our hardware sub-projects as Biomakespace hasn’t initially considered working on plants and algae or their chloroplasts much. By offering our affordable hardware to them and similar community labs over the world we will facilitate further development of plant and algal synthetic biology and also work on chloroplasts. As an example biolistics is the only reliable way to transform chloroplasts of plants or algae. However costs of commercial gene guns are absolutely beyond what such labs can usually afford. We are offering a cheap and tested alternative opening a whole new range of possible projects for them.

    2.2 Transformation protocol
    a. Combine 500 μl of protoplast suspension and 3-5 μg of plasmid DNA in a 15 ml tube, one for each transformation. DNA should be purified using a commercial preparation kit. Elute the DNA from the column using water.
    b. Add 1.5 ml of PEG-P, mix gently, and incubate for 2 minutes at RT.
    c. Add 5 ml SMMP and mix carefully by rolling the tube.
    d. Harvest cells by gentle centrifugation (1,300 x g for 10 minutes at RT), discard the supernatant immediately after centrifugation. Supernatant does not have to be removed completely.
    (Note: do not check for a cell pellet - most of the time it will be invisible)
    e. Add 500 μl of SMMP to remaining supernatant (containing bacterial cells) and transfer to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
    f. Incubate at 30 °C for 90 minutes with gentle shaking or rolling of tubes (max. 100 rpm) or incubate for 45 min without shaking followed by another 45 min while shaking at 300 rpm.
    g. Prepare 2.5 ml aliquots of CR5-top agar in sterile tubes.
    h. After incubation at 30 °C add all cells to 2.5 ml top agar, mix gently by rolling the tube between both hands (do not vortex!), and pour onto a pre-warmed plate of LB containing desired antibiotic.
    i. Incubate overnight at 30 °C - expect colonies of varying diameter because some will be covered with agar and others have easier access to air.  (Note: bacterial colonies on the top of the agar surface will be shiny)
    j. Streak several single colonies (at least 3) on fresh plates within two days.
    2.3 Controls
    a. Negative control: protoplasts without DNA
    This is a test reassuring that the protoplasts are not only fully viable but also free of contaminations before using them for transformation. Perform this test according to the transformation protocol as demonstrated below. After incubation at 30 °C, apply CR5-top agar to the protoplasts and split the sample into two portions. You may"

OD600 of cells in 10% Casamino Acid in M9 is slightly lower at 1.3.  A notable exception is 0.5% Lactose in M9, which has a exceedingly low OD of almost 0.4.
Conclusions
Due to the exceedingly low OD600 in 0.5% Lactose in M9, the medium cannot be used even though it induces relatively high fluorescence.
Our chosen medium from this experiment is 10% Casamino Acids in M9 media, which has the highest corrected fluorescence and also has quite a high cell growth rate.

On est alors capable de connaître le nombre de cellules cancéreuses détruites pour 100 vecteurs cellulaires ou 1 vecteur tissulaire .
La vitesse de diffusion du vecteur cellulaire est égale à 0,5µm.s-1 or la taille d’un capillaire sanguin est de 10µm de diamètre. La particule la plus éloignée met donc 10s à atteindre la paroi du vaisseau.
Grâce à cette ‘’’durée de diffusion’’’ (10s) et à la ‘’’vitesse du flux sanguin’’’ (1x10^3µm.s-1) dans les capillaires, et à la surface d’une cellule cancéreuse (1 µm²) on peut déterminer :
La’’’ longueur (L)’’’ couverte par les vecteurs cellulaires libérés par un vecteur tissulaire
La ‘’’surface (S)’’’ occupée par les phages dans un vaisseau sanguin de diamètre 2r.
La quantité de cellules cancéreuses accessibles.
L = 1 x 10^4 µm
2r = 10 µm
S = 2 π x L x r = 31,4 x 10^4 µm²
Ainsi, un vecteur tissulaire peut potentiellement cibler plus de 31 000 cellules cancéreuses, or, il ne possède que 100 vecteurs cellulaires. On peut effectuer une simplification en disant que 100 vecteurs cellulaires détruisent 100 cellules cancéreuses. L’efficacité de la dispersion est donc totale.
Pour le phage, une fois la paroi atteinte, entre en jeu l’internalisation cellulaire. Ce modèle répond à deux schémas d’action.

Nextly, mix 2mL mixture with 250uL 1mg/mL MUG DMSO solution to react for 15min. Finally, 300uL 1M NaOH solution was added to quench the reaction and the fluorescence was measured with excitation and emission wavelength at 360 and 445 nm, respectively. The fluorescence intensity was normalized by culture OD600 and reaction time 15min as the activity of galactosidase (MUG units=F360/445/OD600/t). The results of the test were shown in Figure. 4.

We constructed a plasmid expressing malQ responding to the concentration of tryptophan. Tryptophan sensor part and malQ were PCR amplified and gel-purified while pTrc99A was linearized between NcoI and PstI. Then the fragments were assembled by Takara infusion cloning kit. The plasmid was named pTrc99A_trp sensor_malQ. We firstly transformed the infusion product into DH5a component cell and 20 single colonies were cultured and confirmed by PCR. And then we extracted the plasmid from the confirmed transformants with the 〖E.Z.N.A.〗^TM  plasmid mini kit I (produced by Omega Bio-tek) and transformed the plasmid into E.coli JW3379.

METU_Turkey,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software_-_-_TEXT.html," The diamonds represent decision branching and they are found between     two rectangular boxes. The arrows show the direction in which subprograms     work and communicate. The subprogram at the head of the arrow starts     executing after the termination of the subprogram at the tail of the     arrow. Following flowcharts are the high level representations of our     algorithms developed for the BioGuide software.

Diagram 1. Flowchart of collection, formatting and storage     of devices data algorithm
Information about the iGEM parts had to be collected in a standardized     format for our application to function properly. Following data collection     custom subprograms is needed to parse and forward the data the application’s     database. In order to achieve this we have designed and implemented     the algorithm shown in diagram 1. In this algorithm, the first stage     was to find the list of part IDs of devices which were supplied by iGEM     in Spring 2010 distribution. This information has been collected from     two sources 1) plate files in excel format which was available online     2) device data provided in xml format, both provided by iGEM. The last     step in the algorithm was to send the collected partID data to the application’s     database.
2.
Diagram 2. Flowchart for BioGuide execution before and during     user interaction
Diagram 2 presents the main algorithm, which shows how BioGuide application     works. In BioGuide the major components are device and Biobrick graphs.     While the device graph represents input-output (promoter-regulator)     compatibility combination of iGEM devices, the Biobrick graph represents     combinations of atomic parts assembled in a device or system. The flowchart     shows how these graphs are created and embedded into the program, which     displays both of the graphs to the user when launched. Application presents     few interactive options to the user when started, which were shown on     the flowchart under the horizontal, bolded line. As shown on the diagram     2, there are four interactive tasks BioGuide can do, where the device     and Biobricks graphs are utilized. Upon clicking a node on a devices     or Biobricks graph, that node changes in size and color and the various     functions shown on the flowchart can be performed then after.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"film would be to eradicate the production of S. aureus mediated PNAG exopolymers. Hence, to perform this particular action we chose lysostaphin, a glycyl-glycine endopeptidase, as one of our combat proteins.
Figure 4: Cell wall structure of Gram positive bacterium
As a Gram positive bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus is encapsulated by a thick layer of peptidoglycan. Lysostaphin works by degrading this peptidoglycan layer which in turn results in cell lysis and death [15] . According to Sabala et al [16] , lysostaphin achieves this by cleaving the pentaglycine bridge cross-linking the parallel stems of the peptidoglycan polymers.
Figure 5: Cleavage site of lysostaphin. The enzyme cleaves at the pentaglycine bridge [16]
.
In order to manipulate and express lysostaphin in this project, we used an existing BioBrick, BBa_K748002 . This truncated and mature form of lysostaphin was first developed by Team HIT-Harbin in 2012. With its specific-target mechanism as well as its relatively small size, lysostaphin can potentially be conjugated to spider silk as a combat protein to treat S. aureus infected wounds.
During the course of our project, we have achieved several of our goals with lysostaphin; after demonstrating expression, we started investigations into its solubility and bacteriolytic action and most importantly were able to show that lysostaphin strongly and specifically inhibited and degraded S. aureus biofilm.

Fulfilling a gold requirement: Improving the characterisation of a previous team's Esp BioBrick in a new expression system and expand on their finding regarding biofilm dispersal and inhibition.
Proteins in the biofilm matrix have various functions and play an important role in all stages of the biofilm development. Cell wall anchored (CWA) proteins are vital in Staphylococcus aureus biofilms to mediate the primary attachment of cells to the surface of its host and also promote the intercellular adhesion, biofilm accumulation and maturation [17] .

Finally restriction mapped inoculations done by Kenneth and myself; the gel results are shown below.

A first glance at the gel implies that almost all of the additional colonies picked failed, although one construct (pEXPR_45_minCMV-7xMnt_mKate) has only two bands, save for the roughly 500 base pair deletion that has been observed in the past. SDM redone using LightingKit again. 50ng DNA used following pages 7 and 8 of this manual: www.qcbio.com/stratagene/210518.pdf We used 1.5uL 100mM stock of the previously designed primers. DNA was taken from the A vials of our stocks in the freezer. During the thermocycler phase, some random buffoon that was looking for an ID label on the side of the machine randomly turned off the thermocycler and didn't turn it back on. We think based on time that the cycles should have finished though. We did the DpnI digest for 10 minutes as opposed to 5 to ensure the template strand was digested. We transformed following our standard protocol with a 60min outgrowth in SOC at 37C. Jon plated and incubated it at 37C overnight.

“I’m now seriously considering doing a biotech masters degree because I feel like I’ve found my niche through this project. Lab work was a bit intimidating at first but all that was needed to get over that was experience. What else do you need to know about me?...hmm...I love Harry Potter!”
Finally, I bought my very first ice cream maker, planning on making ANY ice cream (peanut butter cups was a huge success) and just waiting for my Belgian waffle maker. Also, apparently I talk in my sleep in Slovakian.

From my participation on iGEM 2015 I expect to find the question!

“iGEM has helped me see that science can be something collaborative and involved. I am amazed by how much working with the people who will be impacted by our device has influenced and improved the research we are doing.
I always imagined that scientific research would be a very solitary pursuit, never getting out to engage with the problem you’re trying to solve and the people you’re trying to help. Instead, through iGEM, I’ve learnt that there is a growing need for empathy and a strong social conscience in science and I am incredibly happy that we are moving this way.”

“Starting this summer I was fully aware of what biology is capable of, but implications had only been an after thought. After going to Amsterdam to help incorporate human practices I have realised how important this link is as it can really drive the research.”
Brooke Biologist
“I can see that biology and computer science complement each other quite well. Synthetic biology adapts engineering and even computation and logic principles which makes it highly accessible to someone without a biology background like me. I would be interested in getting more informaticians to realise this sentiment, as it’s truly exciting!”
