Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,", each air sack fills up with air like a balloon, and deflates when breathing out.
The air sacs are covered in a viscous substance called mucus which traps foreign molecules and consequently, prevents them from entering the body. Tiny hairs called cilia constantly move the mucus with the entrapped pathogens upwards and out of the lungs. Thus, the mucus functions as a protection against the outside world, continuously keeping the airways clear of foreign particles.2

Summary
The most common medications for cystic fibrosis, COPD and asthma are the inhalation devices like bronchodilators, mucus thinners, and steroids. A famous new drug on the market is Orkambi. Thick mucus also contributes to bad bacteria in the lungs were often antibiotics are necessary. These medications are always taken together with airway clearance techniques and in severe cases, a lung transplant may be needed.
Cystic Fibrosis
Current commercially available approved drug class are:
Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) modulators (ivacaftor (Kalydeco®) and lumacaftor/ivacaftor (Orkambi®).) The Lumacaftor moves the defective CFTR protein to the correct place on the cell surface, and ivacaftor increases the protein's activity once it is in place. Orkambi is today one of the most attractive medications for CF but the therapeutic effect only targets a subpopulation people with specific CF mutations3.
Bronchodilators is an inhalation device that helps widen the airways, and can also be used for asthma and COPD patients. There are two different types, short-acting and long-acting and can be used before other treatments and before exercise.
Mucus thinners, such as Mucolytic drugs is a type of inhalation medicine that alters the chemical characteristics of mucus to decrease its viscosity and facilitate its removal. There are two"

ETHZ_Basel,2010,Team:ETHZ Basel#Modeling#Movement_-_-_TEXT.html," noted is the gradual smoothing of direction changes between directed movement states, with increasing bias value. The effect of the simulation time can be seen by analyzing the plots column-wise. The same movement pattern observed during the first 100 seconds is repeated over a longer time period, providing an overview of the long - term chemotaxis spatial behavior.
Note the increasing axis range, both on the x and on the y coordinate, due to both increasing bias value and increasing simulation time.
Directed movement/Tumbling
For the above simulated trajectories, we generated the so-called directed movement/tumbling plots used in analyzing chemotaxis motility from the perspective of boolean movement - time dependency. For providing a better visibility of the individual steps of the movement process, in the left figure only the first 60 seconds of the above simulations were considered, while in the right figure a detailed insight into the first 30 seconds is provided.
The directed movement tumbling plots for three different input bias values for 60 seconds simulation time Movement value of 1 represents the directed movement state, while movement value of 0 represents the tumbling state. Simulation time was 60 seconds, with sampling at every 0.03 seconds. As expected, the density of the plots is decreasing with increasing bias value, since the ratio directed movements/tumbling is increasing. In the limit case of 0.99 bias, the tumbling periods are not noticeable, the bacterial behavior consisting almost entirely of tumbling.
The directed movement tumbling plots for three different input bias values for 30 seconds simulation time The effect of the input bias is even more visible at a higher resolution. For lower bias value, tumbling occurs more often (upper plot) and it is gradually eliminated with increasing bias.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#html5_-_-_TEXT.html," is easy to compare two Chain-Model structures with the help of chain sorting. We only need to compare unicode_c value of chains in the chain list and unicode_t value generated under that order. If two structures are equal, their chain list and tree structure must be equal since the chains order is unique in our chain sorting method. If two structures have same unicode_c value of each chain and unicode_t value, they must be same structures since we could uniquely generate a Chain-Node structure from the strings.
How to find species with specific structural pattern of a template one?
We assume that if a combination of species in the species list could be structurally matched to reactants and modifiers templates defined within a reaction, they are possible to react with each other in the way as the reaction template describes. Hence, it is important to find such matchings between species in the species list and template ones defined in the database. We will first give the basic idea and then some modifications.
Blocks of ST and NST part on a template chain
Combinations of NST block matchings form a region restriction for ST part blocks
The template ST block contains 3 ANY parts. If the first ANY part is matched A and B, the task is reduced to match the next 2 ANY parts to C, D, E, F, and G. All matchings could be found by recursively performing this algorithm.
Removing unmatched chains and associated trees of the species. It should have same structure with template species after replacing ST part with matchings if it has the same structural pattern with the template one.
The basic idea is simple. We first consider the structural pattern matching between one chain and a chain template. There are two kind of parts on a chain template: substituent-type part (ST) and non-substituent-type part (NST). The whole template chain could be separated into blocks of ST parts and NST parts. Then we could break down the task to the matching of each small block. For each NST type block, we find all its matching regions on the chain to be matched, there may be more than one region. Each of the combinations of all NST blocks forms a NST frame and restricts the matching regions of ST blocks. Therefore, the minimal task is to find matchings of each ST part block within a restricted region on the chain to be matched. At the present version of MoDeL, there are 6 ST part: ANY, ANYUB, NZ, NZUB, ONE and ONEUB. A general algorithm for all 6 type part is designed and we will illustrate this via an example. Consider a ST block with all ANY type"

As our constructs did not show the expected functionality, we decided to directly use the plasmids described by Bonnet et al. [9] which where obtained from addgene ( Dual-recombinase-controller , XOR gate-V2.0 ). The data available from the original experiment by Bonnet [9] was used in our model to retrieve the missing parameters of integrases . However, we were using a TOP10 strain not expressing TetR by default (as compared to DH5alphaZ1 ) and as a result our strain had to be co-transformed with an additional plasmid encoding TetR. Also, we used defined M9 medium with 0.4% glycerol and 1% CAA instead of proprietary defined medium ( Teknova Hi-Def Azure medium ). As of today, this set-up did not allow us to get the integrase XOR gate running. The fluorescence readout for ON-states (exactly one input, either 0.1% L-arabinose or 200 ng/mL anhydrous tetracycline) and the OFF-states was not as expected (see figure 7). The OFF-state should not show increased fluorescence over time, while the ON-states should increase significantly after 4 h and continue to increase over the whole time span [9] . We are not giving up on this and are proceeding with debugging our construct further and hope to find a solution until the Giant Jamboree in Boston.

In order to maximize the sensitivity of cells to ultrasound, we transfected cells with a combination of mechanosensitive channel MscS and gas vesicle-forming proteins. By decreasing the power of ultrasound stimulation we demonstrated that cells expressing a combination of both ectopic channels and gas vesicles were activated as a result of the ultrasound stimulation (

(D) Ratio (blue line) was calculated from fluorescence intensities of Fura Red and Fluo-4 using CaPTURE.
To prove that calcium influx was the mediator of activation of mechanosensitive channels, we used an inhibitor of ion channels gadolinium (Gd3+), which has a similar ionic radius, but a higher charge density to Ca2+. By blocking the pore of the channel it acts as an general inhibitor of calcium ion channels

Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," and a device for binding to a physical target at the cell surface and thereby activate the membrane-stress-reporter (Device 2).
Device 1
Device 1 is a very simple modification of the pCpxR promoter in E. coli to produce a fluorescent reporter when the cell is under membrane stress. Activation of Cpx pathways in response to solid surface interactions was first reported by Otto & Silhaevy 2001 in which hydrophobically treated glass beads were used to induce membrane stress. Given that the promoter pCpxR was specifically shown to be activated by this interaction, our hope is that, in initial stages of MicroBeagle development, this promoter can respond to a wide variety of physical binding interactions when these are specifically designed for target surfaces. pCpxR is present in the registry of standard biological parts, examined previously by Calgary 2010 and BCCS-Bristol 2008 . In our MicroBeagle work, we aim to further explore and characterize this promoter, and investigate for the first time the utility of this promoter in generating a reporting signal when specifically coupled with a designed cell surface-solid target binding interaction. We characterized our Device 1, pCpxR-GFP, by testing fluorescence generation vs a variety of potential membrane-stress-inducing environments, including various concentrations of a detergent (triton X-100) and the presence of various solid particles.
Si4 Binding Peptide
Our second device of interest (""Device 2"", described below) utilizes, in addition to the pCpxR reporter system (above), a surface-displayed target-binding moiety for physical attachment to particles. Display of the target-binding moiety utilizes Ice Nucleation Protein (INP) to display an oligo-peptide of our choice on the outer-membrane of our E. coli. Initially this will be a peptide capable of binding silica beads, allowing us to create a non-toxic model system of pathogen detection for initial stages of device development. INP is a transmembrane protein that expresses any sequence that is placed on the C-terminus of its gene on the outer surface of the cell. Specifically, we utilized the INP display system developed by UPenn 2012 . The silica binding domain we utilized, termed ""Si4"" was developed by Naik, Lawrence, Clarson, and Stone 2002 . This silica-binding polypeptide was discovered via phage display screening, and was also found to precipitate silica when reacted with silicic acid. This provided us with an additional route to test for the presence of Si4 on cell surfaces"

The NJU iGEM team believes there are two main aspects of “Human Practices”: public outreach to the non-technical community as well as education engagement; and collaboration within the academic and iGEM community. For both sides, we participated in a series of engagement exercises, including consulting with patients and doctors about potential application spaces for our research technology, educational and investigating outreach to the local Nanjing community, and collaborating with fellow iGEM teams to improve their projects and presentations.
filter_dramaQuestionnaire and Propagation online
We believe science is everywhere and it is a part of each person’s everyday life. For most people without science background, synthetic biology and targeting therapy seems to be a very far-off topic. In order to offer better understanding about synthetic biology and the targeting therapy applied in our project, we did a grand scaled questionnaire on social network and then gathered data for a thorough analogy.
Conclusion of normal group questionnaire
Basic situations of the investigation group
● Effective investigation number: 780.
● Age distribution: 18~50 years of age accounted for the dominant.
● Education level: 66.67% for bachelor degree, the survey group basically has the education background of high school or above.
● Family economic conditions: the vast majority of respondents are of well-off level.
The respondents’ understanding of cancer is relatively simple, one-sided and inadequate.
The way of understanding cancer is limited. Most people learn about it from media reports, even though they are uneven in quality.
Figure 1. Rumor of Tumors…
● While the respondents generally recognize that if detected early, cancer can be treated and cured in time, the data notes that there are still nearly 15% of respondents identifying cancer as a terminal and incurable disease.
● The majority of respondents still have a fear of malignancy cancer, which is believed to be their nightmare scenario. Notably, among the 780 valid surveys, only 39.1% are aware of that, during the last decade in China, LUNG cancer made the highest mortality rates amid all types of cancers; 30.9% chose liver cancer, which is of the same high degree of malignancy with Lung cancer; the remaining 30%"

Tsinghua-A,2011,Team:Tsinghua-A#Project#echo_-_-_TEXT.html,"1.3 How does the system work?
In ecology, the predator-prey system often serves as a wonderful example to describe population dynamics. In the system, a predator feeds on its prey, resulting in the decline of the prey population, while the lack of prey will lead to the death of predators those who depend on preys to survive, consequentially an opportunity for preys to reproduce. This system indicates the co-existence of nature, and to give a more detailed description of the up and down of the populations, we call it oscillation. Another oscillating device is known in digital electronic circuits, named Ring Oscillator, which is composed of an odd number of NOT gates attaching in a chain, with the last gate is fed back into the first.
Figure: a predator-prey system
Figure: ring oscillator
Though in different field, these two oscillations do have some commonality, that is, the feedback (or ‘echo’).
When the idea is applied in the synthetic biology, we use two populations of E.coli to construct the system, in which CELL-B represses A and A induces B, just as predators feed on preys and preys feed predators. Of course this system have a feedback network. Then, theoretically, the system will oscillate, and light in red (RFP in CELL-A) and green (GFP in B).
Then, how’s the interrelationship between RED and GREEN, is RED negated to GREEN, or just the very same? It seems contradictory when we take the first glance of the interaction, that is, A increases the population of B while B decreases A. But after taking the delay of biological reaction into consideration, it’s easy to get the answer, which has already been stated in the title: homochronous.
1.4 What does ‘homochronous’ refer?
The prefix ‘homo’ represents ‘same’, while ‘chrono’ means ‘time-related’. As a jargon of Information, the word ‘homochronous’ describes the relationship between two signals that their corresponding significant instants are displaced by a constant interval of time.
Here we use this term to depict the relationship between CELL-A & B. That is to say, in the process of oscillating, the AHL expression rate of CELL-A and that of B (also RED and GREEN fluorescent signals) share the same period, or fluctuate in a same pace. In addition, the interval of two signals remains constant, so the RED signal comes out while GREEN fades away at the same time, and vice versa. Consequently, time goes, RED and GREEN flare"

2A  peptide Sequence
In foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and some other picornaviruses, the oligopeptide (≈20 amino acids) 2A region of the polyprotein mediates ""cleavage"" at its own C-terminus to release it from the 2B region. 2A is also active when placed between reporter proteins and in all eukaryotic systems tested - it acts as an autonomous element, making it an important tool for co-ordinated synthesis of multiple proteins from one open reading frame and making a ribosome jumping. (Fig.3)In recent years, there was little report about 2A peptide that is active in prokaryotic systems, even some papers stated 2A sequences can’t work in prokaryote. But Indian Scientists Dechamma et al. have found the F2A peptide could work in E.coli[1], which gives us creative advice.

Assessing Different Cell Viability Assays: Killing Effect of 5-Fluouracil on Different HeLa CCL-2 Cell Lines
OBJECTIVE
With this experiment we wanted to determine the efficiency of two different assays in order to evaluate the viability of mamalian cells. The first assay that we tried was the usage of Calcein AM dye. This compound penetrates the cell membrane and upon interaction with active esterases in the mamalian cell cytosol, a fluorescent product is being generated, leading to the staining of living cells containing active esterases in their cytosol. The second assay was based on the HeLa CCL-2 lc cell line ability to produce constitutively citrine. Upon cell death, cells are detaching from the surface and they are being removed via a washing step. In that way, the total fluorescence of the specific sample should be reduced. In this experiment, cell samples with diverse viability are generated by the application of a concetration gradient of a well-known cytotoxic agaent, namely 5-fluouracil [1] . For both assays the goal is to create a killing curve, where the fluorescent signal of the cell sample is dropping in respect to increasing cytotoxic agent concentration.
PROCEDURE
HeLa CCL-2 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate with initial concentration of 100'000 cells/mL. After 24-hour growth the cells are incubated with a different concentrations of 5-fluouracil. After 24 hours the cells are, incubated with calcein AM solution and the viable fraction of the cells is assessed for its fluorescence via spectrophotometer.  The use of HeLa CCL-2 lc allowed us monitoring the viability of the cells on a spectrophotometer as these cells are producing constitutively citrine. Decrease in cell viability would result in less cells per well due to the detachment of the apoptotic cells from the well. In terms of fluorescence that would result in the decrease citrine related fluorescence. A detailed protocol is available in Protocols.
RESULTS
Fluorescence data were obtained via a spectrophotometer, for both the cell lines and viability assays used. Calcein AM staining assay gave inconclusive results as medium concentrations of tha killing agent didn't result in cell viability decrease (Figure 11,"

Project description
Figure 1: Photo of baby mice taken at the animal facilities at Odense University Hospital (OUH).
Figure 2: Members of the team discussing something in the laboratory.
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are extensively used in scientific and fundamental medical research.       The nowadays production methods of mAbs are not only time-consuming and costly but also at the expense of animal lives. Antibodies have many applications in research, diagnostics and show great promise in treatment of cancer. But the advancement is held back due to the expensive and time consuming production. Therefore we propose an alternative to antibodies; peptide aptamers – produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The variable loop of the peptide aptamer is generated through a random nucleotide library and held together by an optimized, enzymatic inactive version of human Thioredoxin (hTrx) used as a scaffold protein. We are using the bacterial two-hybrid system to generate and, at the same time, screen for peptide aptamers with desired properties. Additionally we are proposing a production model.

Aimed at the final goal of our project, we simulated the kinetic equations of chemical reactions occurring in each domain, including AT, ACP, KS, KR, ER, DH, and TE. Then we tested these equations and analyzed their feasibility.

In modeling section, we kept pace with the members who are responsible for experiment. We stacked the related equations according to the sequence of DEBS 1+TE. Meanwhile, we also simulated the kinetic equations of the whole DEBS 1+TE. Then we compared the equations of domains which have been stacked with the equation of DEBS 1+TE, and verified the feasibility of the model.

We found that we need more concentration of parts' DNA to continue our assemblies. We are bit skeptical how far we will be successful in the ligated parts transformation. Hence we decided to try both the heat shock transformation and electro transformation on the ligated parts. Today I cultured colonies from plates of all parts needed for tomorrow's miniprep.

Leeds iGEM's Adventure to the Big Smoke and YSB 1.0
By Emily Taylor
On the 12th July 2013, one early morning in Leeds train station, the Leeds iGEM team sleepily boarded the London King's Cross train. Little did Paul know, as he sat peacefully in an empty carriage, he was sitting on the wrong train! A mistake easily made at 7 in the morning! But regardless, the other train sped it's way down the country, stopping at Wakefield where Emily boarded, and as Jonah slept, we made our transition from the North of the country to the South. We arrived at London King's Cross station and waited a while for Paul to join us after his train mishap, this was critical as, if we were honest, he was the only one that knew where he was actually going!
The first day of the conference took place at the Wellcome Trust building. Here we arrived to coffee, much to the team's pleasure, and some fancy looking posters. We displayed our own poster and proceeded to mingle in with some of the other teams that had arrived, admiring their posters and getting to know their projects. We sat down to the first set of presentations where we learnt about what each team was planning to research for this year's iGEM competition and what other activities they were planning for outreach etc. After lunch and another set of presentations, there was a workshop session"

Characterization of PcstA
Figure 1: The experimental setup
We sat out to improve the original reporter system – the PcstA-induced transcription of the gene encoding Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP). We wanted to further characterize the PcstA promoter PcstA PromoterPcstA is a carbon stress induced promotor. In absence of glucose the enzyme adenylate cyclase will synthesize cAMP from ATP. cAMP will bind CAP, catabolite activator protein, encoded by crp, and the complex recruit RNA polymerase to the promotor. There is an inverse relationship between cAMP and glucose, and this means that glucose can repress promotor activity., part: BBa_K118011 , by measuring the levels of mRNA through a Northern Blot.
Originally our reporter system was based on the part BBa_K861173 in which the promotor controls transcription of rfp. However, it is challenging to work with RFP, partly due to its relatively long folding time. Therefore we decided to perform the experiments with another brick, which also contained PcstA; BBa_K1135002. In this brick Pc"

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and other information, please also put it up on the part page.
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:
2014 MIT
2014 Heidelberg
2014 Tokyo Tech
Part Table
Please include a table of all the parts your team has made during your project on this page. Remember part characterization and measurement data must go on your team part pages on the Registry.

Safety
By ensuring all of our QGEM team members have undergone the necessary laboratory safety training, Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) training and Biosafety Level 1 training, we are creating a safe and informed workplace.
Prior to any experiments, the required SDS are read to ensure all relevant safety information, personal protective equipment (PPE) is worn and all necessary precautions are taken to avoid any harm to lab workers and the environment.
Lab safety training includes the following:
Location and use of fire alarms, exits, and extinguishers
Location and use of eyewash stations, safety showers, first aid kits, chemical spill kits and response cards, laboratory gas shut off valves
Standard laboratory safety rules, including proper lab wear, protective gear, use of hazardous equipment
Proper method of disposal and spill response for biohazardous materials, sharps, chemicals, radioactive material, ethidium bromide gels
Proper use and handling of autoclaves (undergone with the department's designated trainer)
Risk Group 1 (non-pathogenic organisms) Escherichia coli DH5-a strain in regulation with the Canadian Biosafety Standards was used for plasmid housing, has no 'natural' environment or habitat as it does not exist in nature"

Overview
BBa_K1555000
We improve BBa_K1555000 by place Riboj between promoter and RBS, and replace sf GFP with GFP to construct BBa_K2555000. The construct include the promoter of cop A, ribosome binding site, self-cleaving RNA ribozyme RiboJ, and protein coding region-sfGFP. In E.coli. As a  ATPase, cop A is  regulated by a copper-responsive protein CueR(1). The promoter of cop A is more sensitive to copper than the other two copper-responsive promoter. RiboJ is an insulator commonly used in genetic circuits to prevent unexpected interactions between neighboring parts. Insulation with RiboJ may  increase protein abundance. sfGFP increased resistance to denaturation, improved folding kinetics, and increased resistance to aggregation during refolding(2). sfGFP has been proven to be very useful  for improved protein detection(3).
Method
In order to show that our synthetic bacteria have a fully functional part that works, expression measurements were made. The construct was linked to sf GFP.  For the parts plate reader  was done. A plate reader is able to take optical density (OD600nm) and fluorescent measurements over time. OD is a measure of bacterial growth over time and fluorescence is a measure of protein expression over time.
Results
The results of a plate reader experiment with different copper concentrations after five hours. Error bars show standard deviation of three repeats
We optimized BBa_k1555000 to be BBa_K2555000. The relative fluorescence intensity of BBa_K2555000 under different copper ion concentrations was higher than that of BBa_k1555000, and the increasing rate of relative fluorescence intensity was higher than that of BBa_k1555000.

Melbourne,2014,Team:Melbourne#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," buffer and loaded on a 15% tris-glycine gel. The whole cell Coomassie stained gel is shown below alongside the NEB P7712S molecular weight marker.
From theoretical prediction of the peptide masses, we would expect the following distribution of molecular weights:
Magainin 1 Star Peptide (Mag1 Star)
USP
Linear Magainin 1 (Linear Mag1)
22.15 kDa
29.3 kDa
14.32 kDa
We looked for bands corresponding to overexpression of the proteins. We observed a thick band, post IPTG around 32 kDa in the BL21(DE3) cells carrying the USP plasmid. However, we saw this same band appearing in the Linear Magainin 1 lane but the Linear Magainin 1 protein should have a much lower molecular weight than what was observed. Therefore, we did not assume that we had overexpression overexpression of the USP 1 protein.
We also noted bands in all post-IPTG lanes around 17 kDa. This would be roughly consistent with both the Linear Magainin 1 and Magainin 1 Star Peptide, noting that small proteins may not run at their expected molecular weight. Again, the analysis is complicated by the fact that the band also appears in the lane corresponding to the larger molecular weight protein, USP I. Given this ambiguity, we decided to purify all the protein in the sample using Ni-NTA purification.
Purification and further characterisation
A small-scale purification was carried out according to our protocol . The cells were lysed with iodoacetamide, an alkylating agent, added to the lysis buffer. Iodoacetamide blocks all free cysteines on proteins with a short alkyl group. This was added because we wanted to determine if a disulphide bond had formed inside the cell. If we did not block free cysteines, then any bond that had formed could be attributed to spontaneous/air oxidation of disulfides outside the cell.
After purification, we ran a concurrent Western Blot and Coomassie stain on both the pre-induction samples from above and the purified protein (namely, the first elution from the batch purification).
The Western Blot used mouse monoclonal antibodies against the N-terminal HIS-tag as primary antibodies and anti-mouse secondary antibodies:
The corresponding Coomassie stain is show below:

Communication with Corporation
corporation we contacted
In this year, we cooperated with corporations to search for the real application of our project. If we want the scientific results in the field of synthetic biology applied to people's daily life, cooperation with corporations is necessary. Just realizing this fact, we tried to contacted many corporations, and introduced our project as well as the concept of ""synthetic biology"" to the corporations. The figure in the right is part of the list of corporations we have contacted in this year.
Boyuan Biotech
During the plication of communication with corporations, the company, Shanghai Boyuan Biotechnology CO.,LTD , showed great interest in our project and wanted to know more about our project, iGEM, even synthetic biology. What's more, they are considering to attend Asian Jamboree with our team.
To communicate with Boyuan Biotech in detail, we held a conference in SJTU on Sep. 29, inviting the corporation and other related researchers to communicate with each other. In the conference, the corporation and researchers gave lectures about what they did, and they listened to our project. They all showed great interest in our project due to our bright prospect on the regulation and optimization of our project.
Education Program
Zhiyuan college, a college constructed in SJTU aiming at fostering Chinese future academic masters, started a program called Zhiyuan Academic Elite Education Program (ZAEEP) to promote the academic literacy and leadership of students in SJTU.
Our team members also took the courses designed by Zhiyuan College in this year. Besides, during the program, our team also gave a lecture in the class to introduce our iGEM project, our experience of synthetic biology experiment and human practice process, thus educating students participating in ZAEEP the necessary skills they should have, at the same time, telling the concept of synthetic biology to them.
Never before has an iGEM team involved in such large scale academic elite cultivation plans supported by national education ministry. We took a big step forward to disseminate the iGEM project in such an official academic elite cultivation plan.

Overview
As we think iGEM can be enjoyed by everyone, we designed our three-part human practice project, which is consists of the tale, the synbio chess game, and plenty of activities and outreaches.
The Tale of Ghost and Elf, written by our team member Xiaoyue Yang, is a supplement of the masterpiece The Little Prince. It is a fantasy, as on the planet Ecoli, the Little Prince happens to meet a girl named Summer. They come across a catastrophic pollution of atrazine, but fortunately Summer is a scientist, and she creates the Ghost Sensor and the Atrazine Seek & Destroy system to defeat the herbicides.
The story is well plotted and illustrated that we think it a work of art. Throughout our survey and outreach, we realize that synthetic biology is a science that is rather far from our common life. Thus we want to make it easier to see and touch with the use of art. Since the tale is suitable for all ages, synthetic biology can be more acceptable by the public.
The Synbio Chess Game, designed by Xihan Li, is a special board game for synthetic biology. The route on the gameboard are molecules: DNA helix, mRNA and polypeptide linking one by one, with function units like enhancer, descriptions like methyl, and typical structures like the stem-loop structure. It is a vivid illustration of the"
Technion_HS_Israel,2015,Team:Technion HS Israel#Constants Database_-_-_TEXT.html," coli Justification: At present the medium being used by the lab is still be discussed. Currently though the medium most resembles water and therefore the water's viscosity value can be used. This allows us to assume that the medium is Newtonian (dilute aqueous medium that doesn?€™t contain long unbranched molecules such as methylcellulose or polyvinylpyrrolidone. Note that methlycellulose does not alter the run and tumble statistics, only bundle and motor rotation rates are affected by the addition of methylcellulose). If agar were to be used then the medium would be Non-Newtonian. Even though it would be Non- Newtonian John Hogan in passing said that we could assume it is Newtonian.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model#HBK_-_-_TEXT.html," This increases the accuracy of the model as the cells react to changes in EPO concentration in time faster. Once they reach the age at which they differentiate into another cell stage, the resulting growth and decay rates that govern them will change.
Figure 14. Transition of cells from one stage to another through differentiation. (a) Follows one population set of reticulocyte cells as they age over time and transition to marrow reticulocytes. (b) Shows the result of a simulation of the population density of cells every 0.1 days of maturity at a steady state EPO concentration of 9.8 mU/ml.
When a time step occurs, the cells in each mesh point (\(u_n\)) experience growth or decay based on the stage they are in. The new population of cells is then shifted to the next age mesh point. The general form of the equation that governs the change of population density at each time step is below.
$$ u_n = u_{n-1}\times e^{(\beta-\alpha(EPO(t)) \times \Delta t} \tag{20}$$
$$ u_{n+1} = u_{n}\times e^{(\beta-\alpha(EPO(t)) \times \Delta t} \tag{21}$$
$$ \Delta t = \mu_{n+1} - \mu_n = \Delta \mu \tag{22}$$
The dynamics of the mesh in response to a gene doping injection can be seen in figure 15.
Figure 15. An animation of the dynamic red blood cell formation model. The injection 141 billion copies of the EPO cDNA in adenoviruses occurs at day 0. The infected cells produce extra EPO leading to a maximum concentration of EPO of 31.3 mU/ml (3.2 times more that the steady state EPO concentration of 9.8 mU/ml).
To calculate the total population of each stage, the trapezoid rule was used to calculate the area under the population mesh and estimate the total population.
BFU-E Cells
108 stem cells become BFU-E cells on day 0. BFU-E cells grow exponentially as they age. Their proliferation rate is not dependent on EPO. As result, the population of BFU-E cells grows at a constant exponential rate as they age.

Arizona_State,2012,Team:Arizona State#Ethical Conditions_-_-_TEXT.html," this would be if the government prevented which areas of the country would have access to the technology or to charge an exorbitant fee to use the technology. This would be a means to expand their control. Ultimately all of these issues kill the effectiveness of the technology as it prevents long-term deployment of the technology, meaning that any benefits from actually creating it may be short-lived.
In order for the ASU biosensor to be implemented correctly, our team would rely on non-governmental organizations (NGO). These kinds of organizations are put into place to work independently of the government. This would be a solution to eliminate corrupt government involvement. First, the biosensor can be vertically distributed by NGOs as this represents the most effective strategy to getting it to countries and regions throughout the world. Second, the aid approach must prioritize the needs of the recipients over the needs of the donor organizations. By giving priority to those who are in need, it would encourage local ownership of the device whereby the political and local attitudes will be for the technology versus against it (Newkirk 2008). This can be effective in overcoming generic narratives that state the technology is more of an imposition than an actual need. This would also allow for the technology to be deployed more effectively as it responds to the needs of the recipients and quickly adapts to them (Newkirk 2008).
Long term, the goal is to have the ASU biosensor become an effective tool for the developing country to use regularly. This would require government officials to create a sustainable, long-term infrastructure that would allow for an adequate prevention and care system. This approach would be most effective in both the long and short term because the NGOs can set up infrastructure in the intermediary to effectively combat the outbreak, while the government creates their regulations to implement our biosensor. The policy effort behind implementation has to include engagement with the local government whereby political goodwill will be generated for the technology versus against it. This is essential to not only preventing political backlash but also resolving any possible concerns regarding the “dual-use dilemma.”

Ms. Guo (70-year-old)       Rectal cancer sufferer
Ms. Guo has been diagnosed as rectal cancer for 8 years. Her initial symptoms were slender stools along with purulence and abdominal pain. But she thought it was caused by her constipation combined with hemorrhoids. She did not know that it was rectal cancer until she went to the hospital for a colonoscopy.
During the 8 years, Ms. Guo has experienced two surgeries. The first one was taken soon after her diagnosing. At that time, as she was found in the middle stage of the cancer, the doctors performed the surgery to remove the lesion. After the surgery she continued chemotherapy treatment for continuous control, adhering to the check every 3 months. However, in 2011 and 2015, Ms. Guo has experienced 2 recurrence. Now she depends mainly on the treatment combining chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Every 21 or 28 days she goes to the hospital for a session of chemotherapy. After accept chemotherapy, Ms. Guo suffers from side effects like vomiting, hair loss, limbs weakness, etc.
As Ms. Guo’s husband told us, the reimburse they received is more limited, because they came for treatment from another province, which is defined as non-local insurance. Ever since Ms. Guo’s treatment, they have spent more than 200k RMB (30,000$) on medical expenses, which add up to be a very heavy burden for them.
At the same time, Ms. Guo told us that there are a lot of people distributing leaflets and ads around the hospital. Some of these ads might be false, yet desperate patients still try to contact them as if they are clutching at the straws of their lives. Ms. Guo hopes that the government could provide some authoritative medical journals for patients like them, enabling patients to understand the latest researches from the formal channels, and to get a better comprehending of the therapies that suit them.
Summary
Long story in short, most of the patient we interviewed showed positive mental conditions, but the economic situation of their families could be uneven. There are not many patients who have relatively well-off condition like Ms. Chen, and more than half of the patients cannot afford molecular target therapy thus rely on the medical insurance reimbursement.
Most of the patients are holding certain expectations for new therapies. However, obviously, aside from efforts to promote the efficacy of new therapies"

Sheffield meet up
The Oxford iGEM team attended the meet up organised by the team at the University of Sheffield on Friday the 18th of July. The purpose of this visit was to continue building the relationships between teams that were started at the Oxford-based meet up last month. The team gave a short presentation on the project so far.
Team members give talk at Royal Society
Team members Glen Gowers and Philipp Lorenz attended the 2014 London Biochemistry Alumni Event hosted at the Royal Society. The occasion attracted alumni from across a period of more than 50 years – bringing together those who completed their PhDs in the 1950s, with students graduating last year. Following an introduction by Head of Department Mark Sansom, two Royal Institution Christmas Lecturers and our iGEM team members entertained guests with their presentations.

Introduction
On June 19th 2014, the Oxford iGEM team invited all of the teams in the UK and Ireland to talks in the Oxford University Biochemistry Department, including a talk by the CEO of iGEM Randy Rettberg; 'Synthetic Biology - Short Past and Long Future'. The event was attended by 15 iGEM teams as well as Oxford University undergraduates and postgraduates. We would like to thank Randy Rettberg, Dr. Richard Kelwick and Dr. Jarek Bryk for their insightful and entertaining talks. Later in the afternoon"
SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Antitumor action_-_-_TEXT.html,"2 : Analyze of the  GFP fluorescence on non recombined Lambda phages (Lambda), recombined Lambda phages with the fragment 286-393 of the penton base (LambdaPb286-393), recombined Lambda phages with the complete penton base (1-571), GFP tagged adenovirus (Ad10 and Ad100)
Firstly, we observe that the recombined phage shows a tag difference independently of the fragment of the penton base used compared to the non transformed bacteriophage. Secondly, the recombined phage with the RGD fragment alone (286-393) has a higher fluorescence than the phage with a complete fragment and closer to the adenovirus one (figure 2).

Discussion
Even if the tissue vector has not been finished, scientific literature shows that a recombinant phage creation with a protein coding the adenovirus penton base is possible. It demonstrates as well that fragment coding for RGD sequence alone has a higher capacity to infect eukaryotic cells compared to the penton base complete fragment (figure 2). In the case of our application it is possible to use a recombined Lambda phage to insert our therapeutic gene.

Conclusion
To conclude the RGD fragment of the penton base alone has a higher efficiency of interaction with integrines of eukaryotic cells. However for our project, it was more judicious to use the complete sequence of the penton base (fragment 1-571) because the use of the cell vector and the induction system by doxycycline give a very fast and target injection of bacteriophages. The use of a highly efficient transfection system is not advised because phages do not have the time to disperse properly and will infect several times the same cell. The use of the complete fragment of the penton base is sufficient for the phage to infect properly eukaryotic cells and let it time to have a bigger dispersion.

Antitumoral Plasmid
Context
In non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, like in all other cancers, the loss of apoptotic capacity of tumor cells is due to the functional loss of various tumor suppressors incoming in the apoptotic pathway.
The DVS application in the anticancer fight is based on the reactivation of this apoptotic pathway by bringing into tumor cells the wild type genes coding for functional tumor suppressors.
The COSMIC project from Sanger institute allowed us to determine which genes to bring to the therapeutic plasmid in the non-small"

Biofiltration: From Concept to Prototype
ITC Analysis: Data, Modeling, and Binding Parameters
The results from the ITC experiment to determine binding parameters for peptides 1x-, 2x-, and 3x-HHTC-Re alongside the predicted structure (QUARK Ab Initio program) follows [2]. This program uses Monte Carlo simulations and knowledge of atomic force fields to construct the most probable structural conformation of a protein from just the linear amino acid sequence.
Figure 3: ITC data for the three HHTC-Re peptides. The binding affinity (Ka) was assessed to determine the strength of the interaction, and the results follow: 1x-HHTC-Re Ka = (1.55 ± 0.21) x 106 M-1; 2x-HHTC-Re Ka = (3.73 ± 0.53) x 105 M-1; 3x-HHTC-Re Ka = (1.50 ± 0.05) x 105 M-1. Figure design credits to Jesica Urbina.
The binding affinity values in Figure 3 are largely comparable to one another, and we do see a linear trend between the number of HHTC-Re repeats and injections taken to reach saturation, which means that each peptide can bind a linearly increasing amount of copper proportional to the HHTC-Re repeats. This validates our hypothesis underlying our construct design for our fusion proteins, allowing us to bind multiple metals on the same biomolecule. In Figure 4, we can see how the specific subunits maintain proper folding (predicted by QUARK), supporting the notion that they would retain their original functions.
Figure 4: Quark ab initio model of 2x-HHTC-Re with chitin binding domain. Domains within the fusion protein have been annotated to display the conformation and spatial orientation.
After confirming the copper binding of the individual HHTC-Re x n peptides, we then needed to assess whether our fusion protein could bind copper and chitin, and whether it could do so when already saturated with the other substrate. Figure 5 depicts two experiments a) Raw data and b) isotherm for 2x-HHTC-Re-CBD + NaDg and Cu. In this experiment, N-acetyl D-glucosamine (“NaDg”; analogous to a chitin monomer and widely used in the literature for"

Introduction
Our human practice included an online-and-offline survey, asking the public about their general information, experience and knowledge on gut inflammation, and their thoughts about using probiotics to detect and treat gut inflammation. We found that people generally are concerned about the following aspects: the product’s safety, harm to human body, sensibility, price, and response time. Thus, we decided to demonstrate our way of dealing with these problems and how can we meet the public’s need.
Safety
Safety is always the first concern that comes when a new product is posed; but our bacteria is generally satisfactory in safety.
First, E. coli Nissle 1917, the kind of bacteria that patients will take, is generally considered safe and even one of the best investigated therapeutically applied E. coli strain worldwide. E. coli Nissle 1917 is non-pathogenic, which means that it does not cause any disease or produce any toxins. E. coli strain Nissle 1917 does not possess any antibiotic resistance plasmids and is very stable, with a poor recipient of foreign DNA (especially those in the form of antibiotic resistance and other promiscuous plasmids). Despite the safe properties of Nissle 1917, we are still planning to do some engineering on its cryptic plasmids (Fred A. Hines et al., 2011) to make it produce appropriate amount of DNase at appropriate time, so that for those engineered bacteria that are left in the gut or excreted to the environment, it can automatically destroy its DNA when a specific time is reached or environment is present.
Second, we are planning to put the bacteria in gastro-resistant hard capsules to make sure that it does not emit to the environment. This capsule is able to permit the transmission of small chemical compounds, and we are now able to control when (or in what pH) the capsule would be dissolved. (Fred A. Hines et al., 2011)
Thirdly, one gastro-resistant hard capsule contains about 2.5 – 25×109 viable E.coli Nissle 1917 cells, which is within the safe range for human body proved by FDA. (Fred A. Hines et al., 2011)

bla_p15A was cloned into pPIC9. The resulting circular vector was transformed into E.coli TOP 10 and plated on LB-Amp. However no transformants were obtained, putatively due to the very low concentration of the ligation product. Transformation was repeated with a higher amount of the ligation.

This week we performed whole cell biotransformation using the cell pellets obtained from our expression cultures of AADC and CvATA.
L-Phenylalanine and Dopamine were used as substrates for AADC and CvATA respectively. Substrates were prepared as a 5 mM solution in 1 mL 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8). Whole cells were weighed and 250 uL of substrate was added to 20 mg of whole cells.
We also aimed to improve our HPLC methods this week by adjusting to 20/80 (ACN/H2O). This resulted in a separation of PDA from L-Phenylalanine allowing analysis of AADC biotransformation. However L-Tyrosine and L-DOPA were still too close on the spectrum.
A further method was trialled using a 90/10 ratio of ACN to H20 which showed good separation for L-DOPA and L-Tyrosine although L-Tyrosine and L-Tyramine aswell as L-DOPA and Dopamine did not show clearly separated spectra

OE-PCR with the digested and purified fragments of esaR , cepR and esaI as well as with esaRv2, cepRv2 and esaI were performed to obtain the two fragments esaR_cepR_esaI and cepR_EsaR_EsaI_v2, that basically contain the same genetic information, however in a"

Lambert iGEM sent a summary of this year’s project to ECUST. The word restriction allowed the team to write a more concise, clear description, a skill necessary when writing an abstract. Additionally, simplification of the project description makes it more accessible to the general public.
Uppsala
Lambert iGEM recognizes that synthetic biology takes lots of hard work and often results in high stress levels. This can cause extremely dedicated members to feel discouraged or “burned out”. Team Uppsala created a survey about this issue. Taking the survey allowed iGEM members to recognize and address their issues with iGEM-related stress.

learnsynbio
Our main outreach initiative is a series of Synthetic Biology learning modules which we call LearnSynBio.org.             After the success of our 2015 educational outreach, we wanted to switch gears and target our outreach efforts             to a demographic which has not received as much attention for educational outreach.
Most outreach seemed targeted either to young children, with the hopes of  introducing them to science in general,          or to the general population, with the hopes of sparking a discussion about the ethical concerns and societal          implications of synthetic biology. But we found comparatively little that reached out to high school students          who are on the cusp of deciding potential career paths in a way that introduced them to synthetic biology as an          actual scientific field. These students seemed like an ideal audience for our outreach efforts.
Since many of the core concepts within synthetic biology are fairly simple to understand with only limited background          knowledge, we set out to create educational materials targeted explicitly towards these high school students in order          to introduce them to the field of synthetic biology as a potential, and perhaps exciting, career option.
LearnSynBio consists of four modules of instructional videos and supplemental materials (worksheets) which are meant          to introduce high school students with basic biology and math background to the ideas in Synthetic Biology. LearnSynBio          is organized into four modules: an Introduction to Basic Biology Concepts, an Introduction to Experimental Techniques          used in Synthetic Biology, an Introduction to Genetic Circuit Theory and Mathematical Modeling, and a module on the          Ethics and Implications of Synthetic Biology.
In order to develop our materials effectively, we spoke with our former high school biology teachers to ask them what          features they would like to see present in LearnSynBio in order to best facilitate its incorporation into the classroom.          They emphasized the relatively short, discrete nature of the videos (preferring several videos in a module to one long          video), and really emphasized the importance of supplemental materials like worksheets which reinforce and complement          the material presented in the videos, and we incorporated these suggestions into the design of LearnSynBio.
for a PDF of more examples of learnsynbio exercises, click here.
Because LearnSynBio is hosted on an independent domain, it is easily accessible anywhere by anyone and can easily          be maintained and updated with feedback from teachers who use it. This allows our outreach efforts to continue even          in places and times where we cannot be physically present!
Finally, we are taking measures"
Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," what challenges every iGEM team encounters no matter what field they may work within, considering the stress factor, and tips of how to avoid them by putting a lot of effort into the structure of the project. Mrs Åsberg then continued with presenting gradually symptoms of burnout and tips on how the individuals can recognize the symptoms and start changing their lifestyle to be more enduring. Mr Nielsen then held a very appreciated workshop about mindfulness to provide a practical tools for the audience to use in the stressful lifestyle that is so common among us. From this session both the participants and audience learned something new, whether it was a practical tool to handle a stressful lifestyle or learning more about iGEM.

Hacking Life
The second session was called “Hacking Life”, where we organized a panel discussion that introduced the topic of synthetic biology as well as different ethical aspects and future applications. The panel was represented by Hannes Sjöblad (Swedish ambassador for Singularity University (NASA) with a background of biohacking), Per Sandin (associate professor in philosophy, and a senior lecturer in bioethics and environmental ethics at Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences) and Jens Sundström (is a member of the swedish genetics committee and a senior lecturer at the institution for plant biology at Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences). The panel was moderated by Nicolai Dorka (member of Stockholm iGEM 2018) and Niclas Fahlander (member of Uppsala iGEM 2018).

From this session both the participants and audience developed new insight in synthetic biology and thus iGEM could decrease further misinterpretation about subjects, such as GMO, that are common among citizens who have none or too little education about it. The interface between humans and different technologies, both silica- and of organic based were also discussed together with its entailing ethical discussions. The scenario was encaptivating and involving so many of the people present in the audience that it was hard to push for a break mid-section. Its safe to say both then and in retrospect that people found there time worth spent attending the symposium that day.

Advised by Wieden as well as U of L undergraduate and graduate students, the high school team – consisting of 22 students from Lethbridge-area high schools, including Keiran McCormack, Chris Isaac, Elaine Bird, Fiona Spitzig, Yoyo Yao, Patrick O'Donnell and Katie Thomas, who represented the team at the jamboree – successfully created a longer lasting form of Oxytocin. A hormone that’s most-commonly used to aid childbirth, Oxytocin degrades quickly and soon becomes unstable, making it expensive and difficult to store.
While such complex projects can be challenging for high school students, the research experience is invaluable, says former iGEM high school team member Erin Kelly.
“Being on the high school team was a steep learning curve, but I learned research methods through hands-on experience and that definitely made the transition to university easier,” says Kelly. Now a second-year biochemistry student at the U of L, she serves as an advisor to the current iGEM high school team along with fourth-year neuroscience student Isaac Ward and master of biochemistry student Mackenzie Coatham (BSc ’12).
The trio, all former members of the undergraduate iGEM team, have used their resulting research and entrepreneurial skills to launch the spinoff company Synbiologica Ltd. Along with Brandon (now a U of L master’s student in biochemistry), and U of L neuroscience professor Dr. Gerlinde Metz and Wieden as advisors, the group is in the process of patenting their big idea – a biomedical technology that provides rapid hormone-detection results. Their idea is expected to be 93 per cent more cost-effective than traditional antibody technology, bringing the next generation of hormone detection to the research, agriculture and medical markets.
In recognition of its scientific innovation, the Synbiologica team has earned numerous accolades. They include winning $10,000 in the South Venture Business Plan Competition and taking first place in the Tech Stream side of the Chinook Entrepreneurial Challenge, an annual business-planning competition hosted by Community Futures Lethbridge Region. The group received an additional $10,000 in cash, a one-year lease on space in the tecconnect: An Alberta centre for new commerce – a high-tech business incubator operated by Economic Development Lethbridge – plus a range of other in-kind prizes, including business consulting from MNP and ActionCOACH, and several thousand dollars worth of media services.

The following morning, dilutions into fresh media were made as follows: 1:100 dilution of the 1uM AHL overnight into fresh LB media with appropriate antibiotics and 1uM AHL (positive control), 1:100 dilution of the 0uM AHL overnight into fresh LB media with appropriate antibiotics and 0uM AHL (negative control), and 1:100 dilution of the 0uM AHL overnight into fresh LB media with appropriate antibiotics and 1uM AHL (test system).  The three systems were sampled once an hour for five hours.  Each sample was pelleted and double-washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and put on ice.
Fluorimetric analysis was conducted at Columbia University on a BioTek Synergy H1 Hybrid Reader (and the Genspace iGEM team gratefully acknowledges the generous help of the Columbia University iGEM team in this regard).  The excitation and emission wavelengths for the fluorescent analysis were 532nm and 588nm, respectively.  (Note that these are different than the 550nm/570nm wavelengths called out on   https://www.dna20.com/eCommerce/catalog/datasheet/54  for the Rudolph RFP.  The Synergy H1 Hybrid Reader warned about having excitation and emission wavelengths that were too close together: the employed 532nm/588nm wavelengths were a close compromise).  The fifteen samples (positive,                         negative and test, spanning five hours) were transferred in triplicate to a 96 well plate in 100uL aliquots per well.  A 100uL aliquot of PBS served as the blank reference against which OD600 and fluorescent measurements were comparatively                         made (i.e., by subtracting the OD600 and fluorescent readings"

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#TestDuke#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," found an alternative containment method,                             which we resurrected from the Oxford iGEM 2014 project 'DCMation'. Our predecessors' project also had to find a method of bacterial containment.
First attempt at making the beads using Sodium Alginate
The 2014 team encapsulated their bacteria in agarose to form BioBeads. These BioBeads were then given an outer coating of cellulose acetate, to allow flow of molecules into and out of the bead, whilst preventing the escape of their bacteria.
This year, we have been able to significantly improve the BioBead concept, by changing our inner material to sodium alginate, and our outer material to polystyrene; something which is still a work in progress. For full details on our developements on BioBeads, check out our Design page!
Increasing Awareness
To promote Synthetic Biology and iGEM, we’ve used a variety of approaches.
UNIQ Workshop
We met with 40 prospective Oxford students to teach them about Synthetic Biology. The students had in interest in Biochemistry but knew nothing about iGEM. We hammered home the key message of Synthetic Biology - that we achieve more progress by expanding a registry of standardised biological parts - through a 15 minute introductory presentation on BioBricks. We then split them into groups and gave each one a mentor from our iGEM team. We worked through questions to test their understanding in a tutorial style and asked them to explain the constructs of previous iGEM teams. They finished by presenting their findings to each other.
UTC Oxfordshire
A couple of us gave a presentation on antibiotic resistance to a class of GCSE students from UTC Oxfordshire (a local school specialising in science) at the Natural History Museum in Oxford, The Pitt Rivers Museum. Our talk covered the discovery of antibiotics, the advantages of them (including their use in laboratory work), how they work, and how bacteria can evolve to gain resistance to them, as well as concepts such as horizontal gene transfer and the consequences of antibiotic resistance on our everyday lives. It also covered our project outline, and pros and cons of Solution, showing how it should help combat antibiotic resistance. At the end, we held a discussion between the students and our team about antibiotic resistance, and their perception of the concern. We also asked how they would feel about using our engineered bacteria, and the response was positive, with most of the students saying that if their doctor recommended the treatment, they would be open to using it.

Due to the lack of equipment in interlab. UESTC-China turn to our laboratory for the fluorescent microplate reader. We offered the access to the equipment and the instructions in analyses of their experimental data.
Peking
We met team Peking first on the 5th Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC). After intense and deep discussions on our project design, team Peking proposed that it is necessary to consider the kinetics properties of dCas9 protein and sgRNA-dCas9 complex, especially in multi-sgRNA systems. Besides, we realized that dCas9 proteins would be saturated by a certain sgRNA with its high concentration, which would disrupt the entire multi-sgRNA system. To solve these problems, team Peking provided us a prototype based on dCas9 activator and binding period delay causing by RNAi which will help us improve and perfect our project modeling in the future.
CDHSU-China
On July 27th, 2018, our team went to Shishi High School in Chengdu, Sichuan province to conduct an interactive lecture. This lecture was prepared to give this new team some suggestions and share our experiences with them. And what’s more, this lecture could be counted as the beginning of a long-term cooperation between their team (CDHSU) and ours.                         We made adequate preparation for it, including consulting details in advance with related officials, understanding the needs of their team and determining the specific content and orientation of the lecture according to the feedback we had got. The lecture was held in the biology competition base of Chengdu Shishi High School. We helped them to be conversant with the competition rules and laboratory regulations. They used a species of plant that was not on the safety white list, so we advised them to have a check to make sure that their subject does not violate the rules. Since it is the first time for them to participate in the iGEM competition, there are many problems and obstacles in their experiments. Thus, it is necessary"

Single-Chamber Biosensors
MSU-iGEM 2017 developed a cost effective, applied biosensor. We designed this biosensor to detect water contaminants in a variety of circumstances and be used by multiple audiences. The biosensor is user friendly even to common consumers and high school students as well. The simple design promotes easy assembly and can be used as an education tool for high schools to show the possibilities of synthetic biology. In detecting water contaminants, the biosensor is durable and portable for scientists to use in field testing and consumers to use at home. The system is designed for initial testing for contaminants that are not regulated or tested for by the EPA. The biosensor provides a cost effective, rapid initial to test if the water must be analyzed by more costly measures. The design also utilizes Arduino boards (1,2,3) to apply the needed potential so the bacteria can produce electricity.
Prototype Testing
This is what happens when a hydrogen gas bubble forms and pushes the media up onto the electrode as well as having the potassium solution spill from the bioreactor due to a poor connection of the reference electrode.
Upgrading Design
After seeing the initial current production, we modified the design by adding a larger syringe housing for the cathode up to the present 3 ml syringe. This protected against hydrogen gas pockets building up and shorting the circuit by pushing the media down off the titanium wire. We also standardized adding 18 gauge needles to this housing area to promote better ventilation of the hydrogen gas. This eliminated the main problem that was distorting the data. We also made new rubber stoppers that provided a better fit into the glass reference housing for more stable background data. This allowed us to produce smooth current graphs throughout our entire project.

This reaction is similar with the reaction in device A, so we have $$\frac{\text{d}[IPTGI]}{\text{d}t}=-\gamma_{IPTG}([IPTGI]-[IPTGO])-m_{IPTG,pLacR}[IPTGI]^{\eta_2}[pLacR]+m_{CC}[CC]-\delta_{IPTG}[IPTGI]$$ Similarly, we can also get $$\frac{\text{d}[pLacR]}{\text{d}t}=\alpha_{pLacR}-m_{IPTG,pLacR}[IPTGI]^{\eta_2}[pLacR]+m_{CC}[CC]-\delta_{pLacR}[pLacR]$$ $$\frac{\text{d}[CC]}{\text{d}t}=m_{IPTG,pLacR}[IPTGI]^{\eta_2}[pLacR]-m_{CC}[CC]-\delta_{CC}[CC]$$ And $pLac$ is a transcription activator of gene $EGFP$, according to hill equation, the concentration of $EGFP$ is  $$\frac{\text{d}[EGFP]}{\text{d}t}=H\frac{\beta_{EGFP}K^n}{K^n+[pLacR]^n} -\delta_{EGFP} [EGFP] $$ The concentration of $EGFP$ is the same as the concentration of antibiotics resistance due to the transcription and translation of antibiotic resistance gene combined with the gene of $EGFP$. $$\frac{\text{d}[EGFP]}{\text{d}t}=\frac{\text{d}[ABR]}{\text{d}t}$$ Where $[EGFP]$ is the concentration of $EGFP$ and $[ABR]$ is the concentration of antibiotic resistance protein expression.

**3.0g glucose needed to be added later after the mixture was autoclaved, as glucose is known to caramelize under the conditions of the autoclave.
We also prepared an overnight stock containing 5mL of LB broth inoculated with E.coli from our verified colony. The following day we measured its optical density, demonstrating that our OD was 1.311, suitable for our purposes. We obtained our PetroBrick sequencing results with a complementarity of 87%, as compared to the theoretical PetroBrick in the PartsRegistry, which was deemed by iGEM team leaders to be high enough to continue in our protocol. We also performed glucose filtration, transferring 3g of glucose into our Production Media solution after it had been autoclaved in order to ensure sterile transfer. On the final day of the week, we were able to start our General Production Protocol that would be followed by a 48 hour incubation. It was in this time that hydrocarbon production was reportedly supposed to occur. Use of the GC would occur in the following week to test for alkane production.
Ring Cleavage
This week we made subcultures from Pf-5 in M9-MM into M9-MM without glucose to avoid carryover of glucose, to insure that the bacteria use butylcyclohexane as their only carbon source. We also took GC readings and compared experimental values to standards made with water and butylcyclohexane (butCH). Readings showed a decrease in amount of butCH in the headspace, compared to standards, indicating that the compound was being degraded by Pf-5. Then, we made subcultures from Pf-5 in M9-MM without glucose into the same media and butCH to decrease carry over of glucose and did time zero readings. Furthermore, we made subcultures from original Pf-5 in M9-MM without glucose into the same media and toluene to test for pathways that degrade aromatic structures. To identify possible genes for the pathways we started running blasts on the Pf-5 genome looking for genes that are homologous to ones that we have been looking at for the two ring cleavage pathways (aromatic and aliphatic). In addition we started a verification of XylE (aromatic ring cleavage enzyme) by transforming part K118021 (XylE with a Pcst promoter) from the parts registry and did two colony PCRs. unfortunately none"
TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Policy Practices#Stakeholders_-_-_TEXT.html," one of the farmers who had a Q fever infection on her farm who was very interested and involved in the development of new techniques to eradicate Q fever. Finally, we had contact with Q fever researchers from the University of Wageningen and GDdiergezondheid (the centre for animal health). An overview of these talks is presented below:
Dr. Anja Garritsen - Scientist working at InnatOss
Goal: Learn more about existing sensing methods that are used to detect Q fever.
Approach: We talked to Anja Garritsen, who is working at InnatOss and is greatly involved in the development of new techniques to detect Q fever. We asked her if she could tell us more about the systems they use. Also we asked her if she could see potential in the application of our sensor system. Thereby we asked her for advice on which molecules we could best use for detection.
Result: In InnatOss they make use of the detection of IFN-gamma for identification. She could tell us that this technique is only applicable after a person/animal has been infected with Q fever for 2 weeks already. Since the formation of antibodies is essential.  Dr. Garritsen herself was very much interested in new techniques to detect acute prevalence of Q fever. This is currently only possible within the first 2 weeks of infection and requires the PCR of bacterial DNA. She could, however, also tell us that the development of new techniques is hindered by a reduction of the occurrences of acute infections. This makes it hard to study the  development of particles in the blood that accompanies infection. When we asked her about particles that are prevalent after acute Q fever infection, she expected that Interleukin 2 and 10 and IFN-gamma might be the most readily available to detect. However these particles also occur in different bacterial infections and are therefore not specific.
Since we would like to use our device for the detection of particles associated with Q fever in milk of the animals, we further informed about the possibilities. Currently PCR-detection is used. Dr. Garritsen agreed that it is easier to get permission for the use of new treatment/detection methods  in animals. Furthermore she could tell us that nearly everything that can be detected in the blood, can also be detected in the milk (including blood cells). She proposed to detect antibodies produced as a result of vaccination. By tracking the antibodies in milk we could determine whether goats are still sufficiently protected against Q fever. Thus our device could be used to track when new vaccination is needed.  Finally we asked her general opinion about our"

Plugins
The great thing about BioHub is that we have designed a unified, extensible plugin platform, which not only have the powerful tools provided by the development team, but also is easy to learn and use by other developers to provide better features. Each specific feature of BioHub is provided by a plugin, whose developer do not need to care about details such as server and network requests. Plugins can just focus on performing their own tasks and manage user's design results. With BioHub's plugin platform, once any of the latest tools or algorithms in the field of synthetic biology got programmed, developers can easily transform it into a BioHub plugin by studying the sample files we provide, making it a new blade of the powerful Swiss Saber - BioHub.
Docker
In order to make BioHub easy to install, configure and use, we carefully selected the program architecture and package format. The use of server -  client architecture makes it possible for labs to run the server on a high-performance computer, and easily access it from any device. Also, we use Docker to package the program, which makes the server very easy to start, update and shutdown. Normally, users may never encounter any compatibility issues. What's more, we also released a virtual machine image file for non-Linux platforms.
Outlook
Since our project is a software designed for synthetic biologists to simplify their work as well as give them effective auxiliary, there are undoubtedly dozens of chances of this software to be improved, just like the previous work 'Biopano'. In the future, we will upgrade our program in order to implement more functions as well as enhance the current ones. For example, we may enable the 'Pathway finder' module to find the strength of the connection between genes, which our software cannot do this at present. Meanwhile, we will introduce our software and its background to our juniors to attract them to join us and to participate in the following iGEM competitions.

Figure 2. Figures showing the relationship between the CA-NC, CA1, CA2, and CA3 amplicons. These figures depict the different cut sites on the 3’ end of the construct done by the protease, determining where the amplicon will begin and end. Base 125-600 were cut out to fit on page.
II. Transformation of Amplicons
Purpose: Once successfully transformed into BL21 we will express the proteins and purify them for VLP formation experimentation.
Attributions: Protocol for the N-terminus amplicon transformation were done by John Banasihan, and the C-terminus by Gina Watanabe. A second attempt for the C-terminus was conducted by Jonathan Tello and Shelby Roberson.
Methods and Materials: Constructs 1-3.5a were amplified off the CR2 Gag-Pro-RT sequence and then digested with NcoI and BamHI restriction enzymes for ligation into pet14b according to our standard protocol. The ligated products were used to transform a DH5a strain and a colony PCR determined which colonies were had successfully uptaken the correct amplicon. The successful colonies were then selected for plasmid preparation in order to transform BL21 strains. A colony PCR would confirm the colonies that had been successfully transformed.The respective protein was purified from the successful colonies and then prepared for VLP transformation.
Results and Discussion: We were able to successfully express constructs 1, 2, 2a, 3a, and 3.5a and we purified them in protein form. The C-terminal construct transformations were unsuccessful. In regards to protocols used for the N-terminus and the C-terminus constructs, we used a 2-step PCR to generate C-terminus amplicons. This was the only difference yet transformation into the DH5a for the C-terminus was unsuccessful. C-terminal construct transformation into DH5a was attempted multiple times and every attempt was unsuccessful. Some potential reasons for this are: PCR cycles were not optimal, unsuccessful second step PCR, contamination that interfered with the PCR reaction, DH5a cells were no longer competent, and the restriction enzymes did not properly digest the 2nd step PCR amplicons as the digested products did not properly appear on the agarose gel as expected.
The following figures are the agarose gel runs of the colony PCR for transformed BL21 strains with different constructs. Figure 1 shows the results for the BL21"

Protein Structure- Supported by SCU-CHINA
In 2016 iGEM competition, FAFU-CHINA aims to use the combination of Cry and Cyt toxins to control mosquito larvae in order to decrease the disease transition like Malaria and Zika from mosquito. 2A peptides is an effective tool to co-express two different proteins with one single vector. However, when 2A peptides is cleaved during the translation, residues with a length of about 20 amino acids are remained at the end of the upstream protein and a proline remained at the beginning of the downstream protein. Because of this, we are not sure about whether the residues would affect the structure and function of the proteins that we are going to express in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, especially the Cry toxins. Therefore, SCU-CHINA team helped Tong Tong used Phyre2 to predict the secondary and tertiary structure of Cry4Aa, Cry10Aa and Cry11Aa with 2A residues. Unfortunately, the structure of Cry10Aa and Cry11Aa have not been elucidated by using X-ray crystallographic methods. Hence there is no good template in PDB database can be used and a large number of errors are reported from the results of homologous model construction for Cry10Aa-2A and Cry11Aa-2A. We were unable to estimate the effects of 2A residues to these two Cry toxins. However, the structure of Cry4Aa has been reported since 2006. We submitted the amino acid sequence of Cry4Aa-2A to Phyre"

Tali virus cosi´messi in circolazione sono in grado di infettare nuovi batteri, ed e´proprio questo “effetto domino” che la squadra cerca di ottenere per eliminare il maggior numero possibile di prede con poche cellule killer.
Accanto alla parte sperimentale condotta in laboratorio, anche la modellistica matematica dei moduli “sensoriale” ed “eliminatorio” costituisce un aspetto importante del progetto. La simulazione dei modelli consente di predire la risposta del sistema a diverse condizioni esterne ed interne, aiutando cosi´a progettare in modo migliore il lavoro sperimentale.
La squadra di Heidelberg si trova al momento nel mezzo della realizzazione del progetto. Gli studenti lavoreranno complessivamente per tre mesi (giorno e notte!) su questo progetto ambizioso. I primi risultati, sia sperimentali che teorici, sono gia´stati ottenuti e la squadra punta a completare il lavoro per lo Jamboree che si terra´a Boston ai primi di novembre, ed e´pronta a sfidare squadre rinomate come quelle di Harvard, Cambridge e Tokyo.

Dundee,2011,Team:Dundee#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," from different organism to improve nutritional components in plants, like increased amounts of food grade protein. This could be a great and efficient way to help famine stricken areas.  In addition, Scientists are also looking into naturally occurring oil-devouring micro-organisms which can help in developing new methods to reduce pollution. Natural occurring and environmentally friendly “Wetting agents” or biosurfactant’s produced by bacteria, yeasts or fungi, are potential solutions to damage from pollutants. Synthetic Biologists may be able to isolate the constituent of biosurfactants produced from a microbe and design them to clean up precise locations of a spill or polluted area.
Another relevant example is the use of synthetic bio-films to be used as environmental biosensors. These could be beneficial for sensing nutrient quality or areas of environmental degradation in the soil.
The presentation ended with a quote from Alistair Elfick of the University of Edinburgh:
“It is envisaged that synthetic biology may be able to contribute to resolving many of the challenges facing us in the 21st Century. The potential applications are immense. We can make devices to produce fuel or animal food from our waste; we can make devices to soak up carbon from the atmosphere and lock it away; we can make devices to synthesise plastics without the need to use oil; we can make devices to sense pollutants; we can make devices to create new drugs. Indeed, synthetic biology holds huge potential to impact positively on our daily lives.” (source: http://www.synbiostandards.co.uk/about_synbio.php)
The second part of the presentation was handed over to the St Andrews team who outlined and discussed the negative aspects and limitations of synthetic biology. St Andrews began by discussing the role of bioterrorism within synthetic biology. Explaining that since the open source approach used in Synthetic Biology can be used by anyone, it is possible to create a virulent strain of bacteria/virus. The example used here was the assembly of Polio from mail order oligonucleotides. Other potential harmful effects include any organism that escapes the lab into the environment. The consequences of this are potentially dangerous. The bacteria could either colonize people causing harmful effects or even be lethal. In addition, the bacteria could potentially out compete other natural flora. This danger stresses the need for scientists to test their synthetic bacteria in the open environment. For example, the arsenic sensor that was produced by an iGEM team needs to be used in an open environment in order to fulfill its use. There is a possibility here that the bacteria becomes endemic in the environment during the test, causing lethal or severe damage to animals"

We could see the FIFO in a more convenient manner with the assembly of two class II promotors associated to differents fluorophores. Then we could observed two kinds of fluorescents in One Cell along time.  One problem that could occur is the interaction between the differents fluorescents proteins due to the cross-over of their emission and excitation spectra and moreover in our final system that count three fluorophores.
emission and excitation spectra of ECFP, YFP and mRFP
The choice of ECFP, YFP and mRFP is based upon this consideration and upon the order of appearing in the FIFO. Indeed by putting the mRFP in last position, we improve the visualization of the FIFO like the maturation time of the protein is about of one hour.
We thank a lot Arnau Montagu, advisor of the iGEM Valencia Team. He advised us, after his team had troubleshooting with fluorescence, to take care about spurious FRET. This phenomenon occurs even with non covered fluorescent spectra when the concentration of two fluorophores is sufficient so they are enough closer to induce some FRET. But it could happen at lower concentration than 40 μM.

Oscillating module
Few approaches have been thought in order to create the oscillating module. The pTet/TetR system that allows us to precisely control the inhibition of TetR on the Tet promotor. Another system use the natural inhibition of OmpR and of EnvZ via OmpR. We finally perform this system that we have developed since we know thanks to the modeling team that the oscillations are the only way to see the full development of the FIFO.
