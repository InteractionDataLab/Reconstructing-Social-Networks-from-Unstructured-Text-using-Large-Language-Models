City: Fuzhou
This summer, we went to Fuzhou, a city located in the south of China to attend the CCiC(Conference of China iGEMer Community). Nearly 50 iGEM teams and many synthetic biology professors attended this meeting. We shared our experience about the team’s history in our university as well as our project this year. Also, we communicated with other teams during the poster time.
Many suggestions that we received from other teams are of value, so we further improved our design after coming back. Besides, we built close cooperation with UESTC-China since we both used the tobacco.
All in all, it’s a pleasant, unforgettable and meaningful meetup!
BTGEM Summit
Time:2017.10.7
City: Beijing
BTGEM Summit was a local meet up that mainly aims to communicate the project results for every team. We trained ourselves through telling others our story, and they fed back what they were interested in or what they could not figure out, and all these information helped us discover many defects in our presentation. At the same time, some fellows’ suggestions pointed out our direction of work in the last month, we gained very much from this meet up.

What is the approximate size of the total market for all existing solutions? Is the market expanding or contracting?
Cystic Fibrosis:
The increasing prevalence of cystic fibrosis (CF) (In the U.S., the number of patients in 2010 rose from 26,366 to a total of 28,983 patients in 2015)) together with rising treatment rate is one of the key reasons for the market growth. In upcoming years, an increase in R&D funding by both private and public organizations, a rising number of initiatives undertaken by nonprofit organizations, and presence of favorable reimbursement policies are expected to drive the market.
The Global Market Size
$3.56 billion
COPD:
The global market size of COPD is expanding. Much of this growth is a result of a high number of new, more efficacious and convenient products entering the market and commanding greater value compared to the therapies already in the market.
The Global Market Size
$11.3 billion
Asthma:
Although asthma has the biggest market size, it is anticipated to show a slow growth rate of 2.2% over the forecast period from 2016 to 2024. And increasing incidence of respiratory diseases together with the demand for cost-effective treatment options is expected to push the asthma therapeutics market growth during the forecast period. According to the estimates published by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), in the year 2013, around 300 million patients globally were reported to be afflicted with this disease and the number is expected to grow in the coming years11.
The Global Market Size
$20.7 billion
What is the size of the market opportunity in each market segment and the potential for growth and expansion?
Cystic fibrosis:
The market for cystic fibrosis is segmented into pancreatic enzyme supplements, mucolytics, bronchodilators, and CFTR modulators.
In 2016, CFTR modulators accounted for the largest revenue with a share of approximately 47.3% owing to the launch of new drug Orkambi. This drug is responsible for correcting the function of a defective protein caused by the CF gene.
The market is also segmented into oral route and inhaled drugs. Oral route drugs account for the largest share of nearly 63.7%.

UIUC-Illinois,2012,Team:UIUC-Illinois#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," in the laboratory, within society, within industry, and perhaps even within the body all must be carefully considered. In order to deal with these magnitudes of complexity, each team should ensure that safety regulations are clearly articulated and standardized. This includes standard biosafety level 2 protocols. In future operations, we plan to appoint a officer in terms of laboratory and project safety.
Additionally, the incorporation of safety concepts into each team’s human practices project would not only allow the iGEM team to think more deeply about safety, but the general public as well. Furthermore, iGEM teams with applications in industry should strive to partner with companies to explore the different safety standards already in place and those that need to be developed with the introduction of some synthetic biology advance.

I. With Peking University (PKU)
Some of our experiments were conducted in PKU old biology building. We shared the lab equipments with the         iGEMers from PKU. They offered us valuable advice on the experiment designing, and helped us with lab skills         training in winter holiday. Yihao Zhang, the advisor of PKU iGEM team, also lent us plate reader, so we could         conduct Interlab and A.hydrophila sensor experiments smoothly. Without their help, we would not complete all         the experiments with the same efficiency.
II. With University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)
In July, we visited UCAS and had a meeting with their iGEM team members. We communicated our team projects and         gave suggestions in experiment designing to each other. They offered us useful advice on the potential safety         issues in our project and helped us to fixed them. We asked them some questions related to plasmid construction and helped them to clarify the experiment design. Moreover, we helped them to complete their human practice by         using bacteria transformed with chromoproteins to paint pictures on LB plates.
III. With the Second High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University (SHSBNU)
We shared our Interlab materials with them, enabling them to finish the Interlab, which is a requirement for         bronze medal."

New way of transforming bacteria idea
Create a plasmid containing Dpn1 under the influence of a strong repressor. In the same plasmid insert the methylase enzyme. The gene is inserted into the methylase and stops its transcription.
If the gene of interest has been successfully inserted into the plasmid and the plasmid has been successfully inserted into the bacteria we can use the inducer to kill off any bacteria that has not been transformed (because the Dpn1 cuts any methylated strands of DNA).
Today we continued developing the bile acid sensor as well as the idea of the anti-venom. For the anti-venom idea we talked to Travis Bayer and obtained a method for screening for the right mutants. We also had a visit from LSE BIOS members that taught us about the point points we should worry about in human practices. We were also given the task to make instructions for a lego structure to show us how difficult it is to standardize parts due to the difficulty of communicating more complicated instructions.

Making rain with bacterial spores
The surface of spores can form crystal structures that attract water vapour from the air and form rain drops. We wanted to use this priniciple to have a useful output from the spores when they reach the ground - which could be sand or soil.
There are several genes localized that contribute to the spore outer layer which could potentially be randomly mutated to optimize the geometric shape of the spore to promote water droplet formation.
One of the drawbacks to using spores is that we need germination to occur for gene expression and there is an obvious risk of releasing GMOs into nature. One option could be to engineer in a death response to have limited gene expression of mucin for example which could aid in water retention, or auxin to promote root growth deep into soil.

During the course of our iGEM project and especally after meeting other iGEM teams in berlin, the news about our toolkit spread through Europe and we got in contact with some other teams that were interested in using TAL effectors in their projects.
Collaboration with Team Potsdam Bioware: Team Potsdam is working on a CHO cell-based project for generating antibodies. Hypermutation should be accomplished by cotransfection of the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). Since it is obviously preferable that the activity of the AID is focussed on the antibody gene, we decided to put our expertise in our two distinct research fields together and produce a TAL-AID fusion protein that binds to the antibody gene-containing plasmid. Using the Plug-and-Play Effector Cassette (PPEC) in our eukaryotic TAL expression vector, it was quite easy to fuse the AID gene to our TAL scaffold. The next step, namely targeting the TAL-AID construct to the antibody plasmid, was a child's play with our GATE kit. So we produced a TAL-AID that specifically binds to the sequence T G C G G T C T A T T A C T and currently test it in collaboration with the Potsdam Bioware Team. We hope that we will be able to show you the new data in Boston.
Collaboration with Team Fatih Medical:
We are in contact with Team Fatih Medical since May and discussed exciting new applications of TAL effectors. Moreover, we have filled out their survey on synthetic biology, which is part of their human practices project.

Principle
The basic idea of this memory system was first developed by KULeuven during the 2008 iGEM competition.  Now we serve it as a function to memorize the added inducer.  By conjugating the sequences, the inducer (lactose) is distinguished and memorized, and then drives the whole device.  When the inducer is removed, however, the function of whole device can be switched to a contrary one.  ( It can only be switched on once and can never go back. )
記憶系統的基本構想是由KULeuven於iGEM2008所提出，而我們將他延伸運用在「被加入的誘導物與環境控制的記憶」此功能上。加入的誘導物(果糖)可調控共軛的兩條序列，進而達到我們所需求的功能。如果移除誘導物，則能將整個系統切換成另一個狀態並產生另一種功能。(這組共軛序列只能進行一次切換，而且這切換是不可逆的。)
The four devices above were separated from our project and be interpreted individually. T7 promoter (I7 17024) is a strong, continually expressed promoter, so that the LacI gene sequence (K091121) is translated unceasingly and lead to the accumulation of the LacI protein. Surrounded by LacI protein, the SD sequence of the PLacI promoter (K091110) is easily stocked and restrains the promoter’s work.

Modeling
We developed several models to help design our biosensor to maximize output variation (i.e. the difference between a person with cancer and a healthy person) and to maximize the overall output so the fluorescence can be detected more easily with cheaper equipment, which would drive down net cost of using our sensor in a medical setting.
These include:
NUPACK modeling : Used NUPACK to model the secondary structures of the toehold switches in their closed and open states to maximize dynamic range.
Mass action kinetics modeling : Built a mass action kinetics model to identify the most important parameters to optimize in our design. We ported this model to JavaScript to make it easier for our design team to use and to explain the model to others.
Stochastic modeling : We collaborated with Oxford to validated our mass action kinetics model, by stochastic modeling of the uncertainties of the parameters.
We also built a cost model to provide insight into using our device as a mass-screening tool, which we tied into our human practices work.
NUPACK model
NUPACK is a software tool that can model the secondary structures of RNA systems. [1] We used NUPACK to optimize the design of our toehold switches.
We ran our simulations at 37°C, with 100 picomolar of miRNA, 20 nanomolar of DNA and 500 picomolar of anti-miRNA. We chose this temperature as it is the optimum for E. coli derived enzymes.
Using NUPACK, we"

Discussion
It was established that streptomycin resistance as screening method did not provide sufficient data. The main issue was to quantify the actual mutants and separate them from spontaneous mutants. Time restrains limited the option of sequencing any of the mutants to verify the insertions. Experiments could be replicated to support the data. If the experimental data is accurate, the findings suggest the beta protein to be more efficient than the GP35, contradicts Sun et al. 2015, but we hypothesis that this could be due to the shorter oligos used compared to theirs[3]. Other reasons could be that GP35 is dependent on other gene products from the SPP1 phage such as GP34 or GP33, but this has not been confirmed.
Optimization of MAGE in B. subtilis
Overview
Different experiments were made to optimize the MAGE procedure. Three different experiments were conducted, to test the right amount and length of the oligos. additionally the mismatch frequency was attempted to be quantified. In our experiments the optimal length was shown to be 80nt which correlates with the expected 90nt. Optimal amount of oligo was showed to be 5uM, which also fits with the expectations. Interestingly the number of mismatches with the highest transformation rate was 5 mismatches, this is unexpected. Using streptomycin oligoes seemed to have a high systematic error"

As a part of our lab work, we’ve conducted numerous experiments with different protocols. The protocols we have used during our experiments were mostly based on the procedures of the companies which supplied us our genes and materials, including iGEM protocols. For example, for our Competent Cell Test, we’ve followed iGEM’s protocol; and for the plasmid isolation protocol, we’ve followed the protocol supplied by Nanobiz, our lab equipment provider.
Before starting each of our experiments, we have optimized and calculated the most suitable conditions. Below are the protocols we used as a result of our optimizations.
Resuspension of DNA in iGEM Kit Plates Protocol
Materials:
dH2O

Pipette
Method:
With a pipette tip, punch a hole through the foil cover into the corresponding well of the part desired.
Pipette 10 µLof dH2O into the well. Pipette up and down several times and let sit for 5 minutes to make sure the dried DNA is fully resuspended. Resuspension will be in a crimson color, as the dried DNA has crisol dye.
Transform resuspended DNA into an eppendorf tube.
Competent Cell Preparation Protocol:
Buffer 1:
Potassium acetate 30 µL

·Once spot great articles or useful biobricks, iGEMers cannot instantly gather together online in one site to discuss them or share their thoughts and puzzles.
...
Considering thoroughly about the problems above, we catagorize the target users of WEiGEM2.0 in three major aspects:
·General Biology Lovers
·Inexperienced iGEMers
·Professional iGEM team members
Focusing on the demand of our potential users, we further developed WEiGEM2.0 on the basis of WEiGEM1.0, with more available and practical functions presenting to the public.
Bio-brick searching engine
Brief  Introduction:
Bio-brick plays a crucial role in the field of synthetic biology; hence the core of WEiGEM is bio-brick. We further developed WEiGEM2.0 based on the popular WEiGEM1.0. Through WeChat, we establish a strong connection among iGEMers, mobile phone, and personal computer. Suffered by the low-efficiency bio-brick searching engines, we came up with the idea of developing a newer, more unique and more efficient searching engine based on the large bio-brick database from iGEM website. We picked several important attributions such as functions, types, status, etc. and assembled them in one search page, allowing users to fill up whatever search box with pieces of information that they consider necessary. Therefore, we can not only search bio-bricks by their names,but also search them according to certain descriptions. Furthermore, users can choose the binding type of prefix and receive bio-brick information with genetic sequences including prefixes and suffixes. Through redesigned algorithm which fits our engine most, our search engine can respond more quickly and be used more conveniently than those previous searching tools. After attaining the bio-bricks they need, if users consider some bio-bricks important, they can mark them down and review them later for other purposes.
Features:
1)Multiple search choice and cross-match
In addition to the common free search mode, we considered the demand of users, and developed various humanized functions. For instance, the function column in the searching page serves to find bio-bricks by keywords in their function and helps an iGEMer match the functions he needs with the bio-bricks that are yet unknown to him but can possibly actualize his goals. This will definitely motivate the researchers’ inspirations when their minds"

Optimized dspB:
Colonies from the transformation of Pxyl and BBa_K081005 with dspB optimized + rsaA in pMR10 were picked, freeze-thawed, and PCR amplified using M13F and M13R.  These were run on a gel ( Figure ).  PrsaA + dspB optimized + rsaA appears to have been transformed and BBa_K081005 + dspB optimized + rsaA may have been.  A conjugation was performed on PrsaA + dspB optimized + rsaA.  To check BBa_K081005 + dspB optimized + rsaA, the transformation product was Miniprepped and digested and run on a gel again but the digestion did not appear to have worked.  More colonies of BBa_K081005 + dspB optimized + rsaA were checked through colony PCR ( Figure ) and a miniprep of colony 1 was PCR amplified but showed the wrong size fragment ( Figure ). The transformation of Pxyl + dspB optimized + rsaA was redone with a fresh digest of Pxyl with SpeI and PstI from a new miniprep. 6 colonies from this transformation plate were picked, freeze-thawed, PCR amplified and run on a gel but showed no desired fragment ( Figure ).  8 more colonies were colony PCR amplified and run on a gel ( Figure ).  Colony 12 showed the correct band size and was digested with EcoRI and PstI and then transformed into pMR10.  Colonies from the transformation of Pxyl + dspB optimized + rsaA into pMR10 were colony PCR amplified and run on a gel ( Figure ).  Colony 3 appears to contain the right size fragment (around 1,800bp) and was therefore conjugated into Caulobacter.
Week 9 July 24-30
The insertions of Pxyl/PrsaA+optimized esp+rsaA into pMR10 were both successful ( Figure Pxyl ). In order to transfer the pMR10 plasmids into C. crescentus, two conjugations were performed.
Inserting optimized esp into BBa_K081005 plasmid was also proved to be right. We picked 8 colonies from from transformation cells and made overnight for each. The overnight culture was Miniprep to get the plasmid and the MiniPrep products were digested and then run on a gel. 6 colonies showed bright band just below 1kb, which was supposed to the right size"

Jilin_China,2018,Team:Jilin China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," When our team did the measurement, we cultured the bacteria to OD=0.6 and then re-suspended the bacterial precipitation with MM culture medium. We cultured the bacteria with different concentration of psicose and measured the Abs600 and fluorescence intensity once per hour.
The results are as follows:
Figure 8. Abs600 and fluorescence intensity once per hour in different psicose solution.
From the above results, we can see that with the increasing of psicose concentration, the fluorescence intensity increases, which matches their assumption.
XJTU-China has also helped us a lot. For our experimental design this year, we have lots of RNA-based thermosensors to submit to the part registry, which is a huge and challenging task. If we use the traditional construction method, the time and cost of constructing these parts will be a huge problem for us. Fortunately, we met XJTU-China at the CCiC conference, and they would like to help us design an intermediate device for constructing standardized parts.
In combination with their own experience in using Golden Gate assembly, they inserted an only 60bp DNA fragment into pSB1C3 plasmid. The DNA fragment contains BsaI restriction site. Golden Gate assembly will enable fast and efficient parts construction. They sent the device to us as quickly as possible so we could complete the construction of about 50 parts before deadline, which greatly reduced our workload, improved our experimental efficiency, and solved our problem.
Figure 9. The intermediate device for constructing standardized parts.
The plasmid was confirmed to be constructed as expectation by enzyme digestion (original plasmid, BsaI single digestion, and EcoRI and PstI double digestion). The agarose gel electrophoresis (figure 10) showed that these enzyme-digested products were all normal, and the brightness was also normal (5bp and 60bp fragment cannot be fully displayed on the electropherogram due to its short length ). Furthermore, they sequenced it. The sequencing results showed that the ligation of plasmid and insert was correct, and the sequencing results were of good quality.
Figure 10. Each gel pore reprenents 1kb marker, original plasmid, plasmid + BsaI and plasmid + EcoRI + PstI.
In our follow-up experiments, the constructing device was fully applicable, and the success rate exceeded our expectation, which greatly reduced our workload. We constructed all basic parts before deadline.
After this cooperation, we have established a deep friendship with XJTU-China. We often discuss some problems encountered in Golden Gate"

GFP Zif strain grew in NM, showing that selection is working.
In complete media, NM, and NM+1 or 3mM 3-AT, GFP Zif grew as well as the regular Zif268 strain. However, as 3-AT concentrations increased, GFP Zif began to grow considerably less compared to Zif268. The reason for this is unclear.

Synthetic Biology Meeting Turkey
COLLABORATION WITH POLITICS CLUB
Synthetic  biology is a brand new field of study that develops very fast. While new  projects come out in time, the questions and problems pop out. Recent example  was the big debate that took place in Europe Jamboree: “The Meeting of Young  Minds”. In the event, young politicians of Holland and iGEM team members  discussed synthetic biology, its properties and future.
Beyond of  that, during the development of the science, it can also be abused and bring  catastrophes to humanity. Informing people and encouraging to use it for the  sake of people is very important because of this reality.
From this  perspective, we discussed this issue with our friends from politics club of our  university in İstanbul. We told them what synthetic biology is, what the  scientists can do via designing the organisms with BioBricks and what this  science would bring to humanity in the future. Then, politics club made a  private meeting between them and declared a report about synthetic biology and  aspects of people about it:
According  to members of the club;
An  obligatory to all countries that can use synthetic biology technology must be  prepared and declared like Kyoto Protocol. It is believed that this will slow  down or prevent possible abuses of synthetic biology.
An  authorized committee whose members are experts of their fields of study related  with synthetic biology must be assembled. This committee must control whole  studies about SynBio. Some sanctions should be applied by this committee to who  abuse this field or become harmful to humanity.

Advice
We don't get to talk to people who know about synthetic biology in real life that much, going to a small liberal arts college. So it was an absolute treat to go to the University of Virginia and talk to domain experts and motivated students

Gibson Assembly
No one in our institution has even performed a Gibson Assembly, so when we decided to use it as our primary assembly technique we were more than a little nervous. Luckily, the UVA iGEM team are old hands at Gibson Assembly and were able to give us some guided direction in the design and troubleshooting of primers and assembly technique
Soluble Methane Monooxygenase, kind of difficult
Our chosen methanaphile and lynchpin of our project proved difficult to worth with. The Universtiy of Virginia actually had a graduate student from the Heidelburg Team that created the original sMMO part.  From this advice we were able to better understand how we wanted to express sMMO."

Cork_Ireland,2015,Team:Cork Ireland#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the flight experienced a hemorrhagic fever and the airport had an ambulance waiting for him in Geneva. That was a horrible experience for him.
She set up the first molecular biology lab in Honduras and has past experience in running that lab. People who visited just could not be diagnosed or would end up misdiagnosed because they wouldn’t have a proper procedure for the diseases. She also noticed the lack of supply chain for diagnostics, those suppliers that could provide diagnostics had to charge massive prices to make a profit. So we decided to set up the company to provide diagnostics for developing countries and give them access to quick and accurate diagnostics.
Describe the concept of a diagnostic DNA computer?
All of the current molecular diagnostic products on the market have three things in common; they require specialized training, a lab fitted with expensive equipment and an end-user who has the buying power.
Isothermal amplification technologies have been developed to tackle these issues but many have been proven to have high false positive rates and under-perform in the field.
Using DNA-Computing we can modify the performance of these isothermal amplification technologies, eliminating false positives but not further complicating the protocol.
How will your product be used once it’s fully developed?
Any type of laboratory or clinic can diagnose a wide range of diseases quickly by taking a single blood sample and placing it in the reaction tube; this tube contains our DNA computer! If the pathogen is present the tube will glow giving a rapid and reliable result.
Why is so important to get an accurate diagnosis of a disease before treatment can start?
Many diseases can present initially with similar symptoms such as a headache, body ache or fatigue; but medically they are different. A treatment that could cure one type of illness could potentially be harmful in another. Molecular diagnostic tests allow us to distinguish between diseases and result in the patient getting the correct treatment.
What advantages will your product have over other diagnostic methods?
Our product is designed to work in low resource settings, regardless of specialized equipment or trained personnel. Using our DNA-computing technology, the cost of a single test is 10 times cheaper than current molecular tests on the market. Using the test is simple; determining the results even simpler! The tube glows to show a positive result!
How much will this diagnostic cost?
At the moment, the cost of 1 test in Honduras is $113 whereas the average Honduran only earns $80 a week which put these diagnostic tests far from their reach. Our test costs $3, yes that’s right, $3.
For each reaction, our reagents cost $1.56, tubes cost $0.46 and fluorochrome costs"

BSc Biological Sciences (Biotechnology) Graduate, University of Edinbrough; MRes Microbiology (Distinction) Graduate, Birkbeck, University of London
Tim is fascinated by the rich diversity of the microbial world, and how this can be utilised for biotechnological and medical usage.
During this time he felt restless and enrolled on the part-time MSc Microbiology course at Birkbeck. Almost immediately he rediscovered his passion for microbiology and the following year he quit recruitment and transferred to a full-time MRes research project. The project was to assess the activity of a light-activated antimicrobial surface. ""Despite blowing my life savings and having to also work part-time to support myself, it was the best decision I've ever made"". He fell in love with research and his hard work has earnt me a BBSRC PhD scholarship to investigate the biosynthetic capabilities of Actinomycetes.""
Tim's effort in the Owligos team is around Practice & Policy and Sponsorship. Tim is proud to be a part of the inaugural Birkbeck iGEM team because, without the flexible learning opportunities they offer to full-time working people, he wouldn't have been able to complete a Masters and wouldn't now be living his dream as a research microbiologist. Tim is very excited by the project we are developing and looks forward to showing everyone at the Giant Jamboree everything we have achieved!

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Project#Life science#EET#cloning_-_-_TEXT.html," primer of the last DNA part was designed in a way that a HIS tag was introduced at the C-terminus of the MtrB protein. However, there was no additional stop codon included in this primer. Therefore we do not characterize this BioBrick.
For characterization the mtrCAB BioBrick was introduced into pSB3K3. This backbone has a lower copy number than pSB1C3 and is therefore more consistent with the literature [1].
ccmAH
Our BioBrick BBa_K1316011 encodes the cytochrome C maturation genes (ccm) under control of the pFAB640 promoter [1]. The Ccm proteins help to mature the MtrCAB conduit and are therefore needed to facilitate Electron Transport. The end construct is visualized figure 4.
Figure 4: BBa_K1316011. Schematic overview of the ccm genes under control of the pFAB640 promoter.
Cloning Scheme
In order obtain our ccm BioBrick we inserted the pFAB640 promoter in BBa_K917006 , a BioBrick that encodes the ccm gene cluster, constructed by the Edinburgh 2012 iGEM team. A schematic representation of the cloning strategy can be found on figure 5.

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Cholera - Detection_-_-_TEXT.html,"era Detect There is already a lot done from last year, so we need to test the constructs from last year. The first step is sequencing and then getting it into E. Coli. Just like the destroy group, we first need to start growing some Cholera.
Big phage Need to do more research on what has already been done. One possible question is how to get a plasmid to form with medicine or something inside.
Small Phage They are trying to decide which phage to use. They are going to grow phage and see if any mutations produce a smaller phage. They need to come up with a screening method.
Here is what we need to do right now. We went to Dr. Robison’s lab and asked for a sample of cholera. We will return on Wednesday to pick it up. It is important that we can get the cholera to grow and produce biofilm. Next, we are looking through the work that the iGEM team did last year. We want to try some of their constructs on the biofilm to see if they actually work. We will also try some of our own ideas.
KK March 18th,
Our priority list right now is: 1) Get cholera growing a biofilm, and 2) Test existing constructs from last year’s iGEM.
We talked with Annette, Dr. Robison’s lab manager, and she promised us she would have a streak of cholera available for us by Wednesday. As soon as we get Cholera, we’re going to form a plan with Dr. Grose for how we can store it so as to not need to constantly ask Dr. Robison’s lab for cholera. On Wednesday we’ll begin to see if we can get cholera to grow biofilms.
Today I looked over existing plasmid constructs. Apparently iGEMers from last year did clone many genes into plasmids but the plasmids aren’t yet in the registry. Since the plasmids have not been sequenced, that will be another priority on Wednesday.
We also learned that Calgary in 2008 created “Champion,” a bacteria that sensed AHL and AI-2. They used colicin to succesfully eliminate “Bad Guy 1” (which I think is so tacky, and I struggled to determine what the heck “Bad Guy” is but I think it’s Vibrio Fischeri). Their quorum-sensing construct worked … they did NOT work with cholera, but in their presentation video they make reference to the potential usefulness of their system with cholera.

TAS_Taipei,2015,Team:TAS Taipei#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," of overspending on marketing and advertising.  Currently the United States has tax incentives for research and development (R&D) for pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. because R&D increases the quality of health care. R&D incentives can encourage the discovery of new drugs and can lower the cost of current pharmaceuticals. These incentives have been successful in supporting pharmaceutical companies' growth. These tax incentives, however, have recently been overused by companies in the “supporting functions” of R&D expenses, namely, marketing and advertising.  Hence, the government’s tax credits for developing more effective and efficient drugs is being used beyond its original purpose. To prevent biopharmaceuticals from following this same trend, we propose that there should be clear distinction between incentives for R&D marketing and incentives for actual research.  American taxpayer funds should go to promote research that benefits the common good, not additional advertising.
The policy brief that we created was based off of research from our questionnaire from The National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine's (Committee on Science, Technology and Law – Forum on Synthetic Biology) in addition to literature research and assistance from our Instructor and debate coach Mr. Richard Brundage.

We obviously love iGEM and synthetic biology.  But we want the world to love iGEM and synthetic biology too.  More importantly, we want to inform the public and students in our school about how synthetic biology works and what the future holds for synthetic bio applications.  Listed below are some of the activities and programs we coordinated to engage as many people as possible.
iGEM Club
By creating the iGEM club, we provided a platform for underclassmen to experience iGEM related activities and develop potential iGEM members to contribute to the formation of our project. Furthermore, we raised awareness during the TAS annual club fair and allow students to join the club. Students in the iGEM club will not only have a chance to input ideas during our planning stage, but also have an opportunity to have a hands on experience of lab work.
Spring Fair
We set up a booth to gain public opinion about synthetic biology and our project through the school’s most renowned social event, the Spring Fair. We created a survey (LINK TO SURVEY) to gain public perception about biopharmaceuticals, GzmB related diese"

As a new team, with limited knowledge of iGEM competition, we desperately needed instructions and suggestions on how to start and manage a team. We have met obstacles and setbacks and we have been seeking advice from 3 teams.
NUDT-China: We invited iGEM NUDT-China that has participated in iGEM for three times to answer our puzzles. During the meeting, NUDT-China introduced the iGEM process, and shared their experience in team building in detail with us. At the same time, they gave comments on our project, and put forward a lot of good ideas.
Nanjing-China: After proposing some initial ideas of our own project, in order to polish up it, some of our team members went to Nanjing University to obtain experience. In Nanjing University, both teams gave a presentation on their project design. As a veteran team, Nanjing-China gave us constructive suggestions which were significant to us. From then on, we gradually became clearer in thoughts and got started with our work.
UESTC-China: The UESTC-China post some plasmids and introduced to us some details about the iGEM.
Counseling
Biosafety issues
Doctor Li Ming is experienced in doing research in horizontal gene transfer and teaching the lecture on biosafety for undergraduates. The biosafety issue is one of the major concerns of both participant teams and organizers of iGEM. Before we started in the wet lab, we asked Doctor Li to evaluate the biosafety issues of our whole project. He introduced the biosafety classifications of different organisms and protection practices among different biosafety level labs. The Vi antigen project was his major concern and he gave us valuable suggestions. He also communicated with Doctor Cong Yanuang to confirm our lab procedures, making sure we were not going to culture S.Typhi but just to extract the genomic DNA of S.Typhi. He helped us analyze whether there were potential transposable elements among the His targeting locus, and the result proved to be negative, which meant the device integrated into the His locus would not be horizontally transferred to other bacteria. At last, he brought up with several biological containment strategies, including the metabolic auxotroph, suicide genes and kill switches. We really appreciate Doctor Li’s instructions on biosafety issues and his thoughtful ideas helped us a lot.

Science Communication
Introduction
What is Science Communication? Science communication distills complex topics into more accessible lay language, to be shared with a non-expert audience. Effective communication helps the public understand the relevance of scientific research to their everyday lives. Effective science communication takes a lot of practice, and scientists are often worried that important (and exciting!) information will be lost in the translation to lay terms. Over the course of the summer, we continuously sought to improve our own abilities as science communicators. As we became more experienced, we developed communication tools, like analogies, to support discussions of complex topics. What are the Problems Facing Science Literacy? The general public often lack the tools to distinguish between legitimate science and pseudoscience. Social media has accelerated the sharing of information, but often this information has not been carefully vetted. Rigorous, peer-reviewed science and pseudoscience both spread rapidly on social media. The public would greatly benefit from greater exposure to the scientific method, and tools to enable critical analysis of information. Increased access to reliable sources of scientific content, presented in an accessible manner, is necessary to counter the spread of pseudoscience.
Our Project
This year, the theme for our human practices was science communication and science literacy. To efficiently explore this theme, we divided it into component parts. On this webpage, we describe our science communication efforts. We strove to raise awareness about the importance of science literacy and to establish communication platforms between our lab and the public. What did we do? We created a survey early in the summer to gain insight into how our surveyed population felt about interpreting science-based news articles. This survey was distributed around the world and received 271 responses in a span of a month. Afterwards, we formulated questions that reflected some of the surprising results collected from the survey. We then asked these questions to a series of experts in hopes of better understanding our results. Here are a few key results of the survey (focusing on the population who identified as having a university education):
Approximately a quarter our surveyed population, who identified as having an university education, claimed to not be very comfortable interpreting scientific news publications.
Most of our surveyed population, who identified as having an university education, claimed to trust scientific reports"

Name: Karen Kar On Cheng
Height: I'm tall; Weight: It's a secret! Belongs to the tetp group.
Karen is a our team leader. Despite that, she is easy to approach and always willing to help other members. She is always the first to enter the lab and the last to leave. Thanks to her, we don’t need to worry about running out of reagents as she is always on top of replenishing supplies. In the lab, she has been very patient with us, always replying “should be okay…” whenever we’re unsure or stressed out about something. She is responsible with keeping track of the team’s progress.
Name: Leona Long Ching Lai
Height: I'm tall; Weight: It's a secret! Belongs to the tetp group.
Leona is a very devoted member of the project. The leader of one of the three module groups, she practises tough love on her group mates. She has a pretty loud voice so it might sometimes sound like she's being harsh but everyone knows she doesn't mean it. The most valuable trait of her is that she always tries to do beyond her responsibility and never cares about claiming credit, from planning daily experimental procedures to preparing materials for weekly presentations. We all appreciate her very much.
Name: Luna Jaya Eresta
Height: I'm tall; Weight: It's a secret! Belongs to the tetp group.
The Teacher. Luna is a great teacher and leader. She’s very organized and quite perfectionist in her work.  She is clear about what to do in the next step and focus on how to modify experiments in order to get a more reliable and persuasive result. Every day in the lab becomes smoother and easier because of the Workflow Plan that she initiated for our group. She’s also very good in delegating work for other people while considering their strengths and weaknesses. Besides, she’s secretly a quite sensitive and careless person, but she’s very professional when it comes to work. She also loves to tell jokes (although some of them are not funny) and take good photo of our team so that we can leave behind wonderful memories.

Brown-Stanford,2011,Team:Brown-Stanford#REGObricks#ISRU_-_-_TEXT.html," a round trip to and from Mars will take a minimum of nine hundred plus days,  Traveling that long, there is also what you have to take along for the ride 2 .

Heavyweights: Packing for an Interstellar Space Trip
Shipping the supplies for settlement plans directly from Earth to Mars is infeasible by orders of magnitudes. Conventional chemical combustion scales up in the following rough estimates: in order to launch a metric ton of material into low-earth orbit (LEO), it takes about 20 metric tons of fuel and supplies (mT) from an Earth launch pad. In order to send one metric ton of payload to Mars with a propulsion system enough to return to Earth, 180 metric tons from low-earth orbit is required, or 3600 metric tons from an earth launch pad. (As a sense of perspective, that is a seventh of the weight of the Titantic).
Now, for an actual trip, assuming a crew of six astronauts for a manned Mars landing, incredibly speedy 200-day one-way transits and a 560-day stay on the surface, 200 mT in consumables and other life sustaining equipment are needed. If all of these resources are brought along for the ride, the Initial Mass in Low Earth Orbit (IMLEO) would be about 1400 mT, or 28,000 mT from a surface launch pad 2 . (That, in case you were keeping track, is a full 1.1 times the mass of the Titantic.) As the standard shuttle launch ferries only 125 mT’s equivalent of IMLEO each run, that is roughly a dozen space shuttle launches just to assemble the necessary supplies. Keep in mind that this is just consumables. In addition, there is the problem of fuel for the launch, which often takes up 50% of the total mass .
The Mass in Consumables to Be Launched will Weigh as Much as the Titanic
Is it Worth It?
This is certainly a lot of trouble to go through to land on Mars...you might think, why bother? We’ve approached an entourage of experts in the field and asked them the same question. You can find out what they thought by clicking on the astronaut in the upper left hand corner!
Or, you can journey on, and read about how we hope to make a trip to Mars less costly, more feasible below.

The impact of one or several amino acid changes on the binding strength and specificity is less well-documented. Amino acids in direct proximity of the residues that bind to the DNA are probably crucial - but more distant amino acids could also have an influence due to allosteric effects. Some TetR mutants that have an altered recognition sequence have been characterized in the literature.
The effects of the mutations V36F, E37A, P39K and Y42F were described in Krueger et al, 2007 . Helbl et al, 1998 states other interesting mutants: the P39Q mutation was shown to exhibit a new recognition specificity for the tetO-4C operator while the E37A-Y42M-P39Q was said to have the highest affinity for TetO-4C.

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," keep going on the post, Mackenzie Cowell is proposing different things to react to the rejection. At first, the rejection seems to lead DIYists to challenge safety concerns for two reasons. At the same time, in order to endure in the field and to be well considered by society, these safety norms will have to be established. And once these norms are established, it will be a way for garage practices to be known and recognized as serious and responsible, rather than being seen as a security risk. Then, the post proposes a very local strategy to create something about its rejection: Mackenzie Cowell proposes to make a “DIYbio symposium at the same time and place as iGEM” and follows, “it would be very valuable to bring as much of the community together as possible to meet and discuss these issues and to present a collective snapshot of their work and projects to the world. There would be cross-pollination with many of the iGEM participants, and lastly, I’d like to use the symposium as a deadline by which some group or groups of people could formally present thoughts and work on our safety strategy to the community and to the rest of the world.”
As in traditional activism, the DIY movement knows that an innovative and quick reaction, even about a “bad news” can get round the problem and turn it to their own benefit.
The MIT reacteded, presumably to the pressure of DIY groups, by a surprising but small initiative. The IGEM 09 Competition will be the first to propose an “Open Division”.
On the IGEM 09 official wiki, you can find:
“For iGEM 2009 we will are opening up an experimental track for individuals or small teams that are interested in participating in iGEM in a limited capacity. These non-competition teams will have a chance to present a flash 5-minute presentation and present a poster at an exposition section of the iGEM 2009 Jamboree on October 30 - November 2, 2009. Non-competition teams will not be eligible for the standard prizes from the iGEM judging committee but might be eligible for a single award specific to non-competition teams.”
That way, MIT and the IGEM Direction are able to keep an image of openness to the participants, to DIY groups (which are mostly composed of very qualified biological engineers) and to grantors. Without making eligibility for global prizes and requiring teams to be “affiliated with a university or educational institution”, “have at least one faculty instructor” and reserving the right to give DNA on a case by case basis"

Today I tested the competent cells prepared yesterday. For that I chose a three DNA samples. One is a diluted biobrick λp-rep for testing electro-competent cells, λp-R-GFP-T which had very high DNA concentration and biobrick pSB1K3 containing mRFP which had a normal DNA concentration for the two chemically competent cells prepared by TSS and TMF(RbCl) buffers respectively.
Orr helped me in doing the transformation of chemical competent cells prepared by TSS buffer. I did the transformation of those prepared by TMF buffer and electroporation. I have kept the plates in the draw to check the results on monday.

In conclusion, the current need is a simple detection method which could be applied to grass samples to be able to check if a pasture is secure for horses to graze on. Therefore we have analysed the possibility of developing the second worm buster by studying fluorescence in grass samples. Our results were promising since the fluorescence was clearly visible in the grass!
The Global Worming Problem and Society
As you can see these little worms can cause a lot of harm. While we hope that our practical work will help solve the physical problem, all of the problems that come with these worms cannot be solved in a laboratory.
The strongyles harm the horses but the collateral damage is extensive - sentimental value, resistance against anthelmintics, the effect the drugs has on environment and the noteworthy economics are all involved [6]. These are all aspects that make the issue bigger than it appears at first glance.
Figure 7: Some members in the team with our mascot Gromit.
Raising Awareness
We have attacked the problem at several angles to raise awareness for our project. We have performed a market analysis of the problem and sent out questionnaires to better judge the severity of the problem. We’ve even been published in a local swedish magazine, explaining the problem and raising awareness locally.
Financial perspective
The equine industry includes many areas like stud farms, breeding, slaughter, trading, training and sports stables, and riding schools [18]. In Sweden the equine industry has a turnover of 450-500 million EUR and horses graze around in fields that in total correspond to 600,000 football fields [17]. There are approximately 350 000 horses is Sweden (2016) which gives Sweden a larger horse/person ratio than many other European countries [18, 19].  A large amount of money is spent on horses within and without the borders of the EU, so this is clearly a global problem.
Even though all the available data points at a high demand for our product, more data is needed to predict how an eventual new GMO product would be perceived. That is why we have worked on the market analysis and economics modelling. The result from these decides if the eventual solutions actually will be possible to implement in real life.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Project#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," importance of a high throughput assay to screen thousands of athletes simultaneously. He recommended a rapid, sensitive and cheap initial filter to reduce the total quantity of samples that will be processed by our final sequencing step. Therefore, we developed a prescreening method based on dextrin-capped gold nanoparticles (d-AuNPs), which changes color properties upon aggregation ( Baetsen-Young, et al, 2018 ).
Figure 5. Prescreening method for gene doping. A ssDNAp is added to the extracted DNA and when complementary strand are creating the secondary structure, the d-AuNPs are stabilized.
2.1 Background Information
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have unique highly specific spectral absorption properties ( Sepúlveda et al, 2009 ), large surface to volume ratios, and an ability to interact with DNA. Due to their characteristics, AuNPs have emerged as robust colorimetric assays. Baetsen-Young et al, (2018) have developed a direct colorimetric detection of DNA by d-AuNPs. They were able to visualize the presence of the unamplified pathogen Pseudoperonospora cubensis in a concentration ranging from 29 fM to 2.9 aM DNA using a single DNA probe.
Upon increasing NaCl concentration, d-AuNPs destabilize and form aggregates leading to a color change from red to purple. However, when a single stranded DNA probe (ssDNAp) hybridizes with a specific target double stranded DNA molecule (dsDNA), a secondary DNA structure is formed as shown in Figure 5. D-AuNPs can interact with this secondary structure, making them more stable and preventing them from aggregation. As a result of the d-AuNPs-dsDNA interaction, the solution with target DNA will have different refraction properties compared to non-targeted DNA and give a visual indication of target DNA presence ( Baetsen-Young et al, 2018 ). The prescreening was tested with the human EPO gene and a corresponding ssDNAp targeting exon-exon junctions of the EPO gene. We were able to verify the possibilities of d-AuNPs to screen for EPO gene doping presence.
2.2 D-AuNPs: Generating a prescreening with visible readout
Aim: Develop a cheap, sensitive, and high throughput screening method to identify possible gene-doping users.
Approach: We generated batches of dextrin-capped gold nanoparticles (d-AuNPs) and evaluated their aggregation behavior in a range of"

Abstract
Contact-dependent signaling is critical for multicellular biological                         events, yet customizing contact-dependent signal transduction between                         cells remains challenging. Here we have developed the ENABLE toolbox, a                         complete set of transmembrane binary logic gates. Each gate consists of                         3 layers: Receptor, Amplifier, and Combiner. We first optimized synthetic                         Notch receptors to enable cells to respond to different signals across the                         membrane reliably. These signals, individually amplified intracellularly by                         transcription, are further combined for computing. Our engineered zinc finger-based                         transcription factors perform binary computation and output designed products.                         In summary, we have combined spatially different signals in mammalian cells, and revealed new potentials for biological oscillators, tissue engineering,                         cancer treatments, bio-computing, etc. ENABLE is a toolbox for constructing                         contact-dependent signaling networks in mammals. The 3-layer design principle                         underlying ENABLE empowers any future development of transmembrane logic circuits,                         thus contributes a foundational advance to Synthetic Biology.

そこでこれからの予定としては、先日決めたチームごとに企画を完成させていき、7月10日までに紙面化して提出＆発表します。
また勉強会では、2年生が全員揃う曜日が少ないこと、時間がないことを考慮し、Web勉強会をすることになりました。
Web勉強会は自律して行わないとできないものです。各自本気で取り組んでください。
ブレインストーミングでは福冨さんの案を中心に行いました。
ほかのチームも福冨さんに負けず、自分たちの案を発表していきましょう。

In electrical engineering, computer science and information theory, channel capacity is the tight upper bound on the rate at which information can be reliably transmitted over a communications channel. And by the noisy-channel coding theorem, the channel capacity of a given channel is the limiting information rate (in units of information per unit time) that can be achieved with arbitrarily small error probability. And you can also see the figure below.
The channel capacity is defined as:\[C = \mathop {\sup }\limits_{{p_X}\left( x \right)} I\left( {X;Y} \right)\]
where the supremum is taken over all possible choices of ${p_X}\left( x \right)$.
After you know about all the concept above, now we are glad to tell you that you can easily follow us and find out many interesting and inspiring things in our project. Congratulations!
Protein Dimerization and Splitting Up
Dimerization is only too common in cells. Monomers assembly into dimers for further functions all the time, some interactions strong, some interactions weak. Function-less newborn peptides piece together and get to work, forming so-called tertiary structure; activated kinases reach each other and mutually phosphorylate; transcription factors, when forming homo- or hetero-dimers according to different stoichiometry, leads to varied downstream responses and distinct cellular fates…
Previous researches have underlined the important advantages of dimerization, including differential regulation, specificity, facilitated proximity and so on. Wait, this cannot be the end of the list. What is the influence of dimerization in noise propagation? The question is hardly touched due to the difficulty in controlling experiment variables. Synthetic biology provides powerful tools to carry out experiments otherwise impossible in designed systems.
For synthetic biologists, it is crucial and challenging to construct AND gate. Split up a regulatory protein such as transcription factor, express two halves independently, and an AND gate is born.
Nonetheless, the act of splitting up can bring about unexpected side effects. Gene regulatory circuits are highly dependent on quantitative properties, its complexity and nonlinearity contributing to hard-to-predict behaviors of biological systems. Once an important part in the system is chopped up, who knows what will happen next?
These are the thrilling challenges and opportunities we face in our program. We split up florescent protein and tune the affinity between them by adding intein sequence. When the two parts bind together, graceful blue light is emitted from EBFP2. These constructs mimic the effect of dimerization in living cells, and are under fine control because they can be induced by the drug Do"

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food.

The measurement results are shown below.
1.5 mMGlutamate / 600 nm OD / 3h 100 mM IPTG
When the given data checked, it is obvious that the produced GadE is functional and makes E. coli survive in the acidic microenvironment in comparison to negative control results. Based on the data given, the E. coli with overexpressed GadE can survive in pH 2 gastric juice for 5-9 hours.
Acid Repellency
The main objective of this part of our project is to direct resistant E. Coli into the internal mucus layer where Helicobacter Pylori are abundant for a length of time. We will direct our E. Coli using the hydrogen ion difference between the stomach fluid and mucus layer. The PH of gastric juice is 2.0 whereas the pH of gastric mucus layer is 7.0. The chemoreceptor tlpb naturally found in the inner membrane of helicobacter pylori enable these bacteria to move away from acidic condition to a more neutral and basic environment. Therefore, we decided to use the TIpB protein and designed a biobrick for our E. Coli in order to ensure that our Bacteria reach the region where the helicobacter pylori are.
Background
Chemotaxis, movement toward or away from chemicals, is a universal attribute of motile cells and organisms.  E. coli cells swim toward amino acids (serine and aspartic acid), sugars (maltose, ribose, galactose, glucose), dipeptides, pyrimidines and electron acceptors (oxygen, nitrate, fumarate).
E. coli's optimal foraging strategy
In isotropic chemical environments, E. coli swims in a random walk pattern produced by alternating episodes of counter-clockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) flagellar rotation (Fig. 3, left panel).  In an attractant or repellent gradient, the cells monitor chemoeffector concentration changes as they move about and use that information to modulate the probability of the next tumbling event (Fig. 3, right panel.  These locomotor responses extend runs that take the cells in favorable directions (toward attractants and away from repellents), resulting in net movement toward preferred environments.  Brownian motion and spontaneous tumbling episodes frequently knock the cells off course, so they must constantly assess their direction of travel with respect to the chemical gradient.

We were able to get the multiple strains from Vivek Jain and John Mekalanos at the Harvard Medical School.
1 pRG1 DH5alpha cells containing the S,R,Rz lysis cassette under a Plac promoter. Ampicillin Resistance.
2 pDKL02 S17-1 cells with the lysis cassette under an IPTG promoter (also containing the mob element). Kanamycin Resistant.

Birth and death happen randomly, but we know how often they happen in average. We will describe in the next section the algorithm we used to model this.
As for diffusion of bacteria, a model relying on a binomial distribution was implemented: among n cells, we pick a random number of them to move; this random number being ruled by a probability p proportional to the gradient of concentration of bacteria. Discretising time and space, one can draw at every step time a random binomial number:
where f and f2 are described in the next section.
Algorithm and simulations
In this paragraph, we use several constants suggested in the paper of Hasty et al. (see references), or sometimes some approximations. We shall mention these numerical values along this paragraph.
We use a discrete lattice to make the computations, considering that the cavity of the microfluidic device can be divided in several slices of constant width dx. It has been further assumed (for simplicity of computations essentially) that diffusion only takes place along the x axis (see figure 1 above). The discrete step time wil be denoted dt. Thus our equations will depend on a one-dimensional space parameter and on time.
Solving the diffusion equation using an implicit scheme
One can simply solve numerically a partial differential equation by discrete differentiation. The simplest way gives directly the solution at time step n+1 thanks to what we know at time n. However, this discrete explicit scheme gives a stable solution only if kdiff.dt/dx2 is less than 1. Therefore, we considered the Crank-Nicholson discretisation scheme. Unconditional to kdiff, dt and dx, this scheme produces stable computations.
However, it appears to be more complicated to solve since u(x,t+dt) cannot be obtained explicitly knowing the solution u at time t. Fortunately it can be expressed as a tridiagonal system of equations that we solved numerically.
Stochastic Gillespie algorithm
The basic idea lying here is to compute random times for a population rather than computing them for each individual (which is much more computer intensive). Those random times appear in the recombinations and the birth-death calculus; Gillespie's idea, which we are about to describe, allows to compute the time of the next recombination (resp. birth or death) within the population instead of making the calculus and storing the result for each cell in the device.
Under the assumption that cells' recombination times are independent from one bacteria to the other, and that these times follow an exponential law of parameter λ, Gillespie tells us that the next recombination time (resp. birth or"
Paris_Bettencourt,2014,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Newsletter3_-_-_TEXT.html," Niger is one species of filamentous fungi which have been widely employed in the fermentati on industry, and become a principal source of enzymes and metab olites. With features such as low cost and high productivity and Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) status in the food and food processing industry, Aspergillus Niger has achieved increased attenti on as host for the producti on of heterologous proteins, such as amylase, acid protease, cellulase , pectinase and gluc ose oxidase, etc .
In this study, we aim to establish one visual operation system of continuous target gene replacement using Aspergillus Niger. Firstly, a construct contains amilCP gene, which produces blue chromoproteins, and cjBlue, which produces green chromoproteins, fused selective marker gene HPH was made and transformed into the high expression site through homologous recombination in the Aspergillus Niger genome. In this construct, amilCP gene was driven by GlaA5 promoter, and followed by GlaA3 terminator; the HPH and cjBlue fusion gene was driven by pgpdA promoter, and followed by GlaA3 terminator. GlaA5 and GlaA3 can be used as homologous arm sequences that can mediate specific recombination. The selected HPH resistant Aspergillus Niger cell will highly express amilCP and cjBlue protein which can be detected by blue color and cjBlue signal. After several generations, homologous recombination will happen between the two GlaA3 sequences, and lead to the loss of HPH and cjBlue, then get the transgenic Aspergillus Niger cells only express amilCP gene which can be easily detected by blue color. These transgenic Aspergillus Niger cells with blue color can be used as original strain for target gene transformation. Those colonies without blue color will be the real transformants in which amilCP gene is replaced with the target gene. In a word, the visual gene operation system in Aspergillus Niger will be established with which the homologous recombination of target genes will be easily traced by detecting the color of colonies.
So far we have finished the expression vectors construction. The genetic transformation work is in the process.

NOTEBOOK
Overview
Our  project lays emphasis on a vital aspect of energy utilization, thus it is  crucial that we have thought carefully and creatively about the impact of our  work and acquired the guidance of the design and experimental methods in our  project from the interaction with stakeholders and experts.
Firstly, we designed special brochures  to enlarge our team.
The next section, Background, is  about the development of nitrogenous fertilizer production in China as well as  the fact that free nitrogen, though substantial in the air, needs to overcome  considerable obstacle to react with other substances at normal temperature.  These have motivated us to further explore the actual effect of fertilizer.
By meeting with  stakeholders and experts, we were able to initiate the original idea of utilizing  solar energy to fix nitrogen, modify the experimental methods and reform our  design of device to be more relevant and responsible. The section of Integrated  Human Practices alsodemonstrateshow our project advanced as  the interactions with stakeholders and experts went on over time.
Brochure
Initially, to spread iGEM and get  more students on board with us, we printed and sent out brochures designed by  our team, which ultimately attracted students from different majors, equipping  our team with various talents.
You can click here to  download the PDF file of our brochure.
Background
Nitrogenous  fertilizer production has been playing a pivotal role since the 20th  century. Yet, the fact is that the average soil nitrogenous fertilizer storage  all around the world is rather small. What’s more, the accumulation of nitrogen  in the soil is a tough process, and modern intensive agriculture leads to the  excessive loss of organic matter and nitrogen in the soil. Under most conditions,  the production of nitrogen in yield per unit is higher than that of phosphorus  and potassium nutrients.
In  the past decades, the industry of nitrogenous fertilizer in China has made  remarkable achievements through unremitting efforts, with capacity for  indigenous innovation constantly increasing. By 2017, China has become the largest  producer and consumer of nitrogenous"
Goettingen,2016,Team:Goettingen#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," Gymnasium in Hann. Münden to introduce the students (age 16-18) into synthetic biology as well as the iGEM competition and our project.
We think that it is very important for the students to get an idea about the countless opportunities biology offers and the impact of all fields of biology on our daily life. When finishing school and thinking about academic studies, we know from our own experience that we weren’t too comfortable with synthetic biology and what it meant at this point of our lives. But this is what we are doing now and to give those young people an insight in this endless field of research we visited them and gave our best to show them the high potential.
After introducing them into the everyday life of a student, we went over to explaining what synthetic biology is and which impact it already has on our life. Especially at this point we realized that is was worth to come as most of the students were fascinated about the importance of research in this area. Finally, we could tell them about the iGEM competition and the way how students from all over the world work in their teams to make the world a bit better. We limited ourselves to state our project in a quite simple and understandable way, to not scare them but make them interested.
All in all we really enjoyed the day with the students and hope that all of them will go their own way no matter if they go into science or somewhere else.
Master Interview Day (24th June 2016)
At the interview day of our master program Microbiology and Biochemistry, the new applicants visit the involved institutes to have an interview with the professors as part of the selection procedure.
They also get insight into different departments and get to know the location and the laboratories. During this event,  we presented our poster to the future Master students from our program. Moreover, we answered any questions the future students came up with. The interest was huge. Besides presenting them our project, we mainly intended to get them interested in the iGEM competition to make sure that Göttingen can provide an iGEM Team in 2017.
The poster can be downloaded here in full size.
Newspaper
We made contact to the the local newspaper here in Göttingen, and they indeed wrote an article about us. Nowadays, newspapers must of course be online supported for a great outreach. We were really happy that this newspaper article was also our most succesful post on facebook this year, with over 2,500 people reached.

Validating our BioBricks
Journal reference:
Question:Validation of AmpE in E. coli?
Experiment:
The plasmid pTH254 harbours AmpE resistant gene. E.coli strain NEB10, DH5-alpha, DH5-beta is transformed with plasmid pHT254 using heat-shock transformation method, thereby plated on LB plate containing 100µg/mL ampicillin and incubated at 37 C. E. coli transformation with water was plated on 100 µg/mL ampicillin was used as a negative control.
Results: Colonies were formed when pHT254 transformed E. coli was plated on LB plate 100µg/mL ampicillin but no growth was detected on LB plate with 100µg/mL ampicillin when E. coli transformed with water only. This strongly indicates that E.coli needs AmpE gene in order to survive on ampicillin containing plates. Thereby, validating the newly added BioBrick BBa_K1975008 .
Figure 34: no colonies are formed on the plate with ampicillin if not they are transformed with the vector containing the AmpE gene. This means that the cells need this gene to survive on ampicillin.
Journal reference: Future experiment
Question: Is our composite biobrick able to produce plastic?
Experiment: For instance scaling up the growth assays, and, very importantly, having S. elongatus and B. subtilis grow next to each other seperated by a membrane.
Result:
Testing Synechococcus elongatus and Bacillus subtilis at simulated extraterrestrial environments

From 2013.igem.org
SynArt
100 years ago our ancestors invented laboratories to ease the observation of creation; to enhance our knowledge and develop for the better so a new renascence began. Today, SynArt may introduce a second renascence where science will work together as one wit art. ATOMS Turkiye believe that laboratories may be unsatisfactory to fathom creation itself. For this reason, SynArt will allow us to perceive synthetic biology from an artist’s standpoint. In order to take the first step, we contacted the other European iGEM teams and invited them to send their valuable artworks for the 2-day SynArt exhibition that was held in our university. We asked what the viewers’ interpretations were and their choice of favourite.

Validated PETase enzymatic activity through pNPB substrate assay
Characterized growth of three bacteria species in TPA minimal media
Optimized PH for growth and PETase activity
Demonstrated TPA signal can be detected by voltage increase in microbial fuel cell
Asking the questions
After constructing our system, we needed to prove that it functions the way we designed it to. To test Plastiback, we asked the following questions:
1. Can we visualize the PETase-sfGFP fused protein?
2. Is our inducible system working?
3. Are our proteins present?
4. Is PETase catalytically active?
5. Is our microbial fuel cell bacteria using terephthalic acid as its primary carbon source?
6. Can we detect terephthalic acid via a voltage increase?
The following is a description of our answer to these questions through experimental results.
Testing sfGFP expression and promoter control
Visualizing the PETase-sfGFP protein will be an important checkpoint for ocean plastic researchers that are evaluating whether a Plastiback device is working or not. By simply shining a UV light on the cell culture, an ocean plastic researcher without synthetic biology experience can determine whether Plastiback is working or not based simply on fluorescence. If  PETase-sfGFP proteins are being expressed, Plastiback will fluoresce. Otherwise, the problem can be diagnosed. It is also important that our inducible promoter is truly controlling protein expression and uninduced samples do not produce much PETase. In the visualization experiment, we can also test whether our inducible system is working because we would expect uninduced cells not to fluoresce, or at least fluoresce at a low basal level.
Following the method stated under sfGFP visualization, we grew up T7 lysY Iq cells containing our plasmids. We then induced the cells with 0"

Discovery Day
Discovery Day is a day-long enrichment opportunity hosted by Hamilton Health Sciences and the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame for high school students. We had the opportunity to host two different workshops, each sixty minutes in length for 16 enthusiastic high school students. Our goal was to help these young students learn about the many aspects of science, potential careers in health science and help them develop fundamental lab skills while ensuring that they have fun!  Together, the Wet lab and Community Outreach Team led two unique workshops,  Gel Electrophoresis and Analysis & Bacterial Gram Staining, respectively. Each workshop emphasized the skills needed to master the techniques as well as  possible applications (i.e., when would these techniques be needed and how can they be used as a tool to solve real world challenges).
Workshop Description
Workshop #1: DNA Gel Electrophoresis and Analysis
In this workshop students will have hands-on experience loading and running DNA through a gel via electrophoresis, an important scientific technique. This was followed by a short investigation of the meaning of DNA digestion, as well as an opportunity for students to observe the effects through the gel.
The workshop consisted of these general parts:
Lab safety
Pipette training
Scientific Background
Running the gel
Gel analysis
Workshop #2: Bacterial Gram Staining
In this workshop, students had hands-on experience in staining bacteria and distinguishing between different types of bacteria (Gram positive versus Gram negative) with the use of dyes. They were also able to explore and learn more about the mechanism behind the staining effect, what different stain results can say about the types of bacteria detected, and the importance of Gram staining in the fields of synthetic biology, health science and research applications.
The workshop consisted of these general parts:
Lab safety
Gram staining protocol
Scientific Background & Biochemical Explanation
Gram stain results analysis
Applications to the world
Impact
In total, we presented our workshops to 73 people (8 teachers and 65 students) from secondary schools all across Ontario. We connected with both students and teachers, both of whom emphasized the need for more hands on learning in order to help students learn about the applications of concepts"
BioIQS-Barcelona,2018,Team:BioIQS-Barcelona#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," are not alone
While creating our wiki editing tutorial (enllaçar amb link), we met other teams which were also contributing to wiki development in a different way:
The iGEM Marburg 2018 team created a guideline on how to design an accessible wiki to people with disabilities. You can check it here . We implemented their suggestions in this wiki and realized that it was so easy and so convenient that all teams should do it. For this reason, we encourage the rest of the teams to follow this guideline. We also recommended so in our wiki editing tutorial. So they have helped us designing an accessible wiki and we have helped them by divulgating the guideline in our wiki editing tutorial. Thank you very much iGEM Marburg 2018!
The iGEM Virginia 2018 team created a Wiki Build Tool which makes much easier to synchronize the content between the iGEM server and the files that are being edited locally. We have used their Wiki Build Tool to transfer and upload our wiki from the local version to the online version in the iGEM server. It is quite easy to use even for inexperienced team members in web development and incredibly simplifies the process of uploading the wiki manually. We also featured this tool in our wiki editing tutorials to get other teams to know it. Thank you very much iGEM Virginia 2018!
We are glat to see how many teams have worked in different aspects of the wiki to facilitate and improve this derivable of the iGEM projects, which might be one of the most important. This collective effort is a sort of collaboration, in which various teams work independently but in the same direction to solve the same problem.
Spanish MeetUp
The Spanish Meet Up organized by the UPF-CRG Barcelona iGEM team took place between over the last week of August. During this days, teams engaged in very diverse activities like project presentations, beach volley, listening to synthetic biology professionals’ lectures and a city tour. Five teams were present in the Spanish Meet Up: UPF-CRG Barcelona (the organizers, working on engineering an E. coli strain to increase palmitic acid uptake), OLM-Madrid , Navarra , Grenoble and us.
Maybe the most fruitful part of the meeting was the project presentations of each team. Our team did a very detailed and sincere presentation of our iGEM project. This way, other teams get to know what things we had already done successfully and what were our challenges. Presenting all the information about the project and identifying the strengths and the weaknesses of it help establishing collabortions between teams and receiving feedback and"

Introduction the class of Bioart
Overview
People all over the world today tend to lose interest in science, so we think that this tendency disturb progress of synthetic biology. For example, ordinary people seem to think recombinant DNA technologies, which are the basis of synthetic biology as unpleasant. In this way, they do not fully understand what recombinant DNA technologies are, and they still hesitate to buy and eat GM foods. These problems seem to be faced in the world when recombinant DNA technologies will be developed and used in many fields. We want a lot of people to know not only in Japan but also in the world, so we try these things as Human Practice.
At the campus visit (2013/08/9,10)
We prepared a booth to introduce iGEM in KIT Campus visit and explained our activity of iGEM to a visitor.
To make the presentation simple, we tried to avoid using technical terms.
Besides, we displayed model organisms used in genetics, such as fruit-fly Drosophila melamogaster, and colon bacterium Eschericia coli. Students could see Drosophila mutants. And we displayed ""E.Coli Pen"" and some pictures drawn with it.
We aimed to make their understanding clear, and make them feel familiar to genetic engineering.
There were about 100 students and their parents who came to our booth. They told us that their ideas and conceptions about biology were broadened by looking closely at the model organisms.
Survey
“What project do we do in ? iGEM 2013?” It is the first difficulty for us to decide it. In order to get a clue, we have researched about public awareness on genetic technology and gene modified foods, as a human practice project.

As we also have:
I_{0} = \frac{{P_{0}}^{2}}{2c\rho}
Let t=\frac{R_{r}}{{(R_{v} + R_{r})}^{2}}
I = \frac{tU^{2}}{\pi R^{2}}
According to the calibration:
U=23V, I=1.9*10^4W/m^2
We have:
t = \frac{\pi R^{2}I}{U^{2}} = \frac{\pi \times {(4.25 \times 10^{- 3})}^{2} \times 1.9 \times 10^{4}}{23^{2}} = 2.038 \times 10^{- 3}\text{\ Ω}^{- 1}
Here we assume the sound pressure 3mm far from the transducer interface is the same as that on the surface, which makes scene based on ANSYS simulation. [2]
So,

Outreach
This year, we notably focused on handling policy & practices with a unique approach. However, conveying the features and benefits of synthetic biology as well as aquanting the people on iGEM is also a paramount responsibility of an iGEMmer; hence we accomplished additional work for outreach purposes.
Primarily, we represented ourselves to the freshmen of our university to eblighten them about what synthetic biology is and what kind of work and challenges we face during our iGEM experience. We also introduce iGEM as the growing community of this field with its extensive registry of standard parts that increase in number each year. We mentioned about the history of our previous iGEM teams and what experiences they brought in so far. Eventually, we talked about our project “Change of Heart”.
During our visit in Turkish Heart Society (TKV), iGEM is cited as the locomotive of synthetic biology industry considering its nature of encouraging young scientists to carry out their own work, which can be very useful to conduct promising projects especially in medical field. The Chairman of TKV, Prof. Dr. Lale Tokgozoglu, was pleased to hear about this field and the effort carried out so far. We also introduced our project and discussed the features, its possible impact on the field. We received very positive responses and praised to hear the beneficial aspect of our project.
We also presented SynBio and our project to the Head of Department of Cardiology in our university hospital, Dr. Beyhan Eryonucu, and the cardiologist Dr. Bora Demircelik to discuss and criticize our plan and approach. We evaluated how we can achieve a better treatment method in the future in parallel with our proposal. Feedback was positive and helped us to retrace the design on P&P approach especially.
We performed a workshop about synthetic biology called “SynBio 4 All”"

Bologna,2008,Team:Bologna#Biosafety_-_-_TEXT.html," allow the insulation -into the cellular culture- of the cells that completed the transformation process. This function is carried out by the action of some sequences contained in the vector with the gene of interest: the selection markers. Through genetic engineering techniques, vectors are filled with a gene -anticipated by a strong promoter that encourage its transcription- that resists to a particular antibiotic. The same antibiotic is inserted in the medium: if the vector has entered the cell it will confer to the bacteria resistance against the antibiotic. All the non-transformed cells will be killed.
A potential contamination of the environment producted by bacterial dispersion would not involve any biohazard. This is because there are no favorable conditions for the proliferation of transformed cells. Therefore the biosafety level maintains the unitary value.

iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.

Aim: phosphorylation of single stranded oligos with subsequent annealing for cloning into pMa12
For ligation to occur at least one of the DNA ends (insert or vector) should contain a 5' phosphate. Primers are usually supplied non-phosphorylated; therefore, the oligos or PCR product will not contain a 5' phosphate. The digestion of DNA with a restriction enzyme will always produce a 5´ phosphate. A DNA fragment can be phosphorylated by incubation with T4 Polynucleotide Kinase in T4-ligase-buffer which already contains the necessary ATP in an appropriate amount (1 mM):

Yuyan Zhang Grade 2008
Hi, I’m Yuyan Zhang, a senior student in College of Marine Life Science. My major is Biology. After participating research programs in molecular biology and developmental biology, I found myself interested into exploring the mystery of life codes. Now I am studying as a transfer student in University of Minnesota, Duluth, majoring in Cellular and Molecular Biology, with a minor in Economics. I believe that the new discoveries in life science can not only affect the academia, but can also bring benefits to much more aspects, like social recognition, economic development and health care of the whole human beings. That is the goal of all the iGEM members.
Yong Peng  Grade 2010
I am Peng Yong and major in ecology coming from School of marine life science of OUC. I am “unique” because I am the youngest iGEMer in our team. Though I haven’t received enough knowledge and experimental training, my computer skills makes sense in the competition. I am in born an adherent for idealism; I love challenges, not a afraid of the indefinites. I feel so lucky to join in this dream-seeking journey. We are the first group in Shandong Province to participate in the game, courage and vigor will never dry up, we will always"

CrtYB Enzyme in the pathway required for B-Carotene Synthesis. This enzyme is a fusion, it is the full Phytoene Synthase enzyme spliced with a Lycopene B-Cyclase enzymatic domain. This sequence was taken from a WT strain of xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous. It catalyzes both the conversion of Geranylgeranyl diphosphate to Phytoene and Lycopene to B-Carotene.

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Project#FRET Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html," ) and is located on the same plasmid backbone pSB3K3. Therefore, it is expected that when all fusion proteins are successfully cut by the TEV protease, the fluorescence level of the double plasmid constructs reaches the same level as the positive control of I20260. As a negative control B0015 was used, a coding sequence of a terminator which should not show any sign of fluorescence.
To characterize our REACh1/2 constructs in combination with the TEV protease a growth experiment was conducted. Both of the double plasmid constructs, a constitutive expression of GFP (I20260) as positive control and B0015 as negative control were compared. For each expression IPTG-induced and non-induced cultures were grown in parallel. All measurements were done in a biological triplicate.
To better evaluate the fluorescence, the observed Optical desity (OD) was taken into account in order to achieve a fluorescence measurement independent of the amount of cells present. This way, the measurement represents the amount of fluorescence per cell only.
Comparison of K1319013 + K1319008, K1319014 + K1319008, I20260 (positive control) and B0015 (negative control)
Both double plasmid construct exhibit a clear fluorescence signal when induced.
The negative control B0015 did not exhibit any significant fluorescence. The positive control I20260 showed a steady level of fluorescence as expected due to the constitutive expression of GFP. As expected, the production is also independent of addition of IPTG therefore the triplicates have been merged together.
Both double plasmid constructs K1319013 + K1319008 and K1319014 + K1319008 did not exhibit a strong fluorescence before induction with IPTG. In the non-induced state, the fluorescence stays low and does not increase over time. It is significantly weaker than the fluorescence reached by the induced constructs or the positive control but was higher than the negative control. The higher base level of fluorescence in the not induced constructs is due to the imperfect quenching and the leakiness of the IPTG inducible promoter.
The induced double plasmid constructs exhibited a fast rise in fluorescence after induction. The signal strenght increased  ~ 10-fold over the non-induced constructs. K1319014 + K1319008 reached the the same level of fluorescence as I20260, indicating a complete cleavage of the fusion proteins by the TEV protease. K1319013 + K1319008 did not reach a level of fluorescence as high as K1319013 + K131"
