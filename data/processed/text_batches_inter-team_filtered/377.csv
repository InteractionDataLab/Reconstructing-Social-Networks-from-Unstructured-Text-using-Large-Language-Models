Sketching out ideas.
Thursday, 6/6: Heather and I met up with Orit to discuss our progress thus far with the “art project.” After explaining our three main ideas, Orit suggested that we also focus on concepts, and not just content. In other words, the ideas that we want to communicate, such as modularity, abstraction, protocol, safety issues, even the fact that things can go wrong! We got a lot of feedback on extending Synflo, such as looking into a device that can create scents (for the banana lab!), and got great new groundwork done as well on replicating the glowing trees experiment (creating a projection, something that will be very aesthetically pleasing). For now, we have a lot of new ideas to work with, and will be following those through!
Friday, 6/7: Today, Heather and I continued our discussion of possible ideas to implement. Only today, we focused more on sketches and drawing out our ideas onto paper. We made good progress, and it was really great that Casey was there to mentor us as well. We added another possible idea to our arsenal – a time capsule like program where people can code a message in bacteria! And with Casey’s help, we also got a new perspective on the game design we are thinking about implementing (a tribute to Conway’s game of life). In addition, we also drew out a really great sketch of how we envision our glowing tree idea to look.
Week 3: June 10 - June 14
Monday, 6/10: Today, Heather and I met up with Orit and discussed all the ideas we had generated over the past several work days. During that time, we focused a lot on width and coming up with as many possible ideas as we could. Then, after our talk with Orit, she mentioned that we had a very good arsenal, and that it was time to pick three and start focusing on depth rather than width. Heather and I chose to explore the glowing tree idea, the time capsule idea, and the game idea.
The final storyboards for Friday's presentation.
Tuesday, 6/11: Heather and I started working on depth yesterday afternoon after our meeting with Orit, and continued doing so this morning. Then, later in the day, we had another check-in with our advisor. For the glowing tree idea and the time capsule idea, we looked more into the actual"

Overview
We want sport competitions to be fair and athletes to be protected against gene doping, the misuse of gene therapy in sports. People caught up in the rat race of doping development underestimate the implications of gene doping, that can stretch beyond sports into public health and social inequality. To get an overview of the design requirements for gene doping detection, we organized a discussion with experts, athletes and coaches at the University of Stirling. We implemented athletes’ wishes regarding invasivity, privacy and testing frequency into our detection method. Further interaction with stakeholders such as the Dutch Doping Authority and Oxford Nanopore Technologies made us add a prescreen and a barcoding tool to our detection method for versatile, high throughput and reliable detection. As a final challenge, we invited engineers to hack our detection method, and used their collective strength to improve our algorithm and anticipate future gene doping developments.

Both the single and double digests for J37015, however, produced only one band – all running just above the 2000bp marker.  SpeI was used in both the single and double digest and according to the sequence data cuts once in the plasmid containing the J37015 part (pSB1A2).  HindIII was the second restriction enzyme used in the double digests and should cut once in the J37015 part.  We concluded from this information that the J37015 part is not in the plasmid – and the resulting single band corresponds to the linearised pSB1A2 plasmid! The digests for pSB1A3 and I731014 were rather confusing.  We don’t know what went wrong here, especially as we had shown previously in the AHL test that the I731014 part appears to be functioning.
This week we also started on the road to making our first biobricks.  The CpxR promoter was cloned out of the TR235 and MG1655 genomes, and was verified on a gel after restriction digest.  The results of the digest of pSB1A3, however, did not make sense again, and doesn’t appear to correspond to what it is meant to be.  We have now decided to obtain this plasmid by using the T9002 biobrick, cutting out the T9002 part, and inserting our CpxR promoter.
The second biobrick we want to make is luxI and GFP under the control of our CpxR promoter. Originally the LuxI and GFP portion were to be obtained from the J37015 biobrick, but since this doesn’t appear to be in the plasmid, we have started on building it ourselves using the separate LuxI (I15030) and GFP (E0840) parts.  Transformations of electro-competent DH5α with the I15030 part were carried out.

Application Scenario
This application scenario was developed by the iGEM team Purdue 2016 in collaboration with Synenergene. In this scenario we  aim to show how the results of our project could be applied in both domestic and industrial contexts in the developed and developing world. Additionally, we seek to thoroughly outline the potential consequences of these applications in current political, ethical, and technological contexts.
The Problem
In concert with an assortment of other nutrients, water phosphates in excess of 25 micrograms per liter are known to drive the growth of harmful algal blooms (HABs) during periods of warmer temperatures ( ≥25°C). These blooms compromise water quality by choking oxygen from aquatic ecosystems and leaching neurotoxins and hepatotoxins such as microcystin and nodularin into sources of potable water. In so doing HABs cost global industry more than ten billion USD in damage and threaten both chronic and acute harms to human health every year.
This propensity for consequence was no more evident than in the Summer of 2014 when over 500,000 residents along the southern coast of Lake Erie were left without water for over 48 hours. Though this incident may seem isolated, with continued global agricultural development and a predicted 1.5-4°C increase in temperature over the next century, the likelihood and intensity of HABs will only increase in the coming decades.
As such, there is a serious need for not only efforts to address the issues surroundings HABs but with those concerning phosphorus misuse. Currently there are no federal restrictions in the US on water phosphate pollution and similar laissez-faire approaches prevail in many African and Asian-Pacific nations. Though estimates vary, like oil, phosphorus is a nonrenewable resource and, like oil, phosphorus production and supply will at some time in"

Function B: MRI Contrast Agent
This is a detailed description of an individual function of our circuit. To access other functions and get an overview of the whole circuit, visit the Circuit page.
Introduction
Since the beginnings of modern medicine, doctors have been eager to see what's happening on the inside of the body rather than to just treat blindly.
Therefore, it comes as no surprise that one of the characteristics that the ideal bacterial cancer therapeutic should posses is external detectability. The ability to see from the outside what's happening on the inside would allow the doctor to get critical information about the state of the tumor, the success of localization and the efficacy of treatment. [1]

The Imaging Modality
To achieve this in CATE, the first step was to choose the imaging modality. Several methods have already been used to visualize contrast-producing bacteria, such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Bioluminescence Imaging (BLI), Fluorescence Imaging, Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). [2] [3] [4] To pick one, we carefully evaluated advantages and disadvantages of these different techniques (Table 1).
Our final decision: MRI. We chose MRI because it is a well-established imaging method in humans, readily available in the clinics. It offers good spatial resolution and does not use ionizing radiation, which means it is in no way harmful. Finally, focused ultrasound, an integral part of our Heat Sensor , uses exclusively MRI image guidance. Therefore, for both theoretical and practical reasons, we decided to incorporate an MRI reporter gene into CATE.

Efficiency
     We used this method to construct our BBa_K1926011, BBa_K1926012, BBa_K1926013,BBa_K1926002 and BBa_K1926003. We successfully obtained the right plasmid after the first round of molecular clone.
     We also tried the method on BBa_K1926021 and BBa_K1926022 (the size of which twice as big as the former), but other than one head-to-feet product, we didn’t obtain the right plasmids.
     Therefore we suggest that this method is mainly suitable for parts smaller than 1kb, as the longer the parts, the bigger possibility for it to self-cyclize, which wastes the ligation substrates.

August
Week 14 (31st of July - 6th of August)
Biobrick Assembly still does not work.. Sequencing shows weird inserts. Golden Gate Assembly of pSB1C3-araC-pBAD-eYFPc-cZIP in two steps gave a lot of transformants. Experimented with CpxR-eYFP BiFC based on 2014 eFPL and Marta’s growth protocols; unsuccessfull so far…
Week 15 (7th of August - 13th of August)
Finally got 1C3-araC-pBAD-eYFPc-cZIP and repeated growth experiment (10x dilution) with some moderate success. Optimal KCl induction resembles 2014 EFPL, but no real growth is seen (yet). Went to Munich to see what's up.
Week 16 (14th of August - 21st of August)
Back from Munich, saw what was up. Returned to Winterswijk, beautiful as ever. Back in the Lab, cotransformed CpxAeYFPn and CpxReYFPc for Exp1 and repeated CpxR dimerization, but someone stopped the experiment, which is not really nice. Saw that Leucine Zippers slightly increase affinity of eYFP termini.
Week 17 (22nd of August - 28th of August)
BioBrick might be  solved by increasing ligation times extensively, but designed primers to circumvent this anyway. Repeated 2014 EFPL teams result. Got confirmation we can attend the Jamboree in Boston after the Go/No-go presentation.

To remove contaminating reads from previous sequencing runs, a quantile of 0.7 of the most deviating reads was removed previous to plotting with the help of iCG model.
Afterwards, iCG model was used to create linear discriminant models based on the filtered groups of template reads gathered by iCG filter. Different setting for the amount of removed, deviating reads were tested. Figure 5 shows plots of the Region of interest for both the forward and the reverse strand and all five template groups, with a quantile of 0.7 removed reads. For both strand orientations, there is a distinct difference in the mean, normalized signal trace detectable comparing the sequences containing an unnatural base with those containing a natural base at the position of interest.
Looking at the plot of the sample containing isoCm, the signal seems to be much noisier than any other sample analyzed. Based on the quality control after synthesis by UPLC and MS and our orthogonal analysis with the M.A.X. system, it is highly unlikely that this result is based on impurities of the oligos prior to sample preparation. Keeping in mind that the displayed data is the product of several steps of data processing, including event generation during sequencing, basecalling, alignment to the reference sequence and normalization, one possible explanation for this result are errors in this data processing pipeline as a consequence of a strong signal deviations to the expected signals of natural bases. For example, if the basecaller misinterprets the signal in the sequence context of isoCm, the error is likely to propagate and cause problems during sequence alignment and time-dependent normalization. Alternatively but less likely, the signal noise could be caused by influences of the sample preparation on isoCm. It has been shown that deoxy-isocytidine and deoxy-isocytidine triphosphate show a tendency for deamination, resulting in their respective uridine analogues (Switzer et al., 1993). Considering the alkaline reaction conditions of the exonuclease reactions performed during sample preparation, the isoCm bases in the analyzed sample could be partly deaminated to methylated uracil, potentially influencing the signal in Nanopore sequencing.

Project overview
Introduction
Our aim is to resolve collapse colony disorder, which has been characterized in recent years. However, it is a quite up-to-date disease, researchers have found some suspicious candidates resulting CCD. Our project focuses on one of main pathogens, Nosema ceranae. As the previous group stated, we used theoretically plausible sensor to sense Nosema ceranae, molecules to prevent Nosema ceranae from invading, and even molecules to kill Nosema ceranae. In case of uselessness of previous circuit on Nosema ceranae, we have to come up with another way to hold back the spreading of Nosema ceranae. This is what we concentrate on.
Background
Ethanol is known as a kind of toxins to bees. Up to certain degree, it has potential harm to the nervous system of bees. Besides, it could have influence"

With the emerging Entrepreneurship track and applications getting closer to industrial realization, the legal status becomes more and more important. Also it would raise awareness to the topic of the legal status of parts, leading to a debate which could further promote the idea of open source. At the same time we hope that examination of most parts will show that they are indeed free of restrictive legal protections.

NTHU_Formosa,2018,Team:NTHU Formosa#Public Engagement-test_-_-_TEXT.html,", paying our maximum effort to promote synthetic biology, iGEM and the project of our team, we introduce the fun and potential in biology to high school students and hope to bring new enthusiastic blood into the biology field in Taiwan, where bio-industry is less popular than semiconductor industry.
It was quite disappointed at first when very few students showed their interest in biology. However, as we vigorously presenting our project with passion, the fact that biologists can create plenty of fun experiments in labs attracted groups of people to gather around. Our audiences on this day were not limited to students but parents and any relatives that came along, all of whom contributed to a survey we collected. With rising interest and curiosity in synthetic biology and iGEM, many questions were raised (the most frequently asked questions are listed below) and, as a result, we successfully promoted iGEM, synthetic biology and gave publicity of BioWatcher and idea. While we collected public views toward BioWatcher, we hope, in this way, to raise awareness of both public and individual health condition and appeal to them the importance of early diagnosis and early treatment.
1.    What’s the significance of our project?
**Soluble ligand-receptor interaction The existing known ligand-receptor interactions, such as notch signaling pathway, is only applicable on insoluble ligands. With our design on reporter cell, the receptors can detect both soluble and insoluble ligands.
**Wide application Before this system can be used in human, it can be applied widely in lab experiment animal models, such as zebrafish. The autonomous report system will be a convenient tool for scientists in qualitative measurements.
**Customized detector The detection module on the reporter cell is nanobody, functional antibody variable domain fragment. The programmable nanobodies on the reporter cells can be customized into detecting specific ligands. The range of application of this autonomous reporting system is simultaneously growing with the expansion of nanobody library. Reference: Pieter Deschaght, Ana Paula Vintém, Marc Logghe,Miguel Conde et al. Large Diversity of Functional Nanobodies from a Camelid Immune Library Revealed by an Alternative Analysis of Next-Generation Sequencing Data(2017)
**Non-invasiveness To increase convenience in blood test for all users, we establish a non-invasive biofactor measurement system with the help of autonomous reporter cells and bioluminescence-detecting smartwatches. In this case, the blood test can be taken more frequently and easily at home, which will increase health awareness and transform the catchphrase-- “early diagnosis early treatment” into live.

Project Overview
Millions of gallons of toxic petroleum are released into the ocean each year as a result of accidents such as oil spills or natural geological seepage.
Crude oil is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons consisting largely of n-alkane and aromatic hydrocarbons. Saturated hydrocarbons with linear or branched chains comprise the alkane series, which includes paraffinic hydrocarbons. Unsaturated hydrocarbons with benzene rings comprise the aromatic series, which includes the BTEX compounds.
The World Water Assessment Program, the UN’s flagship water protection initiative, describes a host of health risks associated with these chemicals, some of which are enumerated in the table below (adapted from WWAP brochure)
While petroleum constituents are generally found around industry, nitrates are a common ingredient in fertilizers, whose use is widespread in agricultural practice.  Nutrient-rich runoff enriches water sources such as lakes, rivers and aquifers with nitrates in a process called eutrophication. This facilitates the onset of algal blooms that deprive the native organisms of oxygen and essential nutrients. Afflicted water sources are difficult and expensive to restore and the process could further harm the wildlife.
Due to stable, unreactive chemical structures, many of the aforementioned chemicals are persistent contaminants that circulate through the environment, thus polluting usable water supplies and marine ecosystems for extended periods of time. In fact, crude residues from the 2002 Prestige spill are still, 8 years later, encountered along Glacian shores. The need to control and mitigate the circulation of such chemicals is therefore both eminent and urgent. To that end, the UT Dallas iGEM team is developing novel, modular biosensors that enable cheap, on-site detection of aromatics, nitrates/nitrites and alkanes in low concentrations using an Escherichia coli chassis.
The aromatics sensor builds on the previous work of the Michigan 2009 and Glasgow 2007 teams. Team Glasgow produced a successfully characterized fusion of the pR constitutive promoter and XylR transcription factor of the pu promoter.  Team Michigan produced a fusion of the pu promoter and GFP, but failed to characterize the construct. The XylR protein forms a complex with aromatic compounds, which positively regulates the pu promoter. In this way, E. coli"

• We characterized and sent to the Registry biobrick original parts, including bioplastic-producing genes; the first synthetic symbiosis biofilm-based part; and the first Biobrick yielding an altered behavior of an eukaryotic organism: BBa_K1112000 , BBa_K1112001 , and BBa_K1112002 .
• We built our own scanner and designed an image-analysis software , C++elegans, in order to detect nutrient-rich hotspots in heterogeneous substrates.
• We modeled the system in increasing complexity levels.
• We designed, performed and analyzed our work in the context of a RRI framework . We also wrote “Ten tales on Synthetic Biology” , a book of short stories showing five negative and five positive dream visions on SB.
• We collaborated with the Norwich , Purdue (""Characterization collaboration""), Copenhaguen (""Bricks of knowledge"") and UC Chile (promoting ""Research"" the game) teams.
• We performed a successful pre-field validation test .
• And we did all this with one of the pillars of Responsible Research and Innovation: transparency.

3. Construction of a fully functional stable cell line combining upstream and downstream circuits
We plan to finally construct our parts on two plasmids.  Stable cell lines with complete functions were constructed through Puro and BSD screening and their concentration threshold functions will be verified by using agarose beads with different amounts of GFP adsorbed. We intend to apply it to real life.
4. Upgrade our system
The above mentioned is only a condensed version of our ultimate system which includes inhibitor and more efficient RDF. We hope to upgrade the condensed version to the final version, which also requires the search for appropriate inhabitor and more efficient RDF. We look forward to the day when our final version will come into being.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html,", even though the secretion tag itself is apparently cleaved off during processing as it should be; otherwise the protein would have been about 47 kDa.
Interestingly, the MlrA with the secretion tag containing three propeptide parts appeared to have a molecular weight between 50 and 75 kDa. This could correspond to the calculated weight of the enzyme with the whole secretion tag, which is 62 kDa, which would mean that there had been problems with the cleavage of the tag. In addition, it seemed that there had been problems with producing the protein, as  there was only a very faint band corresponding to this construct on the western blot.
Our plan was to purify the enzymes with the histidine tag located on the C-terminus. Failure to purify MlrA using affinity chromatography Ni-NTA spin columns had been reported before by Dziga et al. (2012). However, as we made a preliminary attempt to purify a larger quantity of the enzyme with FPLC, we succeeded in purifying a small amount of MlrA: the full results can be read from our lab page. Our results thus indicate that affinity chromatography purification of MlrA is possible, although optimization of the purification conditions would be necessary to obtain better purity and higher yields of purified protein. Although we didn’t have time to try these improvements ourselves, we had ideas of what may give better purification yields. This includes a very slow initial elution buffer gradient to wash out unspecific binding. In addition, optimizing the pH of the sample could improve binding; a higher pH might allow for better binding to the nickel in the column, as the number of histidines with a complementary charge would increase. Diluting the sample in phosphate buffer and desalting the sample could improve its binding to the column. Additionally, binding could be facilitated by extending the 6X His tag to a 10X His tag. In the study mentioned above, purification of the enzyme to some extent with ion exchange chromatography had been successful. Although we didn’t have time to try this option, we were able to demonstrate that it is not the only method for purification, as also affinity chromatography could be successful.
However, as we didn’t manage to purify the enzyme enough, we weren’t able to quantify the amount of MlrA needed for the purification of a certain amount of microcystin. Furthermore, measuring the rate of degradation will also help in characterising the enzyme. In order to have the final product, an enzyme capsule capable of detoxifying a bucket of water, these pieces of"

Figure 1. A comparison of the previous PETase sequence and the double-mutated sequence. Image included from the April 2018 article [3].
Our Project and Inspiration
For our project, we have designed a plasmid that secretes MHETase and the double mutant PETase to increase the rate at which PET is degraded compared to the previous PETase sequence. We inserted the plasmid into an E. coli MG1655 strain. Because of the toxicity of ethylene glycol, a second plasmid was designed to allow the bacteria to break down the ethylene glycol and utilize its products as a carbon source. These enzymes include glycolaldehyde reductase, glycolaldehyde dehydrogenase, glycolate oxidase, and malate synthase. This series of enzymes will turn the ethylene glycol, released from the breakdown of PET, into malate which can be used by the cell as a carbon source via the citric acid cycle.
Much of the inspiration for our project came from the many changes that have taken place on Rose-Hulman’s campus. Within the last few years, recycling and decreasing plastic waste have become important aspects of campus. Many of these changes are due to the Six Sigma class. Six Sigma does projects where the students collect data before and after an improvement phase. Some of their past projects have included collecting data on the amount of recyclables in the trash and the use of plastic straws on campus. Recycling areas were set up throughout the academic buildings, and the campus community was educated about what and how to recycle. The plastic straw project initiated a decline in plastic straw use around campus by offering a biodegradable alternative to plastic straws at the eateries on campus and selling reusable straws to students. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show data collected by the Six Sigma class during their recycling project. Figure 2 and 3 show data before and after the improvement phase. They show a noticeable change in the campus community [4].

Similar analysis will do for TetR and the system will enter into 'TetR' state if its quantity dominates. To show transition between the two states, IPTG is added in 1s after the system enters into 'LacI' state completely. The assembling of parts are construcuted as follows:
Parts assembling: the top assembling is the construction used in our software and the bottom one is the toggle switch design in Construction of a genetic toggle switch in Escherichia coli .
where we use two consecutive terminators to indicate a complete termination. Time course simulation was performed to generate the state transition:
State of system has changed to 'TetR' state from 'LacI' state after adding inducer IPTG at 40000s.
The legend used in the figure is not clear. 13:DNA;(lacI153)4, 11:DNA;(tetR154)2, and 14:DNA;(lacI153)4;(tetR154)2 means binding products of initial plasmid with lacI tetramer at site pLacI gene, with tetR dimer at site pTet gene, and with lacI tetramer and tetR dimer both, respectively. At the beginning, initial plasmids are all bound with lacI tetramer and the system is in its 'LacI' state. After adding inducer IPTG at 40000s, concentration of tetR dimer increases and plasmids bound with lacI tetramer start to bind with tetR dimer and form complex of plasmids, lacI tetramer, and tetR dimer. At about 70000s, all plasmids bound with lacI tetramer are further bound with tetR dimer. At about 85000s, due to repression of expression of lacI, plasmids bound with LacI tetramer and tetR dimer both start to unbind to form plasmids bound with tetR dimer only and the system steps into its 'TetR' state gradually. Details of modeling is available here .

Key points of this modeling are:
LacI protein tends to form LacI dimer, which tends to form LacI tetramer further.
Only LacI tetramer binds with pLacI gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.

2.1 Background
Introduction
RNA thermometers (RNATs) are temperature-induced riboswitches that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in response to temperature shifts by a way of undergoing conformation changes in the secondary structure of RNA to exhibit either turn-on state or turn-off state.
Figure 1: Responsiveness of mRNA structures to environmental cues (TUDelft, 2008)
As shown in Figure 1, the hairpin structure harbors the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (SD sequence) and, in this way, make it inaccessible to the 30S unit of the bacterial ribosome, resulting in inactivationof translation . (SD sequence is polypurine sequence located in around 8 nt upstream from the start codon and responsible for anchoring ribosome in the RNA single strand). Once reaching a certain temperature, hairpin structure would vanish and as a result, exposing the SD sequence to trigger the translation process.
Natural forms of RNATs were usually found in 5’ untranslated region of many eubacteria and were believed to be related to biological temperature-rising response (Nocker, 2001, cited in Neupert and Bock, 2009). Here, we would introduce two sub-families of RNATs and synthetic RNA thermometers and how they works in our project.
ROSE
A conserved family of RNATs is the ROSE-like elements (ROSE stands for Repression Of heat Shock gene Expression), first discovered in the 5′ untranslated region of rhizobial heat shock genes (Nocker, 2001). All the RNAts presenting in ROSE family we known control expression of small heat shock genes (Nocker, 2001). However, most naturally occurring ROSE elements are relatively large and fold into complex secondary structures that usually contain 2-4 hairpin structures (Fig. 2). Hence, for practical reason, we tested A"

GSH is a cofactor for GPx enzyme that the thiol group of cysteine in GSH is able to donate a reducing equivalent (H++ e−) to other unstable molecules, such as reactive oxygen species. In donating an electron, GSH itself becomes reactive, but readily reacts with another reactive GSH to form glutathione disulfide. (GSSG)
GSH can be regenerated from GSSG by the enzyme glutathione reductase (GSR) which uses NADPH cofactor. The scheme of reduction cascade can be seen in figure X:
In literature, GPx-1 can be overexpressed in transfected cells and produced synthetically. This recombinant enzyme is shown to work against hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxide and drugs interfering with redox cycle. (Taylor et al. 1993; Kelner et al. 1995)
GPx and SOD enzyme complex, converts free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) into water.
Aprotinin
Also known as pancreatic trypsin inhibitor or serine protease inhibitor, aprotinin is a potent protease inhibitor. According to our researches, aprotinin prevents the formation of xanthine oxidase (XO) from xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH). XO catalyzes the end step of xanthine degradation pathway resulting with ROS formation. In fact, about 80% of ROS during oxidative stress is produced by this enzyme. Furthermore, harmful free radicals such as peroxynitrite can be built up owing to the products of XO. Such free radicals have been found to react with DNA, proteins, and cells, causing cellular damage or even toxicity.
Another reaction catalyzed by xanthine oxidase is the decomposition of S-Nitrosothiols (RSNO), a reactive nitrogen species, to nitric oxide (NO), which reacts with a superoxide anion to form peroxynitrite under aerobic conditions, additionally.This enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and can further catalyze the oxidation of xanthine to uric acid. Both XO and XDH enzymes play an important role in the catabolism of purines.
Inhibition of xanthine oxidase has been proposed as a mechanism for improving cardiovascular health. (Dawson et al. 2006) A study found that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) had a decrease in oxidative stress, including glutathione oxidation and lipid per"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," We also invented the hard- and software of an LED-panel to irradiate the column properly and control the elution process. With this test column, we met up with two experts in protein purification and analytics and discussed the further optimization of our concept. This led to another version of the column we have not been able to construct yet. However, we instead created a 3D-model to show it.
Future concept of EluX. Concept of a microfluidic like (a) and a bundle (b) purification column designed with the support of Dr. Benjamin Müller and Prof. Dr. Dirk Lütkemeyer as future prediction of how the procedure of light induced elution could be used.
Since the consulted experts advised us to increase the area to volume ratio for efficient target protein purification, we developed a microfluidic-like model. Prof. Dr. Lütkemeyer proposed a bundle-like construction as an alternative. He mentioned that we could also improve our actual model by coating the glass slides with a porous material, e.g. carboxymethyl dextran, before biotinylating to increase the area of the glass surface. We realized the suggested versions of our purification column via 3D-models to evaluate them. Beside the advantage of these concepts to solve the area-to-ratio-problem, both have certain challenges too. The channels of the micro-fluidic like column could be clogged by the cell fragments contained in the loaded cell lysate. To address this issue the lysate could be filtrated. Unfortunately, this could lead to a loss of the target protein and thus decrease the yield. The major challenge concerning the flow-bundle-like column is the irradiation of all channels. We designed bundles of 37 small channels to arrange them like honeycombs with LED-units between the bundles. To still guarantee appropriate elution efficiency, the minimal amount of light and the minimal irradiation time should be tested. We would like to identify conditions which guarantee the channels in the center of the bundle to get enough UV-light to induce the protein back bone cleavage through the 2-NPA.
Elux: Construction
Purification Column EluX
For the construction of our purification column, we aimed for two different approaches. The first one was to build the column on our own, using a 3D-Printer to get the basic parts of the column. This was important, as we wished to provide the construction files to the iGEM community and enable other teams to use and improve our work. The second approach was to construct this column in a more professional way,"

Beehives
Though no risk from microorganisms, modified or otherwise, was involved, our work at the Wageningen beehives also required some safety precautions. Working on a project like BeeT becomes much harder when you are covered in bee stings. Team members working on the beehives always wore at least the top half of a beekeeper’s suit, complete with gloves. Team members were never allowed to go to the beehives alone. Additionally, smoke from a bee smoker was used in order to keep the colony calm when disturbing the hive. Even so, getting stung - through the fabric of snug-fitting pants, for instance - still occurred. We were provided with easy access to an epinephrine pen in case of severe allergic reactions, along with clear instructions for its use. For future work, we recommend the use of a full beekeeper’s suit, so as to reduce the amount of bee stings received. [Include picture of iGEM’er with beekeeping suit]

3.0 STAPHISCOPE – A SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY PERSPECTIVE ON MRSA DETECTION
As could be noted, there are not many methods available for the detecting of this pathogenic organism. StaphiScope, iGEM Waterloo’s 2010 project, has been designed as a supplement to the methods described above. This diagnostic tool has the goal of sensing and reporting for the presence of S. aureus populations in an area of interest (e.g., a wound) prior to virulence. It will do so faster than any of the described plating methods, and at a lower price. The method relies very heavily on the quorum sensing capabilities of Staphylococcus aureus.
3.1 QUORUM SENSING: WHAT IS IT AND WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT?
Quorum sensing is defined as “the communication mechanism that enables bacteria to make collective decisions” (Boyen et al., 2009.) This mechanism involves the release of signaling molecules to the cell’s exterior. In gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus, these signaling molecules are referred to as auto-inducing peptides (AIPs). The signaling molecules could then be detected by special receptors on other bacteria (not necessarily of the same strain) and give feedback in regards to the population density at the site. Bacteria rely on quorum sensing in order to thrive as a population. Most importantly, however, at certain critical concentrations of the AIPs, the bacterial populations make a collective decision to, for example, initiate virulence (Boyen et al., 2009.)
This year, the UW iGEM team is attempting to listen in on the quorum sensing “conversations” of S. aureus, by engineering E. coli to receive the AIP signaling molecule mentioned above. Through a signal amplifier, E. coli would be able to detect the presence of S. aureus at very low concentrations, and prior to the bacteria having the chance to become virulent.
3.2 PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF STAPHISCOPE
The purpose of StaphiScope is to provide the option of speeding up some of the methods mentioned above, without compromising their reliability. It will be a particularly useful tool in speeding up the conventional methods of serial plating. In particular, the plating method described above requires that samples first be plated onto either Mannitol  Salt Agar in order to obtain yellow colonies, or Blood Agar"

Motivation
Synthetic biology is now meeting its golden age. Under the spirit of give, get and share, many standards have been set up and several websites have been put online. It is the ideas of standardized and modulated, which was borrowed from electronic engineering, that allow synthetic biology to prosper. For example, Registry of Standard Biological Parts ( http://parts.igem.org/ ) based on standard parts, together with iGEM, promotes synthetic biology a lot among undergraduate students. However, we find that not every part has high quality, for the standard cannot support some level of DNA in synthetic biology and therefore many complicated parts are marked as “composite part” and there was no standard and database for genetic circuit. We can see from IT industry that, new, proper standards can always strengthen the industry and in every step of development of IT, there is a classical standard with it. To make the language of synthetic biology more precise, to coordinate with the original idea of synthetic biology that we can see the behavior of genes just like the relations in circuit, we proposed two technique standards about logical gene module and genetic circuit. Inspired by the idea of Registry of Standard Biological Parts, we also give a solution to record and share standard genetic circuits online, that is Circuit+.
Actions
So, here’s our actions
Technique standard and Database
We proposed two technique standards this year (RFC 101 and RFC 97) to give accurate definitions of logical gene module and genetic circuits. The standard of genetic circuits is very powerful and works as the theoretical base of the software. The standard of logical gene module deals problem of regulation relations and you can see it in LGD (Logical Genetic Diagram). We designed a database carefully to record the circuits we find in a stand format And many software share the same central database.
Circuit+
We develop Circuit+ as our weapon to promote the idea and standard. So, it works like Registry of Standard Biological Parts. It is website of circuits’ information and behind it is the well-built database. And you can find many ways to browse and find a"

Aachen,2017,Team:Aachen#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"Easy Clone Recombination Sites
Genome editing using homologous recombination needs good recombination sites. The sites have great influence on the level of conservation an introduced gene- fragment has and the success- rate of a gene introduction in the laboratory.
Therefore, we concluded the recombination sites given by the Easy Clone system [20] as very promising. The authors pledge that the easy clone recombination sites are located in      highly conserved regions on the chromosomes. Additionally, they validated them in their studies in terms of successrate of gene introductions.
""LoxP"" - System
For lab, safety and responsibility reasons we decided to remove all marker genes we transformed completely. To do so without removing our transformed genes, we used the CreLox recombination system.
The loxP system is used to remove antibiotic resistances from the genome.The GOI outside of the loxP casette remains intact while the removed antibiotic resistance is degraded.
We placed a loxP site on each side in between the marker gene and the homologous regions. Once the transformation and selection had worked, we removed the resistance using the CreLox system. In the genomic integration cassette, the loxP sites were directly beside the marker gene. What we ended up with were completely transformed cells without any of the antibiotic resistance genes used to mark them.
GAL1
For detailed information about the promoter we used you can visit the part page in the iGEM registry.
In all integrations we carried out (overexpressions of native genes, overexpression and integration of foreign genes), the genes were equipped with a GAL1 promotor upstream. The GAL1 promotor allows sensitive adjustability of the expression rate through the Glucose/Galactose ratio in the cultivation media [21]. Thus, it is possible to regulate to the best expression rate of the introduced proteins by experimenting. Just strongly overexpressing the membrane- bound transporter proteins, as we are working with, can get adversely for cell in terms of survivability in salty media.

Introduction
We design and develop a software tool, iGame, which supports database written in MoDeL format, to perform task of automatic modeling. Actually, automatic modeling is a database-dependent network-searching-and-developing process from the initial conditions. Besides the database, users are required to provide initial environment condition, such as initial plasmids with biobrick parts. iGame will generate the network of the biological system in SBML standard. Please refer to User_Interface user interface to know more about input and output of iGame.
Algorithms for automatic modeling will be shown in the following sections. An overview is as follow:
Section Algorithm flow chart gives an overall description of the general framework of our algorithms;
Section Special reactions and volume strategy tells details about the methods and strategies our program utilizes to handle with some special reactions;
Section Chain Sorting and Weighting Scheme provides details of sorting as well as weighting scheme and their functions;
Section Structural pattern match of template species provides details of the core algorithm of iGame: how to find matchings between template species defined in database and species existed in the bio-system;
Section Generation of products based on reaction templates describes the mix-trim-split method to generate products.
Algorithm flow chart
Before stating our own algorithm, we will first make an analysis about the difference and difficulty brought by introducing a new language system. The general algorithm idea is common: find out all species and reactions between them. Ignoring the efficiency of program, the most obvious method is doing the following recursively until no more species is generated:
find reactions between species have been found and generate products as new species
Similar idea applies to our program. Some modifications must be made because in other software tools, reaction-searching is name-based. However, in our program, it is structure-based. Matching of"

DTU-Denmark,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Project#introduction_-_-_TEXT.html," invented as a ligation-independent cloning technique that could substitute the conventional cloning methods, which mades use of restriction enzymes and ligase. In 2003 New England Biolabs (NEB) introduced the USER Friendly Cloning Kit. Although NEBs USER kit was simple and efficient, it was not compatible with proofreading polymerases that stalled when encountering a uracil base in the DNA template (4). This made the USER Friendly Kit unattractive, although the concept was brilliant. In recent years, proofreading polymerases have been developed that are compatible with the concept of USER cloning, since they can read through uracil (5).
The USER method applies long complementary overhangs on the PCR product(s) as well as on the destination vector. The overhangs on the PCR product are custom made, between 7-15 nucleotides long and deoxy uridine nucleotides substitute selected deoxy thymidine nucleotides. The PCR products containing the customized overhangs are treated with the USER enzyme, which is a mix of DNA glycosidase and DNA glycosylase-lyase endo VIII. This treatment results in release of the DNA sequence upstream of the deoxy uridine nucleotide and the resulting exposed overhangs can anneal to each other to form a stable hybridization product. This product can now be transformed directly into E.coli without prior ligation (4,5,6). In order to avoid template carry-over after PCR, the PCR product is usually treated with the restriction enzyme DpnI. DpnI cleaves only when its recognition site is methylated. Unmethylated PCR-derived DNA will be left intact (5).
Outline of the Plug 'n' Play with DNA concept
We introduce a standardized assembly system based on the principle of USER cloning and the USER fusion Assembly standard introduced by the 2009 DTU iGEM team. The new assembly standard called Plug 'n' Play with DNA ( BBF RFC 80 ) offers easier cloning and is a combined standard and assembly system.
The time required to construct devices and plasmids can be significantly reduced with the use of Plug 'n' Play. This is essential to be able to move beyond what we theoretically can create with synthetic biology and conducting it in practice.
The mission of Plug 'n' Play with DNA
We introduce the standardized and versatile system called ""Plug ‘n’ Play with DNA"", where categories of biological parts can be gathered. We imagine that BioBricks in the form of pre-produced PCR-products, can be directly mixed with a backbone vector. This will"

Colonies successfully grew on the plate that was streaked yesterday.  25mL of LB was added to a culture tube, and 25uL of 100mg/mL carbenicillin was added for a total concentration of 100ug/mL.  Using that same tip that aliquotted the antibiotic, a single colony was picked and the entire tip was injected into the tube (tip was a filter tip, but sterility is questionable).  The culture tube and plate was then walked over to boelter lab, and incubated in the 37C shake incubator at 10:20AM.
IPTG induction: OD600 was checked periodically.  At ~0.6 (0.56 in this case at 4:40PM), 1mM IPTG was added to the culture tube.  The culture was grown for another 3 hours before harvesting by centrifugation.  Centrifugation was done at 4,500g for 20 minutes.  The pellet was resuspended in 1mL of sterile water and centrifuged at max speed for 10 minutes.  The total weight of the cell pellet was 0.095g.
Conclusions:  Protein purification will be done next week in order to determine if this growth protocol was sufficient."

The rubber world as we know it
""Demand is indeed increasing, and the IRSG projections estimate the global consumption of natural rubber to reach 13.0 million tons."" - iGEM SDU 2013
Figure 1 - The Global Rubber Consumption
Today almost all of the natural rubber produced in the world comes from the rubber tree  known as Hevea brasiliensis. The tree is native to the Amazonas, but has been introduced to environments in the tropics, especially in plantations located in the south-eastern regions of Asia. The overall area is unknown, but given that clones of Hevea brasiliensis have been shown to produce between 2-3 t/ha/yr - a production maximum, and then assuming that all plantations produce 2 t/ha/yr and that the total global production is 11.3 mio t/yr, the area of plantations is very roughly 57.000 km2, or approximately the size of Croatia. This is of course only an estimate, the total area could be much larger.
Natural rubber is produced from latex extracts, which are obtained by draining the trees. This milky"

Human Practices - CARD
'A ticking time bomb’
Antibiotic resistance is without doubt one of the biggest threats of our times, with the potential to impact every aspect of our lives, from water supply systems to primary medical care. Labelled ‘a ticking time bomb’ by the UK’s chief medical officer, antibiotic resistance is predicted to cause more deaths than cancer by 2050 [1] [2] .
Antibiotic resistance is intrinsically tied to our project and our project design - after all the idea of targeting biofilms rather than the bacteria themselves emerged because of our concerns about inducing resistance development with bactericidal treatments. While researching the causes and the nature of antibiotic resistance more in depth, one key aspect of it was repeatedly emphasized: antibiotic resistance is a population-based issue and it is up to each one of us to minimise the negative impact we make. Therefore, we delved further into the issue to find out how we could make a difference.
The emergence of wide-spread antibiotic resistance is often blamed on two key factors: overuse and misuse of antibiotics. Both components are often encountered in human medicine as well as agriculture and veterinary practise [3] . Whereas they might be the major cause of antibiotic resistance and prevention strategies have been laid out by a variety of national and international organisation such as the WHO and the CDC , the use of antibiotics in biotechnology is rarely discussed in this context. It is, however, a big part of a daily routine for many of us – be it to prevent contamination of our cell lines or to select successfully transformed bacteria. By adapting our use of antibiotics in research we at iGEM Stockholm believe that all of us can make a difference!
A CARD up our sleeves against antibiotic resistance
CARD is a simple system that proposes guidelines for the use of antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria in the areas of life sciences, biotechnology and genetic engineering. By following four basic considerations any researcher can do their part in preventing a further spread of antibiotics resistance.
During discussion within our team and with fellow researchers, we found that many of us were woefully unaware of anything beyond the most basic safety considerations for working with antibiotics and antibiotic resistant organism in labs.
To abrogate this, we"

Due to covalent linkage, stringent washing can be used to achieve high purity of the recombinant protein that is subsequently released by cleavage of a designated protease.
Overall, our novel approach for protein purification is reliable and highly specific. It provides a better solution to reach high protein purity and quality by remedying many drawbacks of currently used methods.
Design
Magnetic bacteria Magnetospirillum magneticum strain AMB-1 is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic bacterium. It produces a unique organelle known as Magnetosome using iron and other metal ions. Magnetosome consists of uniform nano-sized magnetic particles (50 to 100 nm) arranged as chains in cytoplasm and embraced by a stable lipid bilayer membrane, and exhibits strong ferrimagnetism.
Fig.2 Transmission electron microscope image of (A) AMB-1 and (B) Magnetosome
Magnetosome has been used in various biomedical applications because it is easy to handle and can be used to separate target molecules from reaction mixes. Several proteins are identified to tightly bind to the membrane of Magnetosome, such as MagA, Mms16, and Mms13. Among them, Mms13 has the highest affinity to the magnetic core, and its anchoring efficiency is also better than other Mms proteins. Thus, a protein of interest can be expressed on the Magnetosome when fused with Mms13. The magnetic particles can be easily extracted and purified from bacterial lysate of AMB-1 transformant using a magnet.
Fig.3 Proteins on the Magnetosome’s membrane and AMB-1 modification by transformed with Mms13 protein.
Choosing an appropriate tag is crucial for detecting and purifying a recombinant protein. However, the interaction of tags with corresponding ligands is typically reversible and mostly has low affinity. Streptococcus pyogenes fibro-nectin-binding protein FbaB contains a domain with a spontaneous isopeptide bond between Lys31 and Asp117. This domain can be splitted into two fragments: the small one (13 amino acids) is named as Spytag, while the big one (116 amino acids) is Spycatcher. When they meet together, the two parts can specifically associate and spontaneously form an isopeptide bond. The reaction can take place in diverse conditions, even in relatively extreme pH and temperatures.

We used this feature of Spytag"

PCR extraction was done on the PCR from yesterday. The chromoproteins from the restriction digest done on Tuesday was run on a gel to ensure that the digest was sucessful. The gel showed two bands (as expected) with the larger part of the fragments were much brighter. Gel extraction proved unsuccessful. Another restriction digest was done and the Gibson Assembly to add a purfication tag and to move the DNA2.0 chromoproteins into the iGEM standard plasmid will be done tomorrow using just the product of the restriction digest. The concentration of the restriction digest insert should be 1 ug/50uL or .02 ug/uL or .043 pmol/uL which will be sufficent for the Gibson Assembly.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," order to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.

How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for"

Discussion with C. Veress
C. Veress is a philosophy teacher at a Swiss high school and at the same time he is a passionate musician. In our conversation about where he faces complexity in his life and how he deals with it many interesting topics were discussed. Following is an extract of some questions we discussed.
Where in your occupational field do you encounter complexity?
For me as a teacher the single processes in my profession are manageable and easy to cope with. The complexity arises with the multitude of all duties. As a teacher’s duties I see correcting exams, teaching classes, preparing lessons, reading and grading homework.
A repetitively occurring phenomenon is that during the academic year all single tasks accumulate and in the end the whole organisational system is near the total collapse. There is a saturation occurring, vacation would be highly appreciated but is not possible. As a teacher, being a human, psychic entity I am in contact with other psychic entities. Humans as thinking creatures are often non-predictable and are even after years able to astonish me. This is where I see complexity emerging, thinking creatures being part of a variable organisational structure.
How do you deal with this complexity, can we and should we simplify it?
For my own wellbeing I have found a way of dealing with this complexity. Most of it is related to carefully planning my daily life. I had to learn to define working hours for the sake of my privacy and relaxation time. It has not always been obvious to me that I need to listen to my body and take care of my vegetative duties such as sleeping and eating. When I am neglecting those fundamental"

Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all awards, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form"

It was the energy giants who are now starting to show interest in synthetic biology. This will prove incredibly useful for future iGEM projects and synthetic biology as a whole as these companies will may help to fund some projects provided that they can demonstrate applications within the field.

Duplicating the Lab and Polishing Off Activities
Today I spent some time:
Moving a few of the activities I have permissions on to the second lab and began changing positions that some of the materials are set to when they are required to move, which will be completed tomorrow morning.
I also spent a lot of time making new note cards and dropping them into inventory for restriction digest as well as construction so that it is possible for something to be given back at each step
One issue I discovered within construction was that the id of the individual performing the task was not kept track of so it has to be stored every time an avatar chooses particular circuit parts to ligate together. Also, the substrings for some of the circuit parts still appear to be a couple of base pairs off within construction sites so I will have to use a note card reader I have been using for tests to see what the substrings should actually be.
Tomorrow I would like to finish changing the sequencing station script so that it functions properly for the lab missions as well as general activities and I want to return to the DNA animation by the afternoon and see if it is possible to unravel the strands of DNA I have built.

Fort McMurray and the oil giants
Today was our first day at Fort McMurray, touring the oil sands of Suncor Energy Inc. We, together with the iGEM team of U of Lethbridge and Edmonton, were given an extensive guide throughout the oil sands. The first glance of all the intertwined pipelines that are present in order to maneuver the precursor and the product of oil around made me dizzy, but was able to grasp some sense about how the oil was extracted and processed.
Despite of my thoughts on aiding the maintanence of pipelines via preventation of biofilms, their pipeline damages are mostly due to sand that physically degrades the performance of the pipelines.
The current efficiency, as in given output per input, is told to be about 95%. This number however seems to be way too high as they seems to lose lots of energy via steam. Maybe the extraction or the processing of oil can be improved via bacteria? Something to ponder about.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#model future_-_-_TEXT.html," more independent.
Currently, some of MoDeL syntaxes are defined for specific algorithms of iGaME. Being a language for automatic modeling, cooperation with algorithm is reasonable. However, we believe there are too many compromises, thus causing a number of inconsistencies. In the next version, we are looking forward to a more independent MoDeL.
New functions of iGaME
iGaME grows together with MoDeL. In the one-year process of software development, we have achieved many of our goals, and found even more to be achieved. Looking ahead, we have the following wishes for iGaME.
User-friendly output for both professionals and amateurs.
It is far from enough to provide only dynamic curves as output because users may want more information about the biological system. Professionals may want to know the whole picture of reaction network, how do the species react with each other, and what influence do they have on the network. Amateurs may not be interested in curves, and they want to have a more straightforward concept of the network.
We are planning to give a graphic display of the reaction network by showing the change of species quantities dynamically. Users could understand the underlying reasons why a curve reaches its peak from the network. We also plan to show the topological structure of reactions in network. By connecting species with reactions, users can get a clear picture of the interconnections between species.
User-friendly input with fun
Powered by MoDeL, iGaME has already relieved users from inputting massive amount of data. However, we are still looking forward to make the input process more fun. Besides providing a graphical scene, we are planning to have more elements like story telling and character selecting. Moreover, result grading and multi-user interacting are to be added to make our software a real game.
Database Development Kit
Though we have presented the detail document of RFC 55 for MoDeL, modelers may still found it a tough job to construct a usable database. The Database Development Kit aims at aiding modelers with easy-to-use development tools. To achieve this, graphical tools for creating, removing, modifying data in database are needed. Parameter estimation tools and MoDeL syntax checking tools are also wanted. We are planning to have this kit in our future version, which will greatly reduce the difficulties for users to construct their own databases.
We believe the future of iGaME is bright !

Alessandro and Nadine autoclaved beads and prepared 4 bottles of SOC medium. We took the plated cells (J61002 Ptet-LacI Plac-lysis & Ptet-LacI Plac-RFP) from incubator and put them in suspension (LB medium + ampicillin) to grow overnight. We also plated the rest of these transformed cells. We did a Klenow reaction on the 1off library to have dsDNA. The ordered plasmids arrived,so we made a PCR on pSB3C5 (to amplify the backbone) and on TetR (adding pConst) to prepare the parts needed for Gibson.

J61002 plasmids
Alessandro made minipreps on cells grown overnight and made glycerol stocks of them (500 microL). Because the cells that we assume to have RFP (under the control of Plac) are not a little red, we also kept an aliquot of these cells to make a test with IPTG (this is a molecular mimic of allocaltose therefore it triggers the transcription on Plac): if these cells become red with IPTG we can be sure that RFP is controlled by Plac in our plasmid (from Gibson assembly).
Alessandro digested the plasmind (from miniprep) with PstI because Nadine found that if the Gibson went well, they should have 2 restricition sites for this enzyme - instead of 1 for J61002 Ptet-RFP plasmid. Unfortunately, the results show that GIbson didn't work... For every colony we have a band at 2.5 kb, which corresponds exactly to the size of the backbone.
The backbone must have closed without the inserts... We can redo Gibson with less backbone. On the plates we prepared yesterday one colony is red! We suspended it, we'll check tomorrow if this one has the correct plasmid.
pSB3C5 plasmid
pSB3C5 backbone purification, both bands contain the same product.
The PCR to add Pconst to TetR didn't work, but we already have it in the freezer. Nadine purified the pSB3C5 backbone, but the bands on the gel were really weak even with all the PCR products loaded onto the gel and the concentration is only 6 ng/ul. We will anyway try Gibson tomorrow...

XXVI International Apicola Update Congress 2019
For our last activity of Education and Public Engagement section in iGEM, we wanted to reach the beekeeping sector again but a little different this time. Having done everything we accomplished through these months, we wanted to close this section with our participation in something that involved beekeepers.
After 25 years of development, the International Apicola Update Congress will be held for the first time in a northern entity of the country. In 2019, Chihuahua, our state, will host this important event thanks to its great contribution to the national honey production with great quality products.
The congress is organized and carried out annually by the National Association of Veterinary Doctors Specialists in Bees, A.C. (ANMVEA, A.C.). It is really important for beekeepers because here they have every tool they need at the back of their hands to solve beehives issues.
For our team, keeping in touch with experts is essential for the diffusion of synthetic biology and for receiving feedback of the project, that's why we contacted ANMVEA, A.C., the most important Mexican beekeeping association. We showed them this year´s project and they completely loved it. They were amazed at our engagement and commitment to bees.
One day while we were discussing the project, they mentioned that they were very happy because we were working with bees, this due to the lack of research for beekeeping. The secretary of ANMVEA, A.C., MVZ Ernesto Tanus Sánchez, explained that this area needed a lot of research because beekeepers nowadays were 50+ years old and most of them were not related to science. They said that they needed young minds working to solve beekeeping problems and people who stayed updated with situations related to bees. ANMVEA, A.C. is concerned about the future of beekeeping. As well, they are aware of all the diseases and beekeeping issues that could be solved using new scientific techniques, such as synthetic biology.
As we mentioned before, almost no beekeeper is acquainted with synthetic biology or science in general.  That's  why  iGEM  Tec  Chihuahua  is  looking  forward  to
introducing synthetic biology to professionals in this field. As well, we want to invite and inspire international beekeeping experts to relate to this newly"

The Estimation of $k_n$ and $k_e$
We estimated $k_n$ and $k_e$ based on the data in Wakabayashi et al. (1969) and Kondoh and Hotani (1974), assisted by the theory provided by Kashchiev (2015).
Wakabayashi et al. (1969) conducted several spontaneous nucleation experiments with Salmonella flagellin and obtained some useful data. Using these data, we derived the corresponding parameters $k_n$ and $k_e$ for Salmonella. (In this process, we used the fact that a flagellar filament consists of 11 longitudinal rows of flagellins (O’Brien et al., 1972) and that the axial spacing between flagellins is $5 \ \text{nm}$ (Champness, 1971), hence the citation in Table 2.) To transfer these data to the case of E. coli, we utilized the comparison between Salmonella and E. coli flagellin polymerization given by Kondoh and Hotani (1974). They gave the $K_m$ and $k_e$ for Salmonella and E. coli respectively. Note that the data here was obtained under conditions similar to our elongation step (around physiological ionic strength and pH), while the data given by Wakabayashi et al. was obtained under conditions allowing spontaneous nucleation (with high concentrations of salting-outers). Since our model mainly concerns the nucleation step, we cannot directly use this data. However, the information provided by Kondoh and Hotani (1974) tells us that the $k_e$ of E. coli is about one-tenth of that of Salmonella. If we assume that this relationship holds in the change of conditions between the elongation step and the nucleation step, we can transfer the $k_e$ we obtained for Salmonella under nucleation conditions from Wakabayashi et al. (1969) to $k_e$ of E. coli under the same conditions.
What about $k_n$? Intuitively, we know that since E. coli is slower in elongation than Salmonella (Kondoh and Hotani, 1974), it must be slower in nucleation as well. But by how much? To calculate the $k_n$ of E"

PSA’s fall into three categories: solvent based, water based and hot-melt
Solvent based are traditionally used in patch production
o   Water based and hot-melt are more beneficial for skin irritation, sensitization and environmental contamination risks
o   Polyisobutylenes are better for allergenicity compared to acrylics and silicone-based
Patch failures:
o   Case I: Adhesive failure
o   Case II: PSA doesn’t adhere to backing layer
o   Case III: matrix has good adhesive strength, poor cohesive strength
o   Case IV: adhesive and cohesive failure
PIB-based adhesives:
Disadvantage: easy oxidation and low air and water vapour permeability
Acrylic-based adhesives:
Colorless and transparent
More resistant to oxidation
Silicon-based adhesives
When testing in vivo performance:
Need to find an artificial material that is able to simulate continuous variations of skin humidity - related to critical surface tension, surface roughness and deformability
Skin deformability is most critical to consider
Effects of relative adherend humidity on peel adhesion performances can be studied using collagen-coated plates
When peeling off a patch, need to consider tensile deformation, bending stiffness and substrate deformation
Stress distribution on skin deformation was measured in vivo by tension, torsion, suction and indentation tests

We also started conducting our tests in a closed box to avoid ambient light. By eliminating ambient light we were able to get more consistent measurements. Our biology team also prepared transformed bacteria for us to test with the colour sensor. The set up was similar to what the device is going to look like: in a square 1 by 1 cm, we grew three stripes of bacteria each different colour. For the testing purposes, there were 4 squares. One with all three stripes of bacteria with no colour change (blank), one with one red stripe and 2 blank, another one with one blue stripe and 2 black, and the last one with red and blue stripes and one black. We also had two meetings with the Schulich School of Engineering Machine  Shop at Schulich School of Engineering regarding  our device design. William Gill, an intern student, made a 3D sketch of our device while we communicated necessary volumes for our chambers. We also found out that the range in which the sensor can detect colour is 1 cm wide, so the three chambers with bacteria (three chambers where the colour can potentially change) have to be 1 cm wide all together. Fluid flow stimulation will have to be done to make sure all three chambers get equal amounts of fluid. This week we also got back the results from the plate reader experiment so we can start on quantitative modelling.

Week 14: August 5th - August 8th
The Colour Sensor Testing Plate was left to grow over the long weekend, so it was ready for testing on Tuesday this week. However, the colourrs look rather faint. When measurements were taken, there was hardly any difference between the blank square and all the other squares. The measurements seem to be better, but are still inconclusive as it is hard to tell the difference between just blue colour present and blue and red colours present. More plates need to be grown to see if the measurements would be consistent. The plate was also contaminated with fungus. This week we set up a meeting with Cesar Rodriguez, Senior Research Scientist with Autodesk Research, to discuss our project and to consult him about Maya modelling. Our existing device animation is at a presentable level and we can polish it later on. At this time, we have to start on the animation for the biological process taking place in our device. We contacted a member of last year’s team to get get help with getting started with ePMV plug in for Maya. We will also set up a meeting with the team members working"
NYC_Wetware,2011,Team:NYC Wetware#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"anted culture supernatant), and work surfaces were disinfected using 10% bleach before disposal and biohazard disposal bins were used whenever necessary. 
Although we do expect some public concern about our goal of increasing the radioactive resistance of E. coli, we do not anticipate any safety issues with our work. We have no intention of releasing any bacteria into the human body or the environment at any point in the iGEM competition. Even if it did ""escape"" from our lab, the bacteria is effectively harmless; as stated above, neither our plasmids nor our insert genes  will affect the virulence, infectivity, or host range.  From inception, our team has considered and discussed the possible ramifications of creating bacteria resistant to large doses of radiation. We recognize that the additional resilience of this trait is a potential hazard if transferred to a virulent species. Careful consideration and caution would be necessary before implementing any public application.
Do any of the Biobricks or devices we've made raised safety issues?
One serious issue that we have considered is food irradiation. The process of exposing food to ionizing radiation to kill bacteria is used in countries around the world. If a pathogenic bacteria were to acquire the ability to resist high doses of radiation - a trait we hope to Biobrick - it could no longer be destroyed through this means of irradiation.
With deference to this safety concern, we chose to pursue our project because of its potential for ameliorating a major environmental crisis. In the United States, the Department of Energy states that there are ""millions of gallons of radioactive waste"" as well as ""thousands of tons of spent nuclear fuel"" and also ""huge quantities of contaminated soil and water"". The biobricks we hope to design would enable E. coli to survive while breaking down nuclear toxic waste to harmless derivates.
Additionally, the ability to increase cellular radioresistance has beneficial medical applications. Fortifying stem cells against radiation damage could increase the success rate of stem cell transplants, a current therapy for patient suffering from diseases of the blood, bone marrow, and certain cancers. We believe that the urgency of such needs justifies our research, notwithstanding its potential hazards.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at our institution?
We have departmental approval for our safety policies, and IRB approval is not needed since we don't have human subjects. As volunteers of Weill Cornell Medical College, we are insured in the case that any accident occurs.

2) At 3pm, dilute cells 1:50 (cells: media) into 10ml (5ml if starter media, see above) of supplemented M9 media.  Grow them overnight at 37 °C
Day 3 Afternoon
Things needed
Multi-well plate reader
96 well plate
20 LB agar plates with strep
Monitering of OD
1. When the culture has reached a high OD (>2.0), 200ul of cell culture is transferred into a 96 well plate and the absorbance at 600nm is measured using a multi-plate reader (or spectrophotometer).
2. If the OD of the culture is not very high, there is also the option of spinning the cells down using a centrifuge.  The cells can then be resuspended in a smaller volume of medium.  (optional step, perhaps better if step 1 reaches the high OD naturally)
3. With the O.D.600 calculate how much of the overnight culture is required to give an O.D.600 of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 in 2ml using the following calculation:
Vol of culture (ml)=(O.D.600 wanted / O.D.600 of Overnight culture) * 400ul
Carry out the dilutions required using M9 media+0.5% glucose.
Note 1: There will be a tendency for OD readings to be higher than expected ie. when OD 3.0 is halved, it will probably give an OD of around 2.2 rather than 1.5.
Note 2: The most important region of OD to get data points should be where we expect to start collecting fluorescence readings and other data eg 1.2
Note 3: For higher values (>1 u of OD) linearity of the relationship between OD and Cell number becomes an issue. Dilute down and compensate on paper by multiplying by the dilution factor
4. Remove 200ul of each dilution and pipette into a 96 well plate.  Measure the O.D.600 using a multiplate reader and discard.
5. Now carry out a series of 10 fold dilutions by removing 10ul of the dilution and adding into to 1ml of M9 (this gives "

Throughout our entire project, we have thought about commercialization of some aspects of it. Consequently, we decided to file a patent for the newly developed coacervate-based detection method for the detection of specific RNA sequences ( CINDY Seq ), described on our measurement page . In the process of writing this patent application, it became clear that this method could have a whole range of applications besides RNA detection, and we have identified multiple options on how we could commercialize the method for these applications. Furthermore, we have already received interest from multiple companies to further think about commercialization of the results of our research.

Introduction To GANs
Explore GANs
Introduction
Examples
GANs and Synthetic Biology
What are Generative Adversarial Networks?
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are deep neural network architectures comprised of two different networks, contesting with each other.
In 2014, Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues at University of Montreal introduced GANs in their research article
Generative Adversaral networks is the most interesting idea in the last ten years in machine learning
Yann LeCun, Director, Facebook Ai
These generative networks have an immense potential, as they can learn to mimic any distribution of a given dataset. GANs are creative „robot artists“ which are capable to imagine and generate things we can grasp and understand: images, music, speech, stories...
Images generated by Creative Adversarial Networks [1]
Introduction by Analogy
Let‘s say there is a jewelery store which purchases diamonds from customers and later resells them.
However, there are customers that have decided to try and sell fake diamonds. In such case, the jewelery store must be able to distinguish between the fake and real diamonds or else they will start losing money.
Initially, the forger might make a lot of mistakes when making and selling the fake diamonds and it will be easy for jewelery shop to identify that those diamonds are, in fact, fake. Yet, the forger will try many different techniques to simulate an authentic diamond and eventually might trick the store owners. After that, the forger knows that certain methods work better then the others, and will build upon those techniques to improve even more.
At the same time, the jewelery store might get some feedback from other shop owners or diamond quality experts. As the store receives more and more diamonds, they will become better and better at distinguishing them.
Therefore, the main goal of the forger is to make diamonds that are indistinguishable from the real"

Collaboration
NYC Wetware
Throughout the summer we connected with other iGEM teams interested in radiation-related projects. The NYC Wetware team in particular was studying the effects of genes cloned from the organism Deinococcus radiodurans on radiation resistance in E.coli. We were given the honor of helping them characterize one of their strains TS TR, a strain capable of producing the molecule trypanothione.
Using the gamma facilities provided by the Radiation Science and Engineering Center at Penn state we were able to carry out tests of gamma irradiation of their strain and subsequently measure cell viability.
Aliquots of culture (5ml each) inoculated with the TS TR strain were added to tubes which were irradiated by a cobalt-60 gamma source at a dose rate of 25 gys/min for total doses ranging from 0-800 gys. After irradiation 0.02 ml of the irradiated sample was inoculated into 5 ml of SOB media. The OD600 was measured 12 hours later. The results are shown below.
Sevilla iGEM Team
We were also fortunate enough to have one of our team members, Lauren Rossi, visit the Sevilla 2011 iGEM team while traveling in Spain. She was able to meet the team, swap lab tips, techniques, and gossip, and even got a few members of their team to give interviews for our human practices video Check out their contributions and more on our human practices page!

about the structure of DNA. There could not have been a better occasion to teach scholars about synthetic cells and gene expression in non-cellular systems. Additionally, this day was never celebrated in Vilnius University Life Sciences Center before, thus our team settled to launch a new continuous tradition.
The main attraction of the DNA Day was a number of interactive activities designed for curious schoolchildren of various Lithuanian schools. All activities introduced the main idea and concepts of our project as well as the Life Sciences Center itself as a place where significant research happens. Schoolchildren visited several departments of this Center: Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Department of Botany and Genetics, Department of Eukaryote Gene Engineering, Department of Bioinformatics, Sector of Microtechnologies, Department of Immunology and Cell Biology and Department of Protein-DNA Interactions. At first glance, Life Sciences Center looks a bit like a labyrinth, so in order to make this Day more fun and interesting for students, we set up orienteering competition. Through interactive activities we revealed why it was important to visit the abovemention departments, and how they were related to developing our project’s idea. Pupils were given some tasks and their answers led them to next points in another departments.
First of all, after speaking about laboratory safety rules and showing equipment which included pipetmans, centrifugal machine, thermocycler and other, we explained the central dogma of molecular biology. Pupils learned about several methods we use while carrying out experiments. For example, they were able to try dilution while doing it with some colorful solutions and measuring the exact solution’s concentration with a spectrophotometer.
During other activities schoolchildren had to identify particular restriction sites of DNA sequence relying on activity of given restriction enzymes. It helped pupils to learn about making recombinant DNA which is used to transfer information.
In the Sector of Microtechnologies participants got to know how proteins are inserted into synthesised liposomes. We explained our project’s main idea to pupils and how it might be used in such fields as genetics or molecular biology.
Schoolchildren enjoyed spending a day in our research centre very much and were really interested in solving our biological puzzles. Quoting pupils: “this way it was easier to solidify the gained knowledge”. Later all attendees of the DNA Day were invited to a science communication lecture #DNAtoDo held by professor R. Meškys, our former PI. Professor had presented the latest technology and innovations in the field of life sciences and pointed their impact on our everyday life. Relating this"
