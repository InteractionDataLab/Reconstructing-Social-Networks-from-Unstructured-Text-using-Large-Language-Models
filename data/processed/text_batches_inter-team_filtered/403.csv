Gene Network Modeling
In this part of modeling work, we mainly center on constructing some crucial circuits in our regulating network, including the light responding upstreams and downstream movement control mechanisms, as well as some middle wares.
The aim of these construction work is to know about the how the messaging delivering system work as a whole, how does the different signals effect each other in the final output level.
Introduction
We've constructed several modeling skeleton in Matlab Simbiology Package, they are:
DgrA/DgrB Circuit in regulating the flagellum movement
HfiA/HfsJ Circuit in regulating the genesis of composing substances holdfast.
The DNA Inverse Circuit which may change the direction in which promoter works.
Light Sensors including Blue, Red and Green.
Networks
DNA Inverse Enzyme
Introduction
In this model, our aim is to verify that according to use of a recombinase, we can control the relative expressing level of two different kind of Protein.
This is a small picture illustrating its basic condition:
Equations
$$ \frac{d(repressor)}{dt} = K_{repressor} - Vm_{rep}\cdot DNA^n_{rep}/(Kp_{rep}+DNA^n_{rep}) - K_{bind}\cdot lac\cdot repressor$$         $$ \frac{d(DNA)}{dt} = -Vm_{rep}\cdot DNA^n_{rep}/(Kp_{rep}+DNA^n_{rep})$$         $$ \frac{d([repressor-DNA])}{dt} = Vm_{rep}\cdot DNA^n_{rep}/(Kp_{rep}+DNA^n_{rep})$$         $$ \frac{d([lac-repressor])}{dt} = K_{bind}\cdot lac\cdot repressor$$         $$ \frac{d(recombinase)}{dt} = K_{recom}\cdot DNA$$         $$ \frac{d(PromoterDir1)}{dt} = -Vm_{cata}\cdot PromoterDir1/(Km_{cata}+PromoterDir1)$$         $$ \frac{d(PromoterDir2)}{dt} = Vm_{"
USTC,2017,Team:USTC-Software#Installation_-_-_TEXT.html," each plugin to a port where its frontend files served         // to serve a plugin frontend files, run `npm run dev <port>` in its frontend directory ""plugins"": { ""biohub.abacus"": 10000, ""biohub.biocircuit"": 10001, ""biohub.biomap"": 10002         },         // the address to your local developing server ""proxy_domain"": ""localhost:8000"" },     // configuration for production environment     // you can simply ignore it ""prod"": { ""domain"": ""biohub.technology"", ""static"": ""https://ustc-software2017-frontend.github.io/Biohub-frontend/dist/assets/"" } }
Then run npm run dev, and you can access the site at localhost:8080.
Guidance for Plugin Developers
To create and activate a new plugin, simply run:
(.env) $ ./biohub-cli.py plugin new <plugin_name> --with-frontend (.env) $ ./biohub-cli.py plugin install <plugin_name>
where <plugin_name> is the dot-separated module name of the plugin (e.g. biohub.abacus). You may type ./biohub-cli.py plugin new --help to find more details.
The second step is to install dependencies for the frontend of the new plugin. Simply run:
(.env) $ cd path/to/your/plugin/frontend (.env) $ npm install (.env) $ npm run dev <port> # randomly choose a number for <port> from 10000~65535
Then compiled files will be served at localhost:<port>. Don’t forget to add a new item in frontend/main/domain.config.json:
{ ""dev"": {         // ...         plugins: {             // ... ""<your_plugin_name>"": ""<port>"" }     } }
Now you can start to write your own plugin. The templates generated by biohub-cli contains some useful comments, which may help you during developing. Also, you can take our integrated plugins (e.g. biohub.biomap) as references."

Creating/Testing prokaryotic tCas9-CIBN  chimeric constructs
We constructed tCas9-CIBN chimeric constructs gene with an prokaryotic RBS sequence from the Community collection ( BBa_B0034 ). For detection of expression the fusion protein was tagged with a HA-epitope coding sequence ( BBa_K1150016 ).
Creating/Testing prokaryotic CRY2-VP64  chimeric constructs
We constructed CRY2-VP64 chimeric constructs gene with an prokaryotic RBS sequence from the Community collection ( BBa_B0034 ). For detection of expression the fusion protein was tagged with a FLAG-epitope coding sequence (gactacaaggacgacgacgacaaa).
Creating/Testing prokaryotic tCas9-VP64  chimeric constructs
To address these limitations, we adapted the CRISPR/Cas9 activator system for optogenetic control. We constructed tCas9-VP64 chimeric constructs gene with an prokaryotic RBS sequence from the Community collection ( BBa_B0034 ).For detection of expression the fusion protein was tagged with a FLAG-epitope coding sequence (gactacaaggacgacgacgacaaa).
Testing tCas9-VP64
We tested our tCas9-VP64 fusion protein by transfecting it into BL21 cells along with a guide RNA which will target the tCas9-VP64 to upstream regulatory sites on our reporter construct and activate the expression of GFP. We showed that our tCas9-VP64 fusion is fully functional.
Verification of the suppression efficiency of gRNAs
To ensure the suppression efficiency of the gRNA, four gRNA sequences targeting different sites of CSPA promoter were designed and transformed into the E. coli strains BL21. Efficient suppression of CSPA promoter in strains BL21 was observed. The GFP level dramatically decreases after transforming a fragment that expresses CSPA promoter gRNA. The sequence with the best suppression effect was selected for further study.
Silencing capability validation
We next evaluated the effect of tCas9-CIBN on suppressing CSPA promoter. The GFP expression level was assayed in strains BL21 after co-transformation with tCas9-CIBN and gRNA in the absence of light conditions. Compared with control groups, green fluorescence intensity and mRNA levels were dramatically reduced in groups treated with gRNA and tCas9"

Research is fun, but it is more than just lab work. Communication is a very important part in science. iGEM focuses especially on cooperations and collaborations of different teams all over the world. We met a lot of new interesting people during our iGEM time and hopefully we will stay in contact after the conference.
Meetup in Marburg (15/07/31-15/08/02)
Team Marburg invited all German iGEM teams for a meetup in their little city. After the arrival and the erection of our tents on a camping site, we split up into little groups containing one member of each team. In these groups we explored Marburg and started to connect. The next day started with the official part when every team introduced themselves and presented their interesting projects. We were pleasantly surprised that every team was very helpful and friendly – they all offered help and gave tips in their main areas. Afterwards, the fun part started when we took part in a friendly canoe race on the Lahn. The great day ended with a barbecue followed by dancing in a rented club. All in all, the weekend helped to establish many new contacts and to connect all the participating teams.
Bielefeld - Water Samples (15/07/31-15/08/02)
Bielefeld 2015 is working on extensible biosensors to analyze the water quality and detect contaminations with heavy metals. Therefore they asked other iGEM teams to provide water samples. Based on this we brought them water samples from Erlangen to the Meetup in Marburg, where we met team Bielefeld.

Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Essays_-_-_TEXT.html," to revolutionise neuroscience. The basis of synthetic biology is incorporating DNA into cells, such as neurons, for useful purposes.  One of the aims of synthetic neurobiology is to create novel synthetic neural pathways which can then be studied. Scientists are currently in the early stages of experimenting with this, and in the future it is possible that complex circuits can be created that can mimic disease states, allowing scientists to understand them in more detail. And who knows, perhaps in the future there may be scope for synthetic implants (computer implants have been used to restore vision, and can be used to control prosthetic limbs!).
Currently drug therapies have been the main method of treating neurological diseases, along with more invasive treatments such as deep brain stimulation. [4] But what about synthetic biology? Could inserting genes into neurons alter their electrical activity? Or prevent cell death and therefore neurodegeneration?  Scientists from a wide range of backgrounds have been studying and researching in this new field of synthetic neurobiology, and have found some exciting results. [2,3]
Optogenetics, the process of inserting genes into neurons which encode light sensitive ion channels called 'opsins', has revolutionised neuroscience research. [1,2] This method allows only selected neurons to be activated or silenced by specific wavelengths of light in experimental setups, a major advantage over the traditional method of electrical stimulation which is not neuron specific. [3] Along with the advantages it provides to research (it’s a lot easier to find out what a specific neuron type is doing if you know that it’s the only one being activated or inhibited), it also shows therapeutic advantages. Researchers at MIT and the University of Southern California have successfully inserted DNA from light sensitive algae into retinal neurons in blind mice, [2] restoring their ability to navigate towards light.  Furthermore spontaneous epileptic seizures in mice have been stopped rapidly using optogenetics, by activating inhibitory neurons and also inhibiting excitatory neurons. [2]
Synthetic neurobiology has also caught the attention of younger synthetic biologists [5] ; in the 2011 iGEM competition, undergraduates from National Yang-Ming University developed a new method to use wireless optogenetics, minimising invasive damage to neurons that occurs with the implants needed to use optogenetics.  Overall synthetic biology looks like a promising technique that could further our knowledge of the nervous system and potentially be used to treat neurological disorders. It has so far contributed to improving our knowledge of brain function, and improved neurological diseases in animal models. Gene delivery has also been so far successful in human trials. Of course we need to be cautious; we do not"

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," explore these ethical questions and find out the public’s opinion on our project, we sent out a questionnaire to over 150 people, asking: If your doctor recommended a treatment for an infection, which involved the use of bacteria that had been engineered to treat the infection, would you use it? We also asked this question to a number of medical professionals during our visits to hospitals and clinics.
Whilst the majority of feedback was very positive, we did encounter some valuable criticism, as shown in the graph below. Most medical professionals we spoke to had positive responses, though one nurse had reservations about our idea.
This proportion of negative feedback, although small (6%), highlighted to us that our dialogue with the public needed to be improved, as well as telling us that getting our treatment recommended by doctors is the key to getting it used as common practice. We believe that, through improving people's understanding of our project, we can convince pessimists that genetic engineering is now a force for good. This also led us onto holding talks to student groups, which you can find in the Outreach section below. Nevertheless, this is very encouraging data for our project, and again highlights the importance of gaining support from doctors for this to become a realistic treatment option.
We also approached the public later on with a variety of different delivery option for them to choose from, including the idea of introducing free-living, genetically engineered bacteria into the urinary tract, alongside different catheter-associated treatments. 44% of the 50 people we asked were most happy with the free living bacteria, due to its effectiveness at treating the infection. This was by far the most popular option, followed by 20% opting to have the bacteria sealed within a catheter, since this balanced efficiency with safety.
The public’s biggest concern for this option is side effects from the engineered bacteria colonising the urinary tract. However, over 2/3 of the people who raised this concern said that they would be happy to use the method if they got a clear explanation of how it worked from a health care professional. Additionally, the concern was outweighed by the public’s opinion of having a safe kill switch, and that this treatment is the most effective. Again, full results can be seen here .
Safety Considerations for Free-living Bacteria
For the idea of introducing our engineered bacteria into the human body to be feasible, there need to be sufficient safety considerations in place. Whereas for the physically contained options, ensuring that if the bacteria escape, they die is important, it is especially important to make sure that molecular containment is in place for the free-living delivery option.
We have created theoretical kill switches"
Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," in their project and allowed us to discuss general safety issues such as containing genetically modified organisms and ensuring that they do not become out of our control. You can see the little videos which have been made this day following this link: LINK.  Afterwards, we had a discussion about Paris Pasteur's project and answered their Survey in order to help them with their project.
We would like to thank again all of the teams which came to our meetup, Cap Sciences for the loan of their place and for the videos. We also thank all the people who took pictures and videos this week-end and shared them with us.
Paris- Saclay
When talking with Paris-Saclay during our meetup we were very interested in their project this year which is concerned about safety. Safety in our project is not a particular problem since we are using our genetically modified organisms for production and all cells are destroyed during Curdlan purification. However, when thinking about alternatives where our bacteria would be directly applied on grapevine leaves, these safety issues are extremely important. We spent some time with them during the meetup and afterwards thinking about Safety of our project.
Oxford
The Oxford team of 2015 has generously proposed to help us to establish a short toxicology review of our Curdlan molecule. Our lab does not have the required material to do so and this would help complete our project. So we sent them a sample of our produced Curdlan so they could do tests on it.
Other collaborations
Throughout the year, we have been contacted to answer surveys and to share surveys. We answered to the best of our abilities all of the following surveys: UI-Indonesian , UCL , TEC-Monterry. When possible we gave feedback to improve their surveys. We also participated in Paris-Bettencourt's rhizi project

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," military ends. In the life sciences, risk as such already poses a difficult question as self-replicating qualities of biological systems mean that it becomes more difficult to document the exchange of various genetic material. This places the threshold to create biological weaponry at a slightly lower level considering that it becomes a challenge to trace the source of production. Moreover, as the applications of biotechnology becomes more widespread, the scale at which policy mechanisms need to hold perpetrators accountable become difficult to oversee. Furthermore, in order to acquire the skills to practice synthetic biology, one has to overcome a considerable degree of so-called tacit knowledge inherent to the scientific process. A large and heterogeneous group of specialists are required to cooperate and share their skills and experiences in order to make knowledge production possible. This experience is essential to the process because the long time that can be devoted to practice eventually lets the acquired skill be based on intuition rather than a clear set of steps that need to be taken. Such intricate relation between humans and non-humans illustrate how the practicing synthetic biology can be described as a socio-technical assemblage of knowledge production (Tucker 2011).
However, the opposite of this is also true considering that the requirement of tacit knowledge is undermined by a de-skilling trend in synthetic biology. While the former has led to the black-boxing of the scientific process to create synthetic microorganisms, increasingly, with a sufficient amount of basic skills, taking part in the advance of synthetic biology nowadays has ceased to be merely exclusive to a specific set of highly trained specialists (Tucker 2011). The reason for this is that the design and fabrication of genetic circuits is realized through the making of modularized components called BioBricks, which are designed and standardized so that they are readily available to different synthetic biologists, and applied for a particular function through the use of fairly basic tools in genetic engineering. Moreover, the provision of these BioBricks works via the centrally organized Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The resulting objective is one of more efficient, cheaper, and more predictable ways of doing the work, which ultimately benefits the synthetic biology community. Nevertheless, due to this modularity and de-skilling, non-experts can become sufficiently proficient and thus contribute to technological development as well (Mukunda et al. 2009; Tucker 2011).
The consistency that comes with the standardization of genetic parts and modules therefore brings the dual use of synthetic biology closer to being a reality. Nevertheless, creating novel pathogens remains considerably far from what is practically possible as there are still quite a few operational difficulties left to resolve before a straight line can be drawn from de"

Slide over the picture to know some useful tips to work at the lab:
1. Do your project ideas raise biosafety issues?
Every project in Synthetic Biology should be assessed in terms of biosafety. It is important to evaluate all the risks the new projects could cause. In our project we additionally discussed a lot of ethical issues before we starting working. One of them, which was highly treatedaddressed, was the problem of mutations. Organisms can change and we cannot control all these changes, that means that when we design a modified organism with a specific target and a specific purpose, one cannot rule out that it can mutate and stop working as expected.
This topic has been analyzed through several discussions carried out in Bergen (Norway), Banyuls (France), Barcelona and Valencia (Spain) after showing our fantastic short—film. This film is part of our Human Practices project (available in our Ethical issues section: https://2012.igem.org/Team:Valencia_Biocampus/Ethics )
Public and environmental safety
We work with two kinds of organisms. Escherichia coli is a gram-negative bacterium that dwells naturally in the colon of some organisms, including humans. Some strains can cause serious food poisoning in humans, but laboratory ones are harmless due to some genetic restrictions. In addition, we are using ampicillin resistance genes in our plasmid as a selectable marker for bacterial transformations. Moreover, we also have special containers for biological material for storage and disposal.
In addition, we are using Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The strains we are using are disabled outside the laboratory because of amino acid deficiency. So, they are not expected to survive outside the laboratory.
All biologically-contaminated material, including Petri dishes, broth, inoculation plasticware and others were systematically destroyed by autoclaving.
None of our designs or parts are highly hazardous to the environment since they mainly involve environment-sensing genes and fluorescent proteins."

Figure 1: Fermentation of E. coli KRX with <partinfo>BBa_K863005</partinfo> (ECOL) in an Infors Labfors Bioreactor, scale: 3 L, autoinduction medium + 60 µg/mL chloramphenicol, 37 °C, pH 7, agitation on cascade to hold pO2 at 50 %, OD600 measured every 30 minutes.
After the positive measurement of activity of ECOL we made a scale-up and fermented E. coli KRX with <partinfo>BBa_K863005</partinfo> in an Infors Labfors fermenter with a total volume of 3 L. Agitation speed, pO2 and OD600 were determined and illustrated in Figure 1. The exponential phase started after 1.5 hours of cultivation. The cell growth caused a decrease in pO2. After 2 hours of cultivation the agitation speed increased up to 629 rmp (5.9 hours) to hold the minimal pO2 level of 50 %. Then, after 4 hours there was a break in cell growth due to induction of protein expression. The maximal OD600 of 2.78 was reached after 5 hours. In comparison to E. coli KRX (OD600,max =4.86 after 8.5 hours) and to E. coli KRX with <partinfo>BBa_K863000</partinfo> (OD600,max =3.53 after 10 hours, time shift due to long lag phase) the OD600 max is lower. In the following hours, the OD600 and the agitation speed decreased and the pO2 increased, which indicates the death phase of the cells.

She was instrumental with establishing microarrays as a research tool at the University of Calgary, managing the Southern Alberta Microarray Facility for 10 years. She has been involved with teaching/mentoring in the Bachelor of Health Sciences program since 2003, primarily to develop and deliver the Honours Cell & Molecular Biology course, a core requirement in the curriculum. She has taught every offering of that course and has received numerous accolades from the Faculty and the students, most recently winning the Teaching Excellence Award for 2010-2011 from the University of Calgary Students Union. This is her first year as an iGEM Instructor and her interest in the program springs from her belief in the value of inquiry as a means to getting students engaged in the pursuit of knowledge and developing habits of becoming lifelong learners.
David Lloyd
This is my fourth year being involved in iGEM in which time I have had the opportunity to work with the Alberta team for two years as an undergraduate and now as a team advisor for Calgary for the second year. While my Masters focuses on developing new treatments for breast cancer, iGEM and synthetic biology have always been near and dear to my heart. I have many interests including Genetics, Immunology, Cell Biology, Bioinformatics, and Microbiology. In my spare time I can be found playing soccer, volleyball, or squash, as well as playing the piano, listening to music, and video games. In the future, I hope to merge my passions for Biochemistry, Cell Biology, and Synthetic Biology into an exciting career, opening up a biotechnology company around biological solutions to everyday problems. iGEM has been an amazing opportunity to gain additional skills in a variety of fields and I greatly look forward to another year in the competition!

Alongside the wet lab, significant experimental modelling has been carried out, with members of our team modelling, amongst other things, the gene expression of our secretion systems as well as the rate of diffusion of our secreted products. This represents an important companion to our wet lab work and will inform later experiments.
Policy and practice is the other main area of focus; following an interview with medical professionals, we have begun to consider the importance of fungi in the urinary tract. By contacting other experts, we have begun to formulate a strategy to target specific fungi, which will mean that our method is a more complete solution to UTIs. Science outreach is also a key element of our project. Currently, members of the team are taking part in a summer school in Oxford to promote synthetic biology to prospective applicants. We will also be raising awareness of antibiotic resistance and targeted solutions. Later in the summer, other members of the team will be giving a similar talk to high school pupils of a nearby school. As a team, we will also be taking part in the UK iGEM meet up taking place later in the month at UCL. This will be our first opportunity to discuss our project with other teams.
Our public content is also nearing completion. Our newly designed wiki is nearly complete and content will begin to appear soon. Additionally we have been producing videos of members of the team engaging the public and explaining our project. These are available on YouTube.
Until tomorrow...

WHAT'S UP? 21/07/15
With 4 weeks down and 6 to go solUTIon is making fast and exciting progress. Wet lab is a major focus with all members of the team pitching in to complete our targets. Several milestones have been reached including the successful generation of our team's new and also improved biobricks, which are ready to be shipped. Also our DNA constructs have been successfully inserted into their expression vectors ready for characterisation. Some sequences over the last few weeks have proved stubborn and as a team we have had to embrace new techniques including gradient and DMSO PCR.
Over the next few weeks, our team will begin the process of characterisation; this represents the main phase of experimenting and will provide the data we will present in Boston. Some of our early targets include testing Art175's effectiveness against P. aeruginosa, one of the target pathogens, and also the utility of DNase. These represent the main therapeutics our modified bacteria will secrete in order to destroy the biofilm.

Lethbridge,2017,Team:Lethbridge HS_-_-_TEXT.html," season to be showcased to the world.
Environmental Impact
With SynthetINK, our primary focus is a drastically reduced environmental footprint compared to modern ink pigment production. Quite possibly the worst of all inorganic pigments due to its widespread use and production methods, carbon black, is what we generally compare our own project to. Carbon black is produced using the incomplete combustion of petroleum, for which energy is produced, and the remaining matter from the burning is the pigment. This is a very important problem as this type of production has many harmful consequences, including very significant emission of greenhouse gases, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) as well a large production of VOCs (volatile organic compounds). SynthetINK will only produce cellular debris and a miniscule amount of carbon dioxide compared to that of carbon black, as we will only be using bacteria to produce our own pigment. We do this with the goal of reducing the need for pigments like carbon black, especially in a world where energy sources like petroleum are no longer the norm, which is what we are progressing towards currently.

DTU-Denmark,2014,Team:DTU-Denmark#Overview#Policy and Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," among the Danish population on whom we would have our focus. Based on our strategy, we intended to define a group of people, who already had an interest within biology or related fields. This would allow inspiration on a higher level with more advanced and interesting examples. Additionally we preferred a group that did not have heavy limitations caused by specialised knowledge on what had been seen before and what would be realistic to do now or in the near future.
Based on our aforementioned criteria we narrowed our target group to be composed of ‘students’. However, ‘students’ are still a very diverse group. As illustrated in Figure 1, students look differently on new biological topics depending on how far they are in their education and how much prior knowledge they have within their field. When a student starts in lower secondary school, he or she is generally ignorant regarding biology but is easily influenced. As the level of education increases the individuals are taught about biology and related topics. At the time a student reaches university, he or she has to chose a field of interest. Depending on this choice the student either limits or enhances his/hers possibilities to work within synthetic biology (Figure 1), making this pre-university segment of students a nice starting point for our target group.
As students holding a bachelor degree within biotechnology our minds are already limited by our knowledge about what have already been done and what is realistic. Younger students with a basic knowledge of biology are more capable of dreaming of the huge potential of synthetic biology without being restricted by these kinds of limitations. This allows for a creative mindset enabling them to come up with new applications that can broaden our horizon. They just need to be inspired - the foundation of our strategy.
Figure 1: Relevant characteristics and categorisation of potential target groups.
To reach students in upper secondary school who are able to understand the basic concepts behind synthetic biology and students with an extraordinary enthusiasm within this field, we chose to focus on elite students. The trend in the Danish society towards talent development within the educational sector has led to an increase of science camps for talented students within all scientific fields and biotechnology is no exception.
Based on the above mentioned theory and strategy, we further narrowed down our segment of interest to concerning only talented biology-oriented students currently in upper secondary school. Our vision was to plant a seed of inspiration for synthetic biology in these young people and influence their choice of future career - not by lecturing them what to do, but by inspiring and letting them make their own choice.
Specific Activities
In our outreach initiatives we have taken advantage of different talent programmes in Denmark in order to reach students from our target group, able to understand the complexity"

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#blogtest_-_-_TEXT.html," colony will receive two quorum sensing signals (QSp and QSq) from the two cells above it. These two signals trigger the production of two different integrases r and s in the colony. Integrases enable to build biological XOR logic gates by switching twice a terminator. Indeed, every integrase can switch the terminator only once. Thus if the colony produces only r or only s, the terminator is switched only once, so the terminator is OFF, and GFP and QS1 or QS2 are produced (depending on the colony). If the colony produces r and s, the terminator is switched twice, so it is ON and it blocks expression of GFP and of the quorum sensing molecule.
Rule that will be computed by all cells : an XOR gate between the signals from the 2 cells above. Biologically, integrases p and q are able to bind sites around a terminator and switch this terminator, thereby turning off the effect of the terminator and enabling gfp transcription. If p and q integrases are both present, the terminator is switched twice and comes back to its initial state, gfp is not transcribed.
We need to  :
find orthogonal quorum sensing molecules and orthogonal integrases
discuss with microfluidics experts to check if using microfluidics is possible and presents advantages in our case
find possible parts in the registry for integrases, and design plasmids

BSSE Openhouse Day
Saturday, May 10th
Sharing our iGEM and synthetic biology interest with the public
On May 10th the public in Basel had the unique chance to get an insight into many different scientific laboratories and the work done there. It was the joint open house day of D-BSSE of ETH (Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering) and the Biozentrum of the University of Basel. The many different labs opened their doors to the public and many scientists were present to give interested people some details about their daily work. So did the ETH iGEM team 2014. The team was present with a poster showing the history of iGEM, the previous ETH iGEM teams with their projects and general information about synthetic biology. Additionally there was a slideshow giving a best-of photo collection of last years jamboree. The goal of this day was to inform the public about synthetic biology in general and specifically about the spirit and the many different projects of iGEM. Many people showed strong interest in truly student driven projects and are curious to follow our team wiki for the next months.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

Figure 1. A schematic illustration of our EGFP-T2A-mCherry reporter system. (A) The ACG mutated reporter has the start codon mutated from ATG to ACG. As the second ATG codon in-frame is 78 nucleotides away, elimination of the first start codon leads to a 26 amino acid truncation of EGFP at the N-terminus. Since the minimal fluorescence region for EGFP is from amino acid 7-229 (Li et al., 1997), this truncation mutation will cause the production of non-functional EGFP protein, while mCherry is expressed normally. When our RESCUE Editor system successfully edits the C in ACG (on the mRNA) to U in the presence of gRNA, the start codon will be restored and functional EGFP is produced. As such, our dual fluorescence reporter allows for the unambiguous change from OFF (unedited) to ON (edited change), where (B) unedited cells only have mCherry fluorescence while (C) cells with successful editing events will have both green and red fluorescence. Images were taken at 60x magnification, scale bar = 50 µm.
2. Identification of GLB1, a gene mutated in patients with lysosomal storage disease and the designing of a second EGFP-GLB1 dual reporter to test the RESCUE Editor system in cells with mutated GLB1.
The second reporter design involves a GFP fusion protein linked to the human GLB1 gene. GLB1 encodes a human lysosomal acid beta-galactosidase, an enzyme that is responsible for the cleavage of terminal β-linked galactose residues from glycoproteins, sphingolipids, keratan sulfate, and other glycoconjugates. Genetic mutations in the GLB1 gene have been seen in the occurrence of autosomal recessive lysosomal storage diseases such as GM1 gangliosidosis and Morquio B disease (Suzuki et al., 2001). There are more than 130 single base mutations that have been identified in GLB1 and some of these mutations are the (T → C) base change as listed in Table 1. Hence the use of our RESCUE Editor system could potentially restore the function of GLB1 in patients with this mutation"

Module III - Isobutanol production
Overview
Isobutanol
Genetical Approach
Results
Genetical Approach
Isobutanol is an important substance for industry. No known organism can produce isobutanol or other branched-chain alcohols. Atsumi et al. presented a metabolic pathway to produce isobutanol in Escherichia coli . The pathway is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Schematic illustration of the isobutanol pathway
The shown pathway starts with pyruvate and results in isobutanol. We also start with pyruvate which is generated from 3-phosphogylcerate in the glycolysis of the cell. For this 3-phosphogylcerate is required which is generated in the Calvin cycle of the CO2 fixation in module II . The steps in the conversion of pyruvate to 2-ketoisovalerate can be executed by proteins existing in E. coli (IlvIH, IlvC and IlvD). Since E. coli also has an alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhE), the only required protein for the isobutanol production is  a ketoisovalerate decarboxylase. This protein (KivD) can be received from Lactococcus lactis . The pathway shown in Figure 1 is already an improvement of the described way. The native protein Il"

Business Students
To expose future business leaders to the strategic business opportunities provided by synthetic biology we hosted a speaker from a synthetic biology company and invited business students to attend. To create an accessible and relevant outreach program we followed the Outreach Planning Guide . An overview version of the guide can be found on the Database Page page
Find Communities
At the Mid Atlantic Meet-Up hosted by UMaryland we met CEO and founder of Spira, Elliot Roth. We were excited by how his company had taken bioengineering and turned it into a successful business. As more synthetic biology innovations are presented to businesses in the hopes of receiving funding or marketing support, it will be increasingly valuable to have business partners who understand both the science and the business opportunity presented by bioengineering. We wanted to help future business leaders on William & Mary's campus see synthetic biology as an investment and an asset. To do this, we invited either Mr. Roth or another member of Spira, the CTO and lead engineer Surjan Singh, to speak on our campus to some of our Business students.
Evaluating Interest & Understanding
We connected with our entrepreneurship center to reach out to business students who had already expressed an interest in starting their own company after graduation and we met with three business students to discuss what they would like to see in the presentation. They all shared that their interest would be more in the potential markets, the timeline for synthetic biology developments, and some of the unexpected challenges that develop when doing this kind of work.
Consider How to Connect
In addition to talking to business students, we also connected with Graham Henshaw the Executive Director of the Entrepreneurship center and Clinical Professor at the William & Mary Mason School of Business. Graham shared about the speaker series that was held in the Entrepreneurship center. The new program brought in speakers to talk specifically to students who have an interest in entrepreneurship. The presentation and Q&A style was well received by the business students. With this in mind we moved forward with plans for a formal presentation and time for Q&A time. We"

What is STEC?
Escherichia coli is part of the Enterobacteriaceae family, which includes a great diversity of Gram-negative rods and some of the most common etiologic agents of foodborne disease. Organisms of this family contain antigenic walls that allow the distinction of several serotypes within the same species. There are three types of antigens used in the classification of serotypes: O-antigens (composed by the outer lipopolysaccharide or LPS), K-antigens (capsule-forming polysaccharides), and H-antigens (flagellar proteins). The name of the serotype is given by the variant (a number) of each type of antigen next to its letter. Not all organisms contain the three types.
Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is a group of enterohemorrhagic strains of E. coli (EHEC) that are responsible for foodborne disease. The O157:H7 serotype is the most prevalent strain of STEC. 1
Why is STEC a major concern?
Globally, 1 in every 10 people is affected by foodborne diseases each year. In 2015, the WHO found that 600 million individuals were affected by such diseases and 420,000 died as a result (Figure 1).  STEC causes over 70,000 infections per year in the United States alone. A portion of these individuals will experience kidney failure after 6 days, 50% of which will require renal replacement therapy.2 Countries of low- and middle-income are the most affected due to unsafe practices of food production and storage (Figure 2).
Figure 1. WHO epidemiological data of foodborne illnesses
Figure 2. WHO prevalence map of foodborne illnesses
What is the mode of action?
Shiga toxin is an exotoxin of the AB type. The subunit B directs binding to a glycolipid that acts as a receptor in eukaryotic cells, globotriasylceramide (Gb3). Upon binding, the Shiga toxin is internalised by endocytosis. The endocytotic vacu"

On June 22nd,we had a class in Tongji primary school.
Firstly, we introduced iGEM and synthetic biology to them. Then, we briefly explained our project. We had adapted our project for a interesting story. So in this class, we showed them this story by PPT and our explanation. They were very interested about C.elegans and asked many questions about it.
After this class, these kids had more knowledges about synthetic biology and iGEM. We achieved our goal that popularizing scientific knowledge.

To anneal the two oligos, equamolar amount of each strand is mixed, incubated at 95°C and cooled slowly to room temperature.
Tn5:adapter DNA complex formation
Since this is the first time this experiment was done, the idea is to get the idea of the required amount of adapter needed in the reaction. Therefore 3 different adapter concentrations were added, namely 5µM, 25µM and 50µM. Tn5  was loaded with adapter DNA shown above by following the pipetting scheme shown on Table 2. All samples and reagents were kept on ice during preparation.

Summary
Bacterial transformation is a commonly used protocol in synthetic biology. It can be used for a variety of functions, such as testing whether or not a genetic circuit is functional. Transformation allows bacterial cells, such as Escherichia coli, to take in and express external DNA fragments. Transformation consists of heat shock to damage cells and promote the taking up of external plasmids, recovery to prevent cells from dying, and a final culturing. From there, cells are analyzed.
This microfluidic chip is designed to perform transformation. Suspended cells and plasmid are metered on the chip and are then mixed together. The solution then undergoes heat shock in a time-dependent mixing element for exactly 30 seconds. The solution can then be pipetted out from the chip into a recovery tube on ice.
This chip has been milled and tested, but not deemed fully fluid functional as of this time. For a more complete understanding of the chip, click the download button in order to access its CNC millable SVG files, JSON file, full device documentation and PNG files of its flow and control layers.

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Modeling#Hybrid_-_-_TEXT.html," The crucial   observation here is that the force is zero when the   distance between two cells is larger than   $2\cdot r_{cutoff}$. An agent therefore only actually interacts with   its nearest neighbors. Hence, the naive   implementation wastes a lot of time computing interactions   which have no effect.
To speed up calculation of cell interactions we used an   algorithm that searches only for neighbors within the cutoff   distance for every agent. Moreover, since we take the timestep   small enough so that agents do not easily move out of each other's   influence from one moment to another (see paragraph below),   it is not necessary to recompute the neighbors at every timestep.   Instead, we maintain a neighbor list for every agent which   is refreshed only every few timesteps.
There exist many different algorithms for searching   nearest neighbors and the optimal choice of algorithm   depends on the characteristics of the spatial distribution   of agents.   Since in our model cells repel each other when   they approach each other too closely, they will evolve   to a rather uniform distribution. The most appropriate   fixed-radius nearest neighbor search algorithm in that   case is the cell technique. In this algorithm, the   agents are structured by placing a rectangular grid of   cells over the domain and assigning every agent to a   cell. Determining which cell an agent belongs to   is easily done by rounding the x and y-coordinates down   to the nearest multiple of the grid spacing. In Figure 10   agent 1 and agent 2 have different coordinates but   $x \; mod \; d = x_k$ and $y \; mod \; d = y_k$ for both agents and therefore   they will be assigned to the same cell k.
Figure 13
Cell assignment. Click to enlarge.
If the   grid spacing is chosen so that interactions do not   reach further than the adjacent cells, every agent only   needs to look for neighbors in 9 cells (its own cell   plus 8 adjacent cells) instead of the entire domain, as   illustrated in Figure 12.
Figure 14
Neighbor search in adjacent cells. Click to enlarge.
Choice of Timestep
In contrast to PDE models, there is no danger of instability    due to a large timestep in agent-based models. However, since    the time step determines how far a cell can “jump” away from    its previous position, we need to ensure that it is not so    large as to negate the effect of intercellular interactions.    To understand this, we first discretize the Brownian motion term    in the agent’s equation"

SZU-China,2016,Team:SZU-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," of both of our technology, the labs of Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University have more mature methods in using Electroporation and gene gun bombardment to transform Algal chloroplast , whereas professors from College of Life Sciences and Oceanography Shenzhen University have improved glass-bead method（Expression and molecular analysis of phbB gene in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Chinese Science Bulletin 2004 Vol.49 No.16 1713-1717）. With our complementary technologies as basis, FAFU-CHINA hoped to transform different locus of algae cells using various transformation technologies to improve their results. Therefore, FAFU-CHINA sent their vectors to us so that we could transform using glass-bead method, whereas we shared our Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strains with FAFU-CHINA.
At the same time, we encountered some problems in construction of biobricks. Our antibiotics were always ineffective when we did plasmid amplification on psb1c3 and some other experiments, so the monoclonal bacteria cannot be transformed successfully. At the same time, we did not have enough psb1c3 plasmid for the coming experiments. Fortunately, FAFU-CHINA helped us in time, providing us with psb1c3 plasmid and chloromycetin. They also helped us find out the reasons of our failure. After repeated verification testing using enough experimental materials, we finally solved the problem and continued our experiment.
Collaboration with SUSTech Shenzhen
We focused mainly on the exchange of experimental materials in the collaboration with SUSTech Shenzhen. SUSTech Shenzhen encountered some problems when they did Interlab experiments, so they could not obtain a result in a short time. Their reagents were also consumed. We decided to provide them with our reagents and helped them with continuous experiments.
When our antibiotics were ineffective in doing biobrick, SUSTech Shenzhen gave us their amplified psb1c3 plasmids and chloromycetin which they were currently using. With enough materials, we did many testings, discussed possible problems and verified them one by one. Eventually we found out that our lab’s environment caused the lost of chloromycetin’s screening effect, then we solved the problem and continued to do successive experiments.

First, I have to get a specific gene to show up in the chromosome bar, and then I have to create a second chromosome bar. Tomorrow, we head to MIT, so that’ll be good to have a more formal introduction to synthetic biology.
""""Thursday:
Today, we headed to MIT for the Bio Builder workshop with Natalie Kuldell. We learned about the basics of synthetic biology as well as the motivation to study it. The last time I took biology was a couple semesters ago, so it was nice to try wetlab work again and get a feel for how synthetic biologists do their work. It was particularly helpful to note the parallels between computer science, or engineering in general, with synthetic biology. It was also nice to see what other iGEM teams have done in the wetware track in the past to understand the needs of synthetic biologists for our research. One thing I thought was interesting was that during our experiments in the wetlab, what frustrated me a little was the fact that I was simply running through the procedure without some visual reference as to what was actually going on in the cell. I understood at a high level that we were trying to turn cells different colors, but I think it would be nice to actually visualize the process rather than simply mixing together different solutions with cells. In the afternoon, we made a synthetic cell using “parts” from the MIT parts registry with the help of a computer program. It was nice to create a cell, but again, I felt as if I was simply running through the procedure without any deeper understanding of what was going wrong. I think it could also be interesting to build upon this computer program to show different combinations of parts that could work and provide an explanation as to why it works, which I believe would be more meaningful than trial and error, which is what I would have reverted to had I been working through the program; however, we are already implementing a similar design idea with Eugene DeSyne. Overall, I thought it was a good crash course to synthetic biology and I learned a lot.
Trying out synthetic biology in the wet lab
Friday:
Today, I continued my work on the chromosome bar. Bringing in the information for the genes is very complicated, as I have to bring in lots of extra code. However, I think after I fix all of the errors and import the other files from G-nome surfer, it should go more smoothly.

She felt that HAT is not the best example for a new diagnostic device, as the disease has been combated quite successfully already. However, this changed after we explained that we would like to compare our diagnostic to current methods. Since HAT is a long known disease, it is suitable for comparison.
In case of viral diseases where no distinct symptoms are present, the need of the diagnostic changes completely. In this case, it would be of more use for screening the presence and development of a disease in the population and to place positively screened individuals in quarantine. Thus, the focus is on prevention of spread rather than specific treatment of infected individuals. If the device is used in such a way, the effect of vaccination on the spread of disease can also be seen.
Dr. Pascale Ondoa emphasized that we should look more into biosafety. Moreover, we should not forget that research and development costs are high. This needs to be considered when calculating the estimated cost of our diagnostic.

Metal Sensor: czrA+arsR
Purpose and Justification
If our project is to process cadmium and not other metals, we need to genetically engineer Bacillus subtilis to carry out a set of cellular processes based on the action of metal sensors. These metal sensors will detect cadmium through a system known as AND Gating.  There are two metal sensing repressors, which are known to respond to cadmium: arsR and czrA. By placing binding sites to these two metal sensing repressors next to each other in a promoter region, the gene regulated by that promoter will be synthesized only when a combination of metals that bind to both sensors are present; this is a combinatorial approach for gene expression regulation. Plan B allow us to meet a Gold metal criteria: we would improve BBa_J33206 (ArsR) BioBrick.
Construction
1- Amplify by PCR czrA gene with its promoter and RBS region from Bacillus subtilis 168 genomic DNA. The primers will have standard BioBrick restriction sites in its dangling ends. Forward primer (primer1) with EcoI and Xbal restriction site and reverse primer (primer2) with SpeI. - the region to be amplified: 500bp upstream the start codon + czrA CDS 321bp + terminator sequence.
2- Cut BioBrick part BBa_J33206 (ArsR) with EcoRI and Xbal and the amplified czrA gene with EcoRI and SpeI
3- Ligation - BBa_J33206 (ArsR) + czrA gene
4- Amplify by PCR the product with primer 3 and 4. Primer 3 is the forward"

The WORST gel electrophoresis
As all the teams are working on synthetic biology, gel electrophoresis is necessary for every team member because it         is an important way to judge whether the result is good enough. When our team was searching for collaborations, we         found the “Worst Gel Electrophresis Scrapbook” hosted by team UNebraska-Lincoln. It is an activity that collects         the worst gel electrophoresis images and make them a scrapbook. We also want to compete for the first winner(of course         we want the badge). Here are the images we picked:
Figure 1.This is a picture for plasmid extraction on August 18th. I had successfully transformed standardized         plasmids into Escherichia coli cells but the culture media was polluted by yeasts. So as you can see, there’s almost         no plasmid DNA in this piece of agarose gel. The only two bright strips are not the right size.
Figure 2.Always feel that the system of 50ul cut 1ug plasmids and then recover a lot of gel is very troublesome.         One day, I determined to do a big move, so I added 3ug plasmid to a system, I thought enzymes may not be enough,         and I believe more enzyme will contribute to more completely cut, so I added the enzyme of 4μl. Expectant preparation,         see a blurred strip only to know that the original enzyme overuse will lead to star reaction.
Figure 3.We want to connect two DNA fragments together by overlapping. When we completed all the procedures,         had one of our DNA gel electrophoresis run, when we irradiated our nucleic acid gel with ultraviolet rays, we unfortunately         found that our The strips are arranged evenly in the arithmetic progression, which really makes me laugh and makes         me sad.
Neighbor is the best
Firstly, there are two teams in Tianjin University, TJU_China and Tianjin. For the world wide competition, it is incredible         that two teams are in the same university. So, how can we miss the opportunity of collaborating with each other?!
There are too many biobricks this"
Goettingen,2018,Team:Goettingen#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," ml of buffer Elution Buffer (or sterile HPLC-H2O) that has been pre-warmed to 70°C and incubate the column for 3 min at room temperature. Collect the DNA by centrifugation for 1 min at 8,000 rpm.
To increase the amount of chromosomal DNA, you may add a second time your first elution to the column or add again 50 µl Elution Buffer or water and centrifuge again for 1 min at full speed.
Isolation of plasmid DNA from B. subtilis
The cell wall of the Gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis cannot be disrupted as easy as that of a Gram-negative bacterium like E. coli . Therefore, lysozyme has to be added to the re-suspension buffer A1. Lysozyme is a glycoside hydrolase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1,4-b-linkages between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in the peptidoglycan.
The Material
Liquid LB medium
NucleoSpin® plasmid kit, Macherey & Nagel
Buffer A1 supplemented with 3 mg/ml lysozyme
The Procedure
Use a single colony from your B. subtilis plate to inoculate 4 ml LB liquid medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic and grow the culture over night at 37°C with agitation.
Collect the cells from 2 ml of the overnight cultures by centrifugation for 1 min at 13,000 rpm. Re-suspend the pellet in 250 µl of buffer A1 with lysozyme und incubate for 15 min at 37°C. Add 250 ml of buffer A2, mix gently 6 – 8 times and incubate the suspension for 5 min at room temperature.
Add 300 ml of buffer A3, mix gently 6 – 8 times and centrifuge the lysate for 10 min at 13,000 rpm.
Transfer the supernatant into a NucleoSpin® plasmid column, centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and discard the flow-through.
Add 500 ml buffer AW pre-heated to 50°C to the column, centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and discard the flow-through.
Add 600 ml of buffer A4, centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and discard the flow- through.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Team_-_-_TEXT.html,". Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

The construction plasmid backbone is a linear piece of DNA. It has a few bases beyond the EcoRI and PstI restriction sites. It is cut with EcoRI and PstI.
All 3 restriction digests are heated to heat kill all of the restriction enzymes.
An equimolar quantity of all 3 restriction digest products are combined in a ligation reaction.
The desired result is the left part 's SpeI overhang ligated with the right part's XbaI overhang resulting in a mixed site that cannot be cut with any of our enzymes.
The new composite part is ligated into the construction plasmid backbone at the EcoRI and PstI sites.
When the ligation result is transformed into cells and grown on plates with antibiotic C, only colonies with the correct construction(*) survive.
Materials
Two parts in BioBricks format to be assembled.  The parts are in a plasmid or they can be generated via PCR.
A construction vector that has a different resistance marker from either of two parts.
These construction backbones are available from the Registry.

Utrecht,2018,Team:Utrecht#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," chemotaxis pathway
The implementation phase of our project involved the modification of a bacterial chemotaxis pathway at three points, in order to meet the 5 requirements outlined in the design phase.
Measuring pathway activity. The activity of the chemotaxis pathway serves as a proxy for the concentration of a contaminant in water. To measure this activity, we developed a sensor based on the principle of Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET). Two proteins in the chemotaxis pathway either bind or unbind depending on the presence of ligand, and we measure this binding/unbinding as a change in the color of visible light emitted by the bacteria.
Detecting diverse ligands. In order to detect a range of ligands, DeTaXion will ultimately make use of ligand binding domains from different surface receptors. Modification of the ligand specificity of these domains are based on prediction using binding-affinity prediction software such as Haddock. Within the scope of this project however, we test the possibility of swapping ligand binding domains between different receptors.
Fine-tuning pathway activity. In order to be able to measure a broad range of contaminant concentrations, we make use of an inherent feature of the chemotaxis pathway. Methylation on four different sites of the receptor alters the activity of the pathway at a given ligand concentration. By mimicking these methylations, we can alter the sensitivity of our system to a particular ligand, broadening the dynamic range of detection.
To create a biosensor meeting all five listed requirements, the E. coli chemotaxis pathway was customized using a three step approach. First, we developed a sensor based on the principle of Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET). BRET provides a clear and easily measurable detection signal (requirement II and IV). Next, we tested the effectiveness of swapping ligand binding domains with the one of the chemotaxis receptors, the Tar receptor. This enables the possibility to detect diverse ligands (requirement III). The last step of the approach facilitates accurate detection at different concentrations (requirement I). We accomplished this by mimicking receptor methylation, which alters the sensitivity of the chemotaxis pathway.
Figure 2: BRET-pair activity. A) When CheZ and CheY do not interact, the distance between Luciferase and eYFP is too large for Luciferase to excite eYFP. As a consequence, only Luciferase emits light. B) Upon interaction of CheZ and CheY, Luciferase and eYFP are in close proximity. eYFP is excited by photons"

Collaboration with iGEM Team Michigan
The Michigan iGEM Team shares the fascination for the use of aptamers in synthetic biology. Their aim is to develop an aptamer based detection system for pathogen related proteins. To create a robust test strip, they implemented their sensor in a cell free expression system using a different approach for riboswitch design. The actual aptamer sensing the substances is a small DNA oligonucleotide which is bound to a trigger DNA oligo. On binding of the aptamer, the trigger is released and turns on a RNA toehold switch leading to the reporter expression. To further extend their system, they asked us for the development of new aptamer sequences to be implemented in their sensor system. We therefore worked on the computational creation of aptamer candidates for proteins and small molecules with our software that might be implemented into their system. Furthermore we discussed ways to implement new aptamers in their existing system. In this process we assessed whether the use of our JAWS software may enable them to fuse a variety of aptamers to a single toehold switch construct. In this process we sketched a potential way for switching larger toeholds with very small aptamers.
To be more precise, we included several of the kanamycin aptamers which we validated in our project work into the toehold switch they intended to use. The figure shows the two states of the toehold switch for one candidate we designed. On the left-hand side, the state with no kanamycin bound is depicted. The toehold-switch is inactive as the Ribosome Binding Site (RBS"

BIOSAFETY & BIOSECURITY TRAINING AT IHVCB UI
Institute of Human Virology and Cancer Biology (IHVCB), Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia is one of the best research centers in Indonesia. IHVCB accommodates research activities focused on the agents that cause diseases such as virus and cancer in humans. In addition, IHVCB also train and provide opportunities for students to conduct research. Other activities that are also conducted by IHVCB, which supports research and education purposes, is training, seminars and others.
iGEM University of Indonesia 2018 attend a series of Biosafety & Biosecurity training at IHVCB to enhance our knowledge in biomedical laboratory techniques, including basic safety and safety requirements to prepare. Such knowledge will surely produce accurate and non-harmful results for the surrounding environment in our researches at the laboratory. Researches with biological agents, proper use of chemicals, as well as good laboratory techniques require studies in the safety aspects of biological materials.
On the first day of the training, iGEM UI 2018 team obtained lessons on Biosafety, Biosecurity, Code of Conduct and Dual Use Research. This will deepen our knowledge of techniques and equipment to protect ourselves, also the environment from exposure to biological agents; potentially causes illness, mitigation action, and misuse of a pathogen or toxin into the environment. In addition, iGEM UI 2018 also study microbiology techniques including biological hazards.
On the second day, we received material on bio-risk management, risk assessment and good laboratory practice. Through this lesson, the team correctly following the steps in doing research at the laboratory; reducing the risk of accidents that may occur. Such steps are, but not limited to, using the right clothes in the laboratory, the correct way of sampling and the proper procedure of sharps and harmful substances disposal.
On the third day, iGEM UI 2018 studied a variety of techniques that could support research such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR); it is a method to multiply or replicate large amounts of DNA in a short time. The DNA recombinant technique is a technique for combining or recombining two or more strands of DNA thread that in normal circumstances not pairing or occurring together. In addition, iGEM UI 2018 also study the techniques of serology, cell culture, etc.
On the last day, iGEM UI 2018 received a lesson on emergency response, which is useful to know the effective response to emergency situations; minimizing the effects of emergency situations. In the last day, the team"

Today when I was talking to Thien about Kepler we were talking about a general functional API for Clotho. He is going to need it so that Kepler actors can make use of functions in Clotho. It got me to thinking that I should just post this list. It will continue to grow. However, now everyone can see it. This will be of use for the plug-in team as well.

Today I met with Adam and Lesia and it quickly became apparent that I need to learn how to use ANTLR and look at their Eugene code. So, I spent about an hour playing around with it. Here are my comments:
In both the lexer rules and the parser token lists you are going to need to add: &, |, <,>, <=,>=, etc for the rule enforcement. You might want to go ahead and add other keyboard elements just to ""future proof"" things a little.
There need to be more comments in the code

UCAS
UCAS worked on degrading antibiotics which also focused on the solution of antibiotic resistant crisisis. One member of UCAS visited our university and we discussed hotly. The peptide they used to degrade to antibiotics, the hardware they produced to clean the drainage, the siRNA we used to knock out the gene and so on were all discussed. We learned much from each other.
EPFL
EPFL established a website where many teams shared their project description. XMU-China sent a project description to EPFL and accepted an interview through skype. During the interview, we answered their questions about project, team, impressions of iGEM, our city and so on. We both benefited a lot from the interview, on which we could have a better understanding of each other, not only on the project but also on our life.
TecCEM
We both try to kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria so we succeeded in helding a skype meeting although the time difference made the meeting a little difficult. They gave us some propositions about modeling and we helped them to take the human practice further.
Webinar
Accepted an invitation from the salt school, we attended the iGEM team iGEM's 1st official webinar which was delivered by William_and_Mary , the 2015 champion team. Two members shared the tips and tricks of synthetic biology outreach which elicited some positive effect to our human practice.

LASnlator
This part, made of two composite Biobrick, provides the continuous presence of LasR.
This trans-activator is ready to bind OC8 AHL and then it positively regulates the transcription of both the cellobiosidase and LasI, the OC8 AHL synthase present on the same plasmid.
Generation of: Constitutive Promoter - RBS - LasR - Terminator To build this plasmid we used the following parts:
    -  Constitutive Promoter BBa_J23100 - 35 bp
    -  RBS BBa_B0034 - 12 bp
    -  Las R (coding region) BBa_C0179 - 723 bp
    -  Terminator BBa_B0015 - 129 bp
These BioBricks transformed into DH5α, as suggested by the iGEM protocol. BBa_C0179 was digested with EcoRI/SpeI in order to isolate the LasR. BBa_B0015 was linearized with an EcoRI/XbaI-digestion and LasR was ligated ahead of the terminator. The ligated product was than transformed into DH5α and seeded in the presence of the appropriate antibiotic. The growing colonies were tested with a colony PCR (Vf-Vr2 primers), following this protocol: 93°  5' | 30x (95° 30"" | 50° 30"" |72° 60'') | 72° 7'| 4° ∞ The positives, highlighted through electrophoresis, have been expanded and the plasmid extracted.
The same steps were followed to verify the ligation of  LasR-Terminator (XbaI/PstI digested) downstream the RBS (BBa_B0034). The positive colonies were extracted and the plasmids have been digested with XbaI/PstI. The RBS-LasR-Terminator fragments were inserted in the plasmid BBa_J23119 at first but, as seen with other constructs, this promoter didn't work as expected. So, finally we ligated them inside a different promoter, BBa_J23100, previously digested with SpeI/PstI in order to eliminate the RFP reporter and linearize the backbone. As always, the ligation product was tested"
