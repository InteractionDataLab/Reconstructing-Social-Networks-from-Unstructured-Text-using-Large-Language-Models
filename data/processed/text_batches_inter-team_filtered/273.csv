Sydney_Australia,2017,Team:Sydney Australia#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," insulin from cells or media.
We considered two methods for the purification of our insulins: nickel columns, and nickel agarose resin. The nickel column method is simpler, as insulin can be purified in a single step, yet it is more expensive. On the other hand, the nickel agarose resin method involves more steps but is more cost-effective.
An additional factor in the purification of our insulins is the need to remove the 6x His sequence and the expression tags from the insulin. We designed our Winsulin constructs so that both could be cleaved off in a single step by TEV protease. Our Proinsulin constructs take this further - in a single step using the protease trypsin, the His-tag, expression tag and C chain are removed, simultaneously removing the tags and allowing the proinsulin to fold into active insulin.
Figure 8. Schematic demonstrating the purification methods
In the nickel column method, the protease step also releases the insulin from the nickel column for collection. However, it also reduces the amount of insulin released from the nickel column. Taking this into consideration, along with the increased expense of the nickel column method, our team decided to use the nickel agarose resin method for insulin purification.
Assays
ELISA Assay
As an initial test to determine protein folding and accurately quantify expression yield, we will be using an ELISA. This test uses antibodies that bind to the folded structure of insulin with extremely high specificity. In this regard, it gives an initial indication as to whether the protein is in a conformation that could potentially bind to the insulin receptor. Additionally, the antibodies are tagged with fluorescent protein, so the relative fluorescence will correlate to the amount of insulin in the sample, also with great accuracy.
Figure 9. Schematic for ELISA insulin assay
Glucose Uptake Assay
Following the ELISA, we will test the function of our expressed recombinant Winsulin, and Proinsulin (with trypsin removal of the C-peptide) using an in vitro glucose uptake assay. Here, we measure the changes in glycogen synthesis and glucose oxidation in response to activation of the insulin receptor in cell cultures. C14 radioalabelled glucose will be taken up into the cell at a faster rate upon stimulation and result in incorporation of the carbon into glycogen and CO2, which is measured by a scintillation counter. This assay is a great alternative to an in vivo assay that uses involves assessing the convulsions of mice in response to injections of increasing concentrations of insulin.

Daniel C.:
It sounds like you are really doing some progress. It is better than I think in Ethiopia, because they really have problems.
David Chinyanya:
The problem that is in Ethiopia is that the prevalence rate in Ethiopia is very high. Other districts it is up to 45 % TF. So they need to treat for five years. And migration in Ethiopia is very big. And if I recall the instability as well of other communities because of their ethics, something like that. Which is not here in Malawi.
Daniel C.:
And they are treating, but itˋs not really regressing.
David Chinyanya:
No. According to the information that we have got. But I have not gone there yet to see if what they are saying is true. But in Malawi, this is where we are.
Daniel C.:
What exactly are we doing in the village now?
David Chinyanya:
Now the ITI (International Trachoma Initiative), the Chief executive Paul Wilson will come here after next week. Just to see how we are doing the self survey. Because of the progress Malawi has reported. Because even the mass drug administration, the lowest that we have reported is 90%. The reason is, we use the head of surveillance assistance, who are government employed people. They are in the community. The doctors in the community there, they know the people, they have the trust of the people. So when we are doing the mass drug administration, if someone has not taken the drug the head of surveillance already knows, that that particular patient on that corner didn´t take the drug, so they go back. So initial when we did the mass drug administration, we got less than 80 %. We are going to the mop up now these are the people that help in the mopping up of the people that didnˋt take the drug. So our coming here is the report that we have got as a country. Thatˋs why ITI would like to come and see. So if they come, they don’t want to see the whole SAFE strategy. So they are coming over here just to see the eyes of the community. That we have this high powered delegation people just to see what we are doing. There is not much that we are going to improve in what we are doing, because we are already doing that.

Design of the pathway performed by Stockholm iGEM team
University of Freiburg
In the context of developing novel technologies for diseases diagnostics, we contacted Freiburg iGEM team who are developing a DNA Microarray to screen for several different diseases at the same time. Their project is based on the coating of a nickel surface with a certain disease antigen and the binding to the antibodies of a patient’s serum. In our collaboration, we have sent the team in Freiburg His-tagged HER-2 affibody molecules, a strong molecular binder for the breast cancer antigen. This will allow to screen directly for currently present antigens in the patient as the indirect detection via serum antibodies can also give false positive results due to old infections.
ETH Zürich
The project of ETH Zürich is in the field of cancer cell detection. Apart from several fruitful Skype conversations in which both groups have been helping each other with advice and reflections, we have also established a scientific collaboration. We characterized six of Zürich's biobricks which are different lactate sensing circuits. We tested the circuit with pure lactate and looked at their GFP production in response to increasing lactate concentrations (0.125-160 mM). In return, the iGEM Group ETH Zürich offered to investigate on binding capacity of our BAR expressing TOP10 strains to HER-2 expressing cancer cells (SK-BR-3). The attached E.Coli were also expressing genomic GFP. Hence, using confocal fluorescence microscopy, they tried to image BAR-expressing cells at the outside of HER-2 cells.
Testing our three BAR expressing constructs (BAR1 (BBa_K17009), BAR2 (BBa_K1766010) and BAR3 (BBa_K1766011)) for their binding capacity towards HER-2 expressing breast cancer cells. BAR expression was initiated by ITPG induction.
In their attempt to visualize BAR expressing bacteria attached at the surface of SK-BR-3 cells, they tried to co-transform our bacteria with a plasmid expressing continuously GFP. However, this unfortunately failed. Even transforming E.Coli, which are stably expressing GFP with our BAR-containing plasmid seem to be ineffective. The iGEM Team ETH Zurich visualized the HER-2 expressing cells together with IPTG induced or non-induced bacteria. The results obtained due to inefficient contrast of bacteria and background remained elusive (see figure above). We hope that the increased presence of IPTG-induced bacteria in comparison to non-induced bacteria might be a sign for an increased retain"

Campus Lectures
We wanted to let more and more people know about Synthetic Biology and iGEM. Since students are a curious group with a strong thirst for knowledge, so we went to Tieling Middle School and gave some talks on campus to students of different ages on the topic.
At the end of the talk we had time for some Q&A, and the students and their teachers asked a lot and shared their dreams with us.
We also surveyed them in order to know what they are interested in, and what is the best way for them to learn more about Synthetic Biology.
FabLab & Tongji_China
The FabLab Shanghai’s movement is closely aligned with the DIY and open source hardware movement, and shares philosophy as well as technology with them.
S.T.E.A.M Education
We get established a long-term friendly relation of cooperation with the Shanghai FabLab, and we worked together on the BioBuildLab. We are now preparing a kit for STEAM Education with a simple and practical bio-toolbox and APP. We are thankful to Fablab Shanghai, which helped us with the industrial mapping and making the instruments.
We are developing an open source biological instrument which is low cost and much easier to operate. It may let more people do an experiment without being limited by the experimental environment or professional knowledge. The toolbox is in the making and is aimed at children, so it will be presented to primary schools and middle schools. The toolbox has been designed well and will enter the trial soon.
Designing the toolbox
Laser Cutting
In order to give a better user experience, we introduced our project and toolbox to students from the School of Design and got a lot advice on the user experience and possible new applications.
At the School of Design
S.T.E.A.M education is very popular among students and parents, and many S.T.E.A.M education schools have been established. But we find that there are not many Biology classes in China, and they are also scarce around the world, so we want to design a Biology class firstly in China to let Synthetic Biology be known by more community members.

Membrane fusion: Main
Main | Fusion | Our strategy | Construction
This part of the project was focus on a precise point
The fusion between the OMVs and the targeted bacteria.
We have planned to explore three different method :
With the Jun/Fos dimere: Jun and Fos are able to form an heterodimer which has a high stability and Jun can dimerize with another Jun (thanks to their leucine zipper motif). After mutations into the leucine zipper motif of Jun (that allow the Jun/Fos dimerization but avoid the Jun/Jun homodimer formation), we wanted to fuse it to AIDA (an ABC transporter) to send them to the extern membrane of bacteria.
With G3P : The viral protein known as G3P is naturally exposed at the surface of the filamentous bacteriophage which enable it to get in the bacteria. The M13 phage has a high affinity for E.coli, and if we could place its G3p on the surface of the vesicles it could activate the fusion with the Outer membrane of the targeted bacteria.
In order to target the G3P at the surface of of the vesicles, we fuse it to the OmpA- Linker protein (created by the Warsaw team)
With the SNARE system: Intracellular membrane fusion in eukaryotes requires SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment protein receptor) proteins that form complexes bridging the two membranes. To allow this fusion, the perfect conformation of all protein that composed the SNARE complex"

The Future Plan
We strongly hope to popularize and transform our achievements in lab, and benefit more fish farmers in China and even the world. In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.

Collaboration With AiJu
As one of the most successful social enterprise in China, AiJu offered great guidance to our team during the development of 1kg Bio-Box.At the first meeting, we primarily talked about the topic of the box, whether it should be biobricks, experiments, or others. Eventually, considering the limited chemistry and biology knowledge of our potensial user, we put our focus on biobricks, the base and one of the key concepts of synthetic biology, which is comparitively easy to understand and can also provide a peek of synthetic biology. Afterwards, we began to draw the outline of the box's design and divided our team into two groups, one focusing on the hardware part of the box while the other designing the contexts, games, and rules. The next time we met with AiJu aimed at improving the draft of the box from the perspective of professional education tool kit developers. We learnt a lot from the suggestion from AiJu about the essence of innovative education and how to make your product understandable by comics, figures, analogies and so on.

At the beginning of the meetup, all the participants get to know each other by ice-breaking self introductions and form an initial impression on each team's projects.
The second part of the meetup consist of presentations of projects from all the participating teams. During the presentation, all the teams showed great passion and commitment in their projects. Particularly, our team not only learnt a lot more about advanced technology but got a lot of inspiration from other projects as well.
After presentation, all the participants are divided into groups to held a world cafe section on the relationship of software, experiment.

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," transformation started using the heat-shock protocol (2). The result was plated in different petri dishes as explained below:
For the transformation, two types of cells were tested; diluted (black dotted) and non-diluted (no dot). After the incubation, we have plated the cells. However, we did not have any control strains (only pUC19). Petri dishes were left at room temperature (21ºC) during the weekend.
22/06/2015
We checked the plates made on 19/06/2015. The growth on the pUC19 control plate confirms the efficiency of the transformation protocol. Furthermore, it was clear that the cells are transformation-competent.
The lack of colonies in the LB+CAM plates is a consequence of a mismatch between the screening antibiotic used (CAM) and the actual antibiotic resistance present in the plasmids J23101, J23106 and J23117. The antibiotic resistance on the plasmids is AMP not CAM. Consequently, we have carried out new experiments using ampicillin (AMP) plates later.
In the plate with LB and CAM, using the cells transformed with the GFP marker plasmid (I13504), we couldn’t see any colonies early in the morning (probably because we kept the plates at room temperature). However, after incubation at 37ºC during the day, some colonies grew enough to be noticed, meaning a good transformation with the mentioned plasmid.
23/06/2015
As we described on 22/06/2015, we performed another transformation (2) for J523101, J523106, J523117 and I13522. We also picked colonies from the I13504 plate, which we inoculated in 5mL of LB and put at 37ºC and 200 rpm
24/06/2015
We performed plasmid isolation of the inoculated I13504 colonies. In order to do this, the Promega miniprep unit was used. The procedure of the kit can be found online (4) We stored the obtained plasmid solution at - 20°C (30 µl).
PCR of I13504 primer, PCR protocol (5) was used for this procedure. To check the PCR reaction, an agarose gel (6) was made. The PCR product should be at the level of 2.7 KB.

Every group of bacteriocins that had a divergence time of 0.17 or less between one another was “clustered” into a clade/group. There were 17 total clades, with four clades between 0.08 and 0.17 divergence times, and the other thirteen having values of 0.03 or less. By reviewing past literature for bacteriocins within each clade, each clade was then determined to be either functionally similar (green), not functionally similar (red), or undetermined due to knowledge or time constraints (grey). The circles on the right hand side of the figure above correspond to this result, as well as the pie chart in the next section. The blue circles are the clades that will make up the very last figure on the bottom of this page.
Results: Analysis of Clades
Nearly half of all 17 clades show some similarity in function (8 clades, 47%), and seven out of eight of these clades had a divergence time less than or equal to 0.04. Although these clades are arbitrarily defined, this suggests a correlation between sequence homology and protein function for some bacteriocins, and especially those within class I, class IIa, and class IId.
In order to find the bacteriocin that best suites lacticin Z for hybridization, we used a process of elimination method. For obvious reasons, clades determined to have no similarities in function (6 clades, 35%) and clades with not enough information (3 clades, 18%) was ruled out. Out of the remaining 8 “green” clades that are similar in function, clade 1 and clade 4 consist of mostly enterocins and pediocins from class IId (note: the numbers refer to the numbers inside the green circle in the above tree). These bacteriocins were ruled out because of their large divergence time and difference in protein sequence from lacticin Z, which is in clade 15.
Clade 10 consists of class I bacteriocins mainly from the nisin, nso, and nsu families. This clade was ruled out because, as mentioned previously, class I bacteriocins undergo post-translational modification, which would complicate hybridization due to the cleavage of peptide bonds.
The remaining clades (12, 13, 14, and 15) are all from class IId bacteriocins"

We will be contacting lab technicians at Schulich School of Engineering that work with Arduino to arrange the meeting to discuss the problems with our set up. Our C++ program that outputs the colour of the sample is working with no difficulties, but we will need to integrate it into the code for Arduino, so that our system can do all of the necessary calculations.  We have been looking into Arduino code to find out what changes we need to make to our current C++ code to make it run on Arduino. We will also able to connect the LCD display to Arduino and make the display show “Hello World!”. As of now, all of the components of our future circuit are working (the components include the colour sensor, temperature sensor, and the LCD sensor with connections to Arduino), but certain improvements are required to ensure our system consistently works.
The next step includes exploring the LCD code and figuring out how to make it output more complex messages. Then we will start on putting all components together in one circuit. This week we also met with a microfluidics expert to get his insight on our idea to use microfluidics in device’s design. He suggested we use microtubules in our design rather than considering a complicated microfluidics set up. A syringe or some form of pressure or excitation can be used to pump the liquid across the device. We have come up with a basic outline of how we see our device’s design. The best material suggested for the tubing is Teflon. We are looking into getting necessary supplies for building the prototype for testing. The Mechanical Engineering Machine Shop at Schulich School of Engineering will be helping us to build a prototype. There will be a simplified design for the testing purposes - the syringe will be taken off to get all of the necessary components into the device and put back together. Since the tests are taking place in the lab, there are less concerns about contamination.The results received from a plate reader experiment do not meet the expectations - it appears that few cells grew over the night. After some discussion, it was decided to repeat the experiment next week. This week we also started preparing a 20 minute presentation for the rest of the team on what the engineering subgroup has achieved so far. This presentation will also be a good practice for the presentation at Giant Jamboree.
Week 12: July 21st - July 25th
This week we started testing the sensor using printed colour strips that are located together similar to how we see it in our device.  We also tested to compare white background vs black background. However, the main purpose of these test was"

New Standard
Bio-Builder: Can we build it? Yes We Can!
Throughout this project, we had many genetic constructs to build, including: the alpha system, the beta system, the RNA splint, and testing Toggle Switches in order to optimize the beta system. As you may know, building these circuits is not easy: it requires a lot of lab-work, and has a high rate of failure, in addition to the fact that each reaction requires a different method, and individual planning.
To solve these problems, we designed a new standard for the iGEM community, which will allow teams to construct many different parts, using only a small set of almost identical Gibson reactions which we have shown to have a 94% success rate over the construction of 21 gates. In addition, because these reactions have been standardized, they are compatible with high-throughput methodologies. Finally, we implemented a simple method for making existing parts fit our standard.
The Standard
Our standard is based upon a set of Gibson Addresses – ""barcodes"" which we have strategically placed along the genetic sequence, between the different promoters and genes. It is possible to use these barcodes (which have been optimized for PCR and Gibson reactions), to amplify pieces of DNA by PCR, and combine them using Gibson reactions. There are two types of parts in our standard:
How to build a circuit
This allows us to construct any one of the following constructs:
                
                
Where P is any promoter in our system, G1 is any gene of class 1, and G2 is any gene of class 2. To see how we build any one of the constructs click on its image. *Figure*
In addition, it is quite simple to convert genes into our standard:
Just PCR the desired gene with barcoded primers and then Gibson with any other construct
In addition to designing a standardized methodology, we also optimized the sequences of our barcodes for PCRs and for Gibson Reactions. This is evident from the success rate.
Overall, using our new method, we have successfully built 21 genetic gates (of which 12 were bio-bricked), and only 1 reaction failed along the way, giving us a success rate of 94"

Washington University in Saint Louis has a history of volunteer activities at The Youth Learning Center (YLC) in the Central West End in Saint Louis. Many WashU students function as volunteer mentors, tutors, or assistants at the YLC. This year's WashU iGEM team will be traveling to the YLC to give a demonstration, lesson, experiment, and survey to a group of 6th through 8th graders.  We will end with a survey to gain knowledge of the kids' interest in the study of the sciences, how informative they found our presentation, and how it can be improved in their eyes.

UV-Vis determination of beta-carotene and retinal production
Both beta-carotene and retinal have unique and characteristic spectres when studied by UV-vis spectrometry. The spectra can be obtained by harvesting beta-carotene- and retinal-producing cells, re-suspending them in acetone and lysing them, which we chose to do by sonication. Afterwards, the cell debris can be pelleted and the supernatant can be examinated.
The acetone suspension of beta-carotene and retinal can then be subjected to spectrophotometry, and the obtained values and spectra can be compared to those of pure beta-carotene or retinal in known concentrations. This method provides both a qualitative answer to whether or not the desired compound is present and a qualitative indication of the concentration in the cells.
In this experiment cells were prepared and harvested according to protocol EX1.1 . This experiment was performed with six different strains of E. coli:
Wild type TOP10
Wild type MG1655
TOP10-pSB1A2-K274210
MG1655-pSB1A2-K274210
TOP10-pSB1A2-K274210/pSB1C3-K343005 (double transformants)
MG1655-pSB1A2-K274210/pSB1C3-K343005 (double transformants)
Both K343005 and K274210 were constitutively expressed.
Since the first experiment showed no or small amounts of product in cells grown to exponential phase the measurements were performed on cells incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees Celcius. The graphs obtained from the experiment are presented below:

Overview
As an international competition, every year iGEM welcomes teams from a great range of countries, with a variety of languages spoken amongst its teams and judges. This part of our Policy & Practices seeks to understand the effect of English as the lingua franca of science on the participation and outcome of the competition. In order to achieve this we have looked into the different nationalities of the teams and finalists and the different lingual backgrounds of teams and finalists over the years. We derived our conclusions by comparing this data with factors such as academic output and impact of their countries of origins, the lingual background of the iGEM judges, the international rankings of their universities and the English Proficiency Index of their countries of origin.
Key Findings
The majority of iGEM finalists come from either English speaking countries or countries with high English Proficiency Index.
China is the country with the highest increase in participation over the last five years and is now second in participation only to the US.
Around 40% of the judges in championships can speak at least 1 more language other than English. Those languages are usually French and Mandarin.
The same percentage in the non-English speaking teams is now 64% and has risen by 10% in the last 5 years.

""A protocol for the production of recombinant spider silk-like proteins for artificial fiber spinning."" Nature Protocols 4(3): 341-355. .
In relation to using the recombinant silk for wound healing, it could also be interesting to prepare a three dimensional scaffold of the silk. Here a number of methods, such as salt leaching, gas forming or freeze-drying, have been reported to generate porous three-dimensional matrices. Aqueous-derived silk ﬁbroin scaffolds can be prepared by adding 4 g of granular NaCl (particle size; 300–1180 mm) into 2 ml of an aqueous solution of silk (4–10 wt%) in disk-shaped containers. The container will be covered and left at room temperature for 24 hours. Hereafter the container will be immersed in cold water and then the NaCl will be extracted for 2 days. At last the porous silk scaffolds will be air-dried and then placed in a vacuum-dryer for 24 hours. The morphological and functional properties of the scaffold can be controlled by adjusting the concentration of silk ﬁbroin in water, and the particle size of the granular NaCl Nazarov, R., et al.

The gene comW (SP0018) was found to be       regulated by the quorum-sensing system and is required for a high-level of competence (Luo, Li, and Morrison, 2004). Coexpression of ComW with σx restores the accumulation of σx and the expression of late genes as ComW contributes to the stabilization of the alternative sigma factor X against proteolysis by ClpXP and is required for full activity of σx in directing transcription of late competence genes (Piotrowski, Luo, and Morrison, 2009).
Based on these findings, we tried to integrate this ComW into the mechanism to see whether and how the presence of ComW affects σx. We firstly cloned out the comX gene expressing σx, and comW genes from the genomic DNA of S. pneumoniae NCTC 7465 strain. We then used BBa_K880005 (consisting of constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 and strong RBS BBa_B0034 ) from the BioBricks to express those genes.

Temperature Tests
To further understand the growth properties of the mycelium and predict its growth patterns in different environments (namely the Martian surface), temperature tests were conducted. Based on already existing literature on mycelium, it has been suggested that optimal temperature conditions range from 23°C to 30°C. With this in mind, the growth rate of mycelium at the following temperatures were measured: 4°C, 23°C, 30°C, and 37°C. The surface area of each plate of mycelium in each temperature condition measured each day over the course of 20 days. Three plates of mycelium growing on PDYA were all plated on the same day and put at each temperature condition (totaling to 12 plates of mycelium growing simultaneously at different temperature conditions).
Growing Mycelia in Molds
We grew our mycelium products using a procedure we developed and standardized through running of a variety of different experiments and conducting preliminary research with DIY (Do-It-Yourself) mycelium growth kits that are sold by Ecovative on their site[4]. The kits we purchased were aspen, hemp, and kenaf.
Our procedure began with the preparation of the substrates for inoculation with mycelium. To begin, we ground the substrate into a loose particles (if it did not come in that form). We then sterilized the substrate and any containers we planned to use with the autoclave.
After the autoclave process was complete we moved the substrate, the containers, sterilized scalpels, Whirlpack bags which are supplied sterile and sealed,, and petri dishes of mycelium under the laminar flow hood. We then divided the substrate among the Whirlpack bags. We then sealed the bags and removed them out from under the hood. After removal we weighed the mass of the bags and recorded it on the front of the bag. After re-sterilizing with ethanol, the bags were placed back under the laminar flow hood. We then calculated and added a specific amount of PDY (Potato-dextrose-yeast) to the each of the bags containing the substrates (this was done to provide the mycelium with an easy substrate to break down--in the case of Ecovative they used regular flour). We experimented with different ratios between weight and PDY to find the best amount to add--while we were unable to generate a specific ratio by the"

    Since the mechanical cipher machine is not convenient when it comes to vast input. We designed a software enigma, which has a clear user interface and easy to manipulate. It can be used to decipher the codes behind the postcards we designed(see below).
Postcards with cryptology themes
Applicable age range: All ages
    We designed two kinds of postcards to attract people’s attention, and expand their knowledge of cryptology and our project. The first kind has our project name on the front, and the codes which can be deciphered with the help of our software Enigma. And the second kind has the some illustration of the history of cryptology on the front, and the codes which can be deciphered using historical ways(such as Caesar cipher).
Activities & Experience sharing
    So how did we integrated those tools into public engagement activities? We organized some public engagement activities to test the effect of it in the real world. We attended STEM festival in Suzhou. We set up our stall in the exhibition hall with XJTLU. We have a poster to introduce the idea of synthetic biology and our team. In that case, we used the room escape computer game. People are attracted by it and asked us about the knowledge behind the game, then we introduced some basic knowledge about synthetic biology to them. Then, they understood the game better and “escape the room” easily.
    We also went to the Wuhan science & technology museum. We set up our stall in the information exhibition hall, which is a hall set up for people to learn more about how information processes. And this is exactly the problem we are dealing with! And our stall can provide a biological aspect of information processing, which enriched the knowledge of the hall. Here we played the puzzle game with children using candies, which helped them to understand what we have been doing in a funny way. The video based on synthetic biology was also played beside the game area. Many kids were attracted by it and asked us to explain the details of it.
    We attended a national famous skill sharing activity in China, Oneyouth Talk. We presented our work and introduced synthetic biology to the public. And after the presentation was over, many people talked to us, and gave some valuable feedbacks. There was also a fair in the location of the Talk for people to sell some interesting made by themselves. We sold our postcards with codes there, using the software to help them to decode the information, the mechanical cipher machine to let them try the process of encryption and decryption, which helped a lot to explain our"
SMMU-China,2018,Team:SMMU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," medicine can stop the process of heart failure, let alone reverse it. Currently, we can do nothing but watch the patients’ condition get deteriorating, and eventually evolve into heart failure. This not only poses a great threat to the physical and mental health of patients; on the other hand, patients' families also suffer tremendous economic pressure, bearing the annual medical burden. Seeing these sad facts, we can't stop wondering if we can find a treatment to HF by using the knowledge we learned about synthetic biology.
Question and interview
To evaluate the feasibility of our project, we consulted professor Erwin Neher, a Nobel laureate major in cell ion channel. We also consulted chief Zhao Xianxian and some other clinical researchers for suggestions on the project. These masters pointed out that our project was feasible due to that calcium leakage was one of the most important mechanism accounted for the chronic heart failure. While, on the other hand, they also recommended that we should explore the other mechanisms that may result into HF. In the next step, we can try to work on other mechanisms.

Collaboration
Do as a new iGEM team, our knowledge of iGEM competition was limited, so we need instructions and suggestions about how to build-up and run a team. We met a few obstacles and setbacks and we had been seeking advice mainly from 3 teams: NUDT-China, Fudan-China and TMMU-China. All the three teams are experienced in iGEM and get excellent results.         We visited their labs and invited them to our school for further communication.

Two gears in the upper right are the finishing touches, representing the important inspiration of engineering biology in our projects. The overall open composition implies the open and innovative thinking of our team.
Project logo
In 2018, our team's project logo consists of Oracle's heart in Chinese, shield, branch and DNA double helix. The overall shape of the figure looks like a shield, also like the ""heart"" in the oracle bone inscriptions, indicating that the purpose of our project is to protect the heart. The trunk of a branch is made up of double helixes of DNA, symbolizing that the cornerstone of our technology is synthetic biology. The leaves are the symbol of vitality, showing that after the treatment of our medicine, the heart is rejuvenated.

TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Policy Practices#Application scenarios_-_-_TEXT.html," goats in 2009, the Dutch government imposed numerous regulations on goat farms to limit the outbreak. These measures include a mandatory vaccination of dairy sheep and dairy goats, mandatory tank milk monitoring for Q fever every 2 weeks and a ban on removing manure from the farm. Many of these regulations are still enforced: dairy goats and sheep have to be vaccinated yearly, there is a report duty for signs of Q fever and every dairy farm is obligated to take part in a biweekly bulk tank milk test for the presence of C. burnetii as the milk of infected goats contains DNA from the pathogen.
Figure  6: The milk of goats infected with C. burnetii contains its DNA. In addition to the DNA of the pathogen, the milk usually contains the Phase I- and Phase II-antibodies which are active against C. burnetii. The tank milk test, however, consists of a real-time PCR test as the antibodies are present because of the vaccination of goats.
Jeanette van der Ven , owner of a goat’s farm near Eindhoven and one of the board members of the ZLTO (association for entrepreneurs in the green sector), told us that it is pretty hard for farmers to gain monsters for the testing of their goats. Protocols have to be followed and everything has to be disinfected, which is not pleasant for the animals. It would be a great improvement to make the milk tests easier to perform. With the use of COMBs the farmers will be able to test the milk at home by bringing our sensor system, encapsulated in alginate beads , into the milk samples. These samples can be simply extracted from the milk tanks or even be built into the milk tanks.  When antibodies are present, the beads shall turn into a color. This way, farmers don’t have to send milk samples to a research institute anymore and will get the result of the test immediately. Treatments can be started immediately and there will be no more risk of newly infected cattle in the meantime.  Because all goats are vaccinated, detection of antibodies into the milk does not always signify infection. However, experts from the InnatOss told us that they vaccinate once a year, but often notice that previous vaccines are not working anymore. With the use of COMBs, real-time detection of antibodies is possible, which is really helpful by determine when the goats have to be vaccinated again. Also in this case the farmers are able to do these tests themselves.  We hope that with the use of COMBs a main problem for the society can be solved, by detecting infections easily at an early"

Ethical, Legal and Social Implications
As we consider the ethical, legal and social implications of our project, we should bear in mind the uses which we envision for Micromaize:
As a biofuel, freeing up land currently being used for biocrops for the growth of food crops.
As animal feed, freeing up food for human consumption. Additionally, by using our starch as a biofuel or feeding it to animals, we could potentially allow more fertile land (e.g. rainforests) to remain in its natural state instead of being converted for the growth of monocultures.
As food for humans, but only in the most extreme of circumstances (i.e. famine).
We can divide ethical, legal and social issues into the following categories:
Safety
Security
Cultural, economic and environmental concerns
Ownership, sharing and innovation
Safety
Research
The organisms involved in our experiments are not hazardous to humans or animals under normal circumstances. A safety assessment was completed for our research project and was approved by the School of Biological Sciences Genetic Modification and Biological Safety Committee. This is a requirement for all genetic modification work in the School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh. Since the project was classified as level 1, we were allowed to proceed with minimal containment and good microbiological practice; for example, cells had to be killed with ethanol or by boiling before they could be removed from the laboratory for assay by Raman spectroscopy.
Production
We envision producing starch by fermentation, which involves culturing cells in a contained environment. Safety requirements and regulations for contained processes are a lot less strict than those in place for uncontained systems.
Organisms are bound to escape when large quantities of them are present, even in a contained environment. However, our E. coli strain (JM109) is much safer and less potent than organisms naturally present in the environment (which are there by the grace of natural selection). The JM109 strain of E. coli:
Has multiple disabling mutations,
Will not colonise the human gut,
But divides slowly.
Hence, we are considering using"

Example of a TLS phage-Ampicillin-ΔtolC E. coli transformed with E. coli K12 tolC plate
A model is only as informative as it is accurate. Knowing this we had a plan to test whether or not our model was actually giving us something resembling the reality. We planned a week-long protocol for evolving and analyzing mutants resistant to the TolC-binding TLS bacteriophage (referred to as TLS phage). The protocol is outlined is as follows:
Day 0
Take 250µL of overnight grown culture of ΔtolC E. coli (knockout-tolC E. coli) with the pUC57 plasmid containing the E. coli K12 tolC gene mix with 50 µL of TLS phage stock and plate in 4mL 50µg/mL Ampicillin (Luria Broth) Top Agar on an LB-Amp plate (Make 1 per person).
Day 1
Pick 10-15 mutant colonies and streak them onto a 1/6 or 1/8 sectioned LB-Amp plate.
Day 2
Pick 1 mutant colony from each colony streaked and grow them overnight in a LB-Amp liquid culture.
Grow enough ΔtolC E. coli cells for 10-15 transformations. (Electroporation or Heat Shock) in a LB liquid culture.
Day 3
Miniprep the 10-15 cultures grown from picked colonies, carefully labeling the resulting plasmids so you can distinguish one from another.
Prepare the ΔtolC E. coli cells as competent cells (Electrocompetent or Thermocompetent for whichever method you prefer).
Transform with the 10-15 plasmids you just miniprepped, being extra sure that you know which transformation is from which plasmid.
Plate transformation on LB-Amp plates after the resting period.
Day 4
Make freezer stocks of successfully transformed bacteria, making sure you know which stock goes with which plasmid.
Perform cross-streaks on Amp plates with TLS phage crossing every successfully transformed sample.
Day 5
Make stocks of the samples whose bacteria are NOT killed by cross-streaks (these ones we are now sure have a TLS-inhibiting mutation in the E. coli tolC gene)
Throw out other samples and their corresponding minipreps.

UCL,2017,Team:UCL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," allows for easy orientation testing of our PMDS by adding enterokinase into the cell solution and recording delocalisation of the GFP from the PM into the solution.
For the ‘cytosolic domain insert’ we chose the mCherry BioBrick BBa_J06504 followed by a NLS. mCherry was chosen because because its absorption maximum of 585 nm wavelength light lies outside the emission spectrum of GFP (max. At 510 nm) which makes makes separate imaging easier by reducing bleed-through.
Experimental design
Previous iGEM teams have used a range of different methods for gene delivery into mammalian cells. Some chose viral delivery, others tried to tried to make the iGEM submission vector pSB1C3 a mammalian expression vector by adding a device for mammalian antibiotic expression and creating a device for the gene of interest with mammalian promoters and terminators. Both these processes take a long time and have a high risk of failure. This is why MIT 2010 proposed a new standard to concatenate mammalian parts based on Gateway cloning instead of restriction cloning, the MammoBlock standard. However, this approach requires buying additional material and requires modification of standard BioBricks for Gateway cloning. Since time is the most pressing issue during a one summer research project LIT decided to use standard mammalian expression plasmids instead. We chose to use pcDNA3.1, a standard mammalian expression plasmid, because it is already optimized for protein expression in mammalian cell lines and contains a 5’-UTR and 3’-UTR that is well characterized and ensures efficient translation of the gene of interest.
After restriction cloning of our PMDS coding region into pcDNA3.1 we aim to transfect HEK293T cells by using Qiagen’s “SuperFect® Transfection Reagent” kit, a transfection method based on activated-dendrimers. This method has been successfully used for the aggregation assay (see above).
Using a confocal microscope we are able to see localisation of GFP and mCherry to the plasma membrane. Using a 400 nm, violet laser we are able to induce photocleavage of specific cells in the culture and record the movement of mCherry from the PM to the nucleus. Quantitative data is produced through analysis of percentage colocalization of GFP and mCherry.
This system can be tested even further in the future by using an mCherry part that contains a degradation tag (e.g. BBa_K1926013). This would allow a more dynamic system characterised by fast localisation of m"
TU-Eindhoven,2013,Team:TU-Eindhoven#AnearobicTesting_-_-_TEXT.html," under the regulation of oxygen concentration, even though the concentrations are rather low resulting in low intensity bands on the purified SDS gel and a high gain for the fluorescence measurements. The low concentrations were to be expected however as the EGFP was not being over expressed and the samples taken form the BioReactor were a mere 20mL.
For the SDS gel of the unpurified MG1655 samples we saw some bands that indicate an increase of protein expression. These bands also show up on the purified samples SDS gel. The bands are at the same height as the bands on the unpurified gels, so they correspond. The fluorescence measurements for the purified MG1655 samples showed the correct emission spectra for EGFP. The spectra for the samples that were longer exposed did not have an increased intensity. Scattering was excluded by taking other excitation wavelengths, which resulted in the same emission spectra.
Overall we can conclude that the FNR promoter does work and EGFP is produced anaerobically. We do however recommend the XL-1-Blue bacterial strain for the expression of proteins under influence of the FNR promoter over the MG1655 E.coli strain. Going off on the repeat experiments, it can also be mentioned that expression at slightly higher Oxygen concentrations is also possible, and  could even provide higher EGFP expression.

The first question is about the age of people who answer the survey. We can observe that the most part have about 21 to 30 years.

The means of survey dissemination were mostly directed to people with type 1 diabetes, showing consistency with the answers obtained in the second question. Insulin use is in agreement with the percentage of type 1 diabetics who answered the survey.
Accessibility to the treatment
The graph below shows that only 15% of people with diabetes receive government aid, even the government taking responsibility for distributing the drugs to the patients. About 20% of diabetics spend over $ 150 on treatment, showing the importance of developing cheaper treatments. To corroborate the high costs of medicines and other treatment materials, 92.6% of participants consider treatment expensive.
According to the information obtaine above and the graph below, it is possible to confirm the government's real deficiency in providing the medicines and materials necessary for patients free of cost, since 67% of the participants consider difficult to obtain them.
Insulin therapy
A great part of the patients use insulin about 3 to 5 times per day, which is a considerable number of applications.  The most part of the answers show that people don't known about the number of insulin applications that they use, indicating the banalization of the treatment and the need of more information about.
The result below is very interesting for us. About 80% of the answers show that the usual treatment is invasive for patients and 67% answer that the treatment affects their routine. This indicate the importance of the research and development of new treatments for diabetics, that will improve the quality of their lives.
An interesting conclusion of the graph below can be considered, showing that most people"

NUS_Singapore,2016,Team:NUS Singapore#Project#Wet Lab_-_-_TEXT.html," basal expression and significant increase in reporter output (either by GFP or ALR) in the presence of lactate. Our strategy allows strict amount of reporter expression, thus increasing sensitivity of lactate detection, and minimise false positive result.
We minimise the basal expression of our reporter by linking different strength ribosomal binding sites (RBS) with a shorter version of the promoter region for the wild-type lldPRD operon (BBa_K1897037, derived from Part BBa_K822000), the engineered promoter (BBa_K1847008) or J23100: a high expression promoter in a high constitutive cassette (BBa_K314100). We obtained the coding sequence of ALR from the Biobrick plasmid (BBa_K1172901). The first two promoters, the coding sequence of sfGFP and the sequence of lambda t0 terminator were received from team ETH_Zurich 2015. Our general cloning strategy is demonstrated in our Notebook . A second stop codon was added at the end of ALR sequence to enhance the efficiency of the translational termination.
Part 2:
RIOT Responder
Here, we use the CD44v6 antibody, which is conjugated to a bacterial peptide called hasA. hasA is part of the Has operon system, which when bound to hasR (found on the surface of the bacterial cells) leads to a cascade of reactions within.
The Has operon is another critical sensor for the RIOTsystem. The proteins involved in the operon are hasA, hasR, hasS and hasI. hasA is an extracellular haemophore and it binds to bacterial cells expressing hasR, the hasA receptor. This binding causes a conformational change in hasS (an anti-sigma factor), which then releases hasI, a sigma factor. hasI then binds to its specific promoter (labelled as pHas) to trigger expression of genes under pHas. In the RIOT system, the gene expressed is luxR, which is required to activate the RIOT suppressor.
BACKGROUND:
In this case, we are using the Has operon to activate the luxR feedback system. In the bacteria cell, hasR, hasS and hasI will be constitutively expressed. hasR is expressed on the outer surface of the cell wall and acts as the receptor that binds to hasA. hasS will be found on the inner surface of the membrane of the cell.
Normally in the cell, hasI, which is a sigma factor, is bound to hasS, which is an anti"

Hi! This is my first time at the iGEM team. I participate because I want to make some practical lab experience beside the normal labrotaries. Also I like the idea of working in a project so interdisciplinary as this. You can share your ideas with people from other backgrounds and include their point of view into your project.I hope for new impressions in the field of synthetic biology and I'm courius about a good time in the lab.
Sebastian Barthel
Age: 22 
Subject: B. Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
During my first semester at university, I have been in contact with the former iGEM team 2012 for the first time. Since then, I was keen to work on such a interesting project like the digestion of PET by E.coli. Unfortunately I had to learn some biological basics first, so I could not help our team in 2013. But now I am even more excited to compete with our anthocyanin project this year.
I anticipate from the iGEM project to deepen my previously obtained knowledge by working independently in the laboratory and to improve my softskills and expertise. The possibilities to take positive influence on manhood's future life by using synthetic biology are enormous. I am glad to promote improvement in the field of synthetic biology by being a member of our team and by being part of this year's competition.

So I actually looked the guy up, who’s this doctor guy who’s written books, and who’s appeared on all these television programs and everything talking about all these weird stuffs. And I looked at where he got his doctorate, and his doctorate came from an institution that I’ve never even heard about in Sri Lanka. And the doctor that he got was an honourary doctorate, it’s not a real, he didn’t actually get a phD, it’s an honourary doctorate. I have 11 honourary doctorates from universities across Canada. So, this guy is calling himself a doctor and he’s an expert but he’s not, but he’s doing this big scam, and he’s making a lot of money with speeches and writing books but he has no credibility himself. So he is not a real scientist. And that’s the difference between social media and what do we do on the radio. And we make sure that what we are doing is correct and it’s right. And it’s not just what we think about this and what we feel about it, but it’s the actual science itself. I’m really bothered by that by what I see in social media, and it’s a challenge for students in science to understand the difference between what’s real and what’s somebody’s opinion. It’s a real real challenge. Angela: We have created a survey a few months ago just analyzing scientific literacy among the population. So we distributed the survey and got 271 respondents from all across the world. So most are university students, because we got other iGEM teams to do it. After analyzing the results, we realized that there are some trends that are a bit interesting, like you said, some people believe in pseudo science. We would like to ask you some of those questions if you don’t mind . Nick: The data suggested that most people with a bachelor’s degree trust scientific reports with dramatic and opinionated language to some extent. What do you think that is? Bob: Because it speaks to the person who is not expert in that field. Again, using everyday language is a very effective tool, but, you have to be careful that it’s still accurate. And discern the"

Our System
We have designed a tunable microbial consortium to distribute the 4S biodesulfurization pathway, responsible for the bio-desulfurization of DBT, as a metabolic network.
There are two major genetic circuits contained within our system:
The first is responsible for tuning the relative populations of the bacteria within the consortium. It is composed of different fluorescence markers under constitutive promoters, used to differentiate member of the population. As well as an amino acid biosynthesis genes under a inducible promoter, used to regulate the bacterial populations within the consortium.
The second codes for the distributed 4S pathway, and was created by splitting the dsz operon into each member species of our tunable consortium.

These sites can be mutated out through manual edits of the sequence. In most cases, changes can be made that do not affect the system due to the redundancy in the codon specificity. The prefix for a part is a cctt +XbaI + g site, and the suffix is a t + SpeI + a + NotI + PstI + cctt. The restriction sites enable the idempotent construction, while the extra bases help to separate restriction sites and allow the enzymes some overhang at the ends.
Parts are grown and stored in plasmid vectors. These vectors are circular pieces of DNA that bacteria exchange with each other. There is a set of standard BioBrick plasmids that are used to build and grow parts. They contain sites that enable the introduction of the BioBrick parts.
To put parts together, we cut the parts with the appropriate restriction enzymes and then ligate the cut products together. In Figure 3 , we place one part on the beginning of another part.
The key to the idempotent assembly process is the convenient nature of the XbaI and SpeI sites. The overhang is identical, but the ends of each cut site are different, so the combined site can be ligated, but not cut. Yet, the ends remain the same, and thus, we can compose parts again and again.
For the component that we are prepending, we take the DNA and cut it with EcoRI, and XbaI. The component we are inserting is cut with EcoRI and SpeI. These components are then ligated together and the result is the combined part, with the same ends, but with an uncuttable mixed SpeI/XbaI site where they were ligated.
Figure 4 illustrates the constraints which take the potential parts of the biological platform for a given functionality and compose them to an actual design instance (DNA sequence). This requires a number of steps in which the design becomes closer to implementation while at the same time updating the overall cost of the design.
Clotho will provide a means by which functionality (BioBrick based designs) can be realized as physical implementations via the support of assembly algorithms which not only provide valid assemblies of standardized parts, but also provide efficient optimized assemblies which minimize the design steps and stages needed. This will help save both time and money associated with standard part assembly.

Step 3: Introducing the anti-terminators and the corresponding nut-sites
To avoid leakiness of the system we introduce a terminator downstream of the repressors, see figure 5.
Figure 5: The location of the terminators is shown in correlation with the promoters and the repressor. No expression of the anti-repressor occurs when the terminator is functional.
In order to control the terminators, and thereby the expression of the anti-repressors, we introduce anti-terminators which are located downstream of the terminators. The anti-terminators are able to bind to the nut-site located upstream of the terminator. When the anti-terminator binds to the nut-site it enables transcription to proceed past the terminator.
The anti-terminator GpN as well as its corresponding nut-site are a part of the lambda phage regulatory system. The anti-terminator Gp24 as well as its corresponding nut-site are a part of the p22 phage regulatory system. For further details see the theory behind the regulatory system.
Figure 6: The anti-terminator from half switch one is expressed and thus the expression of anti-repressor AntT occurs. This results in the stability of half switch one.
The anti-terminators and the nut-sites contribute to the stability of the active state. If transcription was allowed to continue to the anti-repressor located on the inactive half switch, the switch could change state spontaneously. The terminator ensures that this does not happen. The anti-terminator of the active state is expressed, allowing continued transcription past the terminator.
Step 4: The final design
The illustration in figure 7 shows the final design of the switch when half switch one is stable. The GogR repressor represses the pR1 promoter and thus expression of the genes downstream of the pRM2 promoter are solely controlled by this weak promoter. The expressed GtgR will be anti-repressed by the AntT and the genes downstream of the nut-site will not be expressed due to the terminator.
The expression of the anti-terminator Gp24 makes transcription through the terminator possible and hence the reporter GFP is expressed.

WashU_StLouis,2015,Team:WashU StLouis#design_-_-_TEXT.html,"id Design
The literature also indicated that the expression levels of each gene need to be finely tuned in order to achieve optimal nitrogenase activity. We decided to use 2 different inducible promoters to give us more control over expression levels, and grouped the genes into ones we thought would need to be expressed at higher versus lower levels.
We decided to create 2 plasmids with 7 genes each rather than one plasmid with 14 genes, which would simplify cloning greatly. We designed one plasmid containing genes that we generally believed needed to be expressed at higher levels, including the enzyme structural genes.
In ordering the genes on the plasmids, we mimicked gene orders we observed in the natural Cyanothece cluster and in other minimal clusters in the literature. Since we did not have the resources to codon optimize, we also considered codon usage in placement of genes on the plasmids. One gene, cysE2, has particularly bad codon usage for E. Coli, so we placed it directly downstream of the promoter.
Primer Design and Cloning Strategy
We designed primers for use with Golden Gate cloning to create the plasmids. Our general strategy for primer design was to add a BsaI site and one intervening base before the fifteen-base RBS before the annealing portion on the forward primer. When possible, we used the first four bases of the RBS as the overhang for ligation, rather than adding in bases and creating a scar. On the reverse primer, we added a BsaI site and one intervening base before adding the reverse complement of the overhang that it should match up with. In designing primers, we considered:
maintaining a primer length of 60 nucleotides or less
having a melting temperature (T m) of the primer-template interaction between about 58 and 62 degrees Celsius
matching the melting temperature of primers in a primer pair as closely as possible to each other
maintaining a hairpin melting temperature as low as possible, and always less than the T m of the primer-template interaction
maintaining heterodimer and homodimer interaction delta G values to be less in magnitude than -15 kcal/mol
adding up to 6 adenines before the BsaI site where possible
having overlap sequences that are distinct enough from other overlap sequences used for the same plasmid
our criterion was to have a maximum of 2 of the same base in the same position. i.e. GACT and CAGT are acceptable as only A and T fall in the same positions. However, G"

Responsible of business (chargé d’affaires) at Genopole in EVRY, FRANCE.
This interview was very interesting. This time we had to meet someone who was not an expert in synthetic biology, who just had some knowledge in microbiology.
We discussed about the potential of our project to interest professionals in both research and industry. Mr. TUFO was also very enthusiastic with a view of adapting our system in the field of therapeutics or biosensing.
He advised us to direct our interest on probiotics acting on the intestinal microbiome and on developing this aspect to show that our project brings something new. He also suggested that we should be interested in the environment by investigating the possibility of a bulk pollution biosensing system in different types of ecosystems.
Overall, Mr. TUFO has helped us greatly enriching our network of contacts in different areas of research, in addition to giving us valuable advice on how to present our project to the professionals we meet.
Volker DÖRING
Researcher at Genoscope CEA in EVRY, FRANCE.
The purpose of this interview was to find out if our project could potentially be useful for an existing research project. That is why we met Mr DÖRING who is in charge of a research team of Genoscope CEA in Evry where they work on a continuous culture machine called GM3, more commonly called “the farm”. It is a large complex system of tubs connected to bottles of specific media that allows cell cultures for months or years and taking a generation for study if necessary. The advantage of this machine is that it can significantly extend the life of any cell culture and store any mutant.
We therefore discussed the potential of our project to adapt to their research tools to open the way for other innovative research projects. Mr DÖRING was very motivated to work with us, he believes that our system can adapt very well to GM3.
He also informed us about the different parameters to consider when we want to work with co-cultures such as the choice of environment, the interactions between different bacteria, the potential conjugations, but also according to the size of the population and the empirical potential of the evolution of our strains, the possibility of mutations that we must not forget to consider.
This interview made us notice that many research teams are interested in a stabilizing co-cultures for their research, something we can bring to them with PEPTalk.

We also met vlogger Valtteri Sandberg who is a relatively famous Finnish fashion / lifestyle vlogger. He makes videos about skin care and makeup routines, and has been noticeably open about his acne. The vlogger was eager to be interviewed about his acne and especially its psychological effects. We were very happy about this chance. The interview can be found from here .
Acne's effect on self-esteem was important information for us, since together with literature we could be certain that acne really is an important problem that affects countless individuals in a negative way and new solutions are truly needed.
Market Research and Designing a Product
To get more information from the industries dealing with acne, we met cosmetologist Ida-Maria Rantala from Ihohoitola Lupaus beauty clinic. She was specialized in acne and told us about her patients, treatments and products they use in a beauty clinic and what they recommend patients to use at home. We got a lot of input about consumer behavior, for example what kind of products they are most often willing to use and how much money they are willing spend on acne treatments. We also talked about Rantala’s own point of view about genetically modified organisms, ongoing trends in skin care and what kind of product she believes will be on the market in future.
The Urlinski company designs and manufactures the equipment for production of cosmetics and medicines. We contacted the company representative to learn about the process of producing cosmetics in general, and to get opinions and advice regarding our skincare product concept. As for manufacture, they emphasized the importance of scaling-up from the laboratory to full production. They also presented how this transfer is done with the devices of different capacities in the company facility, which greatly helped us with our business plan . The first potential problem pointed out regarding our product was spoilage of the cellulose-based hydrogel due to microbial contamination. This led as to try several different preservatives with the hydrogel. We also talked about the growing popularity of preservative-free beauty products, however it seems that we cannot avoid using preservatives in our case. We also received feedback regarding our preliminary package idea for the container with separated compartments for different cosmetics components. According to our interviewee, customers prefer a ready-to-use product over the possibility to prepare individualized one by mixing components on their own. A special dispenser could be used; however, currently available dispensers are not so practical in use and fail to maintain good mixing of ingredients in a cosmetic formulation"

Abstract
An intragenic complementation approach to engineer a faster fluorescence biosensor
Our goal is to engineer a novel biosensor with a faster readout than is currently available. Many bacteria produce, secrete, and respond to chemicals called autoinducers to monitor population density and to synchronize gene expression, a process called quorum sensing. In quorum sensing based biosensors, detection of autoinducer activates transcription of a reporter gene, which must then be translated and accumulate to detectable levels, which can take two to four hours. In our system, we will use TraR, a protein used in the quorum sensing response of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which dimerizes only in the presence of its autoinducer. We have successfully fused traR to sequence for two separate complementary fragments of GFP. Upon addition of autoinducer, we predict that already accumulated TraR-GFP fragment monomers will dimerize, allowing the GFP fragments to interact and fluoresce. This new approach may drastically reduce the time necessary for future biosensors to produce detectable output.

Screenshot of GUI Chemical Environment options dialog
Add Chemical Environment
The 'Add Chemical Environment' dialog can be opened by clicking on the highlighted button on the Home screen. Every simulation must have at least one chemical environment, even if it is empty. By adding a chemical environment, the user is creating an object which spans the entire simulation space and keeps track of the quantity of single species of chemical. There is no limit to the number of chemical environments that can be added to the simulation, but after adding 6 the user may run out of colours to display them in.
The diffusivity of a chemical field (in microns per second) defines how quickly a particular chemical spreads across the simulation space. The decay rate is the ratio of the chemical that breaks down every second. This must be a real number between 0 and 1.
Users can choose which colour to display a chemical in using the drop-down menu. Once users are happy with their choices, they can add the chemical field to the simulation by clicking on the button at the bottom of the dialog. This writes an empty chemical environment into the simulation JAVA file; to add any chemicals to this field, users must create a bacterial population and instruct them to interact with the relevant field. Once a chemical environment has been added, details about it are displayed in the text output area of the Home screen.
Future editions of the GUI will allow users to add to chemical fields without using bacterial populations. Users will also be able to give customised names to each field to aid their memories.
Screenshot of GUI 'Add Bacteria' dialog
Add Bacteria
The 'Add Bacteria' dialog can be opened by clicking on the highlighted button on the Home screen. BSim works by defining a 'class' that defines the behaviour of a bacterial population. It later adds members of the population to the simulation as needed. The GUI preserves this method of doing things by asking users to describe the behaviour of a bacterial species before deciding how many of that species they wish to add, and where to put them.
Using this dialog box, users can create bacteria that:
Detect chemicals
Create chemicals
Direct their movement in response to chemicals (Chemotax)
Signal collisions
The first three of these features can be combined to model many useful population-level behaviours. Examples include quorum sensing, or chemical production in response to a non-homogenous chemical environment.
The final feature, collision signalling, is a very useful diagnostic tool. When a bacterium collides with another bacterium or a solid object, it changes colour."

Expressing sfGFP in vitro
We had to test various reaction compositions to find a functional formula that enabled production of sfGFP. The extract purification and glutamate salt concentrations were particulary important. Finally, a 10 fold increased fluorescence signal was observed when compared to the negative control. This was the first time we realized that we made it; in vitro sfGFP transcription and translation with our extract was possible!
Proving that sfGFP synthesis is possible with our self-made extract. The mean value of two technical replicates was used for evaluation. Fluorescence signal was in this case normalized on fluorescence signal noise of negative control.
Template optimization
Experimental setup
We were sure that a further optimization of sfGFP production was possible. Based on literature screening (for details see background page , we designed a translation enhancing sequence (5'-untranslated region, 5'-UTR) and inserted it into PT7-sfGFP, thereby creating PT7-UTR-sfGFP, BBa_K1758102 . Our assumption was that if translation was a bottleneck in our extract, this sequence would improve sfGFP production. As verification for the beneficial effect of the 5'-UTR, we performed in vivo experiments first, normalizing the fluorescence signal to culture OD600. We employed another reporter protein, mutated red fluorescent protein (mRFP), as well. This was done to check if the 5'-UTR was useful for translation in general. Similar to above mentioned cloning strategy, we constructed PT7-UTR-mRFP ( BBa_K1758106 ) after assembling PT7-mRFP ( BBa_K1758105 ). For mRFP fluorescence signal normalization on OD600 we faced the problem that mRFP emits fluorescence at 607 nm ( Lentini et al. 2013 ). We also tried to express mRFP in vitro to check if it might be a reporter protein equally or better suited for our purposes. mRFP was excited at 580 nm, its emission was measured at 610 nm.
UTR performance
This was the case in vivo: We observed a faster production of sfGFP and mRFP when the plasmid DNA contained 5'-UTR in front of sfGFP coding sequence (see nearby photo of shaking flasks). When fluorescence was quantified in the microplate reader and signals were normalized on OD600, the results"

METU_Turkey,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software_-_-_TEXT.html," and pre-combined constructs     such as devices and systems. Availability of combined constructs is     important to the researchers as combining individual bio-bricks one     at a time will be very time consuming. These previously merged constructs,     serve as the repository for puzzle and they can be used for different     purposes. Up to date the largest and most trustworthy source, for synthetic     biology and its components, is iGEM’s parts registry. In 2010, iGEM     provided over 1000 parts that have initiated many projects. Having more     atomic parts available in the iGEM’s repository, will lead to the design     of more complex and robust constructs, and we would have a better chance     to design different constructs for unique purposes. Also, for the parts     that are already available, extra steps needs to be taken for the quality     control and surveillance of these products. The quality control of the     information for the parts is essential for the future of iGEM and synthetic     biology. Even though we have found pre-determined RFC standards useful     and included those to our standardized template, some individual parts     still requires re-organization of the information as RFC standards alone     for the functionality of parts, does not satisfy the needs for wet lab     biologists.
Without a question there is an urgent need to build a distinct and     specific database well organized with its own standards for synthetic     biology; however, development of such a database is not an easy task.

Table 2: The above table simply depicts information about possessors     of parts and their contact information and the popularity of the parts     for groups. Parameters heading, refers distinctive experimental details     unique to the usage of parts which should be decided by groups.
Second step for building the standardized template was to get the     phylogenic information about the parts development process which includes     the name of the group, designer and contact information, along with     the comments from the group on the parts they have submitted. Contact     information is especially important for iGEM as other groups who need     extra information about the available part can reach to the required     information. Even though contacting with the designers of the individual     parts which are available is highly encouraged by iGEM, unavailability     of contact information points at out the fact that iGEM’s parts registry     needs strong re-organization in order to serve to the synthetic biology     community properly.

We kept connection with iGEM team from University of Science and Technology of China. We had a short meeting concerning team development as well as brain storming methods. And we also provided several parts to Chinese University of Hong Kong to help their project.
Jun Yin, the undergraduate student from Shandong University, who kept contact with us since May 2013
And in May, an undergraduate student from Shandong University, who is also interested in iGEM, got to know one of our teammates in a conference held by Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China in University of Science and Technology of China. From then on, they communicated a lot. Since there was no iGEM team in Shandong University at that time, our teammate gave a lot of useful information to students of Shandong University, such as the process of participating in iGEM, the preparation for iGEM, and some communication conferences held by different 2013 iGEM teams in this year. Besides, in August, another student from Shandong University visited our team. Partially because of our help, our new friends from Shandong University have done a lot to construct their own iGEM team, and may participate the 2014 iGEM competition.
2013 iGEM conference in NCTU
In August, we attended the 2013 iGEM conference held by National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan. In the conference, we made friends with students from National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan University, National Yang Ming University, Hong Kong University, and Zhejiang University. We talked about iGEM, synthetic biology and even daily life with our new friends, learned a lot from them, and helped each other to improve the projects. Really thanks to NCTU's treatment! Besides, we made hundreds of beautiful bookmarks as a gift, which is really liked by our new friends, and did a survey in the conference to investigate people's opinion on subject cross in the field of synthetic biology.
After the 2013 iGEM conference, Rou-Chien Liao, a cute girl from NYMU-Taipei team, visited our lab in SJTU. We communicated with her as the view of projects, and took her around in Shanghai for the whole day.

This weekend, we had our third regular meeting, and had a new teammate joining in us.  Jiren firstly further explained to us the conceptions we didn't figure out last week.  Chao, our team leader, introduced the fundamental knowledge about cancer therapies and the background of the review, combining with his own experience in previous experiments.  He also presented the weakness of the anti-cancer drugs nowadays, and the orientation scientists are working towards, which made us have a deep understanding of our project.
Afterwards, Anqi, Xianwei, and Jingwei gave us their presentations on specific bacterial targeting of tumors, intratumoral penetration, and native bacterial cytotoxicity.  An later added illustrations on Salmonella typhimurium with the information he found.
During the presentations, other students raised questions to further dig into the review. For example, when talking about TNF-α, we had doubts on human immune system, the infection of S. typhimurium, and the function of this factor.  Though we couldn't explain all these questions now, these discussions indeed broadened our minds.
In the end of the meeting, we assigned everyone tasks as usual.  Although the exams are coming, giving us pressure on our study, we will still working hard towards our goal.

Today we continuing to focus on document reading like last week.
Bomiao and Bei firstly illustrated on cytotoxic agents, cytokines, tumor-specific antigens and antibodies, gene transfer and gene silencing.  Among all these topics, the one of expression of anti-cancer agents caught the attention of us all.  Everyone presented his own opinions on this topic, especially in the transfer of genetic material in mammals by bacteria.
In the second part, Wenping described to us particularly on gene-triggering strategies, focusing on the pictures of the mechanism.  She tried hard to explain in detail, and asked us to understand it with the knowledge of molecular biology.  And it worked out.
After that, our new teammate Zhifei Yuan elaborated on detection.  Though he doesn't major in biology and is new to our team, his thinking is distinct and in order, and"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#HumanPractices#EducationandEngagement_-_-_TEXT.html," open to using gene doping for performance enhancement. Together, given the extra pressure that is generally put on athletes, these figures provide us with an alarming estimation for possible gene doping use among the athlete population.  In China we asked an additional question though that shows 10% of the general public would even like to take gene doping for performance enhancement if this would shorten their life to only five more years. Compared to Goldman’s dilemma that was developed in the 1990’s and found that more than half of the athletes questioned would take a performance enhancing drug that would kill them in 5 years ( Goldman et al., 1992 ), this figure is relatively low. Keeping in mind however that we are polling the general population, this might be a figure consistent with Goldman’s research at the time. Later research from 2009 by Connor et al. indicated approximately 6% of the athletes at a track in the USA would take a similar drug ( Connor et al., 2009 ), which is in turn lower than we found among this general population.
We expected that people would generally not see gene doping as a problem, because they have most likely never heard of it before. Because gene doping is relatively unknown by the general public, we also expected people would think it will only become a problem in the future.
Both in China as well as in the Netherlands people think gene doping is not a real problem yet, although the percentages people estimate tend to result in relatively high numbers when applied to the athlete population. In the Rio Olympics of 2016 11544 athletes competed. If we apply the responses of the Dutch respondents to the Rio Olympics an absolute minimum of 760 athletes would have used gene doping on the 2016 Rio Olympics, compared to a minimum of 1075 athletes according to the Chinese respondents. On top of this, most respondents think gene doping will an even bigger problem in the (near) future. This might be a good indicator for the confidence athletes would put into these therapies.
We believed people are generally in favor of very strict doping control, since doping is a word we associate immediately with something that should be prohibited.
Indeed, the majority is in favor of strict doping control maintenance. In The Netherlands almost 90% wants to maintain very strict doping controls and in China 70% wants this.
We hypothesized that people generally don’t think gene doping could make sports fairer.
We thought people would naturally reject this and tried to challenge them in the debate before, comparing it to the natural unfairness inherent to gene distribution. In China 13% believes gene doping can make sports fairer. In The Netherlands "
