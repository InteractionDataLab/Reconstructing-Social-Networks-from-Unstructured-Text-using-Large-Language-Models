BioBrick Tutorial 2017
On Friday of the second weekend of March (9th-11th of March) the DTU BioBuilders stood in anticipation for the first arrival of the invited Nordic iGEM teams.
The following teams marked their presence:
- Norway: Universitetet i Oslo (UiO)
- Sweden: Chalmers University of Technology
- Denmark: University of Copenhagen (KU) and University of Southern Denmark (SDU)
Counting 44 people in total made this year’s BioBrick tutorial the most attended to date.
The purpose of the BioBrick tutorial is to demonstrate the modularity and versatility of the BioBricks beyond a theoretical level, to socialize and initiate a foundation for further collaboration and to lower the distance between the registry and the members of the respective teams - from teams to start exploring the registry. And to get a clearer idea of the  concepts of  “Digestion”, “Ligation”, “transformation” and “plate spreading” keeping in mind that the members of the teams have different academic backgrounds and are enrolled in various programs.
Thus, the bulk of the weekend (Saturday) was spent getting hand-on experience with the 3A assembly. This was achieved in the form of a laboratory exercise, where different genetical parts were combined by small teams of four. We achieved this by combining the BioBrick plasmid backbone (pSB1C3)  with a purple-blue chromoproteins (RBS-amilCP) under control of a constitutive promoter.

Small lectures was interspersed in between incubation times. Lectures were prepared by us, the team form KU and by invited speakers. These lectures covered technical topics such as cloning techniques: Golden gate and USER cloning, a lecture contributed the supervisors of the iGEM-Copenhagen team - a runthrough of the registry and interactive sessions on communicating science effectively to an audience of peers. A full overview of the interesting events can be found on the bottom of this page.
On Sunday, we arranged for a panel of iGEM alumni and our supervisor Chris Workman to take and answer questions that the teams had. Questions covered topics on funding- and PR activities, judging criterias and team dynamics. This was followed by an activity encouraging ideation in the form of an exercise, where the teams built a bridge between a gap of the tables after brief deliberation among themselves on the design features and load requirements.

Results/Discussion: The sequencing data indicated the successful isolation of all genes. Thus, for creating the invertase operon via gibson assembly, K390015 will be used to PCR out the petBD+RBS (light inducible promoter) and INV will be used to PCR out invertase containing the correct overlapping flanking regions. K39005 will also be used to PCR promoter for the GLF operon. K654056 can be used as an integration vector for transforming Synechocystis PCC 6803.
Enzymology
CL: This week we ordered a Free Fatty Acid Assay Kit from BioSystems as we anticipate that our E. coli modified to produce and secrete free fatty acids part is complete.  While I waited for my kit to arrive I participated in a Western Blot used to confirm a His tag on our BTE (Bay Laurel Esterase) gene.
Media
Autoclaved and cleaned flasks for future experiments.
Prepared media to perform last experiment (varying levels of ammonium chloride) again, with 100 mL cultures.  It was thought that using 16x25 mm culture tubes may not provide sufficient aeration, so the decision was made to go back to flasks.
Week 7 - July 11th-17th
E. Coli
Trc Promoter
LT:Fifteen new colonies (#11-25) were recultured, purified using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep protocol, digested with Eco RI and Pst I and run on a 1% gel. (See week 6.) Results:  Trc was not successfully inserted into the PCR 2.1 TOPO vector. Bands in the gel correspond to the TOPO vector without insert.
LB- Amp plates were prepared with x-gal. Cultures #1-25 were streaked and incubated overnight for blue/white selection.  Results: All colonies were white.
All colonies were white so control cells were spread on the x-gal plates. Results:  The control cells appeared very light blue. The x-gal blue/white selection wasn’t helpful for selecting transformed versus non-transformed colonies.

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," just like a password. In     theory it is possible to decrypt the message without the key but a     lot of computing power, knowledge and resources are required so     practical it is almost impossible. With the key the message can be     easily decrypted. The key itself is, of course, not encrypted.
At this point of our design we have a key and message. The     message is encrypted and reads out as nonsense.  At first key and     message consist out of plain text, numbers and symbols. Our     encryption and decryption machine then converts those into the     corresponding ASCII code. The number sequence of the ASCII code is     then converted into binary. And the binary code is converted into a     sequence of base pairs. Thus 00 stands for adenine, 01 for     cytosine, 10 for thymidine, and 11 for guanine. The machine also     adds header and footer sequences to the message and key sequences     for the recipient to be able to recover key and message from the     full genome. Figure 1 shows a conversion table of text to the ASCII code, to binary and to DNA.
The work with BioBricks requires some reserved sequences like     the restriction enzyme sequences for EcoRI, PstI, SpeI, XbaI and     ideally also NotI. Additionally our work with the B. subtilis shuttle vector pDR111 required the reserved sequences SalI, HindIII     and BglII. Our encryption and decryption machine can consider those     reserved sequences while converting message and key. It is also     individually adjustable to other required reservations.

Safety
Safety has always been an important concern in our laboratory, both in project design and operations during experiment process. This year we used two kinds of Escherichia coli (DH5α in part construction and MG1655 in project). According to the official iGEM guidelines of Risk Groups , E. coli is categorized as a Risk Group 1 organism that ""do not cause disease in healthy adult humans"" when used properly. Also, The risk group level of E. coli is correspondent with our laboratory safety level (Safety Level 1). To make sure that everything is safe enough, we have seriously managed Individual Safety, Environmental Safety, Biological Safety based on project as well as Safe Shipping.
1. Individual Safety
All members participating in the iGEM project this year have taken safety training courses given by the department experiment center that we acknowledged general safety managements such as fire-fighting strategies, disposition of biochemical materials, proper usages of microwave oven, laminar flow bench and other apparatus.
All members have carefully read Safe Project Design , Safe Lab Work , Safe Shipment and other requirements proposed by iGEM Safety Committee . We filled up the Final Safety Form according to the real situation in our laboratory.
Nitrile gloves, masks, closed shoes were strictly required in laboratory to prevent potential threats of personal health.
Resting area and Experiment area were clearly separated to confine eating and drinking strictly in resting area.
2. Environmental Safety
Biological materials were not allowed to be taken outside the laboratory without sterilization. All of the used materials (bacterial samples, plasmids, reagents, agar, etc.) after experiments were sterilized before leaving the laboratory and collected altogether for further management.
Regular cleaning of the laboratory trash was arranged every day to maintain a clean and tidy laboratory environment.
3. Biological Safety Concerns based on project
With the advent of synthetic biology, genetically modified microorganisms are being increasingly used for biomedical, industrial and environmental applications. Deployment of these engineered microbes in large scales and open environments calls for the development of safe and secure means to restrain their proliferation.
This summer, we expected to add mf-lon ssrA tag into 5 essential genes using CRISPR/Cas9 method. By applying gene circuits to control mf-L"

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," our ambitions and what we would like to achieve as an organisation, we clarified SinBio vision:
A society that is enthusiastic about synthetic biology, is confident in its use, and supports people who want to be part of scientific community.
Later on, we have developed goals aligned to the vision:
1. To address the first part of our vision, we believe that for people acknowledge and become interest in synthetic biology it has to be established as an integral part of our life, providing benefits for our well-being. Of course, their possible negative aspects or dangers should also be discussed. The relevance of synthetic biology has to be demonstrated to the general public, and the solution it offers - explained.
Such public engagement should be a two-way process, enabling the public to express their interests, ideas and/or concerns, thereby helping scientists and stakeholders to innovate the synthetic biology in the right direction. We should also bring business into the picture as society more often has contact with science through products and services it uses.
We have then picked out the methods we could use to engage the public with the field of synthetic biology:
Participating in and organizing scientific events for the community, wherein people could get familiar with concepts of synthetic biology, its potential and benefits.
Collaborating with startups and mature businesses that may want to incorporate the methods or products of synthetic biology in their workflows.
Releasing a popular periodical newsletter on the latest accomplishments of the synthetic biology field.
These means might improve the public’s understanding the scientific expertise in ways they prefer and feeling that their opinions count resulting in overall approval of synthetic biology.
2. To raise the confidence of using and applying synthetic biology, the community has to first understand what it is. This confidence should arise from informed understanding of the processes of synthetic biology and science in general. This goal should be approached from two perspectives.
First, the general community who has limited knowledge about science principles and topics in general.
Secondly, the people from scientific community who need to expand their knowledge circle into the field of synthetic biology (e.g. life sciences students).
To acknowledge these two groups, we are going to implement different means to engage them into processes of synthetic biology:
Steps for familiarizing general public on scientific research concepts and means to conduct it:
Making a list of trusted scientific sources available to the general community and promoting it.
Organizing general lectures and workshops.
Steps for students to to understand processes behind synthetic biology:
Organizing in depth lectures and workshops on synthetic biology.
Collaborating with Vilnius University to make synthetic biology a part of study programmes.
3. The third thing we want to focus on is developing a society with qualified"

Our modular kit comes with different parts that can be combined by choice, e. g. different mammalian promoters and characterized binding sites of specific properties. By choosing a certain binding site to tag the GOI, one can tune the expression of this gene. Depending on the GOI, different means for read out of gene expression come into play. At first, we applied dual-luciferase assay, since we used Luciferase as a reporter for a proof-of-principle approach. Later on, semi-quantitative immunoblots were prepared for testing of therapeutic genes. However, all the received information fed our models, thereby creating an integrative feedback loop between experiments and in silico simulation.
Next to that we follow two virus shuffling approaches to re-engineer the AAV capsid gene by directed evolution. This is used for production of a virus that is specifically infected into hepatocytes. We test the hepatocyte specificity of the fittest AAV clone via a luciferase reporter in living mice. We show that organ specific targeting is readily achieved in our mouse model. The following project sections give more background on the individual topics and provide detailed overviews on the corresponding results. A detailed documentation of the laboratory work can further be found in the notebook.
For the first time, we could show miRNA mediated fine tuning and cell targeting in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore we wanted to create a library of synthetic viruses that could be evolved to enhance target specificity of our approach. In the combination of the two, we see doors open to the future of RNA based gene regulatory therapy.

July 18: Demo & Resolving the touch problem
Our first demo!
This morning, we demoed the Beast and the art project to international high school counselors, and then round 2 with a couple high school students. As we prepared for the demo, I learned how to calibrate the Beast. It was a very tedious process. The demo took about an hour - we presented to two groups of counselors and they all had many questions for us about the experience and studying computer science. After the demo, most of the lab went to the beach for the CS Department Beach Day - I opted to stay in the lab and work. I continued to work on the Primer Designer - after talking to Consuelo, we finally figured out why the touch was not working. The computer I was working on did not have the input simulator installed, and could not be installed because of the Windows 8. We decided I would continue the primer designer on the Microsoft Surface.
July 19: Demo #2 & Continuing UI
Batman: The Dark Knight Rises
Kim presenting the art project to high schoolers
We spent the morning demoing the Beast and the art project to 8 Upward Bound Chemistry students. They were very engaged with the presentation and activities, which was nice to see. After the demo, I worked with Kara on the Primer Designer - we got drag and drop to work. We made it so that when an item is selected in the SurfaceListBox, an image of the site shows up and can be dragged to certain StackPanels on the visualizer at the bottom. At night, the entire lab went to watch the premiere of ""Batman: The Dark Knight Rises."" It was a great bonding experience.
July 20: Presentation of our work
After the long night, we all came in a little later and prepared for the presentation at lunch. We went through all of the slides to make last-minute changes, and then at lunch, we presented our sub-projects and overall work to the rest of the Computer Science Department. It wasn't the best presentation, but it was definitely a great learning experience for all of us. After the presentation, we went back to working - I joined Kara in completing the front end of the primer designer, and adding the files from my back end.

SCUT-China,2015,Team:SCUT-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," Considering the big variety of cells across different tissues and species, NO-cGMP mechanisms are bound to vary and have designs that are specific to cell types. Thus,the model can serve as a general modeling framework for the study of NO-cGMP effects on the HEK293 as a complex cell signaling system. This framework can be tailored to address particular situations and can also be expanded to incorporate newly observed mechanisms.
In addition, based on scientific workers’ experimental and modeling research of HIV, we have established the model of simulating Lentivirus’ invading cells. Therefore, this model can be used as a reference for other iGEM teams to study Lentivirus.

Team Members
Wu Yifan
She is the leader of the team and played an important role in purposing the idea this year. Meanwhile, she did some chores to help the designers of molecular experimental work. It is very pleasant to work with her since she can always bring energy to her mates. Maybe that is what a leader should be.
Wu Xianfan
He played an important part in the team image. As the designer of the logo, T-shirt and poster in the team, he has burned a lot of midnight oil this summer. He magically turned our logo, poster, presentation, team shirt into fantastic arts.
Li Jing
She is one of core members of the group and the team. She played an important role in most of our experiment together with Liu Dong. She devoted herself to ascertain the main part of our project. We can tell from the notebook that she is an optimistic fighter who can always find a way out of the failed experiments.
Li Ye
Ye Li, from the School of Computer Science, is a member of our software group. He did most of the construction of HITGEM public platform based on a prevalent app called Wechat. Thanks for his engagement, we can chat and even have fun with the AI on our mobile.

Transformation of biobricks; Making of bacterial cultures (mutdCas9, RRvT and mRFP1)
Goal:
Transform biobrick BBa_K592009 (plate 1, well 19E) and BBa_K592010 (plate 6, well 17G) into competent DH5α cells
Make bacterial cultures of mutated dCas9 (with Addgene backbone), RRvT and mRFP1
Procedure:
Transformation
10 μL ddH2O was used to resuspend the biobricks. For the transformation, 1.5 μL of the biobrick resuspensions were added to competent DH5α cells. The transformation was performed as described in our protocol section with slight modification: 1.5 μL of the biobrick resuspensions were added to competent DH5α cells, and 950 μL LB added prior to a 1.5 hour incubation time. The cells were plated on agar plates with chloramphenicol as the selective marker.
Make bacterial cultures
Bacterial cultures with mutated dCas9 (with Addgene backbone), RRvT and mRFP1 was made by inoculating previously transformed stored bacterial stocks in 25 mL LB medium containing 25 μL chloramphenicol. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C with shaking.

Prof. Dr.-Ing. Lars M. Blank
RWTH Institute for Applied Microbiology (iAMB)
Prof. Blank focuses in his research on fundamental and applied aspects of microbial metabolism. Of specific interest is the interaction between the metabolic network and the introduced genetic and environmental perturbations. The research on in silico/in vivo metabolic network operation is aimed at a deeper understanding of cell function, with the ultimate goal of rational cell engineering.  In his teaching, Prof. Blank focuses on the integration of biological concepts with the tools from bioinformatics and engineering. He believes that a sound knowledge base in the life sciences is key for creative and thus successful work in the areas of Metabolic Engineering and Synthetic Biology. Read more about Prof. Blank's work on the iAMB's website .
Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Wiechert
Jülich Research Centre, Institute of Bio- and Geosciences (IGB-1)
Prof. Wiechert's main area of work lies within the field of applied systems bio(techno)logy of microorganisms with a special focus on methodological developments for quantitative biology. Characteristics of his research work are a close integration of experimental and theoretical work within multi disciplinary projects. As the head of the Systems Biotechnology research division at Jülich Research Centre, he is developing methods for quantitative metabolomics, fluxomics and proteomics including model based mathematical methods for experimental design, parameter estimation, and process optimization in biotechnological systems. Future work will also incorporate micro fluidic methods for single cell analysis. In general, all research results are used to drive forward the process of gaining knowledge in the course of an iterative improvement of industrial production systems. This proceeds in close cooperation of all working groups at the IBG-1. Together"

Chemistry
Cyrille Pauthenier
Master 1, Chemistry, ENS Ulm
I'm a student in chemistry master at the Ecole Normale Supérieure. Aware that most of the common chemicals we use in our everyday life derived from oil and because I also enjoy studying biology, I started to focus my interest on living materials as an alternative source of carbon for chemistry, and natural chemical transformation processes. This is how I first stepped in Biocatalysis. Then, I discovered the iGEM contest, and get very fan of the idea of engineering life for our own human interest. I'm a very motivated guy, loving to work in team, and on such interesting projects. My aim is to go on in Synthetic Biology after the contest, and probably make a PhD in metabolic pathway engineering.

Babak Nichabouri
2nd year, Pharmacy, Paris Descartes University
I am currently following the Pharma.D Phd Program. I have to  do a summer internship in the lab of my choice. I chose the CRI  for the multi disciplinary aspect and particularly innovative side.  It is important for me to not shut myself away into one particular  domain, as interesting as it is, and to be always open minded.  iGEM is not only a simple lab internship, it is a pedagogic  program, with no equal, and we will learn as well about people  we work with as ourselves. But iGEM is also a competition, a  great team challenge that motivates us to do great things and do  better still.
Danyel Lee
3rd year, Medicine, Paris Descartes University
I learned about iGEM from a classmate that also wants to  participate in the project. A unique project planned and carried  out by a interdisciplinary group of students, both creative and  innovative, iGEM was clearly not an opportunity that i could  pass by. I look forward to learning from the other members,  learning through the experience, and contributing my own  knowledge and assets to the team.

Come trace our steps...
The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is the premiere undergraduate synthetic biology competition. Student teams world-wide are given a set of biological parts from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Over the summer, the teams use these parts and create new parts of their own to build biological systems and operate them in living cells to achieve various creative purposes. To complement their wet lab findings, the teams also endeavour to design and carry out computer modeling and human practices projects. Through this experience, undergraduate students gain insight into the research process of seeking out information and protocols to come up with their own novel project (not to mention all the re-searching and trouble-shooting expertise gained!). Graduate student advisors also get a taste of what it feels like to be a principal investigator or lab manager in terms of providing for and guiding the undergraduate students. Finally, in November, hundreds of iGEM teams gather at MIT to compete at the annual Jamboree!

Docking Domain
Overview
The fidelity and efficiency of acyl transfer on the interfaces of the individual PKS proteins is thought to be governed by helical regions, termed Docking Domains   (DD), which are located at the C-terminus of the upstream and N-terminus of downstream polypeptide chains. The length of docking domain is about thirty to ninety amino   acids (Figure 1) [1]. It not only participates in the regulation of protein function, but also completes the transshipment of upstream intermediate, and   forecasts its vast prospects in the development of new drugs [2].
There are two types of docking domains. Class 1 is from actinomycetes and mucous bacteria while class 2 is from cyanobacteria mostly [3]. Class 1 DD is   also in the form of dimer just like the polyketide synthase. At present, the class 2 DD is seen to be a genetic engineering tool because of its shorter length and   tight combination, and it will has great application prospect for deeper researches.
Docking domain consists of ACP-side docking domain (ACP DD) at the C-terminus of the upstream and KS-side docking domain (KS DD) at the N-terminus of downstream. The   two parts locate in the downstream of ACP and upstream of KS respectively, and lie in the different modules. Each DD has formed specificity of the binding because it   has specific connection site. Namely each docking domain is unique in the whole polyketone synthesis pathway. With this important feature, we can ensure the connection   between adjacent modules does not have randomness, which makes the product unique.

Flavia, Leda and Farhan represented the UEA-NRP team by presenting our project to members of around a dozen other UK iGEM teams, and fielding questions from them.
In addition to the team presentations, we were also lucky enough to attend talks by representatives from Desktop Genetics, Synbiota and Synthace on some of the latest developments in molecular biology, and emerging cloning technologies. Throughout the day we were also able to mingle with the other teams - a great opportunity to make friends before Boston and to trade success and horror stories from our respective labs.

Due to the enthusiasm of the team members, we came up with a variety of interesting ideas during our brainstorming sessions. A few of our discontinued favourites included: a how to survive on mars concept and a means to control the weather (in true British style). At first we found it challenging to narrow our ideas down to one project idea. However, once we explored the potential of each topic in context of the BioBrick components and how we could integrate Human Practices within the idea it became easier. This enabled us to focus upon feasible ideas, with room for creativity, whilst eliminating those which were not suitable.
Next, we looked at existing BioBricks created previously by iGEM teams, and consequently how we could contribute to enlarging the registry and broadening the application of synthetic biology. We found that the whole team really felt that ageing was a great topic to explore within iGEM and has a huge potential to make both social, cultural and economic impact.
BioSynthAge: Do not go gentle into that good night
We envision a time in which the human population lives a healthier life, for longer. We will use synthetic biology to ensure the ageing world population can both maintain their quality of life and extend their lifespan - increasing their ‘healthspan’. The health challenges currently posed by ageing are many and complex so we propose a suite of synthetic biology solutions to tackle these challenges. Our synthetic biology solutions will include, but not be limited to, the following:
Oxidative stress – the root of the problem
Oxidative stress underlies many of the health problems of ageing so we will develop a number of free radical mopping devices. These devices will include therapeutic bacterial chassis triggered by oxidative-stress to deliver free-radical mopping compounds. To lay a conceptual foundation for genetic tools that address ageing within human cells, we will also use gene-editing tools to map the relationship between telomerase expression and"

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," open clinical signs, these persistent infections affect the performance of the animal like daily weight gain if it's feedlot cattle, so they should gain weight with time.
    This is measurably affected if you compare chlamydia free cattle with chlamydia infected cattle without clinical symptoms. And the same happens to milk productions. A cow herd that is affected by persistent subclinical chlamydiosis will produce less milk than a chlamydia free cow herd. So it really makes an economic sense to try to achieve a chlamydia free status. But we are very far from that. [...] The awareness has increased in the past few years but it's still a long way to achieve that. There is still another point on the subclinical chlamydia infections, as is said there are quite a few data on showing that the presence of chlamydia in domestic animal population is associated with loss of performance such as milk production and daily weight gain. I guess that something similar could happen in a human carriers of chlamydia as well. This is a factor that is currently not under consideration and I think there is no research on it but it seems straightforward to hypothesize that individuals, carriers of chlamydia who are not developing open clinical signs but remain carriers for a long time, these individuals may have their state of health deteriorated to a certain degree and in the end lose some of their performance. This is an important factor that should be addressed in future research.
Daniel C.:
Do you think that some strains are resistant to the antibiotics that are usually used to fight them and [therefore] persist in the body?
Prof. Sachse:
Chlamydia is an exceptional bacterium especially in regard to antibacterial resistance, because there is no resistance as such as in the other bacteria. There is only one species, where a few strands carrying a resistance gene have been detected, it's Chlamydia suis which is not of any importance to human health so generally speaking there are no antibiotic resistance genes in the chlamydia. But nevertheless you can control to a certain degree a chlamydia infection using certain efficient antibiotics but the mechanisms are different, and the mechanisms of control using antibiotics are more nonspecific than with other bacteria, because chlamydia have an ability to evade the impact of the antibiotic because of the absence of peptidoglycan but also because they have this biphasic developmental cycle, where they can reside for a certain period of their lifecycle in a cell in a vacuole so they are quite inaccessible to the action of the antibiotic.

Vanderbilt,2015,Team:Vanderbilt#Project#Sequence_-_-_TEXT.html," plots of raw data. For each data point, the ""background"" seen in the no enzyme negative control lane was subtracted from the fragmentation smear intensity to correct for differences in amounts loaded, fragmentation of the stock sample, and other factors. Two representative alkaline gel images are also shown, in greyscale and inverted. At 1000 mJ/cm2, it was found that non-specific DNA shearing occurs at such high magnitudes that there is no longer appreciable differences between enzyme treated and untreated samples. The graph shown is for assays conducted at the 500 mJ/cm2 UV dosage.
Although statistical analysis of RFPyy failed to produce statistical significance according to the conventional definitions of alpha levels, the modest 12% reduction in mutation-prone sites may not be sufficient to produce significant results because of the intrinsic variability of the technique, which combines variation from irradiation, enzymatic treatment, denaturation, electrophoresis, and staining. Despite all of these factors and the variability they introduce, we nevertheless observe a strong trend that may be capable of significance with further replication.
While these assays were ongoing, the mutation optimization algorithm was being constantly improved. One large improvement that was made was incorporating more precise values for the relate mutagenicity of each type of UV hotspot relative to each other. Our updated algorithm is now capable of optimizing RFP twice as well as had been done with RFPyy. Our improved optimized RFP has a 35% reduction in UV-prone sites, which, based on how strong our results were with RFPyy, would almost certainly produce a result that is both statistically significant and of considerable magnitude.
Oxidized DNA Lesion Experiments
To evaluate our technique's performance with respect to oxidation sites, we primarily used the conversion of supercoiled plasmid to nicked plasmid as our form of visualization. An alkaline gel assay was run, and produced results roughly in accordance with the data found by the plasmid confirmation method. However, the alkaline gel assay requires a minimum of ten hours to complete, and requires specialized equipment and extra care to set up.
Our optimized RFP for these experiments had a 49.5% reduction in oxidation hotspots. Our repair enzyme was Formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG), which is specific in its activity for the 8-oxoguanine DNA lesions that those hotspots are correlated to. For oxidizing our DNA in vitro, we initially tried methylene blue. The advantage of methylene blue is that it releases oxidizing radicals in response to exposure to light,"

1.
Insertion of the butyrate gene pathway
2.
Gene deletion of carbon-draining enzymes
3.
Addition of colon cancer binding ability
Aim 1.
Our primary BioBrick was designed to contain an operon with a combination of 5 enzymes shown to facilitate butyrate production. A similar pathway has been shown by other investigators, but no journal publication describes this pathway being employed in E. coli Nissle 1917. We thus repurposed the pathway for probiotic application. The result of this aim is a part that is a functional improvement of Toulouse iGEM 2015 butyrate pathway biobricks (composite part BBa_K1587004 and BBa_K1587005). We designed our butyrate pathway gblock (gene block) as two segments due to the 5Kb sequence length. A ribosome binding site (RBS) calculator was used to create moderate strength RBS between each gene.
Aim 2.
We also wanted E. coli Nissle 1917 to under-express enzymes that drain carbon and reducing equivalents (ex. NADH) away from butyrate production. Acetyl-CoA is the starting point for the pathway. Theoretically, taking away the wild-type enzymes that also use acetyl-CoA, NADH, or any of the intermediate byproducts could increase end-product yields of our desired SCFA. Gene deletion is an underutilized route in iGEM team projects as it can pose significant difficulties, especially for constitutive or ‘housekeeping’ genes. Nevertheless, we included it in our experimental design, as it is needed for metabolic engineering. Butyrate production of all engineered strains can be assessed through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and anaerobic fermentation. Presence of other metabolites (fumarate, glucose, succinate, lactate, formate, acetate, ethanol) will also be measured to assess efficiency of gene deletions.
Aim 3.
Lastly, we wanted to utilize an"

In order to address this problem, we wish to standardize a well designed synthetic circuit by which the safeness safety and ethics associated with using synthetic biology as mean can be dealt with,
without compromising the function of the construct that is originally designed. Such a system has the potential uses on both single and multicellular organisms for different applications - including but not limited to bioremediation, therapeutics and biosensors.

Design Process
In our design, we employ luxR gene that forms a transcriptionally active complex with 3OC6HSL to activate a downstream construct. Once activated, the desired functions of the circuit will run along with a ""time bomb"" that terminates this synthetic process.

Design Process Cont.
After a period of time (which varies depending on the application), termination of function will be accomplished by knocking out the genes of interest using Cre-lox and/or Dre-rox. As a result, the entire local population of genetically modified organisms can be reverted back to its wild-type phenotype with or without getting exterminated to prevent sudden and drastic changes in the ecosystem.

It also highlighted the global lack of knowledge of the iGEMers upon the intellectual property rights, which shows the necessity of informing about this particular topic. We sincerely hope we have helped to do so.
Part III: Scientific popularization
Introduction
A lot of stereotypes and pieces of information circulate on sciences, so that we can sometimes find it hard to know where the truth is hidden. The public may sometimes look for a reliable source to make its own opinion. We are convinced that we have a role to play and have decided to involve ourselves in the researchers' night which is a european scientific popularization event.
More about the researchers'night
Since 7 years, this event has been taking place on a single September night in about 300 cities all over Europe. The main goal of this night is to put researchers in touch with the public. Thus, they can explain what they are doing, how and what can be the applications in the day-to-day life.
This year, the theme was ""Imagine the future"": what future will emerge from research laboratories? How do scientists imagine the future? Archeology, Physics, Philosophy, Biosciences or Linguistic: researchers shared their lab experiences and thoughts on the future. Therefore, in order to defend a controversial discipline, Synthetic Biology (a.k.a. SynBio), the Lyon-INSA team members participated in the Researchers’ Night, which was held on September 28th, 2012, at the CCO of Villeurbanne.
Indeed, an article published by a French team: “Séralini et al., Long term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize, Food and Chemical Toxicology, Volume 50, Issue 11, November 2012, Pages 4221–4231” and also in the paper “Le Monde” on September 25th, 2012, on deleterious effect of transgenic maize on rats, had a dramatic effect on the public opinion in Europe. Thus, to illustrate that SynBio can be used to improve the environment, health and life of people, we decided to explain the potential of SynBio and to exchange with the public through a scientific speed-dating and around a table containing diagrams and Petri dishes.

Dragon's Den
In the days leading to the event, we prepared a power-point presentation that highlighted our project’s goals and the corresponding implementation plan. After heading up to Edmonton the night before, we rehearsed, rehearsed, rehearsed (and rehearsed a little more) so that we could best impress the Dragons with our eloquent delivery.
We rose fresh the next morning, indulged in the culinary largess of Aramark’s fine cuisine, and ventured downtown to finally face the ferocious Dragons. After witnessing formidable performances from the other Alberta teams, we sauntered up to the front and delivered our presentation. Immediately after the face-off, we incurred their wrath (read: received useful feedback) and were given suggestions on how to improve our marketing approach to potential investors.
At last, it was time to dine on something more than a handful of petrified undergraduates. We meandered to a nearby restaurant and feasted on sumptuous food and beverages scarcely short of ambrosia. We also had the opportunity to feast on something more important: namely, the advice of the business tycoons themselves. We were awestruck by the plethora of wisdom and experiences shared over lunch, not to mention the honour of getting to know the Dragons on a more personal level.
After lunch, the Dragons and students converged in Alberta Ingenuity’s lair to discuss strategies for effective fundraising and networking. It was an open-floor conversation where we had the opportunity to learn from the Dragons and the other teams, free of the reticence that was more pronounced in the morning session. We were also able to address some of the challenges that each of the teams had faced up to that point. The day closed with a feedback session, where the teams discussed the format of the event with the Supreme Commander of the Dragons, Ms Jen Hill.

A Continued Tour of Education in Second Life
Continued visiting other areas in Second Life for inspiration and networking purposes. We've come up with some ideas for things like 'moving tours' of areas on the island, Heads Up Displays to show instructions for activities, and numerous other things. In addition, building has continued in Kings Bishop, and I've made whiteboards and more boxes/misc. for the lab. Sigma Aldrich labs have been an inspiration in how to use textures and prim shapes to build 'modern lab' type pieces.

TJU,2015,Team:TJU#Background_-_-_TEXT.html,"ET). Shewanella, a facultative anaerobe, has been widely used as a model anode biocatalyst in MFCs due to its easiness of cultivation, adaptability to aerobic and anaerobic environment and both respiratory and electron transfer versatility. They are able to exist in various kinds of environments and couple the oxidation of organic substrates such as riboflavins to the reduction of a wide variety of electron acceptors. When the electron acceptor are electrodes, their characteristic of transferring electrons from the cell surface to conductive materials shows great potential to improve the efficiency of bioelectrochemical systems. As a result, Shewanella has become the most widely used bacteria in MFCs.[5]
3 Microbial consortia
Microorganisms rarely live in isolated niches. More than 99% of microorganisms in environments cannot be successfully cultured by traditional cultivation technologies; one reason is that the maintenance of viability of these microbes may need supplementary metabolites or other signaling chemicals provided by other microbes in the ecosystems and communities. [6]
3.1 Interaction modes
Engineering cell-cell interactions and communications is at the central point of engineering synthetic communities. The interactions between microorganisms are ubiquitous and play a central role in determining the fate and evolutionary dynamics of individual organisms in microbial consortia, as well as system properties such as stability and dynamics of the entire communities.[6]
Also, delineation of interaction modes between microorganisms in natural niches could facilitate engineering novel microbial consortia and their traits. The interactions within the microbial ecological communities may have a null (0, or neutral), positive (+, beneficial or win), or negative (-, or detrimental or loss) impact on the partner microorganisms involved. Thus, the binary interaction outcomes could be classified into six different categories of pairwise interaction modes , i.e., neutralism(0/0), commensalism (+/0), amensalism (-/0), mutualism (+/+), competition (-/-), and parasitism or predation (+/-). [6]
3.2 Advantageous relationships of microbial consortia
The win-win relationship of symbiotic association is mutualism (+/+), in which both partner microorganisms derive benefits from one another. e.g., Stable co-culture in the same bioreactor was achieved by designing a mutualistic relationship between the two species in which a metabolic intermediate produced by E. coli was used and functionalized by yeast. This synthetic consortium produced 33 mg/L oxygenated taxanes, including a monoacetylated dioxygenated taxane.[7]
Commensalism (+/0) is a relationship"

PACE
Phage-assisted continous evolution
PACE (for Phage-assisted, continuous evolution) enables in vivo directed evolution of proteins. The basic principle of PACE is to link the propagation of quickly mutating phages carrying a gene-of-interest to be evolved to directed selection in E. coli hosts mediated by synthetic circuits. Here, we describe our custom-made PACE setup and exemplify its use for evolving a split T7 polymerase towards improved auto-reassembly. Furthermore, we outline our unexpected journey on setting up PACE from scratch. Finally, we provide"

Pendant des siècles, les alchimistes croyaient en l'existence de la pierre philosophale; une substance mystérieuse qui transforme non seulement les métaux ordinaires en métaux précieux, mais répond également aux désirs les plus ardents de l'humanité: le rajeunissement et l'immortalité.
Bien que la pierre philosophale n'ait jamais été découverte, les alchimistes ont étudié dans leurs laboratoires un nombre incalculable de substances et leurs interactions. Et ainsi ils ont accumulé des connaissances, qui, aujourd’hui encore, sont une base importante pour la chimie, la métallurgie et la pharmacologie.
Dans notre monde du 21ème Siècle dominé par la science la croyance en la pierre philosophale a disparu. Néanmoins, nous nous efforçons de chercher les moyens de vivre plus longtemps et en meilleure santé, mais aussi des solutions aux problèmes écologiques créés par la modernisation. Contrairement au passé, aujourd’hui nous ne recherchons plus des substances magiques dans la nature, mais celle-ci nous inspire a créer de nouveaux outils pour répondre activement aux défis de notre société.
Laissez-nous vous emmener dans un voyage vers une nouvelle classe de molécules, qui a le potentiel de révolutionner la biologie synthétique: les synthétases de peptides non-ribosomiques. Nous allons vous montrer comment libérer son énorme potentiel pour la production de peptides synthétiques par différentes caractéristiques spécifiques, comme le recyclage de l'or à partir de déchets électroniques.

We also received carbenicillin resistant TALEs from University of California (Meckler et al., 2013): IINNp, IIINGp, IINNp Luciferase, and IIINGp Luciferase. Transformed TALEs were plated on Amp.
We did overnight cultures of BBa_J04500 + TALE A , BBa_J04500 + TALE B , and University of California TALEs. Subsequent miniprep and Nanodrop of the products yielded generally low concentrations ranging from 9.4 - 63.1 ng/uL with mediocre purity. Verification digest of BBa_J04500 + TALE A and BBa_J04500 had bands at 3000bp and 3300bp, not at the expected 2100bp for backbone and 2700bp for insert.
Week 11: July 8 - July 12
This week, we did miniprep on sequence verified BBa_J04500 . We also ran PCR products of the first Kapa HiFi PCR of TALE A and TALE B primers on a 1% agarose gel, however no bands were visible. Subsequent higher temperature gradient Kapa HiFi PCR produced bands around 2500bp and lots of non specific bands (Figure 11). Gel extraction had very low yields (<20ng/uL) and poor purity, and repeated extractions produced similar results.
Figure 11.Gradient Kapa HiFi PCR used to extract construct BBa_J04500 + TALE A and BBa_J04500 + TALE B .  Every lane shows bands at 2500 bp and was expected at about 2442bp. Some unexpected amplification is seen for this PCR. No contamination is observed in the negative control without template DNA. The gel was 1% agarose and was run at 100 V for an hour.

In order to enhance the specificities towards inducers, improvements were made based on the Brown’s tri-stable switch model in 2006. This year, three well-characterized repressible promoters are used: phlFp, tetp, and lacp. The whole construct is divided into three parts, and each contains one functional system with two protein coding sequences (CDS), creating an interconnected tri-stable toggle switch. Moreover, mathematical modelling is applied to predict and verify the consistency of the experimental results. At present, it is by far possible and practical to apply the switch in biosensing which could be achieved by developing a combinatorial circuit of promoters and CDS. With its advantageous characteristics, it is foreseeable that the switch could be applied in a wider spectrum of fields in the near future, for example, biocomputational system and diseases diagnostic.

DTU-Denmark,2018,Team:DTU-Denmark#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," using the micro model, was made and it was stunning. Nicolai and Mathias managed to get a hold of the DTU Byg technician and received training in the machinery in order to make really good compressional tests. The compression tests that our foam-like material is not really yielding the type of results we wanted e.g. we were expecting to see a clear “snap”  when the sample was under sufficient compression. We are not seeing any “snap/crack”, only an increasing amount of compressional force, until the machine stage bottoms out.  What we can do is to stop measuring at a given deformation, and look at HOW that acts.   This is also taken into consideration for the simulation of the “hut design”. Since we have a finished design, it only needs to get realistic inputs. Lau applied physics (gravity, winds etc.) to the 3d model, but had problems with convergence.

Experiment: 3A of genes w. camV Terminator
Ligation: MelA,A0,GfaA,amilCP,hph.
Transformation: The ligations from yesterday and the ligations from the failed 3A PCR experiment were transformed into E. coli and placed at 37 C overnight.
Colony PCR: In parallel, we tested the colony using the colony PCR protocol . It seemed like diluting the colonies doesn't give good results.
23/8/2018
Experiment: 3A of genes w. camV Terminator:
The transformants was a success.
Colony PCR: 3 colonies from each plate was suspended in water. A small fraction of this suspension was used for a liquid overnight culture, that can be used for a miniprep. The rest was heat-treated for 10 min and used for a colony PCR afterwards.  The results show that the ligation products have the correct length.

Sick today :/ Tummy hurts
See below for repeat of AFRP GFP measurements in biological replicates.
Some questions that we still need to answer:
Why yeast instead of bacteria? Other studies have made similar circuits in bacteria before (see ""Building Biological Memory by Linking Positive Feedback Loops"" by Dong-Eun Chang et al.) The argument that yeast are slightly more representative of eukaryotic cells here seems far-fetched as we are not really looking at anything endogenous to yeast. Not that I think we should drop everything and start working in bacteria. We should have a solid response to this though.

Tsinghua-A,2018,Team:Tsinghua-A#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," $N$ is the number of yeast in the system.To further improve, we combine the model 'Reaction in system' that provides the relation of histamine in the system and the expectation activated histamine in one cell. Thus, we have a full model from the histamine in the cell to the fluorescence intensity.And we consider it as a known function
$$ Flo_t=Testing(L_t) $$
Taking $k=1000,N={10}^7$, the plot of this function is showed below.
In this testing, we can flexibly control the input concentration of histamine by diluting or concentrating. However, we know from other researchers and clinical doctors that the expectation histamine concentration of positive result ($EH_p$) is often ten times of that of negative one ($EH_n$).
$$ log(EH_p)=log(EH_n)+1 $$
Thus, with the above rule, we have to find a proper negative input, which ensures the testing system has the best discrimination. In other words, we need to decide the expectation of histamine input of negative result, which makes the negative result and positive result is the furthest. We can define the difference between the negative and positive result as follow as we know that $EH_p=10EH_n$
$$ dif=Testing(EH_p)-Testing(EH_n)=Testing(10EH_n)-Testing(EH_n) $$
The $dif$ is a function of $EH_n$, so we can find a $EH_n$ that maximize the $dif$.The figure of $dif $ is shown below.
In this parameter set we choose, the proper expectation histamine input of negative result that makes the difference biggest is $EN_n=3.16nM$, and the corresponding input of positive result is $EN_p = 10EN_n =31.65nM$. We can directly point these in the plot of the system function as below.
In summary, after analyzing the testing system, we figure out that letting the negative histamine input be $EN_n=3.16nM$(With this parameter set) and testing fluorescence in time $t_{max}=145$(With this parameter set) should be the most efficient and accurate criteria.
Threshold Calculation
After we designed the deterministic model of diagnosis, the error of the input and system should be considered. It is reasonable that there are errors in both negative and positive input, as the histamine in example is different and the manual operation also brings errors. Thus, we tend to assume that the negative and positive inputs ($H_n$ and $H_p$) are subject to"

Week 5
Realization that the trace metals will not be a problem as they will be present in high enough amounts (for the chassis bacterium) as impurities in regular tap water.
Week 6
In order to answer the question of “Will the chassis survive in the sugar water?”. We thought of using the rate of ATP loss in a high osmotic pressure system, and somehow using the maintenance reaction as a source. This idea turned into using the ATP maintenance reaction as the objective function to maximize, as the E. coli will go into a kind of starvation mode.
Week 7
According to this bionumbers page the average water content of an E. coli cell is about 6.7x10^-13 grams. This could be useful in determining how fast the cell might drain.
Week 8
Creation of the table to be used for the sugar water modelling as a new medium, though using H2Otex as the exchange reaction. Example calculation of some output: 1 mol of H2O = 18g
Minimally survivable efflux (in sugar water) = 482 (mmol*gDW^-1*h^-1)
482  (mmol*gDW^-1*h^-1) * 2.8×10^-13 (gDW) = 1.3496 * 10^-10 (mmol*h^-1)
1000mmol h2o = 18g h2o -> 3.722*10^-11 (mmol h2o per cell) = 6.7*10^-13 (g h2o per cell)
3.722*10^-11 (mmol) / 1.3496*10^-10 (mmol * h^-1) = 0.27578 (hour)
0.27578 (hour) * 60 = 16.54 minutes.

3-1-0. Overview
The experiments of iGEM 2016 team Tokyo_Tech are divided into Toxin, AHL, AmiE, and temperature-dependent promoter assays. This section describes the toxin assay. Our team studied themazEF system, which is one of the most studied TA systems.
TA systems are found on the genomic DNA of many bacteria and they play important roles in controlling the cell growth. Preceding iGEM teams have       studied the following TA systems; ccdB ‐ ccdA (iGEM 2014 team ULB-Brussels and iGEM 2013 team UGent), kid ‐ kis, zeta ‐ epsilon (iGEM 2014 team      Wageningen UR) and hok ‐ soc (iGEM 2015 team UMaryland) ( Table. 3-1-0-1. ). Almost all the iGEM teams dealing with TA systems aimed to use them as a kill switch or substitution for antibiotics.
Table 3-1-0-1 TA system that has been studied in the preceding iGEM.
On the other hand, we aimed to study cooperation of toxin and antitoxin in cells. Although UCSF 2012 showed the communication through TA systems including the mazEF system, they did not introduce toxin and antitoxin genes into a single cell and did not show the data on the whole mazEF system. Besides, some preceding teams failed to show enough data on TA systems. Our results show that cell growth can be controlled flexibly by manipulating expression ratio of mazE and mazF, implying new applicability of TA systems to many biotechnological fields and future iGEM projects.

Warwick,2017,Team:Warwick#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM and how our research has been going over the summer, but we also were also kept busy collecting surveys on public opinions surrounding synthetic biology. We had already collected data from members of the general public on the streets of Leamington Spa, but it was important for us to see how their opinions compared to those who either come from a scientific background, or have a keen interest in the field, as would be expected from those visiting New Scientist Live.
There was a marked difference in the opinions of the two groups; those with a keen interest in science reacted far more positively to the idea of synthetic biology than the members of the public who stopped on the street. Our survey results and comprehensive analysis can be found on our Human Practices page.

Public Science Evening: What the Cell?!
This event was organized as part of the Royal Society of Biology’s “Biology Week”. Now in its sixth year, Biology Week sees events take place all over the world that celebrate biology, get more people involved and aware of biological advances, and encourages as many people as possible to embrace their enthusiasm for the subject.
We spoke to some of the 120 visitors about iGEM and our project for 2017. Attendees ranged from primary school children and those preparing for their A-levels right through to retirees. In addition to this, the team organized tours of the Warwick School of Life Science laboratories. WISB (Warwick Integrative Synthetic Biology) is one of only six synthetic biology center’s in the UK, and so it was a great opportunity for us to explain some of our specialist equipment. The A-level students who came on the tours were surprised to see how multidisciplinary the field is; especially the importance of statistical analysis in biological research.
17th October 2017
BITES: A-Level Day
We aimed to foster learning through hands-on research experience, and so organized a microbiology lab and an engineering workshop for a group of local year 12 students, who are interested in undertaking a STEM-related degree when they apply to university next year.
As this was something new to us, we again consulted literature to help guide our teaching style. It was decided that to"

TU_Munich,2010,Team:TU Munich#BeyondTheLab#WikiTutorial_-_-_TEXT.html," a team wiki at the first place. This part should be read by members in charge of the layout and design of the wiki and will require basic computer skills. An understanding of HTML and CSS will also be very helpful.
Part II focuses on the everyday usage of the wiki create in part I and gibes some general advice how to use the iGEM MediaWiki. All team member that want to contribute to their wiki should read this part.
So the goal of your social project is to give every teams an easier access to the iGEM wiki: Because a wiki should simplify your life and not make you struggle!
Part I: Setup your Wiki
Before creating your own wiki, you should be aware of some aspects that you have to deal with when you create your team wiki. The intention of a wiki is to provide an easy-to-use platform where team member can enter information without having to know any HTML, CSS, etc. Secondly, most teams want to add their own style and design to their wiki. The normal way to customize MediaWiki is by using skins and extensions. As all iGEM teams share you common wiki, this is not possible. Changes done by one team would screw up the wiki of some another team. Summing up, the following text has to goals: Create a wiki that every team member can easily edit. Demonstrate how to customize the look of your wiki.
Create an easy-to-use Wiki
Although team wikis tend to vary, most of them contain two areas. A navigation area is always found as well as a content section. These two sections are the most relevant parts of your wiki since every team member should be capable of adding information or arranging your wiki pages. In this tutorial we will use a straight forward, table-based layout that will be put into practice using an invisible HTML table (see figure). Please note that HTML code within a wiki page has to be marked as such, by surrounding it with an opening ""<html>"" and a closing ""</html>"". For a very short introduction on HTML open the up the following ""Read more"" section.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a computer language that tells a browser (e.g. Firefox, Internet Explorer, …) what a webpage is supposed to looks like. In fact, a HTML file comprises plain text and holds instructions, so-called tags, for the browser. Every tag is marked with brackets and has a name that specifies the tag type. The beginning of a tag always contains an opening an a closing bracket (<...>) and the ending of a tag additionally has a forward slash / (</...>). For example"

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Decarboxylation_-_-_TEXT.html," After transforming both ligations and growing them on chlor plates, we noticed that for both attempted constructs, there were very few colonies. When we performed a PCR amplification and ran it on a gel, we did not find any significant bands; we were looking for 743 bp for NPT + J13002 , and 4764 bp for CAR + J13002 , and we did not see these bands. This process was repeated, but unfortunately it continued to be unsuccessful. Also, we once again attempted to clone OleT into a PET vector, but when we made overnight cultures of the few colonies we had, did minipreps, and performed our restriction digest with them using HindIII and AscI, we unfortunately did not see any bands. These processes will have to be repeated. Assays for OleT were continued, and results for these will hopefully be obtained next week so that we may input them before the Wiki freeze.
Week 21 (September 17 - September 21)
This week, we obtained successful results for our OleT assay! This is represented by the graphs below:
Figure 8.  Gas chromatograph demonstrating the production of olefins (alkenes) from fatty acids as shown from the increase in the peak with a retention time of 14.7 min.  The dramatic change in peak intensity at this point suggests that we are producing hydrocarbons.
Figure 9. Mass spectra of the peak in Figure 8 at retention time 14.7 min.  Demonstrating that this peak is an olefin, which is known to be produced in Micrococcus.  This verifies our proof-of-concept that the Micrococcus species can degrade fatty acids into olefins.
Now that our assay is complete, we need to successfully transform OleT into a PET vector so we can perform our assays with E.coli. Unfortunately, we still had no luck in ligating J13002 in front of CAR or NPT. Even when using super competent cells, we were only able to get a few colonies to grow after transformation, and these did not yield good results when we made PCR, overnight cultures, minipreparations, and restriction digests to test. Next week, we are going to attempt to ligate a promoter downstream of the PetroBrick as an alternative method to build our construction. If this is successful, we will ligate NPT and CAR into the construction as well, so we can perform decarboxylation assays with all three of the genes. We still had no success in cloning OleT into a PET vector.

Pasteur_Paris,2015,Team:Pasteur Paris#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," We sat in the several conferences. We also went to support the French FameLab Contestants in Paris at the regional and the national finals. At this event, the contestants, mostly PhD students and researchers, had to sum up a scientific subject in 3 minutes. The themes were very diverse and varied from cancer to gravity to name a few.
Media
At the beginning of June, the team were approached by Juliette Raynal, a journalist from the magazine ""Industrie & Technologies"" to talk about the project of the iGEM Pasteur 2015 team. She published the following article on the website and in the paper magazine of Industrie & Technologies.

Public engagement
At the beginning of the summer, we hosted 9th graders from the middle school Germaine de Stäelat the Pasteur Institute. We gave them a small lecture about the basics of Biology and Crystallography before taking them to the lab. We showed them how to perform a Western Blot, and then we supervised the making of their own. After this little session, we taught them a bit about microscopes, how it works and how to use them. We were very pleased that they chose us and the Institut Pasteur to learn more about science !
   
Interview with a professional
Interview of David Bikard, CSO & Cofounder of Eligo Bioscience:
Eligo Bioscience was founded in May 2014 as a spin-off from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Rockefeller University based on the discoveries from the Marraffini and the Lu labs. After winning several startup competitions, the company has recently raised a €2M seed-funding round and has settled its headquarters within the Institut Pasteur in the heart of Paris.
The French startup spun out of MIT and Rockefeller last year, where cofounders developed highly precise antimicrobials. Eligo’s technology is based on CRISPR/Cas9, the trendy and invaluable molecular tool for making sequence-specific cuts in DNA. Cas9 is a nuclease that binds a small guide RNA (sgRNA). The nuclease will cleave DNA if, and only if, it encounters DNA with a sequence complementary to its guide RNA. Rewriting the guide RNA readily repurposes Cas9 to target new DNA sequences. Their mission is to build a rich pipeline of « eligobiotics » to solve unmet needs in a wide range of industries: health, cosmetics, food, agriculture... (http://eligo-biosc"

They made a piece of fascinating software and found a biological company to synthesize a part in pUC57 backbone to generate delta-5 fatty acid Elongace while they had difficulties in transforming the part into pSB1C3. We changed the backbone for them and helped them by adding the part to the registry.
Figure2.1 Detail information of plasmid pUC57
After days of hard working, we finished this project successfully, here shows the final result of electrophoresis.
Figure 2.2 We digest Bba_K1551000 with restriction enzymes EcoR I and PstI . The Elongace coding sequence (with prfix and suffix)is 2064 bp while the pSB1C3 is 2070 bp so that there is only one bar near the 2000 bp region, which shows that we change the plasmid backbone successfully.
Participating in other teams' human practice
In June, we got an e-mail from the team Virginia, from this e-mail we knew that they were preparing for a global survey about synthetic biology, we participated in their survey actively and finally helped them to collect nearly 50 surveys, they provided us with a nice badge and thanked us for helping.
Email from Virginia:
Besides, we also helped XMU-China to finish their Newsletters, we were very happy to see their Newsletter every week.

Helping other teams after CCiC:
Besides the information mentioned above, after the CCiC(Central China iGEMer's Consortium), we amplified our communication with other teams such as HZAU-China, NJAU-China, NUDT-China and so on, we also provided them with help, here is the brief introduction:
Before the CCiC, we convened a preparation meeting in WHU-China, and helped HZAU-China to formed CCiC. We also exchanged some parts with HZAU-China, such as dCas9 device(BBa_K1081000)(we constructed this part last year), and luxI generator： BBa_K1334030(we constructed the part this year)
Special thanks from HZAU-China
After communicating with NJAU-China, we knew that their program is related to dCas9 device, which we had constructed the last year, so we also provided them with BBa_K1081000.
Thanks from NJAU-China
After communicating with NUDT-China, we knew that both of our projects would use N-(3-oxododecanoyl"

Fudan,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," have, so the system can reach a stable state after a while. The initial differential equations and a simulation with appropriate parameters are both shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2. The initial differential equation set and its simulation. For convenience, we use A to represent for the PC chain, B to represent for the TC chain carrying the transcription factor, P to represent for their coalition, and R to represent for the transcription factor. Meanwhile, we use the footnote ""l"" to indicate that the substance has lost the transcription factor. That is, a TC chain out of transcription factor represented by Bl, and a coalition of Bl and A is represented by Pl.
There are product terms of independent variables in the initial equation set so that we can only obtain the numerical solution of it. We use the linear approximation system, obtained by the Taylor series expansion of those product terms, to find the analytical solution which is necessary for our exploring the relationships between system properties and parameters. Although Lyapunov Stability Theory states that the stability of the primary system can be represented by the stability of its linear approximation system only if some conditions are met[6][7], there is no doubt that the whole system will eventually reach a steady state[4].    By letting the equations of the linear approximation system to be equal to zero, we get the function about the relationship between dynamic range and the production abilities of the two chains. In order to be more realistic, we consider the effects of random errors, downstream leakage measurement errors and other factors on dynamic range, which are not significantly related to experimental parameters. In other words, we can regard their mean values as constants and consequently get Figure 3, in which we show the original dynamic range function on the left and the graph of ultimate DR function on the right.
Figure 3. The DR function and its graph. The horizontal and vertical coordinates indicate the production rate of TC and PC chains, respectively(the transfection concentrations of the two chains can be used to replace them in wet experiment), and the color indicates the size of DR.
Conclusion
The figure shows the existence of the maximun value of dynamic range, which is verified by the wet experiment. For instance, we can get the curve of DR when the ratio of the horizontal and vertical coordinates is constant, which is equivalent to the vertical cutting through the origin of Figure 3, as shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4. A way to maximize dynamic range.
In conclusion, our model reveals the intrinsic link between production rates and dynamic range. Thanks to it, we now have a clearer way to achieve a higher dynamic range.

Principle of Operation
Properties of selection system
The selection system consists of hybrid promoter and ccdB. AHL-LuxR complex and tetR input perform contrast effect. We perform several experiments to identify how the hybrid promoter work. The property is as shown below:
How different ""scores"" result in evolution
When high score and low score E.coli are grown seperately:
Low score produce little AHL and little tetR. High score produce more AHL and more tetR at the same time. Two kinds of E.coli will survive in their own way. They will both reach high population density.
What if we mix them together?
At first, two kinds of E.coli were mixed 1:1. Two kinds of E.coli maintain their own density state.
Average AHL level begin to change.Low score E.coli in the high level AHL circumustance will express more ccdB. Then the high score E.coli has a advantage over the low score.More high score ones will survive. The difference between score finally results in the evolution.

Scarab Genomics has bioengineered the Clean Genome® E. coli by deleting over 15% of the E. coli K-12 genome. Using synthetic biology methods, the K-12 genome was rationally designed by making a series of precise deletions, which included the elimination of non-essential genes, recombinogenic or mobile DNA, and cryptic, virulent genes. This genome reduction optimizes the E. coli strain as a biological factory, providing enhanced genetic stability and improved metabolic efficiency. These properties make the Clean Genome® the E. coli strain of choice for a wide spectrum of applications ranging from routine cloning to production of biological material for therapeutic purposes.
Scarab Genomics was established in 2002. The Clean Genome® E. coli is the result of Dr. Fred Blattner's research at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Scarab Genomics has licensed the patented reduced genome technology from Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation on an exclusive, worldwide basis.

Our team met with several plant pathologists at the Monsanto Research Center who have worked with wheat rust resistance genes, including Sr2, Lr34, and Yr18. They reviewed our project design, made recommendations of other experts in the field to reach out to, and discussed safety and legal restrictions for working with wheat rust fungi and germination of rust spores in a laboratory environment. They also explained interactions between effectors and other stem rust resistance genes, mentioning that many indirect interactions are so complex that often only direct interactions are studied in depth. In addition, they spoke about current global concerns about stem rust, new races of stem rust, and barberry eradication. In the United States, the only area currently having stem rust is the Pacific Northwest, and globally, most outbreaks of virulent races of stem rust are due to barberry; areas that have eliminated barberry successfully have had minimal outbreaks. Previously, we had intended on expressing the Sr35 intracellularly, where they would interact with AvrSr35 secreted by Pgt. However, they recognized that although AvrSr35 can enter wheat cells, it is not necessarily able to enter yeast cells, and suggested that we use Aga2 to display Sr35 on the surface of our yeast cells to eliminate the issue of AvrSr35 entering the yeast cells altogether. Although our project design focuses on demonstrating the interaction of Sr35 and AvrSr35 inside yeast cells first, we incorporated this advice into the future direction of our project by improving the Aga2 + linker (BBa_K416004) part in the iGEM registry so that it would later be ready to incorporate into our Sr35 mechanism.
St. Louis Indoor Produce (SLIP)
Working towards our goal to explore and learn more about unconventional farming methods in St. Louis, we visited SLIP, a, indoor hydroponics farm, on July 20th. Their farming methods solely uses water and nutrients to grow plants without soil, reducing transportation and water needs, as well the need for arable land and providing a new use for abandoned buildings. We first toured their facility to see how the plants are grown. They use vertical growing modules made from PVC towers to minimize space and use the nutrient film technique to cycle water and nutrients through. Some of their crops are grown exposed to natural sunlight with large window panes and others are grown in the basement with custom LED bulbs that emit limited wavelengths of light to optimize growth for each"

Figure 3: Equipment for nanoparticles synthesis
We characterized the nanoparticles using dynamic light scattering (DLS). This technique allows the determination of the size distribution profile of small particles in suspension. Indeed, small particles scatter light in all direction (Rayleigh scattering), but also undergo brownian motion. Hence, the intensity of the scattered light as a function of time is representative of the size of the particles. The first particles we made with this protocol have an average diameter of about 200 nm.

Biotinylating nanoparticles :
The next step was to biotinylate our nanoparticles.  Biotin is a  very small vitamin (244 Da) that binds very strongly to avidin and streptavidin proteins (Kd = 10 -15 M). Biotinylation was made using activated biotin (Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin), which binds primary amino groups (-NH2) and forms stable amide bonds. We used an ELISA-like assay to assess the biotinylation. It showed that biotin was indeed present on the nanoparticles. Classical Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) allows detection of an antigen using a correspondent biotinylated antibody, which in turn is detected by avidin-HRP. Since we wanted to detect biotin directly , we skipped the first part of the assay (i.e. we started directly by adding avidin-HRP). We detected HRP activity using TMB ELISA Substrate, yielding a blue color where HRP, hence biotin, has been detected. Upon addition of ELISA stop solution (2N H2SO4), the positive samples turned yellow. Quantitative data can be obtained by measuring absorbance at 412 nm with a plate reader.

Overview
BIT-China is now taking their third iGEM trip! This year we continued the fine tradition of our team, and hence we created Human Practice through large varieties of academic activities, which belongs to a significant part of our project, including giving preaches and training at school, project communications with plenty of universities in China and obtaining financial support from COFCO. Eventually, we accessed our project from three aspects, containing Risk Assessment, Feasibility Assessment and End-User Considerations.
Promotion
Many people are still unfamiliar with iGEM and synthetic biology though there were over 200 teams in last years’ competition. For promoting the concepts of synthetic biology and iGEM, we held several lectures about synthetic biology and iGEM in our university. After these lectures, we held a winter camp for recruiting and training new team members. In May, we contributed to Newsletter of Xiamen University, popularizing synthetic biology and advertising our project.
1.Lectures and Winter Camp[Collapse]
Fig.1 Lecture of synthetic biology and iGEM
After 2014 iGEM Giant Jamboree, we decided to hold synthetic biology lectures for promoting iGEM competition and synthetic biology and meanwhile recruiting new team members who are interested in synthetic biology.
The lectures are for all students in our university. Besides students from school of life science and technology, some students major in Electronic Engineering, Software and Art Design also attended these lectures. We invited Prof. Chun Li, team instructor of BIT-China, to make speeches at lectures. After these lectures, we recruited some new members with great passion for iGEM and opened our third iGEM trip.
Before project brainstorm, we conducted a winter camp for all potential members. In winter camp, we gave some basic knowledge and offered several classes for improving their fundamental research ability.

To analyze the electrochemical properties of AOX, a cyclic voltammetry experiment was performed to determine the reduction potential of AOX. 50µl of the K2HPO4 solution containing the AOX enzyme displayed on the surface of E. coli was put onto the test strip. Then, 20µl of 10% alcohol was added and mixed in the solution. As shown in Figure 2, the result indicated that a current peak (the current values at 2.0E-05~2.2E-05) was induced around the voltage of -1200 mV, implying that the AOX enzyme did undergo redox reaction. But the current was not much significantly changed when responding to the different concentrations of alcohol.
To improve the redox reaction, we added 200 µl of potassium ferricyanide (K3[Fe(CN)6]) as electron mediators to facilitate the transfer of electrons to electrodes. When mixed with various concentration of ethanol, the electric currents rose significantly (i.e., the higher current intensity between 2.6E-05~2.9E-05) and dose-dependently upon the increasing concentrations of alcohol around the voltage of -1200 mV (Figure 2).
Figure 3: The current strength of AOX enzyme with different concentration of ethanol in an amperometry experiment.
Amperometry is a way to detect the change of electric current along with the time (IT) in a given voltage. Followed the CV experiment, we’d like to know the current variation dependent on the different concentration of ethanol with the electric potential set at -1200 mV. As Figure 3 showed, the increased currents were measured along with the three different concentrations of ethanol (i.e., 0.385%, 0.741% and 1.071%), indicating the enhanced AOX enzyme activity was responding to the increasing concentration of ethanol.
Figure 2: The electrochemical properties of AOX enzyme with different concentration of ethanol in a cyclic voltammetry experiment.
Based on the data above, we plotted a concentration calibration curve (Figure 4) with a mathematical equation, which could be applied to estimate unknown concentration of alcohol samples using current strength.

Simulation Results
Using the model constructed in the previous section, we can run Monte Carlo simulations and obtain the terminal number of the microtubules that has been formed and their length distributions under different initial conditions. By the term “terminal” we mean that overall the system has reached a state where polymerization and depolymerization reach an equilibrium. Typically, to reach the terminal state, we have to run the simulation for a time period of 30 minutes. (This is the corresponding time of real-life experiments, not the time it takes for a computer to complete the simulation.)
Even after several simplifications made in the previous section, a simulation still takes a lot of time, with one complete simulation taking up to four and a half hours. Considering the stochasticity in the model, we have to run the simulation multiple times under each initial condition and take average over the trials to obtain meaningful results, which makes it even more time-consuming to run all the simulations we need. Therefore, we decided to first run some simulations on a simplified model to give an overview of the dynamics and verify the validity of our model before using the complete model to get the key results of interest.
Preliminary Simulation Using Simplified Model
We shall now run some preliminary simulations with a simplified model to see the effects of some parameters over the microtubule dynamics and verify the validity of our model.
To simplify our model to shorten the time of a simulation, we added the following assumptions.
Microtubules only polymerize and depolymerize on one end. Since “+” ends and “-” ends share similar characteristics and only differ by their rate constants, this is a reasonable simplification. It can cut the calculations almost by half.
Microtubules with GTP cap and GDP cap polymerize in the same rate. This again cuts the calculations by almost a half.
There are no regeneration of Tu-GTP in the solution. This is not too much of an oversimplification since the regeneration process is relatively slow.
Together, these assumptions reduce the time it takes to do one simulation from 4.5 hours to just about 30"

By using gas vesicle, we can carry out non-invasive imaging. We expect we can use ultrasound imaging to track the therapeutic bacteria to the nidus.
2. Then, using VioABDE designed by Cambridge 2009, utilized from SHSBNU 2017, we found it was a good candidate for the drug release since the product should be a small molecule which can diffuse out without cell lysis. So, we connect VioABDE to the pTlpA promoter, followed by TlpA39. In a real situation, we can use ultrasound tissue heating, to de-repress the pTlpA promoter, and activate the production of violacein, which is a precursor of antiphlogosis.
3. When the drug is released, we can keep heat the tissue. Using promoter pR followed by miniColicinE2 and Tcl42. So, when temperature reaches 42°C, miniColicin will be released, degrade the genome, and kill the bacteria.
