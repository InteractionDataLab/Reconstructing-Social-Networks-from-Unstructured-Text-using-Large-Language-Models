Only one sample showed severe growth impairment, which was the sample that was grown in 500mM NaCl (Organge curve on Fig. 8). These data indicates that B. subtilis would not have any problems in growing in the salt stress of our final co-culture setup.

Question: Can S. elongatus grow under osmotic stress?
Experiment: S. elongatus was inoculated into BG-11 medium with supplemented NaCl (0mM, 150mM, 300mM). The cells were incubated in a light chamber at 30 degrees at 250rpm for 4 days. OD at 730nm was measured twice a day during the time period.
Result: Inspired by the work of Ducat and coworkers, we use the cscB sucrose permease, which secretes sucrose out of the cell under osmotic pressure. The osmotic pressure is required to secrete the sucrose but it might affect the growth of the S. elongatus. We therefore tested its ability to grow in different salt concentrations, and the growth was obtained by measuring OD at 730nm (Fig. 9). As expected, S. elongatus grow best when no salt is present in its medium. This sample does not look like it has any trouble by growing, just as it is expected. However, when we then add salt to the medium S. elongatus will begin to be stressed. This can be seen by both the colour of the samples (Fig. 10) and the growth curves (Fig. 9). Surprisingly, the data for the S. elongatus grown in 300mM salt shows better growth than the sample with 150mM salt - at least up to hour 68 where after it begins to fall drastically (Green curve in Fig. 9).
This suggest that in long term S. elongatus would not be able to grow in 300mM NaCl without showing severe growth rates. S. elongatus grown in 150mM NaCl shows decreased growth, but the growth keeps increasing meaning that the cells survives but are under a lot of stress that makes them to grow slower than usual (Fig. 9 and 10)

Public recognition
We designed a questionnaire to get to know about the public recognition of energy crisis as well as clean energy. From the current data, we drew some conclusions as follows:
Ways to understand the current energy situation: Internet 83.33%, and 8.73% from newspapers, magazines, books, etc.
Confidence in the development of new energy: large development potential 68.25%, slow development 20.63%
For the ""new energy"" category of judgment: over 80% have a clearer understanding
Among them, biological energy and solar energy bear the highest expectations
More than half of respondents expressed willingness to try new energy drivers / related products, and 30% took a wait-and-see attitude
The application of new energy in society: more than 90% of respondents believe that the most useful way is to use electricity and provide transportation power
The price is too high, the quality of products is unstable and the use is inconvenient. It has become the first three reasons that prevent respondents from buying new energy products
Our vision
Green technology is the future, especially the biotechnology.
Our practice carried out practical investigation with multi-dimension, deeply explored current energy situation, the prospects for the development of a new focus on renewable energy. 
The team members actively interacted with professional expertise and conducted investigations of the energy enterprise learning its culture. Think about how to use synthetic biology methods to synthesize efficient and clean green energy.
Conclusion
What we have got through this part of human practice helps us have a better understanding of
1. The current energy policy in China
2. Investigations of energy enterprise operation mode and enterprise culture
3. Ideas on selecting the next experimental design to energy

Our basic Human Practices include the questionnaire, interview and policy survey. We expanded our Human Practices to many other aspects, during which we heard the voice from professors, veteran experts, entrepreneur managers as well as other teams. They represented some different views from the public and authorities, helping us to understand the project from different perspectives so that we could collect the feedback to interpret those results into our experimental design. Secondly, we set up our iGEM club to provide a platform for students to exchange academic knowledge.
Lastly, to improve public engagement of iGEM in China, we designed our own Chinese version brochures and postcards and distributed them to people who were interested in our project, and we received lots of valuable comments.

Palak I determined that one of the necessary elements in determining ideal pathway was flux balance analysis. I spent sometime looking into what the flux of a reaction is as well as how it is calculated. It turns out that the function in COBRA that finds the flux balance analysis uses a linear solver. I experimented with various linear solvers that are compatible with python interpreters. I found the NUMpy and SCIpy were the most useful modules. I also continued to learn how to program in python using several tutorials.

Biofuels
The rising cost of petroleum, coupled with the environmental concerns that go with its use, has led to a recent increase in biofuel research.  With this research has come developments in using bacteria to produce biofuels such as isobutanol and ethanol. These alcohols are favored because they can easily be swapped into our current infrastructure of car and truck engines. At Gaston Day School, we have decided to launch a biofuel-focused project. To create the alcohols, we are developing alcohol-resistant strains of E. coli through artificial selection. Also, we are using PCR to amplify and ligate the genes GlmZ, GlmY, and IlmV, which are used in native alcohol production. The combination of these genes and the alcohol resistant strains are the first steps in our new biofuels project.
Special Issues with an Isobutanol Resistant Strain of E. coli
Any bacterial strain that is resistant to an alcohol will have to be handled carefully. While isobutanol is not currently used as a cleaner, several other alcohols are. If there is cross-reactivity between the resistance pathways for isobutanol resistance and resistance to ethanol or to isopropanol, we could have a strain that is impervious to several standard cleaning methods. Atsugi, et al. (2010) stated that they did not see any decrease in sensitivity to ethanol in the isobutanol resistant strain developed in their lab. Studies are currently underway to determine if our isobutanol resistant strain shows any change in resistance to ethanol or to isopropanol. Cleaning procedures in the lab have been changed so that surfaces are decontaminated with 10% bleach since there is a possibility that the strain we are working with may be resistant to other alcohols.
If this strain becomes commercially useful, several options exist for decreasing the risk if the strain is accidentally released. Ideally, a kill switch can be incorporated in the strain that requires the presence of a suppressor molecule in the medium. If the strain is released, the suppressor will not be present which will activate the kill switch and prevent the released bacterium from surviving. Several variations of kill switches can be found in the Biobrick registry. K176036"

The products and services also relieve pain for our user by fitting within the current testing framework. Thanks to our detection window analysis, testing can be done at the frequency of regular inter-competition testing as executed by local doping authorities. Our test also facilitates compliance with data laws and athlethe privacy. Due to targeting specific DNA, only the data that is needed for a reliable test outcome is collected.
We have gathered expert knowledge on our process during our whole project. For a more in-depth analysis on which experts we spoke with and how they influenced our project, please see our integrated human practices page . We have written a collaboration proposal to Oxford Nanopore Technologies, as we are currently using their next generation sequencing platform as part of our detection workflow. Our proposal was received warmly. The relevant research department indicated that our proposal is of interest tothem and would fit well within their plans.
Our second step
Our second step is to gather enough funding to continue development.     In our project thus far, we have been supported by many institutions and companies who have made development up to this point a reality.
To cover future development costs, we can apply for a grant, or we can request backing from other funding sources, such as companies and institutes with budgets for research.      We choose to apply for a grant of 20.000 euros from the Partnership of Clean Competition (PCC). The PCC has supported anti-doping research since 2008, spending more than 17 Million US Dollars in support of innovative science. They received our application enthusiastically, and advised us to aim for the larger grant with an average of $225.000 without maximum. This second application is in preparation by the Brouns lab (TU Delft), our supervising lab, whose members are eager to continue our work. The Delft Sports Engineering Institute is willing to support us in this effort with their vast network in the professional sports world as well as with a financial contribution.
Our third and fourth steps
Our third and fourth steps are to develop and demonstrate a method that is efficient and properly scientifically validated. We have experienced great progress during the course of our project. Please see our results page for more information on our scientific achievements. What remains is to ensure that development will be continued in the future.

Hong_Kong-CUHK,2012,Team:Hong Kong-CUHK#SAFETY APPROACH_-_-_TEXT.html,". There are three types of CRISPR/Cas system. Here we only exploit type I-E from Escherichia coli (E. coli) to focus on expression and interference stage. This system presents potential in developing into a novel tool in order to reach higher safety standard of using engineered microorganism machine.
 
Foreign double strand DNA (dsDNA) will be targeted by the spacers from repeat-spacer region (RSR) and destroyed by one of the CRISPR/Cas components, Cas3. Through engineering the spacer sequence, theoretically we can target any dsDNA of sequence complementary to the spacer(s) [1].
By re-designing the targeting sequence, we can cleave the transformed plasmid in certain bacteria to reduce environmental hazard, or even manage to create a controlled suicide system to reduce leakage of genetic information from the bacteria. Thus our system provides an alternative to control safety level of engineered microorganism machine.

II. Biobrick design
Our biobrick is designed to be an integration of two parts, the protein part and the R-S-R part. Sequences of proteins Cas3 and cascade complex subunits are located in the upstream of the RSR system.
The number of the repeat and spacer are not fixed and the distance from the promoter does not affect the functionality.
The protein part in the biobrick is not essential for the system to work, as the type I-E CRISPR/Cas system is an endogenous system in E. coli. Since this part is designed to improve the sufficiency of system functionality, we choose to use Pveg, a strong constitutive promoter. This choice also makes it possible to utilize this system in other microorganisms where CRISPR system does not exist naturally, such as Bacillus subtilis.
To improve the efficiency for construction, we split them into two biobricks containing Cas3 and the R-S-R part, and synthesize them separately Therefore, when testing the system in E. coli, transformation of the R-S-R biobrick alone is enough for characterization.
(a) ‘Repeat’ design
A palindrome can be observed by studying some samples of repeat sequences of CRISPR system of E. coli. The secondary structure of pre-crRNA shows that the base pairing helps to form a loop, which may contribute to the Cas3 and Cascade in expression and interference stages of type-I CRISPR system.
From related research papers [2, 3], we obtained several repeat sequences of E. coli strain K-12. Although repeat sequences from different sources may not be exactly identical, similar characteristics"

Figure 1: The suggested workflow using pSB1A8YL described above. The workflow is broken down to three distinct steps: cloning, confirmation and expression. Cloning is the assembly of the construct, which is conducted in E. coli using typical cloning methods. Confirmation is where the identity of the construct is confirmed, using analytical methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), analytical restriction enzyme digestion and/or sequencing. Expression includes the work done in the final host organism, Y. lipolytica, and includes inserting the construct and optimization of the expression and cultivation conditions.

DESCRIPTION
Design
For the design of the plasmid, we decided to incorporate a high copy E. coli part for cloning and propagation of DNA. The design was based on the pUC19 vector as it fulfills the criteria of being high copy 4 , while perhaps being one of the most widely used cloning vectors for E. coli. To support the BioBrick standard, we only used the ampicillin resistance and replication origin elements of the plasmid. It was found that the sequence in and between these elements did not contain any restriction sites of any current BioBrick assembly standard, thus no further modification of the sequence was needed.
For the Y. lipolytica part of the plasmid we decided to base the design on the pSL16-CEN1-1(227), as it has been found to exhibit high transformation efficiency compared to similar plasmids 5 , and perhaps for this reason this plasmid and its derivatives are utilized in many recent studies. 6,7,8 Again, only the sequences of the replicative and selective elements were chosen. Although, the original sequence was not BioBrick compatible, and thus it was decided to order the sequence as a gBlock. This also introduced the added benefit of being able to incorporate the BioBrick prefix, suffix and a 5’ terminator in the gBlock and exchange the original leucine autotrophy marker with a uracil autotrophy marker allowing for negative selection of the plasmid with 5-Fluoroorotic Acid (5-FOA) 9 . In order to comply with the iGEM plasmid nomenclature 10 , the plasmid was dubbed “pSB1A8YL”, YL was added in the end to emphasize that the plasmid is used for Y. lipolytica.

Ligation
Ligation is the process by which target DNA gene is inserted into a plasmid. Both the plasmid and insert are prepared to have the sticky ends. These two kinds of DNA pieces are placed in a reaction tube and the proper DNA ligase, buffer, and cofactors are added for the reaction to take place. When done properly, the ligation will result in a successful combination of the insert and plasmid into one plasmid.

In previous fluorescent plate reader experiments , we have confirmed that these cells are able to fluoresce and that they can be excited at 405nm, the wavelength of our laser. To make sure the only output we were measuring was fluorescence, and not any ‘leakage’ of light from our laser beam, we also tested cells that were not transformed with the mCerulean BioBrick. These cells are not able to fluoresce after excitation at 405nm, so if the setup is working properly we should not get a signal from these cells.
The cells were adhered to the microscope slides using 3% agarose pads and imaged at an excitation intensity of 0.5 mW. This energy is low enough to not instantly photobleach the proteins, but observe fluorescence clearly.  Focusing on the cells was done manually with a 50x oil-immersed objective. The cells were excited with a Coherent OBIS LX 405nm laser and images were taken using a DeltaPix Invenio III CCD camera.
Results and discussion
Imaging the cells with the setup yielded the following results:
Figure 2: E. coli cells transformed with (A)OmpA-silicatein fusion plasmid and (B) mCerulean, imaged in our custom self-built optical setup. The cells were excited with a laser at a wavelength of 405nm and an intensity of 0.5 mW.
As we can see in figure 2B, the cells transformed with a gene for the fluorescent protein mCerulean are clearly visible. When using a strain transformed with a plasmid that is not known to cause the cells to fluoresce, in this case OmpA-silicatein, no light was observed, as shown in figure 2A. To confirm that this sample did contain cells, we also inspected the sample with light microscopy, as shown in figure 3.
Figure 3: E. coli cells transformed with the OmpA-silicatein fusion plasmid imaged in a widefield microscope to confirm the presence of cells.
In figure 3, we see that the negative control did contain cells, but we could not observe a fluorescent signal. From this we can conclude that we successfully built a setup that is able to observe and measure fluorescence in a cell. There is no leakage of light of our excitation laser in the camera, since we do not observe anything when we use non-fluorescent cells. Also at a higher excitation energy (50 mW) we did not observe"

Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Methodology_-_-_TEXT.html," throughout the experiment. The experience was also crucial to understand biological safety protocol.
Before designing our software, we looked at existing applications for the MS Surface and online applications that visualized programming languages and organized queries in unique ways. These applications included MoClo Planner, Scratch, and Blockly; among others. While working on zTree we looked through some photos of other 3D Tree structures and chose one that seemed appealing, usable, and interactive with the zSpace. With Bac to the Future , we looked at animation and social media to create a more interactive and engaging environment
Design
The next step in our user-centered design process was the Design phase, where we created low-fidelity prototypes of the software we envisioned developing while collaborating with our users. We brainstormed ideas together, and went through several iterations of mock-ups before we started developing and testing a high-fidelity prototype of our software. During the first few weeks of our summer research, we had a lengthy brainstorming discussion with our collaborators from BU and Agilent Technologies. We presented our ideas for Eugene software, our outreach program, and z-space software. Throughout the brainstorming session, users pointed out the practicality of our designs and where we could improve. After incorporating their feedback into our design, we then created a low-fidelity paper prototype for Eugenie which stepped through each step of our software. For our web application, Bac to the Future , we created a mock-up which served a similar purpose.
An example of a paper prototype we created during the early development stage.
During the design phase, we tested the usability of our software. Our first user studies for Eugenie occurred with introductory science students from Wellesley College.
Implementation
Wellesley community
members trying zSpace
After conducting our user studies, we started the implementation stage of our design process, which includes additional testing with synthetic biologists and refining our software past the basic functionality to improve design and efficiency. During this phase, we conducted additional user studies with the BU and MIT iGEM teams. We iterated on the visual design of Eugenie as well as adding small improvements which increased the usability of our software. With Bac to the Future, we conducted initial user studies with the MIT/Wellesley Upward Bound Program high school students to gauge the effectiveness of our application in communicating core synthetic biology concepts, as well as the level of engagement and fun our users experienced.
Evaluation

Overview
Platform
Autoinduction
Pill manufacture is not only concerned with drug release but also by synthesis, purification, packaging, storage, administration and quality control. The E.ncapsulator has been designed to address each of these important manufacturing considerations.
In a batch culture system, a defined volume of media is innoculated with a small number of cells. If the cells are being used for protein production, it is vital that synthesis is initiated at the right time. The optimum time for protein production is when there are a large number of rapidly dividing cells in a nutrient rich media.
In our system, the protein of interest is synthesised at the start of the production process in a phase known as Module 1 . Importantly, the time at which Module 1 starts is controlled by the addition of a chemical inducer called IPTG. This means that Module 1 can be initiated when there is the optimum ratio of cells to remaining nutrients.

Besides, we visited Shanghai Water Supply Authority (SWSA) to know about the present method of water treatment. The section chief, Mr. Zhang received our HP leader Kariny and communicated on water treatment method with her.
He told us although Shanghai has abundant water resource, it is a city with pollution-induced water shortage problem as well.
The desalination industry in these area focus on high quality pure water production, mostly produced by Reverse Osmosis membrane technology. For example, electronic products production water requires extremely high quality, whose TDS must be lower than 0.5 ppm. The source of water comes from normal water supply and has to go through a series of desalination process.
The visit to SWSA warns us that even with water shortage, such a global problem, we also have to consider the area condition that fitting our project. Combining this information with the water shortage report in the earlier article our project has to move to the area such as Tianjin so that it has more chances to prove itself.
Conclusion
Over all, it will take a long way to  bring bio desalination out of the lab. However, this part of our work has make this ""long way"" become clear and will be the instruction for the whole process flow.

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric"

Cell transdifferentiation
Cell therapy is of significant importance to regenerative medicine, which needs through specific lineage cell to access. The most efficient way to access the target cell is to access through cell transdifferentiation or cell reprogramming, and there are normally three methods to achieve it. The first one is that four transcription factors OSKM(Oct4,Sox2,Klf4 and c-Myc) were transfected into somatic cells by using lenti virus as the carrier, then somatic cells were reprogrammed into iPScs. After reprogramming, the iPScs were further differentiated to become many different types of specialized cells. It is worth noting that Gurdon and Yamanaka got the 2012’s Nobel price for this ground-breaking work. The second way is using lenti virus to carry different DNA that can cause the cell transdifferentiation to transfect each lineage-specific transcription factors directly into somatic cells. In this case, it can achieve a direct cell transdifferentiation way to get all kinds of specific lineage cells. The last method is to reprogram the cells into multipotent stem cells first, and then transferred through a specific transcription factor, or chemical induction, to obtain various types of cells.
However, these three methods have their pros and cons. The first method, seems perfect to introduce four transcription factors into a differentiated cell and sufficiently return it"
INSA-Lyon,2010,Team:INSA-Lyon#Safety#Ethics#Challenges_-_-_TEXT.html," planned to realize an anticipated and oriented evolution. In animals, Fatty-Acid-Synthase (FAS) is a multi-domain enzyme. It’s a very efficient way to synthesize fatty acids like Eicosa-Pentanoic Acid, involved in brain metabolism and prevention of Alzheimer disease. But in bacteria, this multi-domain enzyme doesn’t exist, and production of such lipids is not very efficient. That’s why we try to model a bacterial FAS, to over express important lipids for biomedical aims. It would be a real medicinal solution for many cerebral diseases. But it corresponds to an oriented evolution. During billions of years, bacteria never express such a multi-domain enzyme, whereas animals evolve in other way… Is it our right to induce this change?
And we always get the same questions: can the human kind orient Life the way they need it to, the way they want it to ? Are we orienting or disorienting the Evolution ? Will we reorient Life our way just to make profits?
Some societal and religious basis are involved in these questions, and it is a tough subject to talk about. And the problem of awareness and competency of the persons doing Synbio is engaged. Can the genetic manipulation be the fact of anyone ? In the future, will there be a license which allowed people to create life? Will it be free, like open sources software ?

Jack Bauer Vs Synbio ? Bioterrorism, open-sources and fairer world
It brings another usual scientific problem: the misappropriation of the science progress to make some weapons. It exists since the beginning of the world: the fire, the powder, the nuclear energy … Will Synbio be the next? A trivial application, maybe like our system of regulation, could become a part of a bioweapon? It’s clear that an international regulation is necessary. But who is the most competent, able to create and apply it: government, scientists, public? A consultation with all the actors would be a first step in this process.
To fix it, we have to consider as well the problem of the intellectual property. Nowadays, Synbio doesn’t have rules. The BioBricks sent to MIT are open sources, but some of the products of others researches are patented. The principal problem of the open sources is the access to sequences that we cannot control the use. And with the potential of all these sequences, new weapons could be designed. The development of free data base, like NCBI, allows people to make comparison between"

We take two major industrial in Taiwan for example, which are China Steel Corporation (CSC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). We had done some research on annual emission and calculated with our CO2 utilization efficiency. We also set the average carbon emission of small and medium enterprise (SME) as a standard goal which was easier to reach. Therefore, we can model the scale of E. coli carbon utilization system working for 1 % CO2 emission of different enterprise.

Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM competition isn’t very standardised. Consequently the Leeds iGEM team decided to think of ways we could improve this. In the end the idea created was, The Ethics Assessment Form.
The Ethics Assessment Form is based on Safety assessment form which are commonly used everyday in workplaces and labs. The basic idea behind the form is to identify any ethical problems there may be with the research your iGEM team is undertaking and then to see how severe the ethical impact would be if nothing were to change. This is done by using a score table where the severity of the ethical consideration and the risk of the ethical consideration in question are rated on a scale of 1-5 and then the ratings multiplied to get a final score of the severity of the ethical consideration. The chart incorporates a colour scheme, which tells you for each score given whether action needs to be taken against the ethical consideration. Green means that the ethical impact is low, yellow means that small changes could be made in order to make the project more ethical and red means that action should be taken as the consideration is very unethical and will cause problems.
The form is split into sections that, after research and through doing outreach activities, are what we think the main areas of concern when it comes ethics in Synthetic Biology. These sections are; Economical Implications, Legal Implications, Bioterrorism Risks, Accidental Release, Testing and Damage to the Environment.
For each of the sections there are four intersections to consider when dealing with the ethical implications of each point raised. These sections are; Identify, Control, Inform and Review. As a brief explanation of the sections; Identify involves finding the ethical considerations within your project to do with the section in question, e.g. Damage to the Environment, then taking the consideration that has been identified, the Control section allows you to think about ways to minimise the ethical impact and how you will control it. The Inform section is for showing how you will ensure the public that there implications of the project are nothing to worry about; this is an important section as the public play a huge role in ethics within Synthetic Biology and scientific research in general. Then after the project has been finished the Review section allows the team to go back over ethical considerations they had at the beginning of the project and see if they have addressed them all or if anything has changed, as most projects do not stay the same as they were at the beginning of the research. By considering each of the sections, it allows the concern in question to be fully explored and understood.

Is there something wrong with the transformed construct, maybe a mutation?
Was the laccase synthesized but is inactive for some reason?
Was the laccase produced but not in a high enough amount so that we can´t detect its activity in the first place?
Another thought was that there might be copper missing. Since laccase is a copper-enzyme it might be necessary to add copper to the medium whenever it is produced in such high amounts. It´s late, so we will do that tomorrow.

Cell extracts from cultivations were incubated with 2 mM copper sulfate for 2 h and measured for activity via OD420.
Cell extracts from cultivations were incubated with 4 mM copper sulfate for 2 h and measured for activity via OD420.
Team Activity Test:  Today is copper day! First we divided each sample (the ones from yesterday) and added 2mM or 4mM copper sulfate to the halfs, respectively. We incubated our samples for 2h and hoped that the concentration gradient would cause the laccases to exchange the ion they have integrated instead against copper. We measured their activity again after those 2h but there was no change seen. Team Cultivation plans to add copper from the very beginning of cultivation next time.

UCSC Bioethics in the 21st Century: Science, Business, and Society
As is tradition for UCSC iGEM teams, we presented our project to the UCSC summer session class Bioethics in the 21st Century: Science, Business, and Society. The purpose of the presentation was to explain our project, gather feedback on the ethical implications of our project, and inform students on campus about iGEM. Prior to speaking to the students, we considered potential ethical issues with the project, such as cultural differences regarding attitudes towards contraceptives and biosafety of engineering the Yali genome. Our presentation included a brief overview of the iGEM competition, an explanation of the goals of PoPPY, a discussion of the genes to be inserted, the methods we considered for insertion into the genome, and the questionnaires we sent out. Following the brief presentation, the class broke into smaller groups with one iGEM member per four students. In those small groups, we discussed the potential ethical issues of our project in more detail. Many students offered perspectives on our project that we hadn’t considered before. For example, some students offered additional questions to improve the questionnaire. Sandra Dreisbach, one of the Bioethics professors, also encouraged us to contact the UCSC Institutional Review Board (IRB) to have them review our questionnaire and approve it for distribution. As part of the final project for their class, the bioethics students will make recommendations on how the ethics of our project can be improved.
OPERS Festival 2018
At the beginning of each year, UC Santa Cruz throws a festival on campus where clubs, organizations, and research teams come together in one place to showcase their work and what is to come in the following year. This festival is a great opportunity to get the community excited about extracurricular activities and encourage them to participate, and iGEM was no exception. To prepare for the festival, our team worked on perfecting a poster to display at the booth. We also created small quarter-flyers to hand out to those interested. The flyers contained general information about iGEM and how to go about joining the following year's team. We printed a total of 200 flyers and ran out only an hour into the festival. We received hundreds of signatures of those wanting to sign up for the iGEM mailing list to learn more. All our iGEM members wandered"

However, due to the problem of BBa_K2197300, in which there is no difference of the green fluorescence levels between the one with lower uric acid concentration and higher uric acid concentration, we cannot determine whether it can really lower the level of uric acid.

Assay D is an experiment designed to prove the validity of BBa_K2197500 and BBa_K2197502. By incubating engineered cells (BBa_K2197500), cells (BBa_K2197502) and Competent cells with different concentrations of uric acid, then adding engineered cells (BBa_K2197300) after 30 minutes, we measure the Green fluorescence level in a plate reader. We expect that the columns with engineered cells (BBa_K2197500) and engineered cells (BBa_K2197502) will have less green fluorescence expressed when comparing to the column containing competent cells. As theoretically, engineered cells (BBa_K2197500) will absorb uric acid into the cell and for engineered cells (BBa_K2197502), the higher the concentration is, the more uric acid will be absorbed into the cells. So by adding engineered cells (BBa_K2197300) which express more GFP when there is more uric acid, the green fluorescence level of the columns with engineered cells (BBa_K2197500 and BBa_K2197502) will be lower than the columns with competent cells although they were in the same concentration at the beginning.
Steps and Result
We first pipette the cells (BBa_2197500, BBa_K2197502, competent cells) into different concentrations of uric acid and incubate them in 96 well plate for 30 minutes. After that, we add engineered cells (BBa_K2197300) into the wells and incubate for another 30 minutes. Then, we put it into the plate reader for the measurement of green fluorescence level.
However, due to the problem of BBa_K2197300, in which there is no difference of the green fluorescence levels between the one with lower uric acid concentration and higher uric acid concentration, we cannot determine whether it can really lower the level of uric acid.

PROJECT
Our project aims to design a bacterial reprogrammable binary memory (EPROM) with genetically engineered E.coli. To engineer bacteria we designed a genetic Flip-Flop formed by an epigenetic memory sensitive to IPTG -for the memory reset- and an UV-sensitive trigger to set the memory ON. We designed the Flip-Flop circuit by model-based analysis and computer simulation. The core elements are two mutually regulated promoters. Each of them is composed of a constitutive promoter and an independent operator sequence. Thus, transcriptional strength and repressor binding affinity can be independently fixed. Since operator sites are still lacking in the Registry as standard parts, we cloned operator sequences for LacI, TetR, Lambda and LexA repressors and established an experimental procedure to characterize them. These parts allow the rational design of regulated promoters and we expect them to be a benefit in many Synthetic Biology applications. Click here for more information...
TEAM
The leading idea behind the UniBO Team was to put in touch students of the same University with different backgrounds to favor competence and skill sharing. Students from different Faculties (Biotechnology, Pharmacy and Engineering) answered to the iGEM call and formed the TEAM. They were moved by a common desire for new experiences and they decided to participate in this exciting competition to go deep in Synthetic Biology. The Team worked hard during the summer to become fully operative, overcoming differences both in training and personality.

MODELING
Mathematical model analysis and computer simulations were used to design the Flip-Flop circuit. We resorted to this engineer’s approach  to obtain a  rational design of regulated promoters, that are the core element of the circuit.  By the model we found the analytic relationships to quote the regulated promoter in terms of transcriptional strength and sensitivity to the repressor. By model-based computer simulation we established such a relevant circuit properties as the bistability and the dynamical response to inputs. A simple procedure to characterize the operator sequence was theoretically derived. Enjoy yourself!
SOFTWARE
Into this section you can find two software tools developed in our lab for this competition and that we would like to share with other Teams. One tool is a bacteria fluorescence image analyzer that segments the bacteria, counts their number, computes the size and the fluorescence intensity for each segmented bacterium."

The results showed that all enzymes could co-express as a soluble protein with P2A peptide acting as a linker and F2A could work as the same as in eukaryotic system. Moreover, the resulting engineered E. coli exhibited an excellent capability for the degradation of TCP and γ-HCH.
Project Story
γ-isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH)
HCH, formerly known as benzene hexachloride (BHC), is one of the now notorious organochlorine group of insecticides. About 600,000 tons were used throughout the world between the 1940s and the 1990s to control a wide range of agricultural, horticultural, and public health pests.[2,3] Mounting concerns about its nontarget toxicity and persistence have since caused it to be deregistered in most countries[2], but it is very stable in the environment[2,7] and it is still being manufactured in India for local and export uses, so residue problems will continue for many decades.[2] The majority of HCH waste has been discarded in the open or stored at various levels of containment near the production sites, HCH residues at many of the sites have percolated into the soil and then contaminated ground water.[2] Residues of HCH have now been reported for many countries in samples of air[8,9] water[10] soil[10,11,12]food commodities[13,14,15] and even from human blood samples.[16,17]
1,2,3-Trichloropropane (TCP)
1,2,3-Trichloropropane (TCP) is a toxic synthetic chlorinated hydrocarbon that is not known to occur naturally[20]. It is used as a chemical intermediate in organic synthesis, as a solvent, and as an extractive agent. In addition to these intentional uses, TCP is produced in considerable amounts as a by-product from the manufacture of epichlorohydrin. TCP does not noly contaminate soil, it also leaks down into groundwater and settles down at the bottom of the ground water reservoir because TCP is more dense than water. This makes TCP in its pure form a DNAPL (Dense Nonaqueous Phase Liquid) and it is therefore harder to remove from groundwater[19]. Groundwater and soils in various parts of the United States and in Europe are polluted with TCP as a result of improper disposal of TCP-contaminated effluents and due to the past use of the"

All wet lab experiments are hosted at the University of Lethbridge Chemistry and Biochemistry department. The lab itself is a Containment Level One which “requires no special design features beyond those suitable for a well-designed and functional laboratory. Containment is achieved through the use of practices normally employed in a basic microbiology laboratory.” - Public Health Agency of Canada.
Other precautions are taken to further provide a safe work environment for team members. Prior to any lab work, students are required to come in lab-appropriate attire: long pants, closed-toed shoes, and tied-back long hair. Further equipment is given to the student for extra protection such as lab coats, safety glasses, and gloves. All labs at the University of Lethbridge are equipped with fire extinguishers, emergency showers, eyewash stations, and first aid kits in case of dire situations. WHMIS training is provided to all students before any wet lab experiments, and advisor supervision is provided at all times to further ensure safety.
To address biosafety, the University of Lethbridge has a Risk and Safety Services committee tasked with ensuring a safe work environment is upheld by all labs within the institution. The goal of the committee is to “... educate, mentor, foster and grow an environment to all members of the University of Lethbridge community where each accepts an individual and shared responsibility in growing a culture that is rich in the assessment, management and control of risk and safety.” - U of L Risk and Safety Services.
The Risk and Safety committee is aware of Lethbridge iGEM and of our project. They support our work as long as we follow the Laboratory Safety Guidelines outlined by ""Health Canada: Public Health Agency of Canada.""
The potential harm of our system is the escape of our system into the purified water after wastewater treatment and tailings ponds, which could disrupt the ecosystem once the water is released back into the river.
Although our system could potentially escape into the environment if it is integrated into wastewater treatment, it is unlikely. This is because we would ensure UV disinfection. UV disinfection causes damage to genetic material, causing microbial inactivity, as the organisms cannot replicate. Even in the case that our organism escapes, it would be unlikely that it would cause detriment to the environment because we engineered them"
Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," on mice are not the same as they are on humans. A valid point, as both Warfarin and Aspirin are glaring examples of this. There was a little more movement in the room, until we mentioned that soon it will be possible to grow human organ tissues from single cells, and then integrate these into a lab-scale human analogue ! This would eliminate the need for testing on both animals and humans, as tissue samples could be personalised to each patient’s genetic information, and tested in the lab. Upon hearing this, the students agreed that this would be the best approach, even if it did make use of cloning techniques, as it didn’t look to produce full human clones, but merely tissue samples of a few thousand cells.
The group also felt that the public should have more of a say in what should and shouldn't be researched. This is a valid point, but would it really be feasible? There are a lot of different opinions expressed within the public and some will agree with undertaking the research you propose whilst others will not. Which opinion do you then let influence you; do you do the research or not? Clearly, the public need to know what is going on in the field of research but how should their opinion influence whether the research goes ahead? On the other hand, governments have a more influential voice when approving research, especially as most research grants come from them. Is it the government’s place to listen to the public’s opinion and then make a decision based on that whether the research should go ahead? This potentially creates a highly politicised environment, that may not be beneficial to research. However, the group still felt that there ought to be more public say in science, adding that it would help to engage the public with science. Examples of attempts at this can already be seen with platforms such as MicroRyza taking cues from crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and IndieGoGo and applying them to science.
Perhaps one of the most interesting issues raised was that of intellectual property rights, control of technology and the effect on economies. The students as a whole were not as engaged with this idea, although a few certainly brought up some interesting points. For example, one student questioned what happens when you develop a device, who actually has control over it? If a government or corporation control it, then can they be trusted to use it properly ( Monsanto , for example, are already under scrutiny for a potential containment issue). Alternatively, what if the device you develop could disrupt the entire economy of another country , is it right to do so? Certainly, it is clear that Synthetic Biology could have far-reaching consequences, and it is appropriate to"

Overview: our journey outside the lab!
Our multidisciplinary approach: Silver medal
Brainstorming approach
The idea of our project was conceived after the biggest cholera outbreak in Congo this year. Indeed this scourge is transmitted annually through wastewater during monsoons season and there is no way to end it, but to establish                 a sewage system throughout Africa. Cholera causes severe dehydration by vomiting and diarrhea and can be fatal if prompt management is not performed. Therefore, we directly contacted the Doctors Without Borders and the Red Cross Association who were on site to set an angle of attack. We wanted current epidemics data and we aimed at targeting a real problem! Following this, we imagined a way to neutralize the bacteria. We hope to find a                 solution that would make the water drinkable and once this water has been used, it would treat the already contaminated water, thanks to the remaining plasmids.
Our colleague Sara, medical student and iGEMer, went to Benin, West Africa, for collecting data on epidemics and helping local populations! More info in our “INTEGRATED HUMAN PRACTICES PART”
For our neutralizing approach we first thought about a phage-based system. We were followed and supported by Jean-Paul Pirnay, from the Royal Military Hospital Queen Astrid in Brussels. Belgium is the leading country for                 the phage therapy in Europe and actively participated in the PhagoBurn project. Phages are among the most amazing tools to fight multi-resistant bacteria! This prompted us to put the antibiotic resistance at the center of our                 project!
We established a good partnership with the Military Hospital and they will later test our system on their V.Cholerae strains.
After a fruitful brainstorming at the military hospital, posing with a cool vintage military ambulance                     From right to left: Antoine, Dr. Jean-Paul Pirnay, Mathieu, Célestin, Sara and Luca
We later decided to keep the same goal, but to change vector. We switched from a phage to a plasmid as we were all more comfortable working with it. For the choice"

We are sincerely grateful to Dr. Jeff Elhai (Virginia Commonwealth University), Dr. Peter Wolk (Michigan State University), James Golden (University of California, San Diego) for their crucial help and guidance with cyanobacterial transformation.
Triparental mating: Our desired construct (from the donor strain) and a helper plasmid are inserted into a helper strain. The helper strain and conjugative strain are spotted with the recipient Anabaena for the three-parent mating
PowerCell Transformation
Anabaena culture after triparental mating (bright field light micrograph)
Same Anabaena culture showing GFP expression in successful transformant
We transformed the final PowerCell construct into Anabeana using the methods described above. Expression of GFP is clearly visible, indicating the transformation was successful. Some non-transformants can be seen in the background.
We selected for our transformants using neomycin, and let the cultures grow.
Left: BG11(N-) w/o neomycin selection + 50µl of the original conjugation mixture. Middle: BG11(N-) with neomycin + 50µl of the original conjugation mixture. Right: BG11(N-) with neomycin + 50µl of WT Anabaena.
The initial selection looked promising. The left-most culture tube contains BG11(N-) w/o neomycin selection + 50µl of the original conjugation mixture. Both transformed and untransformed Anabaena should be able to grow in this mixture. As expected, this culture tube has the highest cell density. The middle culture tube contains BG11(N-) with neomycin + 50µl of the original conjugation mixture. Only Anabaena containing our plasmid should be able to grow in this mixture. As desired, growth is still visible, but is less dense. The right-most tube contains BG11(N-) with neomycin + 50µl of WT Anabaena. Nothing should be able to grow here. As expected, everything in this tube is dead.
Transformed Anabaena showing cell-type specific GFP fluorescence under the control of the pSac promoter. GFP expression is on in vegetative cells, off in heterocysts. Some background fluorescence from chlorophyll is visible.

Secondary Objective: Solving vitamin A deficiency in the developing world
We have also been continuing the work of our 2007 team in engineering Escherichia coli to produce the vitamin A precursor β-carotene. Vitamin A is required for vision and a healthy immune system. 250,000-500,000 children in the developing world lose their vision each year, half of them dying within 12 months of this ( WHO ).
Further Considerations
In the pursuit of our project, as well as the biological aspects, we:
considered aspects of scale-up , including the ethical, legal and social implications of our potential final product, MicroMaize,
programmed a new piece of software for use in metabolic modelling,
developed and tested a number of new techniques to make the process of creating BioBricksTM that little bit easier,
collaborated with the University of Guelph team , sharing carotenoid synthesis genes, flux modulators, and gram positive plasmids.

Linkoping_Sweden,2015,Team:Linkoping Sweden#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," change from epitope to Ara h 1 is done by changing one protein for                     the                     other, independently of the dissociation of proteins. In model 2 on the other hand, the change from                     epitope to Ara h 1 is instead dependant of the protein dissociation.
Using the modelling and simulation tool Wolfram SystemModeler the following models were then                     created:
Figure 1. Model 1. Mathematical model for the biological process. White circles indicate                     product                     and                     blue                     indicates substrate. Green circles represent the concentrations of the different constituents                     that                     build                     the process. The reaction rates in the process are denoted k1-2-3.
Figure 2. Model 2. Mathematical model for the biological process. White circles indicate                     product                     and                     blue indicates substrate. Green circles represent the concentrations of the different                     constituents                     that                     build the process. The reaction rates in the process are denoted k1 and k3.
These models were then used in combination with an estimate, `U_(conversion)`, of the detectors                     electrical,                     optical and biological effects to describe the full detection system.
`U_(RFPconversion)=I_(flux)*epsilon*l*Bp*D_(befo                     re)*E_(FRET)*Q_(RFP)*D_(after)*Lp_(RFP)*E_(RFP)*R/(6.241*10^18)`
`U_(FITCconversion)=I_(flux)*epsilon*l*Bp*D_(befo                     re)*Q_(FITC)*D_(after)*Lp_(FITC)*E_(FITC)*R/(6.241*10^18)`
The optical restrictions that the filters exert on the photon flux are described by BP and LP for                     the                     band pass and long pass filters respectively4, 5, 6. `D_(befo re)` and `D_(after)` are estimates                     of                     how the                     dimensions of the detector affect the photon flux. The fluorophores, fluorescein isothiocyanate                     (FITC)                     and red fluorescent proteins (RFP) quantum yield, Q, affects the flux as well as the förster                     resonance                     energy transfer (FRET) interaction, `E_(FRET)`, between the fluorophores7, 8, 9. The amount of                     absorbed                     photons by the FITC fluorophores is determined by the absorbance of the solution, calculated with the                     path length, l, the molar attenuation coefficient, `epsilon`, and the molar concentration used in                    "

so by taking  $$t_{1/2}=\frac{ln(2)}{d_{GFP}}$$
from experimental curves, we find
$$d_{GFP} = 4.9 . 10^{-3} min^{-1}$$
For initial AHL concentrations much lower than KmAHL=0.3 nM, we find $$\frac{d[GFP]}{dt}=LeakyLux+\frac{k_{mRNAGFP} k_{GFP} \alpha_{LuxR}^2}{d_{LuxR}^2(Km_{Lux}^2+\alpha_{LuxR})} \frac{[AHL]^2}{K_{mAHL}^2}-d_{GFP}[GFP]$$
and thus a steady state $$[GFP]=\frac{Constant}{(d_{GFP}-2d_{AHL})}(e^{-2d_{AHL}t}-e^{-d_{GFP}t})$$
This curve has a maximum at
$$t_{max}=\frac{1}{d_{GFP}-2d_{AHL}}ln\big(\frac{d_{GFP}}{2d_{AHL}}\big)$$
This way we can find from experimental curves  $$d_{LuxAHL}=4,0.10^{-3} min^{-1}$$
Leakiness
The leakiness of promoters is a major issue in our system. As the signal propagates row-wise, error diffusion could lead to a totally different pattern. The goal is then to control the leakiness. This issue was particularly observed and adressed in the case of the Lux promoter during our experiments set . This leakiness is dependent on LuxR concentration in the cell(see our biobrick characterization in the Registry for more information).
Leakiness was modeled as an offset in the classical Hill function.
$$rFluo = a + b \frac{[AHL]^n}{K_m^n + [AHL]^n}$$ $$\text{where rFluo is the relative fluorescence (absolute measured fluorescence value over OD),}$$ $$\text{a the basal expression rate (Leakiness),}$$ $$\text{b the maximum fold expression rate,}$$ $$"

His story inspired the iGEM teams to go further and push through their limits in this project. Afterwards enjoyed tasteful dinner, were team members socialized and shared their excitement about Boston! Everyone had a great time and got to know their fellow iGEM students a bit better, we all share a common goal and that made it a little easier to break the ice.  After dinner the teams presented their poster, everyone could freely move and ask questions when necessary. In this way they were able to change some of the details, so the posters would be perfect for Boston. We finished with a great group picture and a gift for everyone, our heart shaped stress balls as memorabilia to our event.
We would like to thank all the people who were present: Bram, Thijs and Josine from iGEM Amsterdam. Dawa and Robert form iGEM Munich. Svenja, Johanna, Sergio, Michael and Thori from iGEM Aachen. Paul, Nicolas, Gabrielle, Agathe, Antoine, Alicia and Eliott from iGEM Ionis Paris. We had an amazing day with you and can’t wait to meet you in Boston.
EOS Blog
Aside from direct contact with kids, adults, patients and experts, we wanted to reach a bigger number of people at once. ‘Eos’ is a well-known scientific magazine designed to bring scientific news and developments to a Dutch-speaking audience with both scientific and non-scientific backgrounds. Naturally, we considered Eos an ideal environment to publish something about our iGEM project, given its broad target group.
We started by kindly asking Eos to write an article about us. As we expected, they kindly declined. However, they surprisingly offered us a writer’s account on their website, and the opportunity to write one or more articles our self. Without hesitation, we accepted this opportunity thankfully, and started writing.
In total, we wrote four articles about iGEM. In the first one, we described how we got started with iGEM, and how we came up with our HEKcite project. Secondly, we wrote about the ‘dark’ side of science. The part of research where everything goes wrong, and how to deal with that. In our third article, we gave a more loose description of our activities outside the lab (sponsoring, meetings, education projects…). In our fourth and final article, we published a quick overview of our scientific results, and future directions.
According to the staff of Eos, every article"

Introduction
Currently licensing of community-created biological parts is very similar to the situation on software scene before General Public License (aka. GNU GPL) was created.
There are many great parts and devices created by the community members and released freely to the community. In addition there is very little awareness of keeping community-developed parts and their derivatives free-as-in-freedom, meaning that the work is available free of charge but can also be freely accessed and used by anyone to create new parts that still remain in the Public Domain.
This can lead to the situation when work which was intended to remain in the Public Domain would be patented as a part of some project and the results of this project would not be returned to the community. Moreover this allows the situation in which it's legal to remove original author attribution information from parts containing elements developed by others.
We recommend that all biological parts released to the community should be licensed in a way that ensures that the original part as well as all other parts using it can be obtained, used and modified without any limitations.
We also recommend that single licensing scheme based on Creative BioCommons licenses (see below), a Creative Commons derivative applied to biological parts, should be adopted by synthetic biology community.
This will ensure that original author attribution information has to be included when a"

Tacoma_RAINmakers,2018,Team:Tacoma RAINmakers#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," stuck in the pipette. We did all these calculations based on the fact that we planned on doing 8 PCR reactions (8 PCR tubes). Before beginning the process of adding all the reagents to our PCR tubes, we needed to determine how long the extension part of PCR should be based on the base pair count of our product. Running a PCR simulation of Snapgene allowed us to find the exact base pair count of our positive control, which is 1597 base pairs. From this, we found that the extension period should be 1 minute and 36 seconds.
After adding all of our reagents together into 8 PCR tubes, we needed to select single colonies from transformation plates from 6/19/18. We determined that 6 of our PCR tubes would have the positive control, 1 would be the negative control and the last tube would have no DNA. Once we selected a single colony and put the DNA into a PCR tube, we streaked it onto a new plate (cut up in 8 different sections for each 8 different colonies) and labeled them 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (positive control), 7 (nothing) and 8 (negative control). We then incubated this new plate so that more colonies would grow. Finally, we put our PCR tubes in a thermocycler and ran our PCR.
Blunt-End Digestion and Ligation of pSB1C3 and Inserts
Designing plasmids with individual inserts becomes slightly complicated, as each insert contains a SalI site that is not compatible with the BioBrick prefix/suffix of the backbone. Hence, Tacoma RAINmakers preferred blunt-end ligation, rendering the incompatible ends irrelevant.
Additionally, each insert was digested with its respective enzyme and filled in with T4 polymerase in preparation for blunt-end ligation.
Week 5 - Week 7
We re-started the cloning process with fresh PCR products and more vector. We re-ligated our pSB1C3 backbone with our PcArsR+SpisPink/PcArsR+amilCP insert several times with only negative results. We decided to re-ligate PcArsR + chromoprotein (spisPink or amilCP), as there were speculations that something went wrong in the initial ligation of the two. This ligation contained 3 uL of PcArsR, 3 uL of chromoprotein (spisPink or amilCP), 1x T4 DNA Ligase Buffer, 1.5U T4 DNA Ligase,"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#CFPS_-_-_TEXT.html," add exactly the components to the reaction that are needed, for example additional co-factors, inducers or catalysts. One recent example is the use of an engineered enzyme to maintain a stable pH without the need of a chemical buffer ( Kim et al., 2015 ). Depending on the system, it is possible to use linear DNA or RNA as a template, skipping ligation or reverse transcription ( Rosenblum and Cooperman, 2014 )
Click here to see how we modelled our self-made cell extract!
One advantage of the clearly defined environment the cell-free reaction takes place in, is that ""[...] it should be possible to build a complete mathematical model describing the cellular mimic that could aid in designing new features."" ( Lentini et al., 2013 ). Recent approaches have been made to mathematically model and characterize the PURE system ( Karzbrun et al., 2011 ; Stögbauer et al., 2012 ; Mavelli et al., 2015 ).
Regarding Synthetic biology, CFPS emerged as a valuable tool, with the long-term potential to not only be integrated into, but create whole new fields of research. With CFPS, the synthesis of proteins that would kill the cells used for production became possible, just to mention for example antibiotic-like proteins ( Xu et al., 2005 ; Yang et al., 2012b ). The incorporation of non-natural amino acids into proteins via in vitro translation with appropriate Aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetases enables construction of proteins with completely new functionalities (for a review, see Quast et al., 2015b ).
The advantages of bacterial extracts are fast translation rate and flexibility. For example it is possible to synthesize complex molecules like proteins that contain disulfide-bonds and even membrane proteins with the help of E. coli extract ( Billerbeck et al., 2013 ; Kimura-Soyema et al., 2014 ; Roos et al., 2014 ). CFPS with eukaryotic cells is another option. Recently, synthesis of 80 µg/mL eYFP was reported with the use of BY-2 cell lysates  ( Buntru et al., 2015 ). Compared to other eukaryotic lysates, Buntru et el. showed that BY-2-lysates are cost effective (3$ for a 15 µl reaction). It is interesting that it is possible to combine extracts from E. coli with eukaryotic extracts, and that this combination can help to produce active, properly folded protein ( Zárate et al"

BIT-China,2013,Team:BIT-China#modeling.html_-_-_TEXT.html," regulatory relationship of these genes. (b) is the detailed diagram of the GRN of the quorum control system.
When the number of cells increased to a certain extent, the gene regulatory network was started to control the number of live cells.
Method description
Currently, there are a variety of models, such as the directed graph model, Bayesian network model, Boolean network model, ODE models and stochastic differential equations models, could be applied to the analysis, modeling and simulation of gene regulatory networks.
ODE models implicitly assumes that the underlying quantities, i.e., concentrations or molecule numbers, vary in a continuous and deterministic fashion. However, at the molecular level these assumptions are mere approximations which might not accurately reflect the underlying dynamics, especially when the number of molecules involved is ""small"", such as is the case for transcription factors, which, in certain circumstances, can be expressed at low levels, i.e., a few tens of molecules, or for chromosomal DNA, for which a single copy exists in the cell.
Intrinsic stochasticity at the molecular level may not be neglected any more when small numbers of molecules are involved (since in this case the ""averaging"" out of stochastic effects due to the application of the law of large numbers does not hold any more). Therefore, stochastic models have to be considered.
The system may contain rare, discrete, but critical events and continuously occurring deterministic or stochastic transitions.
Stochastic simulation of protein degradation
A is the chemical species of interest, and the number of molecules of chemical species A at time t is simply denoted as A(t)
The symbol φ denotes chemical species which are of no further interest in what follows.
k is the rate constant of the reaction and is defined so that k*dt gives the probability that a randomly chosen molecule of chemical species A reacts (is degraded) during the time interval [t, t + dt)
the probability that r < A(t)k∆t is equal to A(t)k∆t, since r is a random number uniformly distributed in the interval (0, 1)
A(t)*kdt gives the probability that exactly one reaction occurs during the infinitesimal time interval [t, t+dt)
The goal is to compute the number of molecules A(t) for times t > 0.
With k = 0.1, protein (0) = 20 and ∆t = 0.005.
Fig.2 Stochastic simulation of protein degradation for k = 0.1, protein (0) = 20 and ∆t = 0.005. Number of molecules of proteins as a function of"

A Chassis Using Native Tailings Pond Species
Pseudomonas (left), microalgae species Dunaliella tertiolecta (right).
Chassis Selection
We identified early on in our project planning stages that we would like to use Pseudomonas or microalgae as the chassis to house our system. The motivation for this is that not only are these organisms capable of naturally surviving a tailings pond environment, but they may contain necessary regulatory elements required for a response to NAs. Because of this, taking a response element out of an organism and putting our system into another chassis, such as E. coli, may not behave as expected.  Additionally, we characterized a change in growth rate of E. coli with and without tailing ponds showing that, cells don't grow as well in this media (This work was done in collaboration with the Lethbridge team - See our collaboration section for more information on this research).  Based on this chassis choice however, we realized that given their scarcity in iGEM, tools were needed to establish work in these organisms for future iGEM teams.

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," allow the natural gut microbiota to remain unchanged and reduce the reliance on antibiotics. To achieve this goal phage therapy was selected as an appropriate alternative due to its highly specific nature. It has been shown that non-toxigenic strains of C. difficile can act as probiotics to reduce the colonisation of toxigenic C. difficile in the gut therefore, by silencing the toxin gene expression in C. difficile, non-toxigenic probiotic strains are created.
Figure 2: Toxin repression in C. difficile using antisense RNA. (starting with the image on the bottom left and going clockwise) Once the therapy is administered and in the gut, the genetically modified bacteriophage binds to a toxin-producing C. difficile cell and injects its genetic material (DNA containing our antisense RNA constructs) into the cell. The phage genome is subsequently integrated into the host (C. difficile) chromosome. Later, the DNA is  transcribed along with the host genome, resulting in the expression of antisense RNA. The antisense RNA binds the toxin mRNA hence preventing translation of the toxin mRNA into the protein. The RNA-RNA duplex is degraded in the cell. As a result, the C. difficile cell is no longer producing toxins, converting to into a non-toxigenic cell.
Figure 3: Toxin repression in C. difficile using dead-Cas9. (starting with the image on the bottom left and going clockwise) Once the therapy is administered and in the gut, the genetically modified bacteriophage binds to a toxin-producing C. difficile cell and injects its genetic material (DNA containing dCas9 gene and sgRNA coding region) into the cell. The phage genome is subsequently integrated into the host (C. difficile) chromosome. Later, the dCas9 gene and sgRNA coding region are transcribed along with the host genome, resulting in the expression of dCas9 proteins and sgRNAs. dCas9 binds to the sgRNA forming a complex which binds to the promoter region upstream of the toxin gene. As a result, the toxin gene is not transcribed so the C. difficile cell is no longer producing toxins, converting it into a non-toxigenic cell.
To achieve this two strategies of gene silencing are investigated, the use of anti-sense RNA and dead Cas9. In order to ensure the therapeutic is specific for C. difficile these “silencers” will be delivered to the gut using a phage. This ensures that only the C. difficile cells are targeted and due to the specificity of the “silencers” only strains capable of"

We reached out to various iGEM teams around the world with the invitation to join us for a virtual conference where we all exchange ideas and gain feedback to better our respective projects as well as our human practices.
A proposal was sent to all the various teams we had interacted with throughout our project
The conference began with 15 minutes of opening remarks, and introductions of all the various team members. After that, each team was given 5 minutes to present the main aspects of their project.This was done by sharing a powerpoint presentation that each team was asked to prepare prior to the conference. The screen-sharing feature was used to share the presentation with the conference participants. Each presentation was followed by 10 minutes of questions, feedback and advice from other teams to the presenting team.
Six teams, including our team ended up participating in the conference on September 15th, which took place over a google hangouts call for approximately 2 hours. The main challenge we encountered when planning and organizing the event, was arranging a time that was reasonable for all the teams participating taken into account the time difference especially as we were joined with teams from Turkey, Australia, China and India.
The points that the teams have discussed including but are not limited to the following:
1) Tell us more about your project and why you chose the idea. Are you participating in any special track?
2) What kind of experiments will you be doing?
3) What are some challenges that you are currently facing or you anticipate to face?
4) How will you incorporate integrated human practices into your project? Are you looking for contacts with experts in the field?
If your institution has participated in iGEM before, what are some winning project tips that you can give to the other teams?
Great appreciation to Team HKUST from Hong Kong, REC Chennai, VIT Vellore from India, Saint Joseph Istanbul from Turkey, iGEM Macquarie from Australia for the fruitful conversation. We look forward to meeting you in person in Boston!
We have initiated a collaboration request to ALL iGEM teams. We invite them to join us in showcasing the wonderment of iGEM and synthetic biology by creating a science sketch of their team’s project or any major techniques/principles that their project is using.
Through the series of 1-3-minute sketches, we hope to promote public awareness of the iGEM competition as well as to show how synthetic biology can be utilized to solve problems facing mankind in an"

Gene Deletion
Failed to delete ackA-pta genes
To be able to utilize the EnvZ/OmpR two-component-signaling   system for our project, we need to ensure that the natural EnvZ/OmpR system does not interfere, introducing noise to the system, giving a false signal.
How did we change make sure the natural EnvZ/OmpR system doesn’t disrupt our system?
We needed to use a strain of E. coli that has an EnvZ deletion (ΔEnvZ).  The Keio Collection  (Baba, Ara, Hasegawa, Takai, & Okumura, 2006) contains a strain of E. coli with exactly this deletion (strain JW3367-3).
Great! So we are all set right?
Wrong.
OmpR can be phosphorylated not only by the histidine kinase EnvZ but also by an acetyl phosphate dependent mechanism. (Heyde, Laloi, & Portalier, 2000) This would introduce a low level of noise into the system.  Since our detector needs to be precise to be able to detect low concentrations, even a low level of noise would be problematic.
What did we do about this?
We needed a bacteria which not only had the EnvZ knockout, but also had the genes for the Phosphate acetyl transferase (pta) and"

We went to Boston to meet with BU's team, which was fun. Veggie Galaxy is definitely my new favorite restaurant and I'm going to eat there as frequently as possible from now on. SUCH. GOOD. FOOD. My friend Diana came with me because we needed to run some errands so I was glad she joined us on our adventure.
May 30
I’m only two weeks into my summer research and I feel like I’ve already learned so much! I started a week before everyone else, along with Dan, so we’ve had a bit of time to learn how to use the zSpace and Unity. For the record, zSpace is a machine that can turn a PC into a holographic computing system, which basically means that 3D objects in zSpace actually seem tangible. With the stylus, you can pick up and rotate object to see the entirety of them. Cameras on the machine interact with 3D glasses in order to track head movement and allow the user to see the objects in 3D. In order to make programs that will run on the zSpace, one needs a program that allows them to interact with 3D objects, so we’re working with Unity, a video game development tool.
Most of the first week was spent learning Unity and getting into the flow of working at Wellesley’s HCI Lab. We watched a few tutorial videos, looked through some code, and googled a lot of terminology. Our attempts to learn Unity were so that we could build on a program that was already started by previous HCI students. The program, zMol, intends to provide an interactive way to model the building of molecules without the many plastic pieces that students use now.
After a couple of days we felt more comfortable and started trying to make the buttons on the screen of the program interactive with the zSpace stylus. We made them bigger in the GUI so that the user would have an easier time selecting them, but ultimately we were advised that our efforts were best spent elsewhere so we moved on to trying to make the atoms have double bonding capabilities.
Memorial Day weekend gave us plenty of time go to clear our minds, enjoy the nice weather, and catch up on reading. I started learning a little bit of Blender to see if understanding the tools will help with making things in Unity. I haven’t gotten very far but I’ll keep working at it. In addition to work, I spent some time in Boston running errands and spending time with friends.
Tuesday and Wednesday Daniel and I worked on double bonding and finally got our bonds to"

BIT,2017,Team:BIT#cs_-_-_TEXT.html,"ACOB as Class I medical device (if designed to not detecting cancer biomarkers), means no premarketing control is required. It is worth noting though, Chinese in vitro diagnostic market is relatively new and have few competitors. Those few players can no longer support the concrete increasing demand for medical cares. Chinese government had ratified a great number of acts as well as guidelines and simplified documents examining and approval process to encourage innovation in the field of medical devices, which offers our team a great market environment.
Wireframe Connects the Underlying Conceptual Structure
In market analysis we had solved many issues regarding our project background, but also generated more questions about operability.
To obtain a better answer, we had visited 北京永翰星港生物技术有限公司和博奥生物芯片公司.
We asked 蓝晶 mainly on how to construct a viable procedure to industrialize JACOB. Our plan for JACOB after the iGEM jamboree is divided into developments, commercialization, and resource transformation. For development we currently divided it into small, medium, large scale trial. Based on our current knowledge, small and medium trial is planned as below

1. Small Scale Trial
    a. Duration: About half year
    b. We will choose the production method for JACOB, e.g. as we learned from 永翰星港, the ""filtration"" of aptamers are still expensive, but aptamers synthesis is more economical. Nine sets of known aptamer (90np, 15 microliter, 100nmol/L) costs only about $135, and every set is sufficient for 250 microfluidic chips.
    c. During this phase we also need to rule out unknown influences on the device caused by switching to new assembly conditions, such as switching to fermentation flask instead of tightly controlled experiment chamber.

Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," next generation of synthetic biologists, on the safety concerns of working in a wet-lab environment. The Wellesley iGEM team considered these observations carefully when designing our three projects.
Brainstorming and Collaboration with BU
BU Brainstorm session
We continued our tradition of collaborating with the BU iGEM team . We had a major brainstorming session with BU at the beginning of the summer where the teams introduced their projects to each other. We received basic feedback and brainstormed the initial goals for our three projects: Eugenie , zTree , and Bac To The Future . Eugenie in particular benefited immensely from the initial brainstorming because we needed to learn more about the programming language, Eugene , that was developed to aid synthetic biologists in designing novel genetic circuits. Once we spent time developing several solid ideas for each of our three projects, we invited the BU iGEM team to Wellesley to present our ideas to them and to receive feedback on which versions of the projects to pursue further. Throughout the summer, we kept in contact with the BU iGEM team for information and feedback during project development. As part of our UCD process, we tested our software with members of the BU iGEM team, and their feedback and responses helped to shape further development of our projects.
BU testing Eugenie
Observing BU Lab Meetings
A few times this summer, members of the Eugenie project sat in on BU iGEM lab meetings to observe how members of their research group collaborated while developing novel genetic circuits for their summer research projects. The meetings were informative and crucial in guiding us in the development of software tools that would assist in the novel genetic circuit design process. From observing these meetings, we considered how our programs could help foster collaboration in wet lab research. Some of topics we considered included: how work could be shared and edited between students and PIs, and how our programs would fit in with other the tools that are already being used.
Eliciting Feedback from Users
Eugenie user testing results
As part of our desire to receive feedback concerning the design and usability of our programs from students that have a wide range of exposure to synthetic biology, we tested our programs with BU, MIT and Wellesley students. By observing our users as they used our programs to accomplish the assigned tasks, we were able to refine our applications so that the software tools we had created were not hurdles themselves for the users working in synthetic biology research. We also collected both verbal and written feedback, as well as videotaped user studies for further analysis.

We conducted computer modelling to include isoelectric points, hydrophobicity, secondary structures and 3D protein molecular models.
Proof of Concept: Due to the scope of our project, we focused on developing the key building blocks of our overall vision; to directly attach our DNA nanowire to Photosystem II to capture electrons and generate a current. The first proof of concept is successfully purifying a multi-subunit transmembrane protein complex using a single His-tag that does not disrupt photosystem II activity. We have demonstrated that the purified PSII protein is active and generates free-electrons. Our second proof of concept, is the successful formation of our DNA Origami nanostructure as confirmed by gel electrophoresis and transmission electron microscopy.
Demonstrate your work: Show your project working under real-world conditions. To achieve this criterion, you should demonstrate your whole system, or a functional proof of concept working under simulated conditions in the lab (biological materials may not be taken outside the lab). Due to ongoing experimentation, we hope that our proof of concept will ready for the Giant Jamboree. Please check our presentation or poster session for updated project progress."

Introduction
In order to develop a thorough understanding of the factors that would influence the design and application of our diagnostic in the field, we approached experts and a range of stakeholders to help us develop a sense of the social, ethical and environmental issues related to our project. We also evaluated the safety regulations associated with the use of our diagnostic device to ensure optimal sustainability and responsible design
Decision to Choose Diagnostics Track & Royal Society Conference
Attending a Royal Society conference ('Synthetic Biology: Does industry get it?'; 8th February 2017) at the start of our project highlighted the diversity of synthetic biology applications. However, we were particularly excited by the medical applications. We reviewed the conference for our general university newspaper to explain synthetic biology, through examples, to a non-science specialist readership. You can read the article by following the link below:
Surveys to the Public
Understanding of the current medical applications of synthetic biology guided our initial diagnostics track choice, which was corroborated by the results of our initial survey of the UK public, where more than half of the 200 surveyed wanted a synthetic biology solution for disease diagnosis. After deciding to pursue Chagas disease diagnosis for our project, we decided to create a survey for immediate stakeholders in Latin America with the aim of finding out the most acceptable mode of delivery for our diagnostic. The AQA Unesp (Brazil), Amazonas (Brazil) and TEC CEM (Mexico) teams translated and disseminated our survey. Some of the results (documented below) highlight that most teams were most comfortable with a pinprick or small syringe, all preferred a test delivered at a drop in clinic, and all wanted a test carried out by a trained professional. As a consequence we designed our kit to use as minimum volume of blood as possible and envisioned its use by a trained professional.

Human practice is all about a line. One side to the patients, another side to the doctors, although we are still medico. All we want to do is to care, to save. We talked to patients and experienced clinical doctors to understand status; we consulted the masters to correct our research direction. Communication with other iGEMers enriched our knowledge and exchanged our ideas. The promotion of synthetic biology and HF prevention can be filled with fun when we use the popular public media. Health lies on the efforts of the children. The summer camp is an excellent chance to encourage them to focus on the technique, focus on synthetic biology, which may help to improve the life quality. No medicine is better than prevention. Healthy life style is the most important thing for the elderly. Thus, the visit to Yanji geracomium contributes our love for the predisposed old men.
Human Practice
Internship
As a medico, clinical internship is essential in our career. When we started our internship for the first year, we found the truth was much crueler than we imagined. We thought that as long as we followed the treatment and medication according to the textbook, we can greatly relieve patients’ suffering, and, to some points, we may even cure their diseases. However, on the contrary, during the internship in cardiology department, there were too many patients cannot get cured for heart disease because there is no medicine can stop the process of heart failure, let alone reverse it. Currently, we can do nothing but watch the patients’ condition get deteriorating,"

1.3 Gene Doping DNA Extraction
Design: We spiked samples with artificial gene doping DNA and confirmed its extraction with PCR.
Results and interpretation: Guided by our gene doping model, we spiked samples with 2x10^8 fragments/ml of either linear or plasmid EPO cDNA. We performed extraction, followed by PCR to verify it. Two EPO internal primer combinations were used. For the primer set 072 & 073 the expected band size was 297 bp and for the primer set 074 & 075 the expected band size was 140 bp. figure 4 confirmed the successful extraction of gene doping EPO DNA. The difference in intensity between the linear DNA spiked (sample 3 & 4) and the plasmid spiked (sample 5 & 6) indicates that the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit has a lower extraction efficiency for plasmids, since the same amount of fragments were spiked.

We showed successful extraction of artificial gene doping DNA at concentration predicted by our model using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit. Further extraction optimization is advisable to maximize extraction efficiency.
2. Prescreening
In this module, we developed a high throughput screening method to detect gene doping. The method is based on the concept of color changes induced by d-AuNPs aggregation. In this module, we first analysed the stability of d-AuN"

B Company visit & Game optimization at“Perfect World”
     To impose a greater influence on our younger community members, we further revised our two web games by visiting one of the China’s biggest internet entertainment giants “Perfect World” where we got a lot of useful advice on our games and work. Click here for more details about our games.
About Perfect World
‘Perfect World’ business covers both the perfect world game and the perfect world film and television , which is China's largest film and computer complex. In 2004, perfect world game was officially founded, and the launching of independent development of 3D engine got great success. In July 2007, the perfect world game was successfully listed on Nasdaq. In 2008, the perfect world film and television was set up, and in December 2014 it successfully flanded in A-share market.
    During the visit, we had a deep communication with the company’s staff. First the company’s HR gave a brief introduction to the company. Then we talked to a senior game designer. He gave us some advice on how to make a game more playable. Next, we visited the art design group and they taught us how to design beautiful game characters in a limited time.
    In the end, we provided our first version of games to the company’s employees and proposed issue about games’ balance between playability and authenticity. If we focus too much on authenticity, the playability of the game decreases. In a similar way, if we focus too much on the playability, the games will lose their authenticity and scientific meaning.
    After listening to their advice, we made some changes to our game.First, players can choose whatever characters when initializing but can only initial 10 characters.Besides, one side wins when the amount of this side surly surpasses the other.(A minor advantage is not cinsidered a defeat if we take fluctuation into account) These improvements will help our web game playable while remaining its authenticity.

Public Promotion
We are always exploring a more convenient and intuitive new way to promote synthetic biology and iGEM projects better to the broader public. So, this time we have created Poly Cards, a new public education tool to communicate synthetic biology and iGEM projects. The cards have been successfully incorporated biobricks and iGEM projects (see: Poly Cards) .
For better practice of Poly Cards, cooperating with Zhejiang China Association for Science and Technology, we held a Syn-bio Share. In the process of teaching and sharing, we try to promote synthetic biology to the public, share iGEM projects in recent years, guide them to brainstorm new ideas, and discuss about safety issue about future (see: Syn-bio Share) .
In order to spread the idea of “synthetic biology” to public, we cooperated with Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum (ZJSTM) and built up a community lab (see: Community Lab) . Near the end of our project which is also the beginning of a new term, we invited freshmen to join our final seminar and enjoy recent frontier related synthetic-biology science and technology. In the seminar, we shared our project and carried out a short discussion about safety issues (see: Seminar) .

Researcher, Public, and Environmental Safety
The Rose-Hulman iGEM team has considered safety a top priority since the early stages of project development.      As a result, projects that could pose a significant risk were dismissed.      Our laboratory space is considered a Basic Biosafety Level 1 laboratory but it does have a few characteristics of higher categories.      It has controlled access, biohazard signs and waste disposal bins, and an autoclave. Other safety features are demonstrated below.
All participating students received standard safety and good laboratory practice training as part of their academic laboratory course-work.      The Instructor provided more specific safety instruction, as necessary.      Proper attire was worn at all times in the laboratory. Gloves and glasses were donned as warranted.      The only organisms used in our project are common laboratory strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (BY4741 and BY4742) and Escherichia coli (NEB5alpa),      which are both considered Risk Group 1 microorganisms according to the Laboratory Biosafety Manual published by the World Health Organization.      Group 1 organisms are defined as “no or low individual and community risk, a microorganism that is unlikely to cause human or animal disease.”      Aseptic technique is used whenever working with these organisms and any contaminated wastes are sterilized by autoclaving or destroyed by commercial pyrolysis.      All laboratory chemicals are stored, handled and used as recommended by the manufacturer,      and they are disposed of in accordance with national, state, and local regulations and recommendations.      The laboratory space and contents are not accessible by unauthorized personnel.      All microbial strains, including bacteria rendered antibiotic resistant by transformation, harbor nutritional auxotrophies or other mutations      that mitigate the risk of their growing outside of the laboratory or causing disease in healthy humans or animals.      Furthermore, none of our  recombinant constructs produce any known contagion or toxin.

Here we tested the function of cre-loxp system by making 3 different groups of transfection in the cells that already inserted with loxp gene on genomes using Lipofectamine® 3000.

Few cells survives (Fig15. a) after antibiotics screening without transfecting Cre recombinase gene, which means that there is a small possibility that loxp gene can insert into genomes by interior transposase in cells. To find out the optimal ratio of Cre recombinase gene to Neomycin-loxp gene in the process of transfection, we compared two different ratio, 3:3 (Fig15. b) and 1:3 (Fig15. c), with equal amount of Neomycin-loxp gene but different amount of Cre recombinase gene.(All pictures was captured by Nikon microscope (Nikon TS100) 120 hours after transfection, 600 μg/ml neomycin were added 72hours  screening.
From observation, we know that excess Cre recombinase is not appropriate in transfection process. The most possible reason is that surplus Cre recombinase is harmful for cells, so they may random cut and recombine genes in cell’s genome. Thus, we finally chose 1:3 as the ratio of Cre recombinase gene to Neomycin-loxp gene in transfection.
6. Mutagenesis of TRPC5
Mutation frequency calibration
1. Define ideal mutation frequency
Mutation frequency is the product of DNA polymerase error rate and number of duplications. It depends on initial target amount and fold amplification. Mutation frequencies of 1~4 amino acid changes (2~7 nucleotide changes) per gene are commonly employed.
We have mutated the ankyrin repeats region (734bp length) of TRPC5 by employ 500ng initial tartget and 32 cycle amplification according to the protocol of GeneMorph II Random Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies,Catalog #200550).

Abstract
We helped team Nagahama by constructing a model and running simulations. By calculating the sufficient amount of culture fluid of E.coli which produce Geraniol to preserve food in a certain lunch box. The project is about making a method of preserving food not by cooling but by flavor, ‘KOZOKO: Flavorator'.
Setting the situation and Method
We assumed a situation and constructed a model that we were preserving rice in a certain lunch box and laying the “Geraniol sheet” which contains concentrated Geraniol produced by E.coli on the bottom of the lunch box.
   The size of the lunch box was 10W×10D×4H. Rice was packed and the ‘Geraniol sheet’ was laid on the bottom of the lunch box. The “Geraniol sheet” was 8W×8D×0.2H. The sheet contained concentrated Geraniol produced by E.coli in a culture fluid.
   As we laid the “Geraniol sheet” on the bottom of the lunch box, Geraniol contained in the sheet started to diffuse. We calculated the least concentration of Geraniol in the sheet in order to have the Geraniol concentration be above the effective bactericidal concentration even after laying the sheet for 24hours.
Results

Fig. 7-5-1-2.The State of Diffusion in the yz Plain at x=50[mm]
Fig. 7-5-1-3.The State of Diffusion in the xy Plain at z=40
We use the culture fluid that E.coli were incubated for 48 hours. After the 48 hour of incubation, the culture fluid contained 183mg/L of Geraniol.
From our simulation, the culture fluid of E.coli should be concentrated 10,000 times in order to have the Geraniol concentration be above the effective bactericidal concentration even after laying the sheet for 24hours. The sufficient amount of culture fluid which we calculated in order to preserve rice in the box was 128L under our model.
This work was done using Matlab. For more information see here .

The strain of the bacteria we use for this device is extremely important due to biosafety reasons. Bacillus subtilis is a                     common gram-positive bacterium, which is widely used in engineering field. Human infection of Bacillus                     subtilis is rarely reported, so it is not considered as a pathogenic bacterium. Also, in the cause-of-death                     statistics of the World Health Organization, no data on B. subtilis infections are present since, even                     if reported, they would be “invisible” at the international comparative level due to the coding used                     for classification of death causes[9]. In the literature, only a few cases of infections due to B. subtilis are reported and only one retrospective study describes the isolation of antibiotic-resistant strains                     of B. subtilis. Because Bacillus subtilis itself has a uric acid metabolic pathway, we plan to use an                     engineered Bacillus subtilis strain which hasn’t been used in the blood related clinic therapy before.
Bacillus subtilis itself contains a urate metabolic pathway. The pucJ/K helps uric acid to be transported into the cell,                     and pucL/M converts uric acid into allantoin. pucJKLM can be regulated by PucR protein to initiate the                     transcription. Therefore, we decide to overexpress pucR gene in Bacillus subtilis to activate the downstream                     uric acid metabolic pathway[10,11].

The large oval represents the inner                     cell membrane of B. subtilis containing transport proteins for purine nucleobases and their catabolites                     (black circles) encoded by the given genes[10].
Figure 17 PucR can activate the expression of pucJKLM operon to promote the expression of uric acid metabolism pathway genes.[11]
We chose Bacillus subtilis R179 as our host because it’s used in clinics now to treat gut environment disorder cause by gut                     microbiome in China, which has passed through safety evaluation at least in intestine.
We ligated the pucR to Bacillus Subtilis PHT43 plasmid successfully. PucR can be expressed with IPTG induced. However, after                     many attempts, we didn’t transform it into Bacillus subtilis R179"

We have participated in iGEM Goes Green to consider a more eco-friendly way to work in our lab. The iGEM Goes Green initiative centers around the idea of raising awareness around the environmental impacts we, especially as members of iGEM, have on the world around us and how we can lessen the negative side effects of those impacts. Namely, iGEM Goes Green is focused on spreading awareness on what our carbon footprint is. Our project is supposed to help clean the environment and we want to be effective in our lab methods to make sure that we keep the environment clean, while researching a way to save it! In one of our many contact points with them, we - along with our school’s Ecology Club - sent suggestions for their Go Green Guide, a document that outlines exactly how one can conduct a more eco-friendly lifestyle in and out of the laboratory. We detailed the impact of several other processes (that did not deal with the conventional tips) concerning greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, Eco Club helped by planting a tree on our campus for the purpose of compensating for our carbon footprint created by our flights to Boston, as well as to establish our collaboration with TU Dresden.

The control loop composed of this activation and the short-range inhibition of E. coli (activator) by activated E. coli (inhibitor) functions as lateral inhibition. ""Activator"" E. coli promotes the multiplication of ""Inhibitor"" E. coli, and ""Inhibitor"" inhibits the multiplication of ""Activator"" near of ""Inhibitor"" First, we show that there are two cases for this modeling. Case 3: E. coli that emit AHL(shown u in figure) and E. coli that emit colicin(shown v in figure) are different. formula $$ \frac{du}{dt} = u({\alpha} - (u + v) - {\kappa}c) + du{\nabla}^2u\\ \frac{dv}{dt} = v({\beta} - (u + v)\) + \frac{a}{a + K}{\delta}) + du{\nabla}^2v \\ \frac{da}{dt} = u - {\gamma}a + da{\nabla}^2a \\ \frac{dc}{dt} = v - {\mu}c + dc{\nabla}^2c \\ $$   Case 4; E. coli that emit AHL(shown u in figure) and E. coli that emit colicin are same. formula $$ \frac{du}{dt} = u({\alpha} - (u + v)) + du{\nabla}^2u \\ \frac{dv}{dt} = v({\beta} - (u + v) - {\kappa}c + \frac{a}{a + K}{\delta}) + du{\nabla}^2v \\ \frac{da}{dt} = u - {\gamma}a + da{\nabla}^2a \\ \frac{dc}{dt} = u - {\mu}c + dc{\nabla}^2c \\ $$   The parameter range which is different from strategy 2 is delta. delta + beta must be lower than max value of alpha or beta, because barstar or colI can't restore the growth rate of E. coli more than its max value. Hence, the sum of ${\delta}$ and ${\beta}$ must be the same or below the maximum growth rate. The method is not different from the first one. ["
