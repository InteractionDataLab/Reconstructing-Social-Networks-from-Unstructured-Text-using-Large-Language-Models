St_Andrews,2010,Team:St Andrews#project#safety#GMO_-_-_TEXT.html," teams, who complete a 10-week summer project in synthetic biology.  Synthetic biology uses standardised biological parts, or “BioBricks” to create desired synthetic function in cells, usually E. coli.
iGEM 2010 Team Project: The SAINTS - St Andrews iGEM Neutralises Threatening Staphylococcus Literally ""attacking"" the problem of MRSA, we will build an E. coli that could in principle detect and kill S. aureus (antibiotic resistant strains of which are known as MRSA). The project will consist of three steps: detection, destruction, and enhancement. We will take advantage of S. aureus's own quorum signal, AIP, to identify it. First, we will build E. coli to signal detection of AIP by producing green fluorescent protein (GFP), buiding off of Cambridge’s 2007 BioBrick with similar function. We will then modify this system to include, instead of GFP, a ""Kamikaze"" BioBrick (Brazil 2009) which creates lysosyme, thus killing the cell and any nearby bacteria. Finally, we will enhance the sensitivity of both these constructs by inserting an E. coli quorum sensing loop in between the AIP detector and the output: this serves to amplify the signal from AIP to produce greater output (GFP or lysosyme) per cell and recruit other nearby E. coli.
After further examining the problem, it appeared impossible to get functional AIP detection in a gram negative bacterium due to problems with membrane proteins. Instead, we turned our efforts to another gram negative bacterium, Vibrio Cholerae.
Most cholera cells are killed off by stomach acid, but those that remain alive attach to the gut wall and multiply. At this low cell density, autoinducer concentration is low, and virulence factors are expressed. Once high cell density is reached, enough toxin is present to cause severe diarrhoea. At this point, the autoinducer concentration is high, and virulence factors are repressed. The now avirulent V. Cholerae detach from the gut wall and are flushed out of the body to infect a new host. Our idea is to synthesise Escherichia coli bacteria that will use this ingenious mechanism to communicate with Vibrio cholerae. Our engineered Escherichia coli will harmlessly colonise the gut, and in large numbers secrete the cholera autoinducer, CAI-1. This will cause an immediate high autoinducer concentration to be detected by incoming"

A Huge THANK YOU Goes to These iGEM Teams
We would like to thank iGEM Göttingen for helping us to test Minicolicin in other organisms than E. coli, as well as iGEM Aachen for trying to help us with the assembly and characterisation of the orthogonal pair. We had a lot of nice Skype sessions and it was great fun to work with you!
We would like to thank the iGEM team of Texas at Austin as well for constructing their ONBY (o‑nitrobenzyl‑O‑tyrosine) orthogonal pair. We used the open reading frame (ORF) as template and replaced the coding sequences with our own sequences. This helped us with constructing our plasmid, thank you for this work.
We want to thank the iGEM team of Munich for the good collaboration regarding the syringe pump. You sent us your pump so we could compare it to ours and get some more ideas!
We also want to thank the iGEM team from Düsseldorf for organising a collaboration of eight iGEM teams in Germany. All of us designed postcards with biotechnological topics to raise public awareness. We appreciate the effort and hope that this postcard distribution will make people more familiar to synthetic biology!
Finally a special tribute goes to iGEM Marburg for arranging the german iGEM meet‑up. We all had much fun there, got to know other iGEM team members and are looking forward to see everyone we met there on the Giant Jamboree!

Sequencing results
The iGEM team from the University of Alberta sent in BioBricks for BPA degradation in 2008 (<partinfo>K123000</partinfo> and <partinfo>K123001</partinfo>). Sequencing of these BioBricks by the iGEM HQ and by us led to negative results so the sequences entered into the partsregistry are not correct although these sequences are the ones from Sphingomonas bisphenolicum AO1 (compare genbank entry ). In addition, there are ""illegal"" AgeI and NgoMIV restriction sites in the BioBrick which are used for Freiburg BioBrick assembly standard (RFC 25). After translating and comparing the original sequences from the partsregistry and the sequences from our sequencing results in silico, we saw that the amino acid sequences were identical. These BioBricks were probably synthesized in the Freiburg assembly standard 25 because they have the accordant restriction sites and they were codon optimized for Escherichia coli. But the original sequence from S."

UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB,2017,Team:UChile OpenBio-CeBiB#Collaborations#iGEMManchesterCollaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," Currently, under the proposal, the following 6 bodies are in charge of enforcing laws regarding GMOs and GMMs:
Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RDAC) - Advisory
Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBSC) - Regulatory/ Approval
Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation (RCGM) - Regulatory/ Approval
Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) - Regulatory/ Approval
State Biotechnology Coordination Committee (SBCC) - Regulatory/ Approval
Monitoring District Level Committee (DLC) - Monitoring
Canada
In accordance with Foods and Drugs Act, Health Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Environment Canada are the administrative branches responsible for the regulation of products derived from biotechnology. Health Canada’s role is to enforce standards for safety and nutritional quality of all foods sold in Canada. It works under the Foods and Drugs Act. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) role is to minimize diseases and other public health hazards that could potentially be caused by the food supply system. Fisheries and Oceans Canada role is to regulate Canadian fisheries, oceans and freshwater resources. This joint effort helps ensure that informed decisions regarding GMMs by pooling the expertise and considerations of each agency together.
2. Who regulates the use of GMMs on a case-by-case basis?
European Union
All member countries are obliged to establish ’competent authorities,’ institutions responsible for overseeing the use of GMMs on a case-by-case basis.
United States
The US Food and Drug Administration regulates any GMMs that get used in consumer products, such as GMMs in food or cosmetics. The US Department of Agriculture regulates any genetic modification of plants. However, any GMMs that are to be released into the environment are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency.
Australia
It is the role of the Gene Technology Regulator Advisory Committee to assess all data supplied by any applicant (who is intending to release GMMs into the environment) and perform a comprehensive literature review to determine whether or not it will be approved. FSANZ also regulates the use of GMMs in foods for human consumption on an individual case-by-case basis.
Brazil
The Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa) approves and inspects the use of GMMs and its derivatives in any products for human use (e.g., pharmaceuticals, biopharmaceuticals, cosmetics and food). The Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Supply (MAPA) is responsible for regulating the use of modified seeds and plants. All GMMs must be approved for release by CTNBio.

DTU-Denmark,2016,Team:DTU-Denmark#substrate_-_-_TEXT.html," a sweet flavor due to the high sucrose, glucose and fructose content. Therefore it is often used for prepacked meals and animal feed. Molasses is created when the juice from sugar canes is heated to boiling point. Sugars are extracted over two times as seen in Figure 21. Leaving molasses as a byproduct of this process. We think that it will be a quite useful substrate for fermentation.
Figure 21: Flow chart for production of refined sugar and molasses.
×
As seen in the figure both Y. Lipolytica and S. cerevisiae grows on molasses. Normally Y. Lipolytica does not grow well on sucrose, but there is also a high content of glucose and fructose in molasses. On top of that we realised that sucrose degrades to fructose and glucose when autoclaved (Personal communication) that made fermentation more attractive.
Figure 22: Y. Lipolytica growth on molasses from sugar production.
×
Figure 23: S. cerevisiae growth on molasses from sugar production.
×
Both organisms might be suitable for growth on molasses as seen in figures 22-23, but because S. cerevisiae is able to utilize sucrose it might be the better choice for this byproduct.
Discussion
From our experiments it is clear that S. cerevisiae and Y. lipolytica have very different substrate utilization ranges. S. cerevisiae is better at catabolizing simple sugars while Y. lipolytica is better at degrading lipids, its derivatives and other complex substrates. A lot of the sugar-based byproducts like molasses, are suitable for human consumption. A biobased production approach with these substrates competes with the increasing food demand. The lipid-based wastestreams like glycerol and oil sediments are not suitable for neither human nor animal consumption. As Y. lipolytica displays good growth on these wastestreams, it is well-suited for biobased production systems. However, it should be noted that these wastestreams cannot be utilized for all possible compounds of interest. More specifically, a lot of problems need to be overcome in order to produce compounds such as pharmaceuticals that have to adhere to specific regulations. Based on our interviews with industry representatives, bulk compounds might be a more viable option. Still, new challenges arise when switching to productions based on oily carbon sources. Amongst others the cleaning procedure for the fermentation tanks must be adapted. This was pointed out at our meeting with Novozymes and can be read in the resume"

At the same time, we still had some questions on LuxS/AI-2 quorum sensing systems. In order to get professional opinions on our project and to learn more about quorum sensing, we conducted an interview with two specialists, Ms Weixia Gao and Ms Yufen Quan.
Weixia Gao & Yulei Dang
After the introduction of our project idea, we discussed some particularly interesting points. We received advice that helped us to improve our project. This interview was not only helpful and enriching but also led to an agreement to collaborate with the Laboratory of Metabolic Engineering and Environmental Microbiology.
Here are some key points we got from these two specialists:
1. They suggested us to design a response device, which can be an alternative way of testing the AI-2 level in the natural or artificial environment due to the instability of the current measurement method (BB170 test).
2. They suggested us a good way to apply AI-2 Controllers into real world problems: to focus on biofilm. Biofilm formation is a collective behavior in which AI-2 has a significant influence.
After this helpful and enriching interview, we became clearer of our whole project. This interview greatly helped us on the design and actual execution of our project.
3. The dialogue with experts in synthetic biology: greatly helped us on the design of our biosafety system
With the advent of synthetic biology, genetically modified microorganisms are being increasingly used for biomedical, industrial and environmental applications. Deployment of these engineered microbes in large scales and open environments calls for the development of safe and secure means to restrain their proliferation.
Also in the biosafety investigation we took, we found that although most of the labs strictly obey the management rules, there are still some labs with poor management and faint consciousness on biosafety.  For example, about 10% of the labs we investigated have no resting area separated from the experiment area. More than 15% of the labs we investigated pay less attention to the treatment of organic waste or materials with engineered bacteria. What's worse, more than 40% of the people investigated would have meals in the lab. These researchers are facing serious safety problems which made us become aware of the importance of biosafety.  As the Chinese saying goes, a solid dyke can collapse because of an ant hole in it. Although only a few labs pay poor attention to biosafety, it could still probably cause serious biosafety problems.
After the investigation, we organized many"

Figure 2: Mycelia growing on Martian regolith simulant. They also grew on lunar regolith simulant. (special thanks to Solar System Exploration Virtual Institute-SSERVI for supplying us with the simulants!)
II. Launch, Travel, and Landing
Once the habitat is designed, built and loaded with mycelial starter filaments and dried cyanobacteria or spores (akinetes), we need a way to get the structures from Earth to another destination (e.g., the Moon or Mars). There are a few rockets we can choose from: the Falcon Heavy6 from SpaceX, and the newly developed Space Launch System from NASA are potential options. The launch site will likely be NASA Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
In talking to Engineering Prof. Rick Fleeter from Brown University (an industry-veteran and consultant to the Italian Space Agency), he suggested allocating at maximum 80% of the actual rocket payload to the weight of our structures - providing us with a ballpark estimate of how much material we can carry. As other infrastructure is needed for a human settlement, we aimed to be substantially lower in mass.
Once in space, estimated travel time to Mars is approximately 6-7 months, in the closest approach between Earth and Mars (which occurs no less than ~1.5 years apart)2.
Numerous factors need to be considered when choosing a Martian landing site. These include equatorial proximity (to reduce temperature fluctuations on the order of hundreds of degrees between day/night), low altitude (thicker atmosphere allows for easier spacecraft deceleration, and meaningful quantities of useful gases), and availability of shallow sub-surface water (for use by astronauts).
We first spoke to Dr. Lisa Pratt, NASA's Planetary Protection Officer, to better understand the regulations regarding which types of landing sites are off-limits, or may require additional precautions. Then, based on consideration of these factors, and in talking to Planetary Geoscience Professor Jim Head (an interplanetary mission expert, focusing on Mars, from Brown University), we chose as our landing site Deuteronilus Mensae7,8,9; this site (Figure X) was among the very top sites in NASA’s First Landing Site (LS)/Exploration Zone (EZ) Workshop for Human Missions to the Surface of Mars"

Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#coli_-_-_TEXT.html," pH 4 and pH 5 the darkest colour has been reached.
Activity assay measurements for ECOL laccases were done to find the optimal pH for further analysis. Britton-Robinson buffer, adjusted to pHs ranging from pH 4 to pH 9, was used with 9 mM ABTS to detect the change in OD420. The measurements were done with 308 ng ECOL laccase for each sample. The highest activity was reached when measured in Britton-Robinson buffer at pH 4 and pH 5 (see Fig. 25, Fig. 26 and Fig. 27). More than 5 U mg-1 of specific enzyme activity have calculated for these pHs (see Fig. 27). When testing the activity under basic conditions, the enzyme activity decreases. At pH 7 about 1 U mg-1 was determined. This makes an application of the ECOL not feasible since the water in the waste water treatment plants is in average of pH 6.9.
Figure 26: Oxidized ABTS by ECOL at different pH adjustments. The experimental setup included CuCl2 incubated ECOL (308 ng), Britton-Robinson buffer adjusted to the tested pHs and 5 mM ABTS. Measurements were done at 25 °C for 30 minutes. The most amount of oxidized ABTS can be detected at pH 4 and pH 5.
Figure 27: Calculated specific enzyme activity of ECOL at different pH conditions. The highest specific enzyme activity for ABTS is under pH 4 and pH 5 conditions. The higher the pH, the less ABTS gets oxidized. One unit is defined as the amount of laccase that oxidizes 1 μmol of ABTS substrate per minute.
Since Regionals: ECOL activity at different temperatures
Fig. 28: Standard activity test for ECOL measured at 10 °C and 25 °C resulting in a decreased activity at 10 °C. As a negative control the impact of 0.4 mM CuCl2 in oxidizing ABTS at 10 °C and 25 °C was analyzed.
Fig. 29: Deriving from the obtained values of oxidized ABTS in time at 10 °C and 25 °C the specific enzyme activity was calculated. For the temperatures a difference of 9 U/mg-1 could be detected. One unit is defined as the amount of laccase that oxidizes 1 μmol of ABTS substrate per minute.

This expression was induced at OD600 of 0.4 and an IPTG concentration of 0.5 mM. Samples from fractions collected after IMAC purification were analysed by SDS-PAGE (figure 1). The band at 60 kDa is slightly larger than the expected size of sialidase in literature (54 kD.
Figure 1. SDS-PAGE gel and a protein ladder. From left to right: protein ladder, the remaining lanes contain samples from consecutive fractions after IMAC purification.
Next, we cloned our gBlock containing T7 promoter-RBS-sialidase into the iGEM compatible backbone (pSB1C3). To confirm successful cloning, we performed double digestion on the plasmid (figure 2) and could see one band at ~1600 bp and one at ~2000 bp. The band at 1600 bp corresponds to the size of sialidase and the band at 2000 bp to the linearized plasmid backbone.
Figure 2. From left to right: DNA ladder, the next two are digested BBa_K2235009 plasmids.
We thereafter induced expression of our sialidase (BBa_K2235009), using the same method as when expressing the au54 plasmid, and could observe a band at 60 kDa (figure 3). While this also is slightly larger than the designed sialidase (55 kDa) sequence, it has a similar size as the sialidase we expressed from the literature plasmid (au54).
Figure 3. SDS-PAGE gel and a protein ladder. From left to right: protein ladder, the remaining three are IMAC purification fractions of sialidase.
To demonstrate that the sialidase we expressed from our designed biobrick (BBa_K2235009) is similar to the size of the au54 sialidase, we analysed both samples using SDS-PAGE. The au54 sialidase and our designed biobrick sialidase, with molecular sizes of 54 and 55 kDa, respectively. SDS-PAGE results show no observable difference in size between the two proteins (figure 4). Sialidase is a protein with a high content of basic amino acids, therefore it was hypothesized that this might affect migration through the gel.

However, he thought that the conversion of cellulose to glucose in one reactor, combined with glucose to styrene conversion could be an interesting improvement. Additionally, he explained that CO2 is released at every chemical reaction step, the magnitude depending on reaction conditions. So, whereas our method would not be able to meet industrial needs, it would likely be greener than the chemical process of refining biomass, and significantly better than a fossil based process. These steps come together in the Life Cycle Analysis, which can be found on the wiki and in given references. Mr. Imhof explained to us that we should not go too deep into this and provided us with helpful references about their own research.
The biological process is less feasible than the chemical, but probably more sustainable
Photanol: Wilmar van Grondelle (12th September 2018)
Photanol is a platform renewable chemicals company that utilises proprietary engineered cyanobacteria to process carbon dioxide (CO2) and sunlight into valuable chemical products. They have performed a lot of research in the laboratory, and are scaling up now. They aim to demonstrate that their product works on an industrial scale, and Wilmar elaborated on the process from their concept to where they are now. The concept of Photanol started at university. Together with the university, they went to the University Holding, to get an initial investment. From this point on a biorefinery plan, business plan and LCA were made to attract more investors. He told us that it is important to have a good business plan and LCA when you look for investors, because these are the things that people will look at. Another good way to get income is using different subsidies. Photanol now has an industrial partner with whom they work together to scale their project up further. Wilmar adviced us to contact the GGO bureau and to keep close contact with them, as they know everything about safety and regulations. Especially in the phase where we are in now, it is good to contact them so we can put the safety into the design of our project. One example is that a GMO can never outcompete its wild-type. Besides that, there are two important permits you have to keep in mind; the GMO permit and the environment permit. These take in total about 6 months to get!
It is important to have a good businessplan and LCA

UCC_Ireland,2014,Team:UCC Ireland#Projects SeeDNA.html_-_-_TEXT.html," addition, no special training is required to carry out this test; a result could be obtained with just a few simple steps. This means that SeeDNA could be used in areas where molecular diagnostics has not reached.
Where could we envision applications for SeeDNA? :
On the farm – SeeDNA could be used to carry out testing of animals for infection or disease. Farmers could carry out onsite diagnostic test on herd(s) for disease, allowing for rapid treatment or isolation of infected animals to prevent spread of infection.  This could save money on vet costs as the farm owner themselves could carry out the test. This could be a solution also for rurally located farms where frequent testing cannot be carried out otherwise.
At the GP office – SeeDNA could reduce time needed to carry out molecular tests by bringing the test right to the doctor’s office. Patients could be saved worry-time by getting an instant screening result from the GP at the time of sample collection.
In under-resourced labs in developing countries – Medical laboratories, such as those in provisional hospitals run by aid workers, may lack the specialist equipment of bigger hospitals. With a low-cost, simple test such as SeeDNA, patients of these hospitals could still receive first-rate medical diagnostics.  By allowing for detection of pathogenic viruses/bacteria in poorer countries potentially global public health catastrophes such as the recent Ebola outbreak could be prevented.
Commercialization
The model of our DNA detector is currently in the design phase.  The first DNA sequence to be detected will belong to HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) 16, which causes the majority of cervical cancer cases worldwide. Screening for HPV infection, although commonplace in Ireland, is not often carried out in under-resourced countries where the infection is most prevalent. The SeeDNA HPV-16 detector could be a solution to these populations as it is simple, cheap and requires no specialist equipment.  The most exciting feature of SeeDNA is its ability to be customised. Our DNA detector could easily be modified to detect virtually any DNA sequence, making its applications in diagnosis endless.
For details of our plans to commercialize SeeDNA please see our Business Plan.

E.Coli derived camelid antibodies as a sensor for p53 in saliva
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a malignant tumor with 640,000 new cases annually in the world. Saliva testing is non-invasive procedure that is capable to detect potential biomarkers for OSCC. The DNA, RNA and proteins derived from the cancerous cells can be obtained from saliva samples. It was shown that elevated level of p53 protein was identified in OSCC patients at different stages of the disease.
Camelid antibodies containing only variable regions, nanobodies (VHH) and single-chain variable regions (scFv) with VH and VL, are becoming popular in many biological studies including diagnostic applications. It was identified that VL region alone showed higher affinity to p53 than VHH, and dimerization of VL region with another one increases the affinity up to ten folds. Camelid antibodies have similiar affinity to its substrate as human antibodies and can be conjugated to other proteins without loss  of function. They can be expressed and secreted in many organisms including E.Coli in high amount, which reduces the cost of antibodies production. Thus, the aim of this project is to design a biosensor, based on available sequence of antibodies, to detect p53 in saliva samples for OSCC diagnosis.
The biosensor will be similar to ELISA, but instead of antibodies, dimerized VL regions will be used. Vhp53 with zipper-containing polypeptide, His-tag, red fluorescent protein (RFP) and HlyA-C-terminal signal sequence of alpha-hemolysin will be expressed in E. coli. We expect that zipper will allow dimerization of two Vhp53 parts and hemolysin secretion system will aid in secretion of nanobodies. Purified nanobodies will be used for detection of p53 protein is saliva samples.

E. coli is one of the most widely used model organism in Synthetic Biology. E. coli can be engineered in various ways. Apparently, to make recombinant E. coli, one needs to transform recombinant DNA into a competent bacterium. However, E. coli itself has a low tendency to uptake DNA from the environment.

UCLA,2015,Team:UCLA#Project#Functionalizing Silk_-_-_TEXT.html," of these fibers as a vehicle for nanoscale drug delivery or a scaffold for tissue engineering, there is much interest in attaching domains onto these fibers to achieve desired functionality. Bombyx mori, commonly known as silkworm, contain silk proteins comprised of fibroin, the core fiber that provides silkworm silk it’s structure. Fibroin is the main protein of interest that we aim to attach functional domains onto. Fibroin serves as a vehicle for functionality.
Previously, to functionalize fibroin proteins, scientists have relied on chemical conjugation of silk peptides or breeding transfected silkworms that express transgenes encoding functional domains. However, these methods have inherent limitations. Attaching big, bulky functional domains directly onto the ends of fibroin proteins can disrupt Beta-sheet formation between the fibers. Preserving secondary structure is critical to preserve functionality. Moreover, native Bombyx mori silk genes are incredibly repetitive, which makes cloning of transgenes complex and time consuming. The breeding of transfected silkworms can be summed up as costly and laborious. These disadvantages prevent chemical conjugation and in vivo expression from becoming  sustainable, cost-efficient ways of manufacturing silk fibers with functional capacities. As a result, there is much need to develop a new method to manufacture functional fibers.
Methodology
Fig 1: Our novel, co-spinning module, with our gene of interest, sfGFP, inserted between the non-repetitive N and C terminal domains of Bombyx mori, along with appropriate Bsa1 restriction sites. Also not shown is a 6X histidine tag, used for later protein purification processes.
The theory behind the co-spinning methodology is to attach a functional domain onto the native silk fiber without disrupting the natural mechanical properties or non-immunogenic behavior of wild-type silk. To achieve this, we've created a genetic construct, entitled our ""co-spinning module"", consisting of super folder Green Fluorescent Protein (sfGFP) flanked on either sides by the N and C terminal domains of Bombyx mori. These termini are critical in maintaining the structural integrity of the fibers. Specifically, the N terminal domains of individual fibroin proteins bind to their identical counterparts on adjacent fibroin proteins, thereby establishing disulfide linkages between the fibers. The C terminal domains on the fibroin proteins aid the fibers in responding to decreases in pH levels and mechanical stresses, conditions that induce the stacking of Beta sheets into an actual fiber. The repetitive motifs in between the terminal domains are hydrophobic regions that cluster together, separate from the"

03-10-2010 - Thomas - Antiterminator group
Juliet and I were in the lab today the group. We ran a gel of the 30 verification PCRs that were done yesterday, as well as the four restriction digests. The verification PCRs showed that pATN and pAT08 were both successfully ligated and that the pAT11 ligation failed. We're unsure about the pAT01 ligation, there were strong bands for all four minipreps done, but one of the inserts was larger than the other three. The one that was larger was also the one we thought was closest to the expected size. We ran three PCRs, two of pAT01 (to further verify it) and one of pAT08 so it will be ready for restriction tomorrow.
The digestions of pAT02, 04, 06 and 07 all looked ok and were used to run three ligations, plasmids pAT09, 10 and 11.
02-10-2010 Anastasiya & Patrick Anti-terminator group
Re-did the digestions on pAT02, pAT04, pAT06 and pAT07 that Thomas managed to kill last night.. :p They were ran on a gel and seem to be good, PCR clean ups were made on them and they need to be ran on a gel again to determine the dna concentration, so this is one of the tasks to do for tomorrow. Freeze solutions were made of pAT02(L1-2), pAT06(L2-4), pAT07(L4-4) and placed into our strain bank in the -80C freezer.
Mini-preps were made of the over-night cultures containing pAT01, pAT08, pAT11 and pATN(N+1C3), these were then ran on a gel as well as used for PCR verification. If no one else from the building takes out the PCR tubes from the PCR machines, then remove them tomorrow and run them on a gel to see if our ligations were successful.
As there was no more space in our functional parts only box, I started a new one called functional parts only box #2 and the new mini-preps can be found in there.

Mutagenesis
In traditional directed evolution, the gene encoding the protein of interest is mutated, mostly by PCR and DNA shuffling, to create a library of gene variants large enough for the subsequent selection. In our system, we introduced a mutagenesis module to make the diversification automated and more controllable. In order to generate enough mutants of the interested sequence carried by the phage, an inducible mutagenesis plasmid was constructed (see Fig.1), inspired by the work of Kevin M. Esvelt [1].
(Figure 1 Structure of the mutagenesis plasmid)
The increased mutation rate is achieved by suppressing the proofreading ability of DNA polymerase Ⅲ and enhancing the translesion synthesis in the SOS response.
Suppressing the proofreading
The dnaQ gene encodes the ε subunit of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, which acts as the proofreading 3' exonuclease. During DNA synthesis, mispaired bases are removed by theε subunit as soon as they are incorporated. By changing two amino acid residues, we get dnaQ926, a defective mutant whose products interfere proofreading by competing with wild-type ε subunits [2].
Enhancing the translesion synthesis
When a cell experiences DNA damage, RecA proteins will bind to single-stranded DNA formed consequentially by the damage, and induce the SOS response by inactivating the repressor of umuD and umuC. The UmuD protein then undergoes an auto-digestion and produces UmuD’ which associates with the umuC product to form a complex UmuD’2C, the form active in translesion synthesis [3]. To accelerate this progress, recA730, umuD’ and umuC are introduced in the mutagenesis plasmid. RecA730 is one of the mutants of recA whose product is the most proficient in the competition for single-stranded DNA and thereby more activated for the repressor inactivation that leads to SOS induction [4].The over-expressed umuD’ and umuC will enhance error-prone lesion bypass and inhibit RecA-mediated homologous recombination, an additional mechanism by which the umuDC gene products help E. coli tolerate DNA damage [3].
Soon after infection, phage DNA replicates in a speed much faster than E. coli’s genome. Progeny M13 ph"

References were also needed in order to make sure we were indeed measuring RFP and to see how the growth curve of the strains the constructs were residing inside were behaving, therefore pSB2K3 which contains an RFP coding device, namely BBa_J04450 was taken from the DNA distribution kit, transformed and plated, and reference XL1-Blue and DH5α were plated as well. Overnight pre-cultures were started of these 24 colonies (15 SPL, 7 reference promoters, and 2 references) in order to run subsequent measurements with BioLector .
Once BioLector measurements were made for all of the above mentioned constructs within both of the strains, specific activity of the SPL promoters could be calculated and more importantly the Relative Promoter Unit (RPUs) in relation to the standard reference BBa_J23101 as per BBF RFC 19.
Results
As mentioned previously, two strains of E.coli were used. Constructs 1-4 were therefore transformed both into XL1-Blue and DH5α, both of these sets of transformations containing the constructs were then measured using the BioLector.
The first set of measurements, involving constructs 1-4 within strain XL1-Blue, showed a lot of variation in promoter strengths of the SPL. What was more significant was being able to map these strengths in relation to the reference promoters. The graph below illustrates the different promoter strengths obtained by plotting RFP over Biomass for the SPL and the reference promoters.
Figure 3 illustrates the variation in promoter strengths of the SPL mapped against the reference promoters. PM corresponds to BBa_J23101, PS corresponds to BBa_J23100 and PW corresponds to BBa_J23116.
The SPL and reference promoters can then be plotted, ranking them according to their specific activities. The graph below displays the rankings.
Figure 4 illustrates the specific activities of the SPL promoters ranked together with the reference promoters.
Table 1 shows the specific activities and RPUs calculated for all the SPL constructs run in the first set of measurements in BioLector

Mid-Atlantic Meetup
University of Virginia, 29 July 2017
By attending the the 2017 Mid Atlantic Meet-up hosted by the University of Virginia, the UMaryland iGEM team both discovered further improvements on all three projects and established collaboration opportunities with other teams. The attendees of the event included: William & Mary, UDelaware, UNC-Asheville, and Georgia State. Following the presentations, the UMaryland team was inspired by William & Mary’s human practices and outreach efforts in education.
In addition to testing each team’s plasmids, our teams discussed collaboration opportunities on curriculum planning and methods in improving our “Lab-in-a-box” design and protocol. We had the pleasure of talking to all teams to reconsider the implementation of the banana project and revising the metal detection project with a narrower scope for education purposes.
The Mid Atlantic Meet-up’s informative breakout sessions featured several speakers and through these talks, the UMaryland team learned about the growth of open community labs and the beginnings of commercial implementations of synthetic biology. We also met Elliot Roth, who introduced us to Dr. Robalino and his work in saving the Cavendish banana. The breakout sessions motivated us to develop a “Lab-in-a-box” focused on accessibility in small communities for students. From this meet-up, the UMaryland team gathered novel methods in both teaching synthetic biology and catering to our local communities."

She also advised us on future experiments we could carry out in order to gather further data reflecting the efficacy of the system, both using immune cells in vitro, and in appropriate model organisms in vivo.
Dr Chris Butler
Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences
Dr Butler’s experience in Primary Care provided us with an important understanding of patient’s perceptions and their likely responses to the use of a GM probiotic. He believed that patients understand the concept of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ bacteria existing, but believed that the majority would still be surprised, and probably sceptical, about taking bacteria as a treatment. This reinforced the importance of educating the public about probiotics and the benefits of a diverse microbiome and encouraged us to develop an educational leaflet on this topic and focus on this in Long-term Public Education Plan. Dr Butler is the Principal Investigator of the PRINCESS (Probiotics to reduce infections in care homes) Trial, so provided information about the effectiveness of probiotics. He talked about the microbiome becoming less diverse with age, but informed us that there is currently no evidence to suggest that probiotics become less effective with age - suggesting that our therapeutic should still be functional in more elderly patients.

Professor Greaves highlighted the importance of ensuring that the delivery of IL-10 is controlled, drawing upon evidence from his own experiments that demonstrated the health risks associated with excessively high expression of IL-10.

Response Module
Our response system is based on a fluorescence emission signal and uses the fusion protein GFP-Dark Quencher linked together by a TEV cleavage site, as the key component of the module. We characterized an intein mediated reconstitution of the Split TEV as the system’s input; when the association by the intein mechanism occurs, the two split TEV bind together into a functional TEV protease. This active protease is then capable of triggering our response module by catalyzing the proteolytic cleavage of the GFP-Dark Quencher linker, leading to an increase in fluorescence emission. With this system, we established a new intein-split TEV tool approach.
Advantageous Response
Our response module is mediated by the enzymatic reaction of the reconstituted split TEV. One single detection event will guarantee one functional TEV, which could target multiple linker sites. This key feature based on the reconstitution of split TEV assures the amplification of the response making it easy to be detected and quantified. This response module and the split TEV approach are ideal to set a detection threshold.
Background
1. TEV Activation
We based our response system’s strategy on a split TEV approach, where the TEV sequence was separated into two fragments, which can be fused together by a reaction. The original TEV sequence has a S219V mutation to reduce its autoproteolysis and the integration position picked out to generate the split fragments was the amino acid 118, a functional split site already described (Sonntag & Nootz, 2011). This split TEV is already part of the iGEM repertory and based on the principle that there is no basal activity of the protease, we selected it as our response system's trigger.
Nevertheless, a second regulated reaction needs to take place to activate the TEV protease. Sonntag and Nootz (2011) mention that reconstitution of the TEV activity by a conditional protein splicing, as mediated by inteins, is a powerful tool due to its high specific activity and artificial regulation"

Promoter design, characterization and consequences
The generation of well-characterized genetic parts is a prerequisite for the rational design and construction of reliable genetically-encoded devices and systems.  However, most publicly available parts (including those in the Registry) remain largely uncharacterized.  Therefore, we propose a minimal measurement standard for the quantitative characterization of one of the most frequently used parts, promoters.  This approach uses both mRNA and protein measurements to provide a tractable and universal analysis of relevant promoter characteristics.  In an effort to elucidate promoter design principles, we have also designed and characterized new promoter and enhancer sequences.  Our goal is to contribute to the advancement of fundamental synthetic biology by evaluating the performance of new and existing promoters and enhancers, which may serve as a model for describing other basic parts such as ribosome-binding sites and transcriptional terminators.

Interview to a psychologist
Insights: Shocking. Improvement. To clear the doubts that emerge during the realization of the project
Changes: New perspective of the project
Resume
Our team wanted to know the perspective of a mental health professional so we decided that the best idea would be to contact a psychologist; we thought the best way to acquire was through an interview. During the interview we solved some doubts about depression and the best possible way help those people affected by depression and anxiety, we also asked about common facts about these illnesses and some of the most recurring misbeliefs about depression and anxiety.
Living library experience
Insights: Intimate. The public will be excited to live a face to face experience with people that suffer from anxiety and depression.
Resume
The living library is way of showing those who might be scared to share with others that they are depressed or even as encouraging them to accept their disease. This is a powerful of way of demonstrating the community that depression and anxiety are common diseases and that we must not be ashamed of suffering these illnesses thus we expect to create a space where people who go to this experience are comfortable enough to seek help and raise their voice.
Also there are still some people who believe that depression is just something that happens in movies, so via this experience we want to prove the relevance of mental health.
Movie
Insights: Conscience. That people would create an informed opinion about these
Resume
Similar to other events we expect to project a movie in a room big enough for at least 150 persons; sometimes documentaries can get boring  and tedious, so what we aim to show is a movie that has all the elements of what depression and anxiety are,
also the consequences of not seeking help, how to encourage someone to seek help. Our main objective is to show in a way where people can get to experience what depression from another point of view.
We intend for this event to be appealing all of the alumni of our campus, as well teachers, executives, administratives, workers and relatives of all the schools personnel.
Collaborations with other teams
Insights: Excitement, sharing our work and learn from the work of other is awesome.
Resume
We are really excited to collaborate with other iGem teams around the world; we developed a dynamic where we asked other teams to take a photograph of a touristic monument and add an special hashtag; we are in process of receiving the photographs and organizing them.
We are also waiting for opportunities to collaborate with iGem teams of Mexico,"

People's Opinion
When making a project that significantly changes the agenda for antibody production and use, it is important to shed light on the opinion of the general population. Is there in fact a public demand for an alternative? To get these answers we conducted a survey asking people about their opinion on the use of laboratory animals in scientific research and antibody production.
The survey was open for one month and shared via our accounts on facebook and twitter. To get answers from all over the world we sent our survey to various iGEM teams and asked them, if they would be interested in helping us by sharing it. The survey brought in answers from 291 people. These people were primarily from Europe, but also people from North and South America, Asia and Australia responded to the survey. The majority of the respondents were young people in the ages of 19-29 and roughly 2/3 was either working or studying in the fields of life sciences such as biochemistry, molecular biology, bioengineering or medicine.
From the above data, it is shown that 60 % of the respondents have an ambivalent view on the use of laboratory animals"

Why cadmium?
The BacMan project is focused mainly on sequestering the heavy metal cadmium from contaminated soils, however with the many other heavy metals known to contaminate agricultural land, such as Mercury or Arsenic, it is necessary for us to justify our decision.
Exposure
Cadmium is one of the most toxic heavy metals to which the environment can be exposed.  Smoking is a major source of cadmium exposure to humans, however the main source of contamination to food is the usage of cadmium containing fertilisers and sewage sludge on agricultural land used for crops and vegetables (Jarup and Akesson. 2009).
The level of human exposure is dependent on factors such as dietary habits, and contamination of agricultural land. Exposure is significantly higher in China and Japan than in Europe and the US due to the high intake of rice grown on soil contaminated by local polluting industries (Nordberg et al. 2007)  As well as food, water from rivers and wells can also be seriously contaminated. Cadmium is present in most foods however is particularly concentrated in molluscs, crabs and other shellfish, as well as tubular plants and root vegetables; cadmium is also concentrated in offal products such as kidney and liver.
As well as humans, cadmium exposure has implications for other species, with recent studies revealing cadmium exposure has serious effects on embryonic development of grazing animals (Nandi et al. 2009).

In the last few days, we have confirmed that our restriction enzymes work, that our electroshock cuvettes do not due to corrosion from bleach, and still have had no confirmed biobricks. We picked another candidate colony from the ArgE plate because the PCR of the plasmid between VF2 and VR (standard biobrick sequencing primers) was only about 200 bp, while we were expecting about 1.2 kb. We got the same result from our potential MetA colony. We received new ligase, and if that doesn't work, we are going to try the gibson assembly method. Using a previous restriction digest"
IISc_Bangalore,2016,Team:IISc Bangalore#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Govt. of Karnataka
We had a sit down on July 27th, 2016 with top officials at the Government of Karnataka’s (GoK) (the state in which our institute is located) department of Information Technology, Biotechnology and Science and Technology and presented to them our idea and its applications.
We presented our project and its possible implementation in the government biotechnology parks which are lacking in machinery for automation and downstream processing, some of these processes can be performed by our BioBricks, which can effectively replace or supplement these expensive machines. The intent was to convince our government representatives of the need for enhancing the current government biotechnology facilities and a possible option of doing so.
The novelty of using Ag43 for clarification of cell cultures and using this to replace or supplement energy and capital expensive centrifuges and its application in conjunction with auto-induction using quorum sensing made our idea patent worthy in their opinion and hence, to continue our research, the GoK’s biotechnology department granted us ~$9,000 towards consumables for our project.

UESTC-China,2017,Team:UESTC-China#achievement_-_-_TEXT.html,"Our project is a three-enzyme system catalyzing a five-step chemical conversion, we hope that these three enzymes (DhaA31, HheC, EchA) will be used to degrade TCP into glycerol. The efficiency of multi-enzyme processes can be enhanced by optimization of the stoichiometry of the biocatalysts. Dynamics research has been a hot topic，however the dynamics of the multi-enzyme system is complex. We built a mathematical model, and the enzyme stoichiometry of each pathway was optimized. Mathematical modeling and one-pot multienzyme experiments provided detailed insights into pathway dynamics, enabled the selection of a suitable engineered enzyme, and optimal ratios of enzymes. According to the modeling results, and combining the character of plants, we constructed different plasmids. Then some parameters were adjusted for the best fitting with our experimental data. The validated model was used to quantitatively describe the kinetic limitations of currently available enzyme variants and predict improvements required for further pathway optimization. We used the model to guide the design, and found an optimal strategy to improve project conversion efficiency. Click here for modeling.
☑ Best Plant Synthetic Biology
Our team produced a Super Tobacco which could degrade 1,2,3-TCP into glycerol this year. We introduced three key enzymes, DhaA31, HheC-W249P, EchA into tobacco by Agrobacterium mediated transformation with the application of synthetic biology of plants. In order to obtain better degradation efficiency of TCP by enriching these three enzymes at the root of tobacco, we also used a plant root specific expression promoter YK10 to replace the constitutive promoter CaMV35s. At the same time, a gene encoding the expression of cytokinin, CKX3, which could improve the biomass of roots as well as a plant cell wall localization signal peptide AO-S were also introduced into tobacco. All the genes we used have been codon-optimized for dicotyledonous plants and were submitted as BioBricks to iGEM Registry. Our results provided a potential approach for degrading 1,2,3-TCP by plants and we hoped that our Biobricks could be helpful to other iGEMers who worked with synthetic biology of plants in the future!

Survey
How do iGEM teams usually organize their wetlab work? Could tubefront be deployed to other laboratories?
We have asked other teams to answer several questions on wetlab organization. The results indicate that there could not be more diversity between teams. Some already have certain organization systems that they are happy with, but many have problems or don't have a good system yet.
Demographics
In total 32 teams participated in the survey. Most of them (88 %) were European or Asian teams.
Distribution of Wetlab Team Size
Most iGEM teams usually work with wetlab crews of around 9 people. Some teams have scaled up to more than 15 or"

Figure 7: For our signaling proteins, we revert to the basis: OmpX. We functionalize OmpX by introducing the amber stop codon into its loops (red). The signaling domains are fused to OmpX C-terminally, since the N-terminus is occupied by the signaling sequence (yellow). The signaling sequence is cleaved from OmpX after localization.
The Loops
The amber stop codon will be incorporated in the protruding loops of OmpX. We have chosen to introduce the mutations into the loops since they are easily accessible and are not a part of the beta-barrel of OmpX [ 12] . Hence, we believe that mutations in the loops will not disturb the secondary structure of OmpX (see Figure 8B).
Figure 8: A) The OmpX protein structure has been elucidated through NMR and X-ray crystallography. B) The square residues are important for the secondary structure of OmpX. To keep the structure intact, we introduce an amber stop codon in one of the protruding loops. Figure 8B is adapted from [13] .
The to be substituted residues in the loops were chosen in such a way that the clicked aptamer would protrude from OmpX. Moreover, residues were selected such that the signaling protein's structure closely resembles OmpX natural’s structure. The serine residue in loop 2 was chosen since it was the only available residue with side-groups pointing outward from OmpX. The tyrosine residue in loop 3 was chosen both because tyrosine closely resembles the unnatural azide-functionalized amino acid (see Figure 9) and because the tyrosine points outward from OmpX.
Figure 9: The unnatural azide-functionalized amino acid closely resembles tyrosine.
The Signaling Components
Quite paradoxically, the number of signaling proteins pales in comparison with the vast amount of cellular responses. This signaling paradox can be explained by the fact that cells employ amazingly complex signaling pathways, which feature signal amplification, signal integration and cross communication [14] . In addition to the vast amount of effects signaling pathways can have, these pathways operate over a staggering range of time scales; some signaling pathways act within less than a second, whereas others affect cell behavior only after hours or days.
An essential aspect of a universal membrane sensor is that it allows for these wide ranges of time scales and responses. We believe that the modularity of our membrane sensor and the complexity of intracellular cell signaling allows for a wide range of responses"

DgrA/DgrB Circuit
Introduction
The concentration of c-di-GMP is varying, and for our experiment we will promote its expression to inhibit rotation of flagella. It will bind to DgrA and DgrB. The resulting complex will have two routes to go: one is the [c-di-GMP&DgrA] complex which will inhibit FliL, a protein bound to the membrane playing a key role in rotation of flagella. And the other route is that the DgrB will directly affect the rotation of the flagella.
Equations
$$\frac{d([cdiGMP-DgrA])}{dt} = \frac{(Ka \cdot [cdiGMP] \cdot DgrA - Kf \cdot [cdiGMP-DgrA] \cdot FliL - [Kd_{cdiGMP-DgrA}] \cdot [cdiGMP-DgrA])}{cell}$$
$$\frac{d([cdiGMP-DgrB])}{dt} = \frac{(Kb \cdot [cdiGMP] \cdot DgrB - [Kd_{cdiGMP-DgrB}] \cdot [cdiGMP-DgrB])}{cell}$$
$$\frac{d(FliL)}{dt} = \frac{(-Kf \cdot [cdiGMP-DgrA] \cdot FliL + Kg_{FliL})}{cell}$$
$$\frac{d([cdiGMP-DgrA-FliL])}{dt} = \frac{(Kf \cdot [cdiGMP-DgrA] \cdot FliL)}{cell}$$

We also asked the following question: From what price would you say this product is too expensive? The average of the answers was 81 €.
Finally, we asked a more technical question about using our Aether product: The filters do not have an unlimited life, we consider the following charging system: The user will receive a notification on his phone indicating that it is necessary to change his filter. He will then replace the old filter with a new filter, and send the used filter to a collection center where it will be analyzed and upgraded. Envelopes specially designed for this purpose will be included in the kit ""Aether"". From what lifespan of the filter do you consider the charging system as a constraint?
Meetings with enterprises
BIOTechno Forum Réseau BIOTechno is a french network and a unique organization in Europe, uniting 12 doctoral students and PhDs associations of Biotechnology spread over the whole country. The aim of the events “Forum BIOtechno 2017” organized on June 16th was to enable PhD students to highlight their transferable skills from Academia to industry. We took advantage from this opportunity to present our project to biotechnology experts. It was also a great opportunity to train ourselves to pitch the project.
Vivatech forum VivaTech is the world’s rendezvous for startups and leaders to celebrate innovation together. It’s a gathering of the world’s brightest minds, talents, and products. On June 17th, we had the opportunity to present our project to several enterprises, get feedback and discuss about potential partnership.
Conclusion
To conclude, during these past 10 months we really tried to communicate with the public and experts around our project, synthetic biology and air pollution. We did our utmost to reach the widest audience in order to see how our project affects society and integrate our conversations with stakeholders in the design of our product. We took advantage of every opportunity to integrate feedback and publicize our project, whether it was through a Particulate matter scavenger hunt, a questionnaire, meetings ... or even by giving a flyer of our project to President of France, Emmanuel Macron, who unfortunately was too busy to answer our questions for the law report.

WITS-CSIR_SA,2011,Team:WITS-CSIR SA#Project#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"ine-dependent fashion. It consists of a newly improved theophylline riboswitch clone 12.1 (Lynch and Gallivan NAR 2009) that is detached from its associated translation unit (coding region) and fused to a CheZ gene which has a N-fusion prefix and lacks a stop codon (although a TAG stop codon is provided by the RFC 25 suffix). The riboswitch regulated N-terminal part can be fused to a reporter or other CDS.
CheZ is the chief regulator of the molecular events that lead the counter clockwise rotation of the flagella motor during the chemotaxis signal transduction pathway of E.coli. This counter clockwise flagella motor rotation results in bacterial swimming (instead of tumbling) in the presence of a chemoattractant (in this case, theophylline).
Back to Top
When no atrazine is present, the RBS within the riboswitch sequence is not exposed to translation machinery. When atrazine is present, it binds to the riboswitch and causes a conformational change which results in the RBS being exposed. This allows for the translation of the adjoining gene. In this case, the gene which will be expressed is CheZ - a fundamental protein in the signalling cascade of bacterial chemotaxis. This riboswitch-CheZ fusion BioBrick regulates the expression of the CheZ gene in an atrazine-dependent fashion. It is composed of an atrazine-sensitive riboswitch, developed by Sinha et al (2010), which is detached from its associated translation unit (coding region) and fused to a CheZ gene which has the Freiburg N-fusion prefix and lacks a stop codon. While it is possible to fuse the riboswitch to the CheZ coding region by standard BioBrick assembly techniques, this approach was not used as it would increase the distance between the RBS and the ATG start codon and potentially decrease the efficiency of the riboswitch. This was shown in the work of the Taipei 2010 team who used this approach for a theophylline riboswitch. The riboswitch and the adjacent CheZ coding region are considered together and should be cloned together. CheZ is the chief regulator of the molecular events that lead the counter clockwise rotation of the flagella motor during the Chemotaxis signal transduction pathway of E.coli. This counter clockwise flagella motor rotation results in bacterial swimming (instead of tumbling) in the presence of a chemoattractant (in this case atrazine).

METU_HS_Ankara,2016,Team:METU HS Ankara#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," ButCoat and RBS + ButCoat
We have loaded uncut version of K2052015 next to EcoRI single digested one. In the third lane RBS ligated ButCoat (K2052018) was loaded with its single digested version. Digested ones gave sharp lane at 3600 bp as we expected.
K2052016
Gel Image 3: FimH+Double Terminator+ Arabinose Promoter+ RBS+ ButCoAT
Here, we have uncut and cut version of our whole construct. Since we have out of enzymes, we have digested them with NcoI. After digestion, we were expecting a lane at 1200 bp. Because it has 3 cut sites in the construct, we have extra lanes.
PCR Confirmation
Gel Image 4: PCR confirmation of Ligated Parts
The primers that we have designed bind and multiply the site when the insert and vector are ligated properly, forward binds to a region in vector and reverse binds to a region in insert and give a product at 781 bp for 1,2,3,4 which is K2052014 and 843 bp for 5 K2052018 ,6 which is K2052015.  Primers:
forward  5’-CGAAAAGCCAAAACCTGG-3’-18 bp
reverse  5’-GAAGCCTGCATAACGCGG-3’ -18 bp for 1,2,3,4
forward 5’ –TTGGAACCTCTTACGTGCCC-3’-20bp
reverse 5’- ATCAGTTTCGCCACGGTCTT-3’-20bp for 5,6
Single digestion and  confirmational PCR has been made to confirm that the vector and the insert unites properly.  As it can be seen in the first four lanes, PCR gave a hit at 781 bp. It has been confirmed that they united properly.
CHARACTERIZATION
We tried our experiments for expression vector, pet28a, however after hundreds of trials, we failed to get the expected results. So we decided to change our method and used our parts with psB1c3 backbone for characterization. By ligating GFP to the upstream of FimH and by ligating RFP to the downstream of ButCoAT, we have designed new constructs that we used for both characterization and experimental validation.
Our construct which includes GFP goes like this;

Gijs Verkleij
MSc. in Biotechnology, 2nd semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
Synthetic biologists are the next rockstars! Not just me who’s saying that: wired.com: ""biologists are the next rock star designers""
Theater or cinema?
Cinema, because it’s for young people. I will engineer my own genes to stay forever young.
Stefani Pjaca
MSc. in Biotechnology, 2nd semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
iGEM is an once-in-a-lifetime learning opportunity to be a part of an ambitious team and to develop a project from scratch to the final jamboree in Boston and hopefully contribute to the synthetic biology community.
If you had 50.000 DKK to spend in two hours, what would you spend them on?
I really enjoy traveling the world, so I would definitely use the money to go traveling somewhere! I would probably book a trip to Australia since I have never been there before.
Mohamad Ali Khalil El Lakany
MSc. Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, 1st semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
I like the entrepreneurial aspect to the whole project. Having and idea and making that idea happen. To watch it grow to something useful, beautiful, practical and presentable. To handle and overcome the obstacles you meet on that road. It really thrills me. Igem is exactly that and more.
What cheers you up?
Oh, that’s a long list. I would say, children and dogs. Children because of their innate, almost unquenchable curiosity, in addition to their appreciation for the even the smallest things. They make us rethink things and reevaluate our habituated views on things and the actions we do. Dogs are just great, and"

Fusion proteins
Fusion proteins
In order to validate this inhibition in vivo, Bouvier et al. constructed a translational OmpN fusion to the N terminus of GFP. Figure 3 shows the mentioned OmpN::GFP fusion. They observed that the GFP signal was inhibited by the asRNA, probing that the fusion of the beginning of the OmpN gene with the GFP gene was also regulatable by the RybB asRNA.
Figure 3. OmpN::GFP fusion. The fusion includes the nucleotides -75 to 90 relative to the ATG of OmpN. The beginning of the OmpN CDS is shown in red capital letters. Taken from Bouvier et al., Suplemental Data (2008)
We will take advantage of this strategy by making an analogue fusion of OmpN start sequence with those proteins whose translation we want to regulate. As we can see in Figure 1, the RybB asRNA binds to nucleotides from 5th to 20th relative to AUG. Consequently, we have designed a shorter fusion in which we fuse the first 7 codons of the OmpN gene CDS upstream of the RFP and Sspb CDS. As for the upstream nucleotides of the OmpN gene we have chosen those from the mRNA (see Figure 4) to make sure that no promoter was included. As we can see in Figure 1, these fusions do include the OmpN RBS.

Our final fusions of OmpN::SspB and OmpN::RFP are shown in Figure 5.

Overview
This year, our project has focused on the cardiovascular health issues, and our human practice has made great contributions to integrate laboratory work with community practice. We interviewed medical staff and patients to learn about the current clinical treatments for cardiovascular diseases. It helped us to improve the design our project to meet translational needs. Also, we conducted detailed data analysis for past iGEM projects, and found that cardiovascular area was under-studied compared to other areas in the Health & Medicine track, i.e. antibiotics. We hope this area could be promoted by our work. Moreover, we spent time in communicating with a wide audience of iGEMers, cardiovascular experts, legal specialists and local residents to promote the healthy lifestyle of cardiovascular prevention, security of gene technology and knowledge of synthetic biology. All our HP work emphasized the social responsibilities of scientific staff, letting scientific project exert real impact on the society.

Beyond the Bench and Back to the Bench
We have spared no efforts to connect our human practice with laboratory work. We tried to make our human practice run through the experiments. Firstly, we searched and read plenty of papers, reports and past iGEM projects and analyzed the data we gathered. Secondly, we interviewed the doctors about present cardiovascular treatment and asked for advice of project design. After that, we had the first team seminar to talk about talent training and attended an important conference to present our initial idea and got lots of helpful and instructive feedbacks. After improvement, we implemented experiments and gained preliminary results. And then we had a dialogue with doctors to show the results and had the second team seminar to discuss how we can connect the modeling with our experiment. With abundant suggestions, we polished our project design again and gained more positive results which made us excited. Next, we made great contributions to promote the idea of gene therapy based on synthetic biology to those who are concerned about our project. We tried our best to have a dialogue with patients and discover their real living condition, and we introduce our new method of synthetic biology to acquire their precious thoughts and suggestions. Finally, we went back to the bench to"

Selection
Overview
Motivation
Selection is a key mechanism of evolution like Darwin defined it. Biodiversity and life as we know it in all its complexity is scientificly not explicable without it. We wanted to design a system able to generate an Evobody that can gain affinity towards any target protein it is confronted with. So what better way is there to design our system than copying one of evolutions core principles and letting the bacteria with the best Evobody emerge by itself?
Having a library of Evobodies as well as a mutation system is a great way to guarantee a high variety of binding proteins.    However, there is still the need of a screening method to separate Evobodies that show affinity to the target protein from those    that do not. As we wanted our whole system to work in vivo utilizing directed evolution we settled for three different    approaches to screen for functional Evobodies:
Overview

Software
Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Week commencing - 13/08/18
A positive control for Gibson assembly was undertaken by assembling 2 overlapping dsDNA fragments and the backbone pUC19 control DNA provided by NEB, using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Cloning Kit. This was used to ensure that Gibson assembly using the master mix worked, and that the cells had been made competent. This positive control reaction was then transformed into the competent cells made earlier in the week using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Transformation Protocol. These cells underwent heat shock before being spread onto LB plates containing ampicillin as the positive control plasmid carried resistance to ampicillin. All 3 of the positive control plates had growth of DH5α cells, the negative control plate had no growth of DH5α cells, as they contained no plasmid and were not ampicillin resistant. This showed that the Gibson master mix was effective and the competent cells had been successfully made competent.
Week commencing - 20/08/18
gBlocks and the primers for the detection of the gBlocks were resuspended following instructions by IDT. Gibson assembly of the gBlocks and the pSB1C3 backbone was conducted using the volumes calculated through NEB: the vector should be 0.05 pmol and each insert between 0.1 – 0.2 pmol so that the total does not exceed 0.5 pmol. Competent cells were then transformed using the reaction mix and plated onto LB agar containing chloramphenicol instead of previously used ampicillin, as pSB1C3 has chloramphenicol resistance. Following overnight incubation, no colonies were observed on either the test plates of the negative control plates.
Week commencing- 27/08/18
A second attempt at Gibson assembly was conducted and the transformation protocol was performed the same as previously. No colony growth resulted from this. It was considered that the backbone concentration was too low, which could be limiting transformation. More of the backbone was amplified and purified to a stock concentration of 26.2 µg/ ml.
Week commencing- 3/09/18
A third attempt of Gibson assembly was done using the increased backbone concentration resulting in a total reaction volume of 36.3 µl. This was then transformed into DH5α cells resulting in 1 colony on each plate where  200 µl of transformation mix had been"

Gene Therapy
Overview
The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) iGEM 2013 team has built a fatty acid inducible system that enables inducible glyoxylate shunt to serve as an artificial futile cycle in human liver cells. Our vision is to introduce genes necessary for the cycle into the human body, with the aim of ultimately increasing energy expenditure in response to high circulating fatty acid levels. The idea is this would help obesity patients increase expenditure of calories and alleviate health complications such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Because introducing genes into the human body is currently not a common therapeutic method, we thought it would be necessary to research on the details of how our project could be actually applied. Even though the application of our project may not occur in the near future, we thought it necessary to evaluate our project’s application as a potential biotechnology product. We have investigated a possible method that is under serious research in the scientific community: gene therapy. In this article, we will introduce the approach in more detail, examine the biosafety and bioethical issues, and lastly examine whether our project could be applied using this method.
Gene Therapy
Introduction
Gene therapy is a method that involves introducing changes in the genome to treat or prevent disease. In general this can be done by replacing a gene, inactivating a gene, or introducing a new gene into the body. Currently, scientists are trying to make gene therapy safer and more effective. In the future, effective gene therapy might replace the use of drugs or surgery (Handbook, 2013).
History
In 1966, Edward Tatum first published a paper suggesting the use of viruses in somatic-cell genetics and gene therapy. The first clinical trial was conducted by Rogers et al. to cure urea cycle disorder by introducing the gene for arginase using Shope"

The solution of the above given equation is \[ p_N(t) = \left( \begin{array}{c} N-1 \\ N_0-1 \end{array} \right) e^{-\lambda N_0 t}(1-e^{-\lambda t})^{N-N_0} \quad;\quad N=N_0, N_0+1,... \] which is the negative binomial distribution where, for convenience, we have written $N(0)$ as $N_0$. In a practical way, this differential equation can be solved by a variety of theoretical techniques. While we are more interested here with the result than the mathematical formulae, we let the readers interested in the proof to consult Bailey's book The elements of stochastic processes [Bai ], for instance.
As our solution is of the standard negative binomial form, the mean -i.e. the average value- and the variance -i.e. the average way that we move away from the mean- are given by : \[ m(t)=N_0e^{\lambda t}\quad and\quad V(t)=N_0e^{\lambda t}(e^{\lambda t}-1) \]
Especially, we see that the mean of the stochastic model is exactly what we have found by having a deterministic approach.
Simple birth-death process
In fact, the model we exposed in the previous part was not realistic and we have to consider that our bacteria could also die. We introduce here the death rate $\mu$ which is also supposed to be the same for all bacteria, regardless of their age and don't change with time. We still assume that bacteria develop without interacting with each other.
Deterministic model
We still have the same notation and $N(t)$ denotes the population size at time $t$.
We proceed in a same way than in the pure birth process but, this time, death will lead to a decrease of the population, that's why the $\mu$ is preceded by a minus : \[ \frac{dN}{dt}(t) = (\lambda-\mu) N(t) \] which integrates to give \[ N(t) = N_0 e^{(\lambda-\mu) t} \] where $N_0$ denotes the initial population size at time $t=0$.
We still find an exponential growth, but the"
