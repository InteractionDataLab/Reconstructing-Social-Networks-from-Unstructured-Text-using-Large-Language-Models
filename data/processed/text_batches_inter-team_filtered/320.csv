Abstract
Biosensing Water Contaminants
with Genetically Engineered
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1
As one of the most important natural resources, the declining quality of fresh water is a world-wide issue. Pollutants such as pharmaceuticals, hormones and heavy metals are rarely monitored and the need to detect and remove these compounds in an inexpensive way is what motivates this project. The marine bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 could be a part of the solution through its unique ability to interact with electronics. The Mtr pathway in S. oneidensis MR-1 is an external electron transportation pathway that is able to transfer electrons to an external acceptor such as an anode, thus generating electric current that is utilized in bioelectrochemical systems. We are utilizing S. oneidensis MR-1 △MtrB, the MtrB gene is removed, to prevent electron flow to an outside source through this key protein. We are then inserting a plasmid into this strain that contains the MtrB gene under control of a promoter that activates transcription of the protein when induced by compounds such as pesticides and metals in the water. This will allow for controlled electrical expression that can be used in microbial fuel cells to create a biosensor for the detection of these compounds. This biosensor will then be engineered to be manufactured on a large scale to be used for research, education, humanitarian efforts and even consumer use. Although the proof of concept is currently tested in a single chambered bioelectrochemical system, an affordable and portable paper microbial fuel cell system is currently in development."
Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Model Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," model predicted that at high amounts, magnesium glutamate and sodium oxalate were having an inhibitory effect, and potassium glutamate was having an enhancing effect on CFPS activity (Figure 6). It is well known that magnesium ions are crucial for protein synthesis, for example in the functioning of ribosomes, however at high amounts magnesium can become inhibiting to protein synthesis by stalling translation at the translocation step (Li, et al., 2014). Therefore, it is not unexpected that magnesium glutamate causes a decrease in protein synthesis activity at certain concentrations.
Figure 6: Cube plot generated by JMP using data collected for the SRD. The x-axis shows magnesium glutamate concentration, the y-axis shows potassium glutamate concentration, and the z-axis shows sodium oxalate concentration. The ovals shows predicted CFPS concentration. The maximal CFPS activity was found at 195 mM potassium glutamate, 6 mM magnesium glutamate, and 2 mM sodium oxalate. The minimal point was found at 65 mM potassium glutamate, 18 mM magnesium glutamate, and 2 mM sodium oxalate. This was verified as the maximum and minimum points using the surface profiler function in JMP.
As mentioned before, sodium oxalate is used as an inhibitor of the enzyme which converts pyruvate to PEP. However, pyruvate is also con verted to desirable metabolites during the pathway which generates ATP for protein synthesis, and these reactions should not be inhibited. Sodium oxalate acts as a pyruvate mimic, and therefore at high concentrations it may not only inhibit conversion of pyruvate to PEP, but also pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, which would decrease the amount of ATP generate, and hence reduce protein synthesis activity. This may be one explanation for why sodium pyruvate appears to have an inhibitory affect. Using this data, a maximum protein synthesis activity within the range of concentrations used for each salt was found at 6 mM magnesium glutamate, 195 mM potassium glutamate, and 2 mM sodium oxalate (Figure 6). A CFPS supplement solution with these revised amounts was made and used to perform CFPS reactions. Two types of CFPS system were used; one which contained cell extract from the same batch that was used to build the SRD model (B1), and extract from a separate batch, but which was prepared in an identical way (D1). The results showed that CFPS reactions using extract from the same batch that was used to build the model (B1) did indeed increase"

Peking team visiting our team
Seven team members of Peking team, Hongyu Xiong, Wenyuan Zhou, Sibai Sun, Hong Zhang, Wenming Xing, Tian Lu and Zidong Zhang visited us on July 27th. Before they came, we thought to work together on a project of Human Practice, addressing lectures related to iGEM and synthetic biology to high school students in Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum. This was a good project and also a rare chance, after all, Hangzhou was nearly 1600 kilometers away from Beijing. Peking team provided event planning and contacted with the person in charge of museum, our team designed and printed the post and tried to contacted with teachers of several high schools in Hangzhou. But due to summer holidays, it was difficult to call together highschool students. At last, we had to give up this project. It was really a pity. Anyway, our team communicated with Peking team happily. We exchanged the project and recent progress with each other, and had a wonderful dinner together! Though we can't collaborate on Human Practice this year, this visit no doubt strengthened the friendship between Peking team and ZJU team!

Xcode
  For us, the programming tool is XCode. Xcode is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) containing a suite of software development tools developed by Apple for developing software for OS X and iOS. First released in 2003, the latest stable release is version 4.4.1 and is available via the Mac App Store free of charge for Mac OS X Lion and OS X Mountain Lion users.
  
  Similar to other programming tools, XCode can support many different programming languages, like C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, Java, AppleScript, Python and so on. However, the major language we use is Objective-C.
  
  What makes XCode unique is that it includes interface builder. Interface Builder is a software development application for Apple's Mac OS X operating system. It is part of Xcode, the Apple Developer Connection developer's toolset. Interface Builder allows Cocoa and Carbon developers to create interfaces for applications using a graphical user interface. It is very user-friendly. There are many components, like buttons and sliders, listed beside the main window, users can just drag the components into the main window, and then these components can be showed when running the program. If don’t use Interface Builder, users will have to write lines and lines of statements to set a component, but now, just dragging can simply set its properties. Moreover, if users set a link between the component and statements, then this component can be controlled by the program.

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," are a burden for insurance companies. It is thus important to keep our solution affordable. Although not accurate, our cost calculation above indicates that the plaster will be cost-friendly. In addition, the reduced number of wound dressing changes will lower labor costs. The affordability of our system will not only be appealing to developed countries, but also to developing countries. As the plaster material is well-storable and transportable, it may provide an equal solution for patients in remote places and cities.
To prevent resistance against lysostaphin, we could consider a multi-angle approach inspired on the treatment of tuberculosis and malaria. For these diseases, the simultaneous administration of several drugs has been proven effective in the fight against resistance (34). Similarly, there is preliminary evidence that tolerance to a certain bacteriocin renders bacteria more susceptible to other toxins. Furthermore, experiments indicate that the combined activity of several bacteriocins is higher than the activity of each of them alone and that doses could be lowered (35). It has been observed that lysostaphin-resistant strains of S. aureus show increased susceptibility to methicillin. Methicillin-resistant strains were even rendered methicillin-sensitive (20). We may thus co-secrete lysostaphin with other bacteriocins or antibiotics.
Finally, the lysostaphin secretion results have positive implications on their own. Secretion significantly simplifies the purification and downstream processing of proteins (36). We established secretion without the use of any special equipment not present in a modest laboratory. This means that scientists, pharmacists and medical doctors in developing and developed countries alike may benefit from our method. They may thus use lysostaphin to treat patients without excessive costs.
Outlook
The first step towards a wound healing plaster would be the assembly of our secretion and adhesin systems. Based on stakeholder-feedback, we already designed some next steps to improve our design.
Additional bacteriocins
We want to expand on the secretion system with other bacteriocins, implement a sensing system, and we consider the implementation of a kill switch. Initially, we searched for a bacteriocin against Staphylococcus aureus. After feedback from several experts, we realized we should expand our secretion system with bacteriocins which target Pseudonomas aeruginosa, Streptococcus and preferably also other bacteria present on wounds. This is because wounds are always colonized by several bacterial strains. The eradication of S. aureus is an important first step towards wound healing, but may lead to other bacteria becoming more dominant in the wound flora. We propose to combine the expansion of our secretion system with sensing-based regulation"

Then run npm run dev, and you can access the site at localhost:8080.
Guidance for Plugin Developers
To create and activate a new plugin, simply run:
(.env) $ ./biohub-cli.py plugin new <plugin_name> --with-frontend (.env) $ ./biohub-cli.py plugin install <plugin_name>
where <plugin_name> is the dot-separated module name of the plugin (e.g. biohub.abacus). You may type ./biohub-cli.py plugin new --help to find more details.
The second step is to install dependencies for the frontend of the new plugin. Simply run:
(.env) $ cd path/to/your/plugin/frontend (.env) $ npm install (.env) $ npm run dev <port> # randomly choose a number for <port> from 10000~65535
Then compiled files will be served at localhost:<port>. Don’t forget to add a new item in frontend/main/domain.config.json:
{ ""dev"": {         // ...         plugins: {             // ... ""<your_plugin_name>"": ""<port>"" }     } }
Now you can start to write your own plugin. The templates generated by biohub-cli contains some useful comments, which may help you during developing. Also, you can take our integrated plugins (e.g. biohub.biomap) as references."

Light Control
    we did co-transformation for the red light and green light system separately. the bacteria after co-transformation were irradiated by red or green light in our device, and we use sfGFP as reporter gene. By monitoring relative intensity of fluorescence, we could prove the system’s feasibility. Following is the result observed by multiple plate reader.
（The device we used for testing--designed by TEAM_XJTLU）
    We measured the fluorescent intensity of sfGFP to show that whether the TCSs can be activated or inhibited after being irradiated by the light around specific wave length long. After being irradiated 8 hours, although We can easily to find that both green and red TCSs have a great leak compared to control, but we can still observed that the activated group expressed about 20% sfGFP more than the dark one. But in red-TCS(haven’t combined with NOT gate) which is activated by darkness, there’s only about 15% enhancing compared with the group inhibited by red light.     In addition, to realize the second generation of cipher machine, we need to ensure that the light control system could be coupled with the oscillation system. That is to say, the response time of the light control system must be shorter than half period of the oscillation. Thus, we measured the system’s response time. Following is the results:

Population Quality Control (PopQC) system, is a new approach designed for biosynthesis yield enhancement, based on non-genetic cell-to-cell variation, which includes unequal cell division, different gene copy numbers, epigenetic modifications, random gene expression, volatile RNA stability, protein activity, etc.
Because of those differences, different cells in a single colony will have considerable variations in protein and metabolite concentrations. Therefore, in cell cultures there will be both high- and low-producers, and the intrinsic low-producers might cause suboptimal ensemble biosynthesis. The elimination of low-producers can realize the efficient utilization of substrates and high yield of target products. Thus, it has been proved to be an efficient way for biosynthesis being more suitable for large-scale industrial production. In our project, PopQC was designed as a plasmid-based gene circuit in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3, which continuously selects high-performing cells in order to further improve the yield of target metabolite— glutamate, and then the secondary metabolites— γ-PGA.

Team Darmstadt exchanged knowledge with us regarding the usage of the fluorescent marker mKate that we used in our cloning strategy. In addition, they helped us by distributing our survey.
Gatherings
RWTH Aachen
After the meetup in Munich we also went to the Aachen meetup. It was really nice to meet the other teams and to see how their projects have progressed since the last meetup. Also we were very grateful for the opportunity to present our project and getting feedback.
LMU Munich
To get in touch with other iGEM teams we took part in two meet ups. The first one was organized from the team of the LMU Munich. We did this and that, and socialized much those days. We exchanged among the different teams and we came to the conclusion to set up a collaboration with the iGEM team Aachen.
A Proposal Of The German iGEM Teams Concerning Intellectual Property
During the meetup of the German iGEM teams from 23rd to 25th May also workshops took place in which amongst others we discussed the topic of bioethics. Moral questions were addressed, regarding the value of life and human influence on it, as well as questions dealing with the possible socioeconomic effects of synthetic biology.
Especially the topic of an open source vs. patent controlled field accounted for a large part of the discussion. During the discussion one student brought up the point that the legal status of parts in registry remains unclear and that there are parts (e.g. BBa_K180009 ) where only upon a closer look it becomes clear that the rights are company–owned. The issue that the legal status of parts in the registry remains uncertain is also mentioned in a recent article published by Nature ( Bryn Nelson ‘Synthetic Biology: Cultural Divide ’, Nature 509, 152–154, 08 May 2014 ) :
""[N]o one can say with any certainty how many of these parts are themselves entirely free of patent claims.""
We, the German iGEM teams, therefore like to suggest the addition of a new feature to the parts registry:
A dedicated data field of license information for each BioBrick part.
For the implementation, we propose to introduce two new fields to BioBrick part entries in the registry:
A string property ""LicenseInfo""
A traffic light property (grey, green, yellow, red) to indicate the level of legal protection (unknown, BPA-like, free for research purposes, heavily protected)
Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify and extend the parts info, provide a"
TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#stakeholders_-_-_TEXT.html,"investment campaign in the Netherlands: as of January 2013, investments in companies making cluster munitions are prohibited. “In the CCM, assistance to companies making cluster munitions is prohibited. In our view, investment is also assistance, but this is not explicitly stated in the CCM. We try to create a norm that investment in such companies is not-done, which might result in countries banning cluster munitions investments.”
Since the PAX campaign against cluster munitions is a very good example of how such organizations work, we discussed it in further detail. “It all started in 2007 with a controversial Zembla documentary ‘Het Clusterbom Gevoel’ (the cluster bomb feeling) on which we collaborated. This  caused widespread civil unrest. Since then, we have provided MPs with input for anti-cluster munitions motions and did lobbying efforts at various ministries. We also publish a yearly report, Worldwide Investments in Cluster Munitions: A Shared Responsibility, in which we present a survey of financial institutions which invest in companies who make cluster munitions, or, on the other side, financials who have very good practices concerning cluster munitions; you could call it a naming-and-shaming approach.” In the end, the campaign resulted in the Netherlands becoming one of the first countries to prohibit investments in companies making cluster munitions.
The Stop Explosive Investments campaign is not only important as a means to create a cluster munitions-free world: “We try to establish a precedent in international humanitarian law that investments are seen as assistance, so that when for example a treaty against nuclear weapons comes along, signees are forced to ban investments in nuclear weapons.”
We were wondering why the ICBL and the CMC, involved in what appear to be the quite distinct subject of respectively landmines and cluster munitions, joined forces. Ms. Oosterwijk explains: “You should realize that the Mine Ban Treaty (MBT) is very unique. It’s a great case of civil diplomacy, since it was instigated not by the UN but by a group of benevolent countries in cooperation with civil society, international organizations, military experts, etc. . The goal is to end humanitarian suffering. The CCM is based on the LMT. The humanitarian imperative is the same and the texts are largely identical. Both treaties include provisions to end use and production of the weapons and also for the destruction of stockpiles of those weapons. Besides that, both landmines and cluster munitions are weapons adhering to the no distinction principle, which means that they are not aimed at a specific target, but kill people, soldiers and"
HKU-Hong_Kong,2010,Team:HKU-Hong Kong#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," have concluded that it would be far too difficult to implement such a system into an E. Coli within the time period available to us.
The changes
After identification of the difficulties, we decided to change our plan and instead of focusing on oil, we will use lactose to imitate ‘oil’. This lactose analogue can also be substituted with different subtracts with appropriate modification on the biobricks in initiating the mechanism. Lactose is used as the analogue owing to various reasons:
Lactose operon is widely studied
No reporter needed
Lac-Z assay
Optimal difficulty and achievable for 2 months’ time
So, now our plan has changed from making an oil digesting bacterium to a lactose digesting bacterium. After the digestion is done, the bacteria will be programmed to kill themselves.
The plasmid design
PlacBAD
It is the promoter of the lac operon inducible by lactose or arabinose. Without the substrate, the promoter is suppressed by the repressor protein. Under this condition, the gene is considered as turned off. No expression of genes that are upstream the suppressed promoter can be observed. No proteins that are encoded by these genes are produced.
cI
It is the coding sequence of cI protein. The cI protein acts as a repressor protein and bind to the promoter of the suicide gene. The suicide mechanism is then turned off without expression of gene E and production of E protein.
Lac I
Encode for the inhibitor of the lac operon
Lac Z
Encode for Beta-galactosidase which breakdowns lactose to glucose & galactose and convert lactose to L-lactose which can activate the lac operon
Lac A
Encode for lactose acetylase which transport lactose from medium to E.Coli
Lac Y
Encode for lactose permease which regulates concentration lactose inside the cell
pL
a promoter that can be inhibited by cI
Reasons for choosing the lac operon (since Lactose is now an analog for “crude oil molecules”)
Found naturally in E.coli
Well-studied
Easy to understand how the mechanisms of the operon work
Present in the chromosomes of E.coli, so that recombination of a new promoter can be easily performed
Scenarios
In the presence of lactose, the lac operon and cI which were originally suppressed by a repressor are now turned on. Transcription, translation and post-modifications are carried out in order to express the gene. cI"

The day ended with a Q&A where we addressed any questions or doubts the students may have had about college.  We also advised the students on how to apply for scholarships, and how to fill out college applications, and how to replicate these experiments in high school. Holly and Cara, also went a step further to elaborate the diverse applications of our iGEM lab by explaining how the lab has not only a scientific component where we perform critical research but also an artistic element where students design research posters of our articulated data and present them at STEM conference. Hence providing them with an overall view of the life of an undergraduate student in STEM, and the life of an iGEMer.

Interactions in Biological Systems: What are they up to?
We hosted a lecture by microbiologist Dr. Hammer. Dr. Hammer studies cell signaling in the bacterial pathogen Vibrio cholerae, and during his talk, Dr. Hammer discussed how he uses genetic engineering for his research. His lab studies microbial interactions at scales that span genes and genomes, regulatory networks, cells, populations, and communities. Harmful and beneficial bacteria are genetically encoded with regulatory networks to integrate external information that tailors gene expression to particular niches. Bacteria use chemical signals to orchestrate behaviors that facilitate both cooperation and conflict with members of the communities they inhabit. His work focuses on the waterborne pathogen Vibrio cholera, which causes the fatal diarrheal disease cholera in humans and also resides in aquatic settings in association with other animals and surfaces like crab shells and zooplankton molts composed of chitin.

According to Moore’s Law, that states that the number of    transistors in a dense integrated circuit and its computational power    doubles approximately every two years, the cost per Megabase at 2015    was expected to be around $50; however, the computational equipment    associated with the DNA sequencing has growing exponentially decreasing    even further the price, besides the new techniques that allows a faster    and more precise analysis.
With all this information, our hypothetical scenario seems to be    possible in just a couple of years, in which novel upcoming techniques    are available on the market.
However, CryptoGErM is not only a system for the storing    of information, our system goes beyond that; rather than just storing    encrypted information, our system can be used for physical sending.
And if the system is in the wrong hands?
What would happen if the system would end up in the hands of a criminal? Which impact would it have?
To give an answer to this question, we propose a computational    simulation to model the behaviors of some of the agents that could use    the CryptoGErM system, within these agents, a potential criminal was    included. Please consult the AI Agent Model in The Modelling Section for further information and discussion

Officially I am a Bachelor of Biochemical Engineering and a Master of Molecular Bioengineering, but recently I joined a Developmental Biology Lab at the MPI-CBG.  I’m studying the segmentation clock, which regulates zebrafish somite formation, and eventually would like to rebuild that clock outside the zebrafish.  With the idea of this project came my first exposure to synthetic biology, the concept of engineering biological machines and ultimately iGem.  Unfortunately, I’m too old to be a team ‘member’ but being an ‘advisor’ is also a rewarding experience…really!  In my spare time my favorite thing to do is play, relax with friends and experience new things.
Marko Storch
I am doing my PhD at MPI-CBG in Dresden in Joe Howard's Biophysics group. My main interest lies in engineering principles and emergent properties in the molecular world. To learn about these fascinating phenomena, I am engineering motor proteins and study properties of cytoskeletal systems in vitro using a bottom-up approach. I got interested in IGEM during my master studies in Molecular Bioengineering here in Dresden, but unfortunately it was too late to get a team started. So I am very happy, that students from the Dresden Master Courses can now participate in the IGEM competition each year and I took the chance to contribute as an advisor this time. Working together with the students is very enjoyable! The attitude in this team is great and discussing with fresh minds about all the things from concepts to wet lab tricks is fun and a rewarding experience.

As a new team into the iGEM competition we wanted some coaching from another team so we contacted iGEM team Leiden     early in the competition. Team Leiden has participated the competition in 2014 with TU-Delft and in 2016. So Leiden     is also a team with less experience than other Dutch teams.
During the competition we met each other three times, two of them where actual mentoring sessions. Our first     meeting was at a bar in Leiden on April 25th 2018. We met each other for the first time and talked a lot about the     iGEM competition. They had already chosen a project and gave us some tips about how to choose a project. It was a     very nice evening and we learned a lot about iGEM and each other.
The first real mentor session was in Leiden on August 15th 2018. We started the meeting with a small presentation     of both teams about the laboratory progress, human practices, PR, wiki, budget and fundraising. After the     presentations the teams were divided in management groups, here we discussed the progress and problems in more     detail. We told them about how we divided the tasks between the team, how we reached out to companies and media and     about some laboratory work. They gave us a lot of tips and tricks about crowdfunding campaigns, social media and     labwork. The team leaders remained in close contact during the contest so they could help each other with problems     as quickly and efficiently as possible. The succes of the mentoring session led to a second one on September 27th     2018.
It was an honour to be mentored by team Leiden. We know that they will succeed because of their amazing individuals     at the Giant Jamboree in Boston!

Click Chemistry
Nobel Laureate Barry Sharpless coined the term “click chemistry” in 1998 to describe a class of chemical reactions that revolutionized the field of organic chemistry by placing heavy emphasis on reactions that are “modular, wide in scope, give very high yields, generate only inoffensive by-products that can be removed by nonchromatographic methods, and be stereospecific (but not necessarily enantioselective)” (Sharpless, Finn, Kolb, 2001). Many click reactions are also insensitive to oxygen and water and require only readily available reagents and solvents. This new approach to organic synthesis presents opportunities for the advancement of materials science, drug design, bioconjugation.
Figure 1. Copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction. The colored components indicate the corresponding atoms and bonds through the transformation from reactants to products. A terminal alkyne in the presence of Cu will react with an azide to form a stable triazole product.
The copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction (Figure 1) is the ideal example of a click reaction, having all of the desirable characteristics of click chemistry. The CuAAC reaction is modular because the azide and alkyne groups easily attach to a wide variety of organic R groups, the “modules”, that need to be joined. This reaction has the power to simplify the synthesis of a diverse array of complex compounds. Furthermore, the azide and alkyne are unobtrusive and do not affect the function of their R1 and R2 groups. This reaction also exhibits the rare combination of producing a thermodynamic product but at an extremely slow reaction rate that can be dramatically accelerated with a catalyst. The azide and alkyne carry a lot a of potential energy and will reliably proceed towards the extremely stable heteroatom triazole ring, but this requires heat, time, and high concentration. When copper ions are present, however, the reaction is nearly immediate (Sharpless, Finn, Kolb, 2001). The CuAAC reaction is also bioorthogonal, meaning that the reaction does not interfere with any normally occurring biological reactions.  For these reasons, the CuAAC reaction has a high potential"

TU_Darmstadt,2017,Team:TU Darmstadt#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," NodC. The NodC protein has strongly hydrophobic domains which indicate that it is an integral or transmembrane protein. The plot shows three transmembrane sequences. The plot was made with the TMHMM website. [8]
The NodC protein has strongly hydrophobic domains which indicate that it is an integral or transmembrane protein (Figure 3). Interestingly it is only found in the inner but not outer membrane of Rhizobium leguminosarum [10] . In contrast to most eukaryotic chitin synthases, NodC does not have a translocation domain for chitin. Therefore, the chitin synthesis is accomplished in the cytoplasm. NodC belongs to the class of glycosyltransferases which catalyze the transfer of sugar components from an activated donor molecule to a specific acceptor molecule [11] .
Mechanism
NodC is involved in the synthesis of chitin oligosaccharides, but only with a polymerization degree up to five. In earlier studies it was shown that investigating this CHS in E. coli is possible and leads to good results [12] .
NodC uses UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) as a sugar donor, which is a precursor for the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan and therefore present in growing bacterial cells.
Another advantage is the unique property of the NodC which allows it to produce chitin pentamers in living E. coli without exogenous acceptors [3] . If an acceptor molecule and the substrate are added to the purified enzyme, the reaction can also be done in vitro.
The mechanism of elongation proceeds by a successive nucleophilic substitution reaction at C1 of the UDP-GlcNAc – molecule (Figure 4). UDP departs when the O4 atom of the growing sugar chain attacks as a nucleophile [11] .
With a low concentration of UDP-GlcNAc NodC produces a mixture of trimers, tetramers and pentamers and with high concentrations of UDP-GlcNAc it produces pentamers solely. It almost exclusively directs the formation of pentasaccharides [3] .

After incubation for 24 h at 37°C, bacterial growth was only visible on the plates lacking glyphosate. When the plates were further incubated for 48 h, several glyphosate-resistant mutants appeared on the plates supplemented with 10 mM glyphosate (Figure 3A). No mutants appeared on the plates with glyphosate concentrations higher than 10 mM. Next, we repeated the plating experiment with a mutant (designated as iGEM1) that was isolated from the 10 mM glyphosate plate. After 48 h of incubation, the glyphosate-resistant strain iGEM1 formed mutants on plates containing 30 mM and 40 mM glyphosate (Fig. 2A). Again we isolated mutants from the 30 mM and the 40 mM glyphosate plates that were designated as iGEM 7 and iGEM13, respectively (Figure 3B). Our attempts to further increase the glyphosate resistance of the strains iGEM7 and iGEM13 failed. To ensure that the acquired mutations in the strains iGEM1, iGEM7 and iGEM13 are stable, the mutants were passaged three times on SP rich medium plates. The glyphosate resistance of the mutants was confirmed by streaking the bacteria on CS-Glc medium supplemented with increasing amounts of glyphosate. As in Figure 3C, all strains that were adapted to glyphosate grew on plates with 10 mM glyphosate. The strains iGEM7 and iGEM13 also formed single colonies on 20 mM glyphosate plates. Moreover, albeit weak, the strain iGEM13 showed even growth with 40 mM glyphosate.

UCSD_Software,2014,Team:UCSD Software#Teaml_-_-_TEXT.html," heard the  scope of the project, my interest immediately grew and I was excited to be a part of UCSD's first  ever iGEM team.
At first, familiarizing myself with iGEM proved to be a greater challenge than I had  expected. I had no previous exposure to the field of synthetic biology, and because I had joined at  a later date than most of the team, I started the summer already behind everyone else's knowledge  and frequently felt lost during meetings. In addition, difficulties in finding housing in San Diego  over the summer meant that I was making an hour­long commute to meetings twice a week and  working remotely for the rest. Despite this, iGEM has been a great experience. Through this  project, I learned the Python programming language, refined gaps in my programming knowledge  base, and learned a great deal about synthetic biology theory. In particular, I focused on network  analysis and network motifs. For my part of the project, I read through literature detailing various  network motif finding algorithms and implemented one of them on our network in order to conduct  analysis and demonstrate an increase in functional genetic circuits in our network.
I definitely feel that I chose the right way to spend my summer by joining the iGEM  team. Not only have I learned a great deal about synthetic biology, a field which I previously  knew nothing about, but I have learned how to work in a large group environment, how to  collaborate on a brand new project, and how to meet tight deadlines. IGEM has provided me with  a valuable skill set which I plan to use in a hopefully long and successful career in the  bioinformatics industry.

How: Delete the sequence at the N-terminal end directly after the first transmembrane part (when read from N=left to C=right).
Delete the C terminus directly after the last transmembrane part, this is the subunit binding region.
What: Check what you did so far
Why: You want to know if you removed the right regions. Do I have receptor with only six transmembrane regions?
How: Check with http://elm.eu.org/, enter the protein sequence code and find protein motifs.
What: Go from protein sequence to DNA sequence
Why: For further adaptations it is easier to work with the DNA sequence
How: Enter the original full length DNA sequence in http://web.expasy.org/translate/ with the output format “Include nucleotide sequence’. Now you can easily find which nucleotides should be removed.
What: Add the RI7 N-terminal DNA code upstream of your DNA sequence and the RI7 C-terminal downstream
Why: The sequence that code for the N-terminal loop should be replaced by the RI7 sequence for better membrane localization. The C-terminal region should be replaced for a higher affinity with the alpha subunit.
How: Go to Biobrick BBa_K775000 in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, copy the RI7 N-terminal parts and paste this upstream of YFR sequence. Copy also the RI7 N-terminal parts and paste this downstream of YFR sequence.
What: Codon optimize the sequence for Saccharomyce cerevisiae
Why: For better expression of the protein in yeast
How: Go to http://www.jcat.de/  and enter the sequence. Also specify the restriction sites that you don’t want to have in the sequence: at least the standard illegal restriction sites: EcoRI, XbaI, PsteI, SpeI.
What: add BamHI and NdeI restriction sites and other features
Why: If you have this two restriction sites you can easily clone your receptor in BBa_K775000 to have a yeast promoter and terminator.
How:  If you send it for synthesizing just add the nucleotides in your file. If you work with cDNA you can add the restriction sites with PCR.
Tip: if you send your sequence for synthesizing you can also add a Kozak sequence for better translation of the protein and A FLAGtag to analyze the localization of the protein into the membrane.
What: Final check
Why: check, check, double check!
How: Align your final protein sequence to the original sequence of your receptor and the"

Safety Q&A | Human Practice
Background
The ideas of electronic circuit based design have long been a part of the fundamental research since the very beginning of synthetic biology. However, as the scale of designs becomes larger and larger, researchers start to find it difficult to adapt those ideas of circuits to the biological system, in which two main properties bottleneck the realization of these ideas.
First, biological reactions are considerably much slower, when compared with circuits, thus less possible to analogize the electronic components.
Second, synthetic biology fails to get the concept ‘wire’ introduced, due to the liquid environment of biological reaction, which decrease both the quality and the quantity of signals.
In this passage, we, with the consideration of the basic analysis method in information science, try to propose some new perspectives on the combination of synthetic biology and electronics.
Bottom-up Method
In modern electronics, people rarely focus on the detail of a particular component when designing systems, for these single components have already been well-characterized and standardized. All that requires is innovating rather than just repeating. When it comes to biology, we are surprised to find that some basic parts, such as AND gate, register and toggle switch, have been applied to genetic machines. While, there is still a far way to go.
Reaction  rate
Usually, the reactions of protein expressing cost a period on the scale of hours, which is disappointing when thinking in an electronic way. Fortunately, the rate of protein-protein interaction (PPI) is relatively fast, which makes us feel optimistic. The potential of these ‘high-speed’ reactions is to be explored.
On the other side, a low rate does make a difference in some aspects, especially in those need delay. Capacitors is widely used in sequential circuits like oscillator and trigger in order to realize delay, correspondingly, the low rate in biological reaction shows its preeminence in forming delay, thus easy to establish a inertia system.
Independent  signals
To overcome the interference of signals in liquid and simulate the function of wires in circuits, we put forward some solutions. Different populations of bacteria communicate under a variety of signal molecules, each independent with others. Whereas, it’s not as easy when the amount of signals increases, for that molecules should maintain orthogonality.
In our further research, we try to"

Purdue,2015,Team:Purdue#Organisms_-_-_TEXT.html," called protists. By experimentally comparing the effects of diets containing varying degrees of lignin complexity and by looking at gene expression in the termite Reticulitermes flavipes, researchers identified two enzyme families responsible for aiding digestion of lignin rich diets: aldo-keto reductases and catalases [1]. These enzyme families are not involved in cellulose or hemicellulose digestion, yet their presence significantly enhances the amount of sugar recovered from plant matter.
Our team met with one of the researchers from this study, Dr. Michael Scharf, and he explained how these enzymes were located inside the lumen of the termite and served more as a pretreatment for the wood as it travels through the termite’s digestive system. Experiments that Dr. Scharf has done with the termite enzymes have shown that aldo-keto reductase can boost monosaccharide output by four times the original amount when using pre milled corn stalk for termite food.

White Rot Fungus: Biomimicry from Fungi
White rot fungi are a specific variety of fungus which are capable of decomposing various woody debris and living or dead trees by having the ability to break down lignin and cellulose found within trees, dead trees, and wooden debris. Although most species are known to digest the entirety of the wood they grow on, certain species of white rot are known to break down just the lignin, leaving characteristic white, string type patches that are almost mainly made up of cells containing high amounts of cellulose [1]. To achieve this effect, the fungus releases various lignin degrading enzymes (a variety of peroxidases) that oxidize aromatic rings within the lignin and break the structure of lignin into smaller subunits. At this point, cellulases and xylanases pass through the degraded lignin layer of the wood and extract the polysaccharides: the remaining cellulose and hemicellulose.The cell wall structure is shown in the second figure. These polysaccharides are then used by the fungus for nutrients, growth, and"

Since having all the information hosted localy, we present here an overview of our collaborations with other iGEM teams, all of them were very useful and enriched our iGEM experience. We appreciate their valuable help.
Edinburgh
The Illuminati connection proved to be an effective bridge. Parts, ideas, references and experiences were exchanged. We started the communication in July and since then we were sharing our projects progress by E-mail. In order to improve the success of our projects we interchanged different parts, as is described below.
Shipments:Sharing Parts
From Edinburgh to Mexico

For InterLab, we inoculated 2 positive control BBa_I20270 cultures and 2 negative control BBa_R0040 cultures for the CFU study in LB and chloramphenicol and put them in the shaker to incubate overnight. We also made enough LB+Chlor plates for the CFU study.
Members: Kaylee and Liz
7/24/18
For InterLab, we continued work on the procedure and used our overnight cultures from the positive and negative control samples. We diluted them 1:8 in LB+Chloramphenicol and measured their OD600 in the plate reader, along with 2 control LB+Chloramphenicol samples. We followed the protocol to dilute the rest of the samples in triplicate so they would have an OD600 of 0.1 in the plate reader. We then diluted those 12 samples according to the protocol and plated 100μL of the appropriate dilutions on LB+Chlor plates to incubate overnight so we can count colonies tomorrow.

This year, iGEM NYMU focused on energy transformation. In order to measure which pigment may make microalgae gain a higher oil production efficiency and make soil energy more useful, they transferred genes of different pigments into microalgae and compared solar transformation efficiency in different pigments. Our Instructor provided a self-designed photobioreactor and updated its technical skill, offering a chance to have a deeper look in our project and experiment design.
[ Figure. 6.2-1 ] Technique transfer from our lab to iGEM NYMU. We offered a self-designed photo bio-reactor to iGEM NYMU, helping them to do the experiment.
．Collaborate Memo :
After the 5th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference, NYMU team had a chance to contact the primary instructor of NTHU team, Dr. Ya-Tang Yang, and his laboratory students. Dr. Yang is the associate professor of Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Tsing Hua University. They provided us with a set of Photo-Bioreactor made by themselves and taught us how to use the Photo-Bioreactor. During August to September, we discussed with Dr.Yang and his lab students, trying to fix some difficulties we encountered.
After the Photo-Bioreactor finally worked smoothly, we started to measure the OD value of microalgae we cultivated, collected huge amounts of data, and drew growth curves for our projects. Meanwhile, we shared collated data to Dr. Yang’s lab for research use. We believe this collaboration would be a great academic exchange and produce some interesting results. The pictures below show Dr. Ya-Tang Yang, NYMU team member with Dr. Yang’s lab, and the growth curve of Chlorella vulgaris as well as Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942.

OBJECTIVES
Introduce genetic engineering and its difference with biotechnology
Describe how genetic engineering is related to our society
Explain iGEM and our project, Tristable Switch
Demonstrate basic wet-lab techniques such as standard assembly and PCR
Conduct basic experiments such as restriction digestion and ligation, and more advanced experiments such as colony PCR
FEEDBACK
The flow of the two-day lab experience was smooth and it was pleasing to see that the students were willing to learn. However, time did not seem to be sufficient to give a proper pre-experiment explanations for the students before each experiment, thus materials regarding wet-lab were explained post-experiment.
Fortunately, the students were capable of following the processes of the experiments and could appreciate the principles behind iGEM’s synthetic biology. The teacher hoped that there would be more workshops to be organised, giving more opportunities for secondary school students to gain exposure in synthetic biology."

Our Project
Numerous iGEM teams have designed biological devices that do not sufficiently emphasize their circuit safety measures        or do not include adequate standardized safety switches. In order to address the safety and ethics associated with using        synthetic biology, we wish to design a standardized safety measure in synthetic circuits,        without compromising the function of the construct that was originally designed. Such a system        has potential uses in both single and multicellular organisms, and for different applications - including but not limited        to bioremediation, therapeutics and biosensors.

Next
Our Design
In our design, we employ luxR gene that forms a transcriptionally active complex with 3OC6HSL to activate a downstream     construct. Once activated, the desired functions of the circuit will initiate a ""time bomb"" that terminates this     synthetic process.

Next
Time Bomb
After a period of time (which varies depending on the application), termination of function will be accomplished by knocking     out the genes of interest using Cre-lox and/or Dre-rox. As a result, the entire local population of genetically modified     organisms can be reverted back to its wild-type phenotype, with or without getting exterminated to prevent sudden and     drastic changes in the ecosystem.

Edinburgh_OG,2016,Team:Edinburgh OG#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," this year was different from the list presented by the Yale iGEM team from the two previous years.
LIMITATIONS AND FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS
It is important, however, to establish the limitations of our program so that they can be addressed  properly in the future. One limitation of the CARE tool is that it requires  any microorganism to have an annotated genome for it to be screened, as the accession number is needed to build the database from antiSMASH.
Moreover, when performing the data mining for each secondary metabolite, we found that a significant number of the assessed secondary metabolites did not have clear data on their toxic effect on the surrounding environment, humans and animals (i.e. classified as “?” – unknown – to be managed according to the precautionary principle). These kind of results could spur  further investigation into these compounds and corresponding biological functions and effects by the scientific community. Further, the utility of the tool is limited by the great number of as yet unknown secondary metabolites. In filamentous fungi alone the  number of unknown mycotoxins is expected to be in the range of several hundred thousand (Barlow et al., 2007).
Furthermore, the program could be further refined by completing the missing front-ends and including a risk matrix for every secondary metabolite in which the risks are directly related to the probability of them happening. Furthermore, since the extent of the assessments on non-model organisms is not limited to their secondary metabolites, tools to screen for recombinases, virulent factors and CRISPR-Cas9 systems could be developed for them to be incorporated in the CARE program.

UIUC-Illinois,2010,Team:UIUC-Illinois-Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," - The third and final part of BioMORTAR is cell modeling using the BIGG database in conjunction with COBRA tools in MATLAB to simulate cell growth and chemical flux from the added pathway within the cell.
IMPtools (AKA IMPtools 2.0)
The first release of IMPtools is the result of the efforts of the 2009 University of Illinois iGEM software team. The web-based program works by finding the quickest pathway between two organic compounds over a reaction network constructed from the KEGG database. It also would allow the user to customize the algorithm by using a weighting system to specify the importance of certain features of reactions, such as ATP consumption, metabolite connectivity, and amount of extra product at the end. The software won best software as well as a gold medal in the 2009 iGEM competition at MIT, however it still had a few problems to work out before it could be feasibly used.
IMPtools has had some big improvements made to it since last year's iGEM competition. First, some major bugs in the program were fixed, and the inputs were simplified to recognize the name of the compound rather than merely the KEGG ID. There are two major improvements to IMPtools. The first and most fundamental, is the reduction of the rather bloated network by the application of the RPAIR database available from the KEGG project. The RPAIR database pairs compounds that chemically interact for each reaction, making the network a much smarter network to work with. The new IMPtools relies on the direct nature of the links for greater accuracy in generating a realistic metabolic pathway. Another large improvement is the addition of a branching system. One major drawback of IMPtools was that the algorithm would simply ignore large intermediate inputs and outputs in the pathway. The branching system solves this by keeping track of these large side products and attempting to convert them into readily available reactants or common metabolic products that could be provided or absorbed by the cell's existing metabolism.
User inputs the desired starting and ending compounds
Weighting system allows for a more customized metabolic pathway
IMPtools selects the best metabolic pathway from the generated reaction network
An option allows IMPtools to optimize output while minimizing intermediate inputs or products through pathway branching
Plasmid Designer
Building on top of IMPTools, BioMORTAR plasmid designer determines the requisite enzymes and retrieves the appropriate gene sequences from the KEGG database. BioMORTAR will then assemble a plasmid or an array of plasmids in silico for the necessary metabolism according to the expression characteristics designated by the user. The target organism is accounted"

    In 2014, iGEM team Warwick asked” Do you believe Synthetic Biology is a dangerous tool, knowing that potentially dangerous organisms are being dealt with?” in their survey. 30% of respondents say yes, 45% give negative answer.
    In investigating their survey design and outcome, we thought the iGEM community are getting a clearer image of how the general public percept gene-tech related information. We, as well as another iGEM team HSiTAIWAN, however, wondered more about how and why these perception is formed? When genetic-engineering related information, or more generally speaking, gene-technology related information is transferred, in what attitude is the story being reported? Does the report contain too much terminology that distant the audience with scientific outcome? Does the information sufficient enough to transfer correct and complete story to public? What about iGEM wiki? Are the stories in iGEM wikis being told in a hard way that can be challenging for science-laymen to realize?         This year, we NYMU iGEM, as long as HSiTAIWAN collaboratively investigate into these questions.

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria"

CheW and CheA generate receptor signals; CheY and CheZ modulate rotation of the flagellar motor and thus change cell behavior and movement; CheR and CheB regulate MCP methylation state to make feedback to CheW and CheA.

E.coli receptors employ a common set of cytoplasmic signaling proteins: CheW and CheA interact with receptor molecules to form stable ternary complexes that generate stimulus signals; CheY transmits those signals to the flagellar motors, CheZ controls their lifetime; CheR (methyltransferase) and CheB (methylesterase) regulate MCP methylation state.

But the original chemoreceptors of E.coli do not respond to the root exudates, while the McpS of the Pseudomonas putida , McfQ and McfR do (Parales, et al.) . McfQ responds to citrate and fumarate, and McfR detects succinate, malate and fumarate. To compare with the work what 2011_Imperial_College_London had done, we chose McfR which also responds to malate. The mechanisms of prokaryote chemoreceptors are similar, so we designed a plasmid to express chemoreceptor. McfR in the E.coli makes the bacteria have the ability of chemotaxis towards TCA intermediates. As our experimental condition is limited, we just did experiments on chemotaxis towards succinate and malate. What’s more, in an attractant gradient, the chemoreceptors monitor chemoeffector concentration changes as they move around. And they use that information to modulate the probability of the next tumbling event. And we searched the pattern of their chemotaxis towards a concentration gradient of attractant using capillary assay. The results are demonstrated below.

We did a few different procedures today. We started out by doing a PCR purification for BI7701, BI7707, and BI23.... It was successful, but our concentration was very low (11.9). We also set up another PCR for BI7701, BI7707, and BI23... It will be done tomorrow. Today we also did a digest of our plasmid and our cro insert.
Having confirmed that our CRO insert was indeed PCR amplified (see picture above; very faint lines about 500 base pairs; wells 1-3 represent three strains of lambda, while 4 is a negative control), we performed a PCR cleanup on ALL 3 of our samples, in an attempt to isolate concentration of CRO insert possible. On the spectrophotometer our A260 reading gave us a concentration of 11.9 ng/microL.   Following that we ran a digest of our CRO insert and pLAT plasmid with pBAD promoter using restriction enzymes PST1-HF and ECOR1-HF. Our pLAT sample was a mixture of pIG12 and pIG13, which according to the parts database are the same plasmid, taken from two different colonies.  Having set our vector and inserts to digest, we started a low-melt gel with Jordan’s help. Low melt gels follow a slightly different protocol than normal gels, and use a smaller dock. Our dock was broken so our gel didn’t set very well. Because we don’t have time today, tomorrow we’ll run our vector and insert on the low-melt gel to see what happens. KK, KP

The SYFP2 plasmids most often accumulated IS (insertion sequence) element inserts, which completely prevented the expression of the fluorescent protein. The most common IS elements observed were IS10R and IS10L. Furthermore, S10L/R expressed preference for a particular nucleotide location (GGCGTAGTACC) within the SYFP2 gene. Two point mutations were also independently observed in two samples of SYFP2.  One mutation converted resulted in the loss of a start codon.
Plasmids that contain the YFP gene also tended to display instability. Samples with the YFP gene often broke after approximately five days, and a myriad of mutations appeared to have contributed to this instability. IS elements were another common feature among the YFP group. Point mutations in various locations also appeared in the YFP group, such as in the promoter and ribosome binding site. Two samples also featured a large deletion from the plasmid.
The BFP group of plasmids also had high instability, similar to the SYFP2 group of plasmids. This group of plasmids lasted around only a few days before their devices broke. IS elements were very common in the BFP plasmid group along with promoter deletions.
Interestingly, the EYFP and ECFP plasmid groups were incredibly stable, remaining fluorescent for over ten days. Only one sample in the entire EYFP group displayed a mutation, which was a promoter deletion. Only two mutations were shown in the entire ECFP group, a large deletion and an In-del mutation. Overall, these two fluorescent proteins have shown to be very stable (see Table 1 for full results of mutations).
Based on the patterns of mutations, it is clear that IS elements are a major source of instability in plasmids in this strain of E. coli, Top10. Furthermore, because of the common location of insertion for IS elements, they must have a sequence preference. By changing the sequence, it it may be possible to increase the stability of plasmids by eliminating a primary source of mutation. Furthermore, by elucidating the contribution that IS elements make towards the instability, we can anticipate these events and account for such instabilities when designing plasmids for future experiments.
One of our team members also developed a Computational Approach to categorizing the mutations.  We believe this will be of great help to us as we begin to analyze our larger data set(s).

When the first population is re-injected into the coalescence chip with higher channel height compared to the channel height they were initially produced in, the droplets acquire spherical shape. The second population of droplets are produced in the coalescence chip. These droplets acquire a flat circle shape in the channels.
Scheme with a channel, wherein on droplet is flat circle shape (second population) and another is spherical shape (first population)
The interfacial tension of droplets produced with nonionic type of surfactant follows the nonlinear adsorption [4]:
(5)
Microfluidic droplet coalescence is based on application of alternating electric voltage. The value of interfacial tension created by surfactant adsorption is further modified by electrical field effect on a contact angle. This influences the interfacial tension γ for both produced and re-injected droplets.
The interfacial tension of the three-phase interface follows the Young-Laplace equation:
(6)
We also know the electric field impacts the contact angle θ:
(7)
The initial contact angle θ0 (before applying the electric field) is expressed from Young- Laplace equation (6) and inserted into the relation for electrowetting :
(8)
The applied electric field does not impact the interfacial tension between solid ( PDMS ) and oil γSO or solid and water γSw. We introduce the effective interfacial tension γ(eff) which will account the effect of electrowetting \(\gamma_{WO}^{(eff)}=(\gamma_{SO} - \gamma_{SW})/\cos \theta\). This relation is inserted into equation (8) to give a result:
(9)
In the last equation we find a dimensionless factor called the electrocapillary number ECN, showing the ratio of electric to capillary forces:
(10)
In our experiments we have ECN<<1, that shows the capillary forces have the highest impact in our system. Finally the interfacial tension is expressed in a following way:
(11)
Using the arguments from the electrowetting, the term for capillary pressure in equation (1) will be changed accordingly. The capillary pressure of two droplets is written as a sum of two pressure components coming from the different interfacial tension:
(12)
3. Energy supplied by electric voltage
The electric field energy is created by applying the voltage to the electrodes. To define the electric response of droplet coalescence system, we used the concepts of electrokinetic model described by Tan et al. This"

Two buns with fresh cheese, a marmalade croissants and a warm cup of coffee later we realized that we were almost there. Only a few moments later the captain asked us to fasten our seat belts and get ready for landing. It was a bright day again and because the weather was so nice and sunny we got to get our first good look at the water, land and forest surrounding Singapore.
￼
ARRIVAL
￼
Getting of plane and through security didn't take much time and even our luggage showed up pretty fast. After all of us changed some money at a booth we decided to take the train rather than a cab to get to university town, where we were supposed to stay for the week. The trip from the airport took us about 45 minutes and we got to get the first real impression of Singapore’s architecture and its people. The first we noticed were the air conditioners – Everything was air conditioned. From busses to buildings, everything was close to 17°C, so when you actually got out you had the feeling of getting hit in the face with a 40 degree hammer. On the other hand you got pretty could when you were outside for some time and then entered a building again. The accommodation at university was quite simple. Every one of us got a plain room of about 6 to 7 square meters, with a bed, a closet and of course an air condition.
THE CONFERENCE
On our second day in Singapore, the first day of the conference, we really felt the jet-lag. Getting up at 7:00 was like waking up in the middle of the night and we would have struggled pretty hard with staying awake the whole day, if it wasn't for a scientist's best friend — coffee.  The conference was held in the university’s museum and because we got there so early, we didn’t have to queue for entrance and could look around a little. The entrance hall was used for food, booths of companies and light conversation during the breaks, whereas the first floor was reserved for the poster session in the afternoon.

Participants from all over the world could display their research results and answer regarding questions. The talks themselves were given in a big room with a great atmosphere, a little reminiscent of a theater, with very comfortable chairs and a several storage gallery.

Results in silico
We choose our synthetases based on a good total score and a good ligand score. We checked the corresponding PDB-files, and rated the ligand and the binding pocket         as satisfying, so that the ligand assumedly does not collide with residues in the near environment.        The total scores for CBT are not as good as the scores for NPA. However, the ligand scores are acceptable in both cases. A visual evaluation confirms that the ligand         fits into the binding pocket.
Our results for this step
We used this algorithm to simulate the evolution of the tyrosyl-tRNA with the amino acids Nitrophenylalanine(NPA) and Nγ‑2‑cyanobenzothiazol‑6‑yl‑L‑asparagine (CBT-asparagine).
NPA simulation:
The .cst-file contained two blocks for the nitrogroup of NPA. Since there are two oxygen-atoms in the nitrogroup,         we defined two atom nametags. As several possibilities are useful, we defined two possible constraint partners          for the hydrogen bonds. The first is asparagine (N) or glutamine (Q) and the second is glycine (G). We set the           possible distance to 2.8 Å, as it is the optimal distance for hydrogenbonds, and a tolerance level of 0.5 Å.            We set the angles to 120° with a tolerance of 40°, as recommended by Florian Richter during our discussion in cologne.            The torsion angles were set to 180° with a tolerance of 180° and a penalty of 0, such that the torsion angles can rotate            completely freely.(Richter, unpublished data)
CBT-Asparagine simulation:
CBT-Asparagine can build hydrogen bonds in two ways. The first is a weak hydrogen bond on the         sulfur atom and the other possibility is a normal hydrogen bond on the nitrogen (N2)         after the Cγ. We wrote three cst-files, one for a possible bond with sulfur, one for a         possible bond with nitrogen, and one for both bonds. As possible corresponding amino acids, we chose serine,          th"

One of them is for example a primer designer. The primers are designed by choosing the melting temperature and the binding site of the template sequence. The robot finally creates the sequence of the forward primer (Primer 1) and the reverse Primer (Primer 2). Furthermore, the Software Team supported us in the design and coding of our homepage. In return, our team helped with information about biological interests and cloning procedures and organized the t-shirts and the trip to Boston.

Collaboration with the iGEM 2010 Team Stockholm
The iGEM Team Stockholm 2010 was interested in using the Freiburg standard 25 and contacted us in order to get information about cloning vectors from our stocks concerning the three pSB1X3-derived BBa_J18901-3 plasmids, as well as the pMA (-BBRF) vector (BBa_K157000) available in the Registry. We made the advice that the Freiburg iGEM 2009 team last year used the pMA vector for almost all cloning steps. The plasmid is small and delivers high yields of plasmid DNA. In comparison to that the larger BBa_J18901-3 plasmids carry two antibiotic resistances making the part assembly more restricted.
Community outreach in collaboration with BIOSS and Europa Park
The sience days at Europa Park take place every year making sciences attractive for young people. Pupils of different ages take a look in sciences by doing practical experiments and playing games. In association with BIOSS we prepared a game for the younger kids, in which they could actively join in. The game gives the kids an imagination about a cells inner life by playing the role of kinases, phosphatases and signalling proteins. In addition, we made questionnaires and tested the knowledge of the pupils in biology.

A. Scaning Electron Microscope (SEM) Result  Analysis
For biodegrading experiments, we used 3x5 cm 2 bottle plastics with average weight 0.05 g. Then, we washed it several times with water and ethanol.
Plastic samples were applied just before we inoculated the bacteria on the medium. Bacterial culture was grown at 370C in Luria-Broth medium. After 3 days of incubation, we washed the plastics with water and ethanol then dried for measurement of the weight loss.
Meanwhile, for UC Davis bacterial culture, we inoculated the bacteria in Luria-Broth medium supplemented with 170 ppm cloramphenicol. After an absorbance A600 nm of 0.6 was reached, we added 1% of arabinose and plastic samples. After 2 days of incubation, we washed the plastics with water and ethanol then dried for measurement of the weight loss.
We used medium supplemented with antibiotics and plastics sample as control on this experiment. The scaning electron microsccopy analysis of fractured surface of PET film was carried out using  Scaning Electron Microscope. The surface of the treated PET samples were coated with conductive heavy metals such as gold/palladium.
SEM image shows that cracks were observed at the surface of a plastic samples (PET) after incubation of the bacterial culture.  However, there was no significant weight decreased of the plastics samples.  From this SEM study  we concluded that both our LC Cut UC Davis and OmpA-LC-Cut Fussion ITB 2014 able to degrade PET plastics samples.

Riboregulators have cognate pairs. For certain crRNA, there is a corresponding taRNA that can activate and “unlock” the repression by crRNA. We originally thought that    Lock 3c and Key 3c (Table 1.) were cognate pairs, but they turned out to be that the iGEM 2006_Berkeley simply made variants of Lock 3 and Key 3. They put an    alphabet at the end of the name every time they produced different variants of lock 3 and key 3. The lock 3 and key 3 variants were created independently from each other so    the letters at the end of name does not mean correspondence. Other teams should take note of this when they consider using riboregulator variants from iGEM 2006_Berkeley.
Riboregulator Results
Figure 1. Fluorescence (F)/OD600 measurements of riboregulator pairs after arabinose induction and their corresponding controls.
All samples were inoculated in M9 minimal salt medium overnight in no or various arabinose concentrations (%w/v). The samples were diluted around 10 fold the next day. Measurements were made when the samples reached around the mid-log phase (OD600 = 0.3 to 0.5).        Graphs depict the triplicate mean + standard deviation. (A) Schematic diagram of the genetic context of the experiment. Note that the diagram generalized the CR and TA sequences.

(D) Measurement for Medium lock ( BBa_K175031 ) and Key for medium lock ( BBa_K175032 ) cognate pair. (E) Measurement for Lock 3c ( BBa_J23031 ) and Key 3c ( BBa_J23008 ).
To characterize the different riboregulator pairs, we kept the genetic context identical except for the various cr-repressing sequences, trans-activating sequences and the RBS. The  RBS sequence also had to be different for some of the riboregulator systems because the cr-repressing sequence depends on the RBS sequence. In order to repress translation, the  cis-repressing sequence need to interact with the RBS, and so the"

Motivation
Why focus on atmospheric pollutants and especially VOC ?
Atmospheric pollution is characterized by the presence of gas and particles (nitrogen oxides, carbon oxides, ozone, particles PM10 and PM25, Volatile Organic Compounds, black smoke) in the outside air with harmful impact on human health and/or on the environment. [1] [2].
It is known that pollution has harmful effects on human health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 7 million premature deaths are due to atmospheric pollution, equal to one eighth of the world annual deaths. [3] The estimated cost of these premature deaths in WHO countries is $ 1.6 trillion per year. [4]
In France there are 3.5 million people with asthma, 50 000 people suffering from serious respiratory deficiencies, and 150 000 deaths of patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases. [5] All those diseases originate or at least are aggravated by atmospheric pollution.
In addition to public health issues, these pollutants can have a harmful effect on the environment as they acidify water and soil and decrease plant growth. These changes trigger a decline in agricultural yields and alter aquatic ecosystems. [5]
Atmospheric pollution is an accumulation of complex phenomena. To understand local and regional emissions, meteorological conditions, transport, and pollutant transformation must be considered.  [2]
Our team decided to focus on VOCs for several reasons. VOCs are organic"

Attraktionen in Aachen
Falls Sie früh genug anreisen (oder spät abreisen), gibt es einige Dinge in Aachen, die einen Besuch wert sind.
Aachener Dom
Der Dom ist das Wahrzeichen von Aachen. Es war die Kaiserpfalz von Karl dem Großen, und viele Könige und Kaiser wurden unter der Kuppel des Aachener Doms gekrönt. Ein Überbleibsel dieser Zeit ist der Marmorthron auf der oberen Etage des Doms. Seit 1978 ist der Dom ein UNESCO Weltkulturerbe, das Erste Deutschlands.
Für Geschichtsgeeks und andere Interessierte ist der Aachener Dom einen Besuch wert. Besonders empfehlenswert sind die Führungen!

Anabaena variabilis
Mucor circinelloides
Bacillus subtilis
These are all common widespread species without serious health effects. They are all generally regarded as safe (GRAS), Biosafety Level 1, and are found commonly in the natural environment.
What risks could arise from our experiments?
A possible risk is the release of fungal spores into the lab. However, none of the strains of fungi we worked with are known to produce spores hazardous to human health, and we have tailored the growth conditions so that the growing fungi should remain in the non spore-forming mycelial stage. Even so, we wrapped or sealed all growing mycelium into separate containers, and sequestered all of said containers into one environmental growth chamber to limit the possibility of spore release. Any fungal samples we suspected would send out contaminating spores if opened were worked on under a sterilized laminar flow hood. After adequate mycelial growth has occurred, we also baked the mycelium to dry and inactivate it and prevent further growth while keeping it out of wet or damp conditions that could restart growth.
What risk might our project pose outside of the lab?
More than likely, little to no risk. The strains we are working with are regarded as safe and are will not have any toxic or virulent modifications. No modifications will be made beyond the overexpression of adhesive proteins, which should not affect the environment, our colleagues, the community at large, or us even if they escape the lab. Also overexpressed protein production would stop or drop to near negligible levels after the cells run out of the induction molecules arabinose or IPTG, the latter of which is not very common in nature.  For housing applications, it is important that our my"

We also ran a gel purification of the restriction digests of J63001 and J63002 in preparation for the ligation.
Gel Mixture Protocol for 1% Agarose gel:
Agarose:  0.5012 g
0.5xTBE with SYBR Safe:  50 mL
Microwaved for 1 minute on high.
Ran gel in previously used TBE 0.5x buffer.  Used all 50uL of each restriction digest by splitting up this amount among 3 wells apiece with roughly 18uL per well.  Also, ran with both a 100 bp ladder and a 1 kb ladder.  This is because one hopes to extract the excised part J63001, which is 744 bp long, as well as the cloning vector contaning J63002, which should be around 2292 bp.  When the blue dye had gone halfway down the length of the gel, removed it and placed it on the transilluminator.  Visualization at this time showed that the 1 kb ladder did not appear to work, as nothing appeared up in that lane.  The 100 bp ladder lane had visible dye, but it seemed too clumped together to get a good measurement.  In the lanes with J63001, there were two bands, as one might expect. The higher band would be the smaller piece, meaning the actual part J63001, while the lower band would be the plasmid from which this part was removed.  In the lanes with J63002, there was only one visible band, since only a small portion was removed during the restriction digest (no more than 10 bp).
Unfortunately, made the bad decision of putting the gel back into electrophoresis to help separate the bands.  This only appeared to wash all of the DNA from the gel, making it basically impossible to extract any at all.  Looks like the restriction digest will have to be conducted again using some more of the miniprep DNA.
The mixtures for the restriction digest were the same as those listed for yesterday, noting, however that there was slightly less than 27uL left of each plasmid.
Incubated for , then placed on heating block at 70 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes before putting them in fridge.

Safety
Even well-equipped, state-of-the-art laboratories are not able to guarantee the success of scientific experiments; it also needs detailed operating procedures and safety instructions. Students are expected to strictly abide by the following laboratory regulations.
First one is about the provisions on clothing. We used EtBr for gel electrophoresis in our experiments. And EB, which are small molecules; easy to bind to DNA molecules; and absorbed through the skin; is biologically carcinogenic.
Therefore, in operation, each student is required to wear the lab protection suit. Items that placed in a room where the nucleic acid is preserved (including computers, etc.) And students must wear disposable plastic gloves to protect them from EB infection.
Second, there is a text reminder on the door of the laboratory room, posted with words ""Cell carcinogens inside"" and ""Non-workers prohibited from entering."" Students who enter and exit the nucleic acid electrophoresis laboratory must also need permission from the instructor.
Third, follow the specific operation sequence:
Disinfect hands and laboratory utensils with alcohol before the experiment. Some products, such as glass rods, should be re-confirmed with an open flame after disinfection. The alcohol lamps placed in specific positions.
After completing the above steps, the experiment will begin. When doing experiments on bacteria, it must be done in a clean bench.
The pipette tip and collection bottle are disposable items. After use, they are discarded in individual trash cans and not mixed with other garbage.
Fourth, laboratory safety rules are the following:
No food. Classmates must eat in the prescribed rest area.
Strictly distinguish between laboratory waste and domestic waste, which can be identified by the color of the trash can or by posting a prompt.
Do not place any sundries in the experimental area, or put personal items on the designated desk.
The experimental gun head, collection tube, PCR tube, etc. are used after high- temperature sterilization, and the pipette is disinfected with alcohol to ensure the accuracy and safety of the experiment.

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," for genomic integration. This technique uses a recombination enzyme native to bacteriophage P1, Cre recombinase, and lox sites that the recombinase targets [26] . Typical Cre-lox recombination uses two identical loxP sites which may invert or delete the genomic information between them depending on lox site directionality [27] . We found a publication by Watson et al. (2008) where they used two incompatible lox sites for recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) [26] . In their genome, two incompatible lox sites flanked a selectable marker. The same two lox sites flanked the gene of interest in the plasmid.
Figure 4: Cre-lox recombination method. Two incompatible lox sites, loxP and lox71, will flank selectable marker ura3 in our egineered strain of Y. lipolytica, and will flank the gene cassette. The regions between the lox sites will be exchanged when Cre recombinase is introduced.
Using two incompatible lox sites allows the Cre recombinase to recombine only the sequence between the lox sites; we determined that this system may work to incorporate our genes of interest. Figure 4 shows how RMCE works with two incompatible lox sites in the context of our experiment. We will use BioBrick loxP (BBa_J61046) and lox71. To confirm that Cre-lox has worked, we will engineer the selectable marker ura3 between the lox sites in the genome, and grow the transformed strain on uracil-enriched 5-FOA media to ensure only transformed colonies are viable.
Since we were uncertain of the size of the gene insert we could reasonably incorporate using RMCE, we contacted the authors of the article, Dr. Adam Watson and Dr. Tony Carr of the University of Sussex. They informed us that we could insert our genes of interest with little difficulty, as they previously used RMCE to insert up to 16 kb fragments with no decrease in efficiency.
After much consideration, we decided to use both Cre-lox recombination and HR in parallel experiments to determine which method yields the most recombinants. We will use HR to incorporate the lox sites into the Y. lipolytica genome, and HR to integrate the progesterone pathway. In a parallel experiment, we will use Cre-lox recombination and RMCE to insert the genes into the Y. lipolytica genome. We originally intended to characterize the recombination rate of the lox sites to satisfy one of the iG"

Cell Lysis
Summary
Cell lysis is a commonly used protocol in synthetic biology. It can be performed through a variety of different methods, however we had focused on chemical cellular lysis. Cell Lysis is used to extract and isolate DNA from a specific type of cell. This is an extremely important step in building genetic circuits in order to utilize specific coding regions in a cell's DNA. Chemical cell lysis involves introducing cells to a series of buffers in order to degrade the cell’s outer membrane and collect the DNA that is released.
This microfluidic chip is designed to perform chemical cell lysis. Suspended cells and an lysing buffer would be mixed inside the cell. This mixture of buffer and cells would be then mixed with a neutralization buffer to prevent DNA degradation. The mixture would then move to the diamond chamber where the DNA binds magnetic particles. Lastly, an elution buffer would be input and to clean and release the DNA from the magnetic particles.
Note that the control layer is used as a region to mill a space on the opposite side of the flow layer for an electro-magnet to be implemented.

Yale,2016,Team:Yale#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,", Rhizobium tropici (R. tropici) CIAT 899 and Sinorhizobium meliloti (S. meliloti) 1021, for applications in agriculture and nitrogen fixation.
MAGE is a useful form of genetic engineering because it generates increased genetic diversity at targeted genomic loci through the introduction of synthetic oligonucleotides, and allows for directed evolution of cell populations (Wang, et al.). MAGE has a variety of applications in genome modification, including optimization of a protein or small molecule production pathway, tuning of gene expression, modification of ribosomal binding sites, and knocking out of undesired genes. Rhizobium was chosen not only for its significance in food production and nitrogen applications, but also because it is a non-model microorganism that can improve characterization of such organisms, ultimately providing a framework for implementing MAGE in non-model organisms.
MAGE increases genetic diversity by using the Red recombineering cassette to induce mutations along the genome of an organism, including insertions, deletions, and point mutations. However, the efficiency of MAGE is decreased by the cell’s natural mismatch repair (MMR) system, which corrects any mismatches caused by MAGE. To reduce this problem in E. coli, researchers knock out the mutS gene, a key component of the MMR system. By knocking out mutS, the efficiency of MAGE increases, but this process has not been shown to be easily done in non-model microorganisms such as rhizobia.
Target Organisms: Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899 and Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021, broadly symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria
We selected two strains of rhizobia for our project based on the literature available, their ability to nodulate a variety of agriculturally relevant legumes and other potential applications.R. tropici was selected for its ability to form nitrogen-fixing symbiotic relationships with a broad range of legume hosts, including those of the Phaseolus and Leucaena genera (Martinez-Romero et al. 1991). Compared to other rhizobia species, it is more tolerable of stressful conditions such as acidic soils and high temperatures (Graham et al. 1994). It is ideal for our use because it has a reasonably fast doubling time of less than 6 hours (Morón et al. 2005) and because its genome is fully sequenced (NCBI Taxonomy ID: 698761). S. meliloti is similarly able to nodulate a wide range"
