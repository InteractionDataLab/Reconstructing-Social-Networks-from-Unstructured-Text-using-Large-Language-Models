Both are the same amino acid sequence except for the XhoI site and the histag at the end of the original.
The steps to order the construct is the following.
Go to IDT Sign in go to gblocks gene fragments name copy paste sequence in test complexity add to order say no to everything for payment:  my account, oligo card, send to david, notify igem or david
Some suggestions from Fasih were the following.
Design the primers before ordering.   a) For XhoI and NdeI sites include handle of 6-8 basepairs b) igem prefix and suffix.  With two stop codons before the suffix.  This will go into psb1c3 perform digest and ligation on benchling Use snapegene for plasmids Need BL21 (DE3) with T7 polymerase for expression in pET22b
-Design of primers Primers were designed using Benchling For expression:   These are the NdeI and XhoI sites obtained from Benchling. NdeI:  5’-CATATG-3’, 3’-GTATAC-5’ XhoI:  5’-CTCGAG-3’, 3’GAGCTC-5’ The handle used was ACTGAC
For iGEM:  The iGEM prefix and suffix were used as stated previously.
Conclusions:  It seems as though the primer lengths may be too long, and that the melting temperatures are too high.  A second opinion may be needed tomorrow.  The order for just the PCquad optimized will be made in addition to primers to make it usable in the Pet22b vector, and for iGEM.  Once the strains from Yeate’s lab are obtained, the vector will be isolated and our optimized PCquad"

Tsinghua,2010,Team:Tsinghua#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," on the Safety Page from  iGEM( https://2010.igem.org/Safety ) as following:
Q1: Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety,
public safety, or
environmental safety?
A: Our project is about how to use E Coli to simulate the production of Specific Antibodies. No serious safety problem can be caused by the harmless engineering strains of Escherichia coli and we kept our promise and rules which ensure the safety during the whole process.
Q2: Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
A: No any potential safety issues.
Q3:Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
A: Yes, it is. The safety check is operated frequently. This is organised and operated by the Laboratories and Facilities in Tsinghua University. During our project, they operated one of the safety checks in one year and they evaluated our laboratory as well as our project. Our lab construction is keeping in line with the policies in Tsinghua University and because our project is about how to use E Coli to simulate the production of Specific Antibodies and the models we use are Escherichia coli so they evaluated our project is in a safe category and meanwhile they spoke highly on our Tsinghua iGEM 2010 Safety Manual for ""It helps to keep safety in everyone's mind and do really good job."".
Q4:Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
A: The most invigorative way to inspire the teams to make up ways to deal with and improve the BioSafety is to establish a special prize in BioSafety, so that many teams could try their best to deal with the issues in BioSafety, like how to take experiments safely, how to build safe BioBricks and mostly how maintain the safe environment during our projects.
Also to recognize that importance from the bottom of one's heart is the most effective approach for dealing with some issues. So if more education, announcement, lectures, courses and many other kinds of teaching methods can be carried out to draw attention on the safety, to let people keep this in mind, the Safety Issues could no longer be an issue but a common sense.

WHU-China,2013,Team:WHU-China#hp_-_-_TEXT.html," team visited our lab. We shared ideas about synthetic biology and informations for iGEM. Later in July, They asked us whether we had any suggestion on protein expression of Bacillus subtilis, as there is no teacher employing such system in USTC. We collected information for Bacillus engineering by asking the teacher and graduate student in our university who are using the system. And then we sent these information to USTC. Hopefully these information did some helps. 2.Communication with Shenzhen_BGIC_ATCG team member
As our busy experiments moving towards the end with the passing  summer vacation, our long-term partners –iGEMers of Beijing genomics institute(BGI) in Shenzhen are also trying their best doing their research. After a short telephone conversation between our team leaders, we fond that it was time for our two teams to hold a seminar and exchange our experiences and advices we have gathered during iGEM. It was at this great time that Shuang Zhu from Shenzhen BGI came to Wuhan University for a visit and we held this seminar between Wuhan university and Shenzhen BGI with great joy. In our WHU-IGEM lab, Shuang Zhu told us about their project idea and plan in detail and we also shared ours. Then we had heated conversations about our preparation and experiment experiences during iGEM and we find that we have so many interesting  experiences and exciting feelings to share as iGEMers. Our team leader- Hangxing Jia also told Shuang some of our problems as we try to produce our own biobricks and Shuang gave us some valuable and effective advices with the practice of her team. Finally, we made a conclusion of our process during the past months and planned our future assignment with the helpful advices from Shuang Zhu. As faithful and helpful partners for each other, We are all looking forward to further cooperation between WHU-iGEMers and Shenzhen BGI-iGEMers in the near future. 3.Giving CAU team suggestions
We communicated with team CAU(China Agriculture University).Both teams introduced projects  and give some meaningful advice to each other. Since it is the first time for CAU to attend the IGEM, we offered some basic guidence to them.

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#11 August 2009_-_-_TEXT.html,".  The Bitumen and water mixture needs to be separated. It is done so easily by heating this mixture . Forming froths … Oil moves up … water down… The Bitumen is still very viscous and moving this viscosity through the pipes is hard. To make the Bitumen less viscous , a 50:50 Bitumen: Synthetic oil mixture is made. This emulsion flows much more easily and is ready to be sold. The Bitumen in this mixture doesn’t have very much sulfur: Why this is I don’t know : either due to the process of extraction or due to the nature of the reservoir. Synthetic oil is made from a Bitumen . It is one of the final products that industries and refineries hope to achieve. Synthetic oil is bought from Suncore because Conocophillips doesn’t have refineries on site.
EMILY
Tour of ConocoPhilips and Discover Centre
Today we went on a tour of Conoco Philips.  In the morning we got a general overview of their processes and went on a perimeter walk to see how everything actually worked.  I found this a lot more interesting than yesterday as I found it easier this way to see the bigger picture, how all the parts of the process fit together.  Yesterday it was harder to see how all the parts of the processes were interconnected.
Some things I took away from this:
ConocoPhilips has a much smaller footprint due to their different extraction method than Suncor  (In Situ versus surface extraction).  It also doesn't use large tailings ponds, etc
Despite competiton, all companies rely on each other for various materials, technologies, etc.
One of the major problems facing the project is the high viscosity of the bitumen.  They need a way to make it less viscous in order to get it to the surface.  Right now they are using steam injected in to the ground.  This uses a lot of energy and water though, so is there a way to reduce this viscosity using either less steam or something else?
Another problem they face is that some of the water that goes through the process is released as vapour and lost.  Is there a way to save this water?  They are currently looking into using some form of a condenser, which apparently poses some engineering challenges, is there another way?
A third problem is that not all of the Bitumen can currently be extracted.  Is there a way to fix this?
In the afternoon, we went to one of the two pads where the drilling actually happens.  We then finished the day with a"

UAlberta,2017,Team:UAlberta#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," members from the Campbell Lab in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Alberta. The Campbell Lab is a world-renowned leader in the development of fluorescent protein-based tools through protein engineering for use in cellular imaging. Landon Zarowny, a PhD student, Dr. Matt Wiens, and Dr. Eason Shen provided us with valuable insight into the workflow of directed evolution experiments.
For directed evolution, Landon discussed the multiple rounds of screening that needs to be performed to find a new variant. He told us that in their experiments, directed evolution is used until the differences observed between rounds of evolution begins to plateau. The information gathered from round to round screening is then used to assess and improve other photophysical properties of the fluorescent protein indicator. However, the successes achieved from multiple rounds of screening comes at the expense of the necessary time commitment. He emphasized that a researcher might need to screen tens of thousands of variants before they can be confident that they have exhausted that round of evolution. “It can be time consuming. We’re always looking for better screening methods, but they can be difficult to build or carry out. One method to get around the screening process would be automation. Some research groups do have that, such as at Janelia Farm.”
Dr. Wiens and Dr. Shen confirmed that directed evolution and the resulting screening that needs to be carried out can be time consuming and labour intensive. Dr. Shen estimated that while a round of directed evolution can be performed within a few days, this estimation assumes everything goes according to plan and does not include additional experiments required to verify and characterize identified variants. “Practically it takes longer. Molecular cloning can go wrong, things need to get sequenced, and purification of the protein needs to be carried out. This can extend a round to a week or two.” Dr. Wiens estimated that a typical project length might be a year. Dr. Wiens also discussed some challenges with directed evolution experiments, such as successfully improving one property at the cost of another property and not being able to achieve an indicator that has all of the desired properties.

Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," the E. coli strain S2208, stock ID: 47 (OD600 ~ 0.5) was pipetted to 8 wells of a 96-well plate and 1 µl X-gal stock solution (40 mg/ml) was added to all wells except of the first.

The 96-well plate was placed in the plate reader and the phage detection protocol was started measuring the absorption at 600 nm every 10 min for 2 h.
There was no significant difference in absorption between the infected wells and the non-infected control as well as the well without X-gal. The results demonstrated that the conversion of X-gal is not a suitable method for phage quantification by spectroscopy as the product absorbs light at 650 nm, which interferes with the absorbance of cells. This explains the continuous increase of absorption during 2 h of cultivation. Further tests are planned using the beta-galactosidase substrate ONPG as the product absorbs at 420 nm.

To simplify the method, plaque assays were performed using only top agar. Top agar (0.7 %) supplemented with carbenicillin and X-gal stock solution was mixed with E. coli (ID:47) and phage suspension, according to the protocol: Blue Plaque Assay, and was poured into an empty well of a six well plate.

The plate was stored at 37 °C overnight.
On the next day top agar with E. coli was slightly blue, but only the positive control 10-11
showed 12 clear plaques. This proves the assumption that frozen phage samples are not longer infectious.
Software
DeeProtein
We implemented 1d convolutions to better capture the 1-dimensional character of protein sequences.
We generated a new test case"

- TODAY MARKS THE START OF THE PHAGE PURIFICATION TEAM!
- Today we began researching for a procedure to begin purifying phage. We have found that T7 can self assemble with scaffolding proteins without forming procapsids, and that T4 has only been know to form procapsids. We may not have to worry about T4 if the other group isn't using it.
- Important findings
Phage have been purified before
Phage capsids can self assemble
Phage (amber strain) can have their genes knocked out to make a hollow phage
3/18/13
- Priorities List:
Find out how to put drugs into the capsid
Possibly contact F.W. Studier for his amber t7 phage strain
- Next class we plan on growing up phage so that we will have a decent amount of phage to work with.  We have several procedures that we plan on testing so that we can see if we can purify the protein capsid.  We hope to be proceeding with these as soon as we have phage that we can use.   - Another issue that we need to consider is how to get drugs into the capsid.
We need to be able to test and see if we can actually fill our empty capsids with a material.
We have several procedures found in other papers that could possibly help us with this.
3/20/13
- We spent time trying to find a good procedure to propagate phage in a liquid medium. We finally found one that I think will work well for"
Lethbridge,2010,Team:Lethbridge#News_-_-_TEXT.html," many influential figures. It was great for our team that the Premier of Alberta (as well as many other people) believes that we are an amazing recipient of Alberta Government funding. It was a great night for our team, it was a great night for iGEM, the food was great, and the beer was free!
Things are going well in the iGEM lab and we hope you are having a wonderful time overseas.

UNITN-Trento,2015,Team:UNITN-Trento#Judging_-_-_TEXT.html," important questions beyond the bench relating to ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights in the context of our project.
We reasoned on household energy consumption in different parts of the world (Europe, America, Asia) looking at different solutions including how synthetic biology can act. We also discussed about the safety and the security of our project and about how our prototype would fit into the real world in a sustainable way, respecting the environment and limiting consume.

Dry lab
Skinchip 3D model was designed and software ideas were pitched. Biobricks were                                         checked and revised. Chemical modifications for anti-miRNA were investigated,                                         locked nucleic acid (LNA) technology appointed as the best method for miRNA silencing. Receptors within the scaffold for stem cell migration/call was                                         investigated but also other molecules apart from the main project                                         protein/molecules were investigated for the same purpose.
Human Practices
Fundraiser organization and planification, tasks were handed out. Went to a                                         public talk about tissue regeneration in burn victims using nanoparticles of                                         chitosan, we made contact with the people involved in the conference and                                         received a feedback, another meeting with the experts was appointed. We had a                                         meeting with a communication reporter to be published in a magazine. Online                                         meet up with iGEM Brazil, Ecuador and Chile were performed.

Summary
Worklab began and we had meeting to assign new sub-project. Wiki page                                         planification began, we contacted a Graphic designer to help out. We also                                         contacted several specialists in tissue regeneration to gain insights about the                                         project.
Wet lab
Transformation of competent E. coli DH5 cells was performed using different                                         plasmids, no successful transformation was seen. New cells were created under                                         the same protocol. Escherichia coli DH5 transformed with psB1C3 and inoculated                                         in LB medium. A Skin chip prototype was manufactured using PDMS and normal                                         objects such as clips and shelf sustainers.
Dry lab
Protein sequences for the ECM were optimized with IDT and verified. Novedous                                         methods for the miRNA silencing were analyzed theoretically and several                                         critical factors for the competitive binding against RISC complex were                                         encounter. Physico-chemical characteristics for leptin were revised and                                         documented. Several designs were proposed for the modelling and manufacturing                                         of the skin chip.

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic"

Even though we are not sure if this may bring other sub products which may raise safety concerns or not, this will be a topic that is far from our project and will not be discussed in this secession.
Long-term use
At first, our team didn't consider the possibility that the cell can be used multiple times since the recycling of the cells might be difficult and expensive due to the cell damage during desalination process. After testing the genetic design, we found the strength of the cell is stronger than we predicted.
Thus, the immobilization of the cell has been placed into our consideration. Even though the genetic pathway of releasing the salt is too late to design. We can still try out the downstream process.
Immobilization of microalgae has been known for a long time in wastewater treatment, especially in removing N, P and metal (Mallick, N. 2002). Additionally, the genetic stability of the cyanobacteria immobilized in calcium alginate beads has been proved, which indicates that long-term preservation of cyanobacteria can be achieved by immobilization ( Syiem, M. B., & Bhattacharjee, A. 2015).
Based on above two aspects, immobilization of cyanobacteria will probably be a promising way to fulfill cell-water separation. But selection of immobilization system and testing of conditions for biodesalition must require a lot of work.
Collaboration with Nanjing iGEM team
We used the immobilization material share by NJU-China iGEM team. Unlike B. subtilis they are working with, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 is harder to attach to th materilas. Right now, we are still working on the method.

Pittsburgh,2018,Team:Pittsburgh#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," useful signals that can be measured include certain cytokines, pH, and pollutants. These could be utilized in diagnosing diseases such as cancers and peptic ulcers. CUTSCENE could be an invaluable tool for researchers as well; by tracking the levels of multiple molecules over the course of a cell’s life, investigators can classify dependent relationships. This information allows biologists to construct vastly improved cellular models, accelerating the rate of scientific discovery.

We plan to insert E.chromi (from the Cambridge 2009 project) into this operon, this will ensure that its expression is controlled by the activity of our fusion receptor causing a pigment to be produced in the presence of the cholera autoinducer. This project has the potential to be expanded to detect many different pathogens. We have chosen vibrio cholerae as an initial proof of concept as it has a specific autoinducer (CAI-1), reducing the chance of interference in the pathway.

SMITe - The Concept: In short
The Issue
Chronic wounds and antibiotic resistance are issues increasing in importance and often go hand-in-hand
Current treatment strategies for chronic wounds rely on mechanical removal of dead tissue, or systemic antibiotic therapy, which are largely ineffective or come with considerable risks for the patient
A major reason for ineffective treatments are biofilms; structures secreted by bacteria to facilitate establishment of a chronic infection
Our goals for SMITe: Spider Silk Mediated Infection Treatment:
We aim to construct a functional dressing for chronic wounds, using spider silk as a scaffold to attach biofilm-degrading enzymes. This includes:
Expressing biofilm-degrading 'combat proteins’ and quantifying their potency
Assembling combat proteins with a linker and tag needed for purification and attachment to spider silk
Attaching the enzymes to spider silk using Sortase A, a transpeptidase
Isolating Sortase A from the S.aureus genome and creating a ‘Sortase Package’ including basic parts needed for other iGEM teams to use Sortase in their own projects
Testing the efficacy of the fully assembled wound dressing with attached enzymes on biofilms

After introductions and sharing information about the projects, we explained the essence of our social activities. We asked the representative about the attitude towards celiac patients in the educational system in Australia in order to enrich our theoretical background. The conversation focused on the ability to connect between science and social needs, and the importance of this process. We also asked her opinion as a student concerning high school students participating in a world wide science competition, and whether it is worthwhile or not.
It was amazing to speak to a scientist on the other side of the world and to know that she herself appreciates and welcomes young students attempting to make a breakthrough with a science and social idea as one.
At the end of the Skype conversation with Paris and Sydney we succeeded in understanding more how prestigious the competition is, also for those who are already on their academic road, and how this challenge with all its difficulties progresses you as a human being and develops your ability to cope and overcome things individually and as a team.
Technion HS Team
The Technion is the first high school team we have managed to collaborate with. The meetup and hospitality at the Technion was very comfortable for us because the participants are almost the same age as us.
The meeting helped us understand how to prepare for a winning presentation. Both teams helped each other by giving feedback on how each team should present itself in the activity in the framework of the competition. We gave and received remarks on how to stand in front of an audience, the correct use of technical aids, and to summarize a deep and prolonged process.
At the end of this part of the day we worked together on how a good poster should look compared to one that is not as good. Both teams collaborated and gave feedback on the posters exhibited at the Technion.
After that, Technion students gave us the basics for writing a mathematical model and we offered assistance on the construction of the wiki site, and gave the student who regard after the Wiki some advises.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Design
Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose"

Freiburg,2011,Team:Freiburg#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"ant of both samples was measured with a plate reader:
Non-purified: 180630
GST-purified:  243011
Thus the ratio of GFP absorbance / 1µg protein is:
Non-purified: 5642
GST-purified: 1432257
If the values of the Bradford assay are assumed as correct, the purified sample has a 254x higher GFP concentration than the non-purified sample. Due to 3 washing steps it can be assumed that there is barely any other protein left except GFP. Furthermore it can be estimated that only 17% of the total GFP amount present in the 50ml cell culture, could be captured using this assay.
Methods
Plate reader:
The fluorescence intensity and protein concentration were measured with the FLUOstar Omega, which is a multi-mode microplate reader.
Samples were pipetted into the microplate and analyzed via the plate reader. In this experiment we focused on the protein concentration and the fluorescence intensity of GFP.
Bradford-assay: A method to determine the total protein concentration.
To analyze the protein concentration of the samples, Coomassie Brillant Blue was pippeted to each sample. With the binding of the dye to the proteins the color changes from dark red to blue. The more protein in the solution the more Coomassie dye can bind to proteins and the more the color changes into blue. The absorption of bound Coomassie dye is 595nm. The absorbance is proportional with the amount of bound dye. With a series of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) measurements the exact protein concentration of the samples can be determined. BSA acts like a “marker” because the concentration of BSA is known and with a linear calibration line the exact protein concentration can be detected.
Usage and Biology
Prepare construct
Cloning: Clone the GST Biobrick part BBa_K608408 beforte the N-terminus of the protein you wish to purify. You may want to put a Glycine linker inbetween the two parts, for better expression and folding proterties of the fusion protein. DO NOT USE THE RFC10 STANDARD, but another, which allows fusion proteins. We recommend the Gibson Assembly, it worked conviently for us.
Vector: You may want to use a vector especially designed for protein expression. The iGEM vectors are all high copy plasmids, which can lead to an overload of protein in your E. coli cells. This can result in toxic effects or inclusion bodies.
Transformation: you may want to"

Restriction Digest
This protocol was taken and adapted from the yellow book. The yellow book took this protocol and adapted from GinkgoBioworks BioBrick Assembly Manual.
Materials
nuclease-free water
500 ng of DNA (you must calculate this from the concentration)
NEBuffer (for X/P- NEBuffer 3, for E/S, E/P, E/X, S/P- NEBuffer 4)
Restriction enzyme 1
Restriction enzyme 2
Prepare
Turn on a water bath to 37 degrees Celcius.
Turn on a heat block to 80 degrees Celsius.
Get a bucket of ice and put the materials in the ice.
Procedure
Prepare reaction mix
To each tube, add nuclease-free water and 500 ng of the part or plasmid to be /digested. Adjust the amount of water you add such that the total value in each tube is 42.5 uL. We usually add the the water before the DNA.
Add 5 uL of appropriate NEBuffer to each tube.
Add 0.5 uL of BSA to each tube.
Add 1 uL of the first appropriate restriction enzyme to each tube. When pipetting restriction enzyme, only touch the very end of the pipet tip into the restriction enzyme. Restriction enzymes are stored in a high percentage glycerol solution that sticks to the outside of the pipet tip; if you dip the tip deeply into the restriction digest you will add much more restriction digest than needed as well as increase the glycerol concentration of the digest mix.
Add 1 uL of the second appropriate restriction enzyme to each tube.
The total volume in each tube should now be 50 uL. Ensure the digest is well-mixed by flicking the tube or pipetting up and down. You can spin the tub in a microcentrifuge to collect the liquid at the bottom of the tube.
Incubations
Incubate the restriction digests at 37 degrees Celsius for at least 1 hour. You can leave this overnight (15 hours).
Incubate the restriction digests at 80 degrees Celsius for 20 min to deactivate the restriction enzymes.

Below is pseudo-code for a stochastic temporal tracking algorithm that is intended to maintain consistent cluster labeling from frame-to-frame and account for clusters combining and splitting. The time interval between frames should be chosen to be sufficiently small such that the probability of more than one binding/un-binding events occurring between any two frames can be assumed to be zero.

But wait! We passively assumed that the number of clusters N′ in frame i − 1 was greater than the number of clusters N in frame i. Not to worry, small modification...
N = N′:
If this is the case, the logic holds and we simply have a child label j′ that is mapped to parent label j.

Physically, this corresponds to a cluster splitting.
How do we handle this? No modification of the pseudo-code algorithm is needed. There will simply be two objects with labels j1, j2, respectively, to which some j′ is mapped"
Austin_UTexas,2018,Team:Austin UTexas#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," plasmid contained a GFP and KAN resistance as well. However, it appears to have allowed the MFD strain to survive on the selective media, as traces can be seen in one of the control plasmid conjugation sections, as well as the sections where MFD plus the control plasmid was plated alone. However, because all the negative controls for the S. marcescens conjugation with a plasmid from the BHR kit died on the selective media, the results are not assumed to be invalidated. Ultimately, because the S. marcescens expressed the GFP from the BHR plasmid, we concluded that the origin of transfer (part type 7) was functional, allowing us to conjugate into other bacteria.

FimE recognizes IRL and IRR, then catalyze the inversion of J23119. The weak acid would be generated at that time. For the environment, due to the production of the weak acid, it would turn neutral gradually.
Since the recombinases were found and RMCE was invented, more recombinases’ functions and features were be explored. Recombinase has stick logic relationship and high robust. It fits the modern research of synthetic biology.
○ Result
To test and verify the recombinase system, we replace the mLdhA and gadA to mRFP and GFP respectively. (Fig.13) Through fluorescence, we could verify the recombinase system.

We constructed our verification circuits through OE-PCR, and linked them into vector pSB1C3 (Fig.14~17). And we divided it into recombinase part and fluorescence part.

He suggested we could use a tube with a preservative in its lid that is only released upon closing the tube. The tube could then be sent out via post to an individual to provide a saliva or urine sample, and could be posted back to a centralized lab for processing. For blood, there would be localized centers for tests (or just GP centers) and one main processing lab.
He also recommended using a multiplexing assay to detect multiple different miRNAs simultaneously from the same sample. However, at the time we had only designed one series of switches which would be activated by homologs. For a multiplexing assay, cross-hybridization levels need to be minimal - so we knew we had to think about new ways to design our switches. Our second series of switches, designed after talking with iGEM EPFL, were designed to solve this problem.
Professor Lovat’s team at UCL also helped us choose the best pieces of equipment for miRNA extraction which helped us with our cost analysis . We also discussed carrying out miRNA extractions in the field with them, as well as automation of the miRNA extraction protocol.
Sensitivity and Specificity
Professor Lovat and Dr Desai were concerned about the specificity and sensitivity of our test, and how it would be used for screening.
There are two types of sensitivity and specificity:
In terms of the toehold switch, sensitivity is the lowest number of miRNAs that can be detected and specificity is whether only the target miRNA can activate the switch. The feedback of doctors prompted us to seek out the advice of iGEM EPFL, to create the second generation switches with massively superior specificity.
In terms of a screening tool, sensitivity relates to the false negative rate, while specificity relates to the false positive rate.
A 100% sensitive test will always pick up the disease but may also pick up patients that do not have the disease (no false negatives).
A 100% specific test will never pick up healthy patients but may also miss patients that do have the disease (no false positives).

TAS_Taipei,2016,Team:TAS Taipei#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," this graph, when concentration and dose frequency are kept constant, changing nanoparticle radius results in essentially no change in the concentration graph.
Figure 4.E: Changing Concentration. When concentration is changed, its resulting equilibrium concentration increase proportionally. However, the time to reach equilibrium does not change.
Changing Concentration
We find that changing the concentration impacts the equilibrium concentration. There is a direct relationship between GSR concentration inside the nanoparticles, and the equilibrium outside. Higher concentrations also make the graph more unstable, however, shown in a greater amplitude of oscillation in Figure 4.E sample graph is shown above.
Changing Frequency
Figure 4.F: Changing Frequency. The equilibrium concentration is unaffected, although lower frequencies (greater periods between dose), with a higher concentration each time, results in an unstable graph.
We find that changing the frequency does not impact equilibrium concentration, but does change the stability at equilibrium, as shown in Figure 4.F. The concentration oscillates at a greater amplitude about the equilibrium, which is undesirable, when frequency is too low. Therefore, daily doses are definitely preferred.
We graphed each of the three dependent variables as a function of the three independent variables, and found the quantitative relationship between them. This engineering technique allows us to find an equation for the equilibrium concentration as a function of the three independent variables.
Notice that the time to reach equilibrium (related to the time constant) cannot be altered. See the two eyedrop appraoch to overcome this problem.
Two Stage Eyedrop Approach
Explanation
Problem: We cannot decrease the amount of time until the concentration reaches equilibrium, where full prevention is effective.
Solution: We propose the two stage eyedrop approach. For the first days of treatment, a higher concentration of eyedrop will be used before using a lower concentration. This will speed up the time to reach equilibrium.
In the diagram, we wish to reach the low equilibrium (in blue) as soon as possible. Using the higher concentrated nanoparticles results in the red curve. By applying the higher concentrated nanoparticles in the first days, then switching to the lower concentrated nanoparticles afterwards, we follow the highlighted path. This allows us to reach equilibrium faster.
We need to figure out the concentration of GSR in naoparticles for the blue and red curves. The blue curve (eyedrop 2) requires the original results of our model (outside collapsible). The red curve (eyedrop 1) requires some calculations.
Figure 4.8: Two Stage Eyedrop Approach. Two nanoparticle designs are shown above, with high and low concentration. By applying high conc. eyedrops first until [GSR"

September 15 - September 30
After several attempts, T7  has  finally banded! We discovered that the band may disappear because the T7 band is faint, even at very high titer. Mutated phage is low titer, and if the gradient is made more specific, the band would be impossible to see. With this knowledge, we can continue on with purification. These two weeks are the last weeks of experiments, and the latter week was devoted to working on the wiki.

We can degrade the PHB made by our own bacteria
With this experiment, we demonstrate that the material that we purified in various experiments is Poly-Hydroxy-Butyrate bioplastc. One of the samples analysed was extracted from bacteria growing on waste, therefore we made PHB bioplastic directly from waste.
We can close the loop and degrade our own bioplastic, with our own enzyme, PhaZ1 .
The bioplastic produced by our bacteria contains PHB and can be broken down into monomers by PhaZ1 enzyme (expressed by our bacteria)
The amount of 3HB monomers freed from the polymer is more in case of all PhZ1 treated samples, than the untreated sample. There is less 3HB produced from the samples that were purified from bacteria than from the pure polymer, purchased from Sigma. This could be because I put less amount in the assay to start with, because there was less available. I put about a 0.01-0.03 g of our own and 0.5 grams of Sigma-PHB.
Please see our protocols and data pages for methods and details of the data.
Bioplastic degradation: Proteinase K enzymatic assays▼
Proteinase K kinetic activity
According to the literature, protease K breaks down poly L-lactic acid as well as fibrous proteins, such as silk fibroin. In the active site of proteinase K is a catalytic triad containing serine, histidine and aspartic acid. L-lactic acid is analogous to L-alanine. Poly L-lactic acid, therefore, can bind to and be catalysed by the catalytic triad, as it mimics silk fibroin which is rich with L-alanine residues. Proteinase K cannot catalyse the breakdown of poly D-lactic acid, because the catalytic triad will not accommodate it. [46] [47]
To obtain parameters to use in our PLA degradation model that kinetic activity of proteinase K was measured with a substrate analogue, N-succinyl Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu p-nitroanilide (AAPL p-NA). Cleavage of AAPL p-NA releases 4-nitroaniline (4-NA), which can be recorded by an increase in absorbance at wavelength 405nm. For this assay, proteinase K and AAPL p-NA were purchased"

Collaboration
Harvard iGEM
Cell Culturing Microfluidc | July - September 2017 | Harvard iGEM
This collaboration between the BU Hardware Team and the Harvard iGEM team was based around engineering a microfluidic system to culture cell and measure the resulting cell growth.   Each team was responsible for separate parts of the system.  The BU Hardware Team primarily worked on the design, manufacturing, and testing of the microfluidic device. The Harvard iGEM team primarily worked on an optical density sensor which was aimed to measure cell growth. Even though each team focused on individual parts of the system collaboration was imperative to test and develop each teams work.

Mainly sponsored by:"
Cornell,2012,Team:Cornell#project#hprac#CEA_-_-_TEXT.html," chromosomal integration alter the expression patterns of this engineered pathway? Will it interfere with other functions of the cells? Functionality can be altered depending on the position of the construct within the chromosome. This is our first forthcoming research priority: determining any potential adverse effects of chromosomal integration, carrying it out, and thoroughly testing the functionality of our new engineered strains.
Competition & Biodiversity
A second concern is that engineered strains could possibly outcompete wild-type species in the environment and pose a threat to biodiversity. Our first line of defense against this possibility is physical containment: the inlet and outlet of our current prototype are equipped with 0.1 µm filters, effectively eliminating the possibility that our engineered strains may interact with natural organisms. However, imagine that there could be a mechanical error: physical breakage of the device, slight discrepancies in filter pore sizes, et cetera, that could leave a slim possibility that our strains could come into contact with natural species. What then?
To answer this question, we return to the altered physiology of our strains: the primary distinguishing characteristic to note is that the cells cannot carry out the wild-type levels of anaerobic respiration unless they are induced. This means that in situations where oxygen availability is limiting, and toxins are not highly prevalent, our strains are less able to compete than wild-type Shewanella; this is our second line of defense. S. oneidensis is native to freshwater ecosystems in our area, so our strains should not be disruptive to biodiversity. In addition, we have observed that inserting the nah operon into cells seems to significantly increase their doubling time, so our salicylate reporter strains would be even less able to compete than our arsenic reporters.
However, what happens in the case that oxygen availability is not limiting? It is probable that our current engineered strains would be able to survive and thrive in aerobic conditions, and live alongside wild-type Shewanella. We need a third line of defense for this situation, a modification that would prevent our strains from being able to survive outside of our physical device. For this, we propose auxotrophy: in a truly field-deployable device, we would use a strain that had a gene for a key metabolite knocked out, so that the strain would rely upon supplementation of this nutrient in order to survive. We would then supplement this metabolite inside of the device, so that our strains would function properly within our device. If the bacteria were to somehow escape, their functionality would be severely impaired by the lack of nutritional supplementation, and they would be quickly outcompeted by wild-type strains.
This brings to the"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions"

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Hydrocarbon_-_-_TEXT.html," plates did not look very promising, as they were completely covered by red colonies, with only a few white ones. Many of the white colonies from the previous week had become red. 8 overnight cultures were also performed so that a restriction digest could be done on the CAR colonies, to see if the part was there. These overnight cultures were prepared with the Kan antibiotic. Another ligation was done with the three combinations of cut inserts and vectors: CAR with PET, NPT (E/P) with PSB1C3, and NPT (X/P) with PSB1C3. Restriction digests were performed on the CAR overnight colonies with AscI and HindIII, and when the gel was run, a single lane was shown to contain both the CAR gene and PET vector, as shown below:
</html>
As shown in the gel above, lane 3 indicates 2 bands, the uppermost at about 5.4kb, identifying as PET. This single lane also contains a clear band of CAR, a bit under the 5000bp mark, at 4690bp. The ladder used was 1 kb plus. This successful result allowed us to proceed with mutagenesizing the 6 illegal cut sites of CAR, including: 2 PstI sites, 1 EcorI site, and 3 NotI sites, with the primers that we had designed. Two additional colony PCRs of NPT were performed, but unfortunately a band indicating NPT was not visible in any of the traisl, even when an additional plate of both the NPT (E/P) and NPT (X/P) restriction digests were ligated and transformed. Very few white colonies could be seen on any of the transformations, but we were determined to continue trying. We then attempted to mutagenesize the first illegal cut site of CAR, which would be a PstI site. The mutagenesis primers needed to be diluted and stock solutions were made. Then, we attempted to mutagenesize the PstI site of CAR with that site's specific primers, using various concentrations of template DNA (5ng, 20ng, 50ng). We used the KAPA system to perform this plasmid amplification, using the thermocycler settings of the Desulfurization team. The mutagenesis PCR would be run over the weekend to hopefully have successful results.

Tsinghua,2013,Team:Tsinghua-E#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," provide selection pressure to tryptophan provider microorganisms by antibiotics resistance. Similar to mutD, three different RBS sequences (B0030, B0032, RBS derived from the upstream of wild type tnaA) were introduced upstream of tetA (cloned from pCM110) by PCR amplification. Plasmid pTrc99A_trp sensor_lacZ was also linearized by PCR to remove lacZ and at the same time introduced with tetA overlap homology. All the primers information was listed in the appendix, primer information. The partial functional part of this plasmid was sequenced. The three constructed plasmids were named after pTrc99A_trp sensor_B0030_tetA, pTrc99A_trp sensor_B0032_tetA and pTrc99A_trp sensor_B0030_tetA, respectively. In this iGEM project, they were named after bitter pressure part 30, 32 and ori, respectively.
Week7(8.6-8.13)
Figure. 9 sweet pressure part construction with pBAD as promoter
Simultaneously, because of the failure of our sweet part to have desired growth dependence on tryptophan measured in the last week, we redesigned our circuit and replaced tac promoter in pTrc99A with more strict araBAD promoter (pBAD). At the same time, we designed random RBS library to control the expression level of malQ. In this way, a proper maltase expression level could be selected and expected to avoid the overexpression problem. The pBAD sequence was derived from (pRedET (amp),produced by Red^R/ ET^RRecombination). Hence, pBAD and tryptophan sensor were PCR amplified, gel-purified and assembled by overlap PCR.
A 5’ end RBS random primer (malQ_RBS_library-F) for malQ was designed to produce the RBS library. pTrc99A plasmid was PCR amplified to remove tac promoter sequence and simultaneously linearized. These three gel-purified fragments were assembled by Takara infusion cloning kit. The plasmid with a random RBS library for malQ was named after pTrc99A_pBAD_trp sensor_random RBS_malQ. For the poor efficiency of the E.coli JW3379 component cell, we firstly transformed the infusion product into E.coli DH5a component cells and 120 single colonies were cultured and confirmed by PCR. After this step, we cocultured"
Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," in orderly rings and layers with no spaces between them (maximum density). In this case, there are 600 rings of bacteria and 4 layers**. The blue lines are the mesh, the solver’s spatial discretization. Observe how the mesh around the bacteria is very orderly, but also rather coarse (compared to the feature size). The loss in accuracy in this area is intentional: our model inherently can’t resolve concentration differences inside each bacterium’s cytoplasm, therefore a finer mesh would not provide extra information, only modelling artifacts -- and much more computation time! ** Due to constraints with the mesh generation, this isn’t exactly the case. The reality is more complicated, but it simulates bacteria packed closely together. Notice that each red rectangle has a blue rectangle next to it. Only 1 in 3 red rectangles actually interacts with the AHL, the rest is inert geometry. Thus, 1 cell covers the space of 6 rectangles on the same layer, plus 6 more on the layer below. The cell’s AHL output is multiplied by the number of bacteria it replaces, thus in fact concentrating the production of this entire region on 1 cell. This should be a slight source of error though, because the diffusion coefficient is large.
Boundary and initial conditions
Boundary conditions specify what happens to the concentration (Dirichlet BC), or to its gradient (Neumann BC), at the geometric boundaries. There’s a lot of those: the edges of the agar, as well as the edges of the rectangles that represent a ring of bacteria. A Neumann BC takes the form $\nabla \mathit{[AHL]} \cdot \hat{n} = q$, where $q$ is the flux through the boundary. $\hat{n}$ is the unit vector normal to the boundary.
The edges of an agar plate are all reflecting boundaries, because AHL can’t diffuse through them: plastic walls at the sides and bottom, air at the top. Thus, at the boundary $q=0$: no AHL goes through.
A boundary condition on the edge of the bacteria could simulate the semipermeable cell membrane, but unfortunately the current version of Matlab doesn’t accommodate conditions on internal boundaries. To evaluate the significance of this restriction we’ve run a test simulation ( figure 11 ).
The initial conditions are described by the [AHL] at each point in the geometry at $t=0$. Here, they are 0.
Solution algorithm
We solve the PDE with the finite element method (FEM). This method discretizes the continuous space into small elements by overlaying a mesh ( figure "

Germ-line gene editing is still a topic of ethical debate due to the unknown effects of manipulating the genetics that become part of the gene pool. The genome within the germ line cells is passed down to offspring, meaning any change done in Germ-line gene therapy will be carried on, for better or worse. Editing could cause a decrease in genetic variance among populations, and could cause other unforeseen problems in the future that no one currently can predict accurately.

SAFETY
Safety First!
LAB SAFETY
Safety is a key word when working in a laboratory. Each team member who worked in the lab received a guided tour and an introduction to safety protocols, including waste management, sterilization, clean lab coat, hand washing and so on. Sometimes, your protection equipment can turn into an unique Star Wars costume!
Most of the work made during our project was done in an L2 safety lab. The other part of the technical work concerns the printing of our bio badge 3D model. This work has been done in a chemistry lab that doesn’t require specific biological safety protocols.
SAFE PROJECT DESIGN
The safety aspect of our project has always been in our minds while working on it, since the primary goal of the badge is to be used outside of the lab. We decided to design it in a way that prevents our modified bacteria from escaping into the environment. The badge includes a ring filled with bleach which is mixed with the bacteria contained into the capsule once it has been used. The bleach will rapidly kill the bacteria and ensure that none can escape. The risk of bacteria escaping into the environment is thus greatly reduced.

Warship
""Simplicity involves digging through the depth of the complexity"" (by Steve Jobs). We aimed to build a simple device (we termed ‘warship’) to increase the competitive power of introduced bacteria against native microbiota and biosafety levels of using engineered bacteria. This was inspired by the feedback from our presentation in a workshop (HUST_Cheering) in July. Other iGEMers were curious about the 'fate' of our engineered bacteria in human's gut. Our Gutrio has to compete with other living microorganisms in a such complicated gut environment. Intestinal environment differs from individuals to individuals and the agents cannot survive if they are not well-prepared. Moreover, it is quite dangerous for armed Gutrios to expand their territory without limitation.
We achieved this by sandwiching alien bacteria with pieces of semi-permeable membrane, thereby detaining concentrated aliens and yet still allowing exchange of chemicals between aliens and gut. We extensively elucidated that aliens would not leak out and surrounding bacteria could not invade aliens. Importantly, we revealed small molecules can freely diffuse across the semi-membrane. Therefore, in principle, therapeutic agents produced by aliens can diffuse into gut environment. Thus, our simple device allowed us to target two birds (alien competitive power and biosafety) with one stone.

The biggest diameter of particles that are allowed through the semi-permeable membrane is 0.22 um. We immersed our device in intestinal-pH solution, concentrated hydrochloric acid, sodium bicarbonate solution and common organic solvent, used mechanical compression to test its strength and it was intact after all of the tests.
First we tested if our device allows small molecules like IPTG pass through the membrane (Figure 2). We put E.coli with a"

This gave the gathered audience and experts an opportunity to engage with current innovations in the space, and provide their feedback during the networking hour. Perspectives from the attendees and speakers were not only gathered anecdotally by our team, but also through a short attendance survey that helped us understand the demographic of our audience and encourage their engagement.
Outcomes and Analysis
This outreach experience framed the rest of our human practices work, with key take away messages being integrated into all aspects of our project.
Defining Synthetic Biology
Prior to the discussions, the audience were asked to evaluate their understanding of synthetic biology. Despite over 97% of the attendants having heard of the term before, 32% of them seemed unsure about its definition. This was a common theme that we encountered amongst discussions with our family and friends.
Similarly, the panellists gave diverse answers when challenged to define the term. From discussing the evolution of the field of molecular biology to considering the interface between the organic and inorganic, the speakers all came back to the idea that this space has been built by combining previous research, scientific principles, and an overarching goal to invent promising new technologies. At one point, Matthew Kearnes even included the audience by asking them from what field of science or engineering they identify with, and using the range of responses from engineers, chemists, biologists and social scientists to illustrate the diversity and inclusivity of the field of synthetic biology.
However, the common thread throughout this part of the discussion was that synthetic biology focuses on applying engineering principles to biological systems to build reliable methods and tools. This is backed by the literature1,2, with the key philosophies behind most projects being rational design, modularity, abstraction and novelty; all paradigms that stem from engineering practices and commercialising processes.
Given the imprecise meaning of ‘synthetic biology’, the UNSW team decided to craft our own simple, yet descriptive definition that attempts to encompass the diversity of this field:
“Synthetic Biology is the application of engineering design principles to biology in order to develop valuable methods and tools that benefit society and the world.”
This statement was used throughout the rest of our human practices work to ensure we could clearly portray how we envisaged the context of our project in its research context. Furthermore, it helped shape how our project evolved over time by encouraging us to employ the engineering ‘design-test-build’ paradigm through the iterations of our design, to improve our scaffold design.

The light-source itself was a run-of-the-mill flashlight, with a blue light filter installed in front of the lens. To eliminate the effect of temperature gradients inside the incubator, the three samples were placed in a triangle formation in the center of the designed light box.
Figure 3: Schematic over plate positioning and areas exposed to light.
Another deviation from the protocol is that the cultures were not spotted onto the center of the plate, but instead one drop of culture was placed in the center of the light exposed half and another drop (of the same culture) was spotted onto the dark half. This would give us more information on how the bacteria would behave when directly exposed to either the darkness or illuminated surroundings, instead of the gradient that was present in the first experiment.
From the results of the first experiment we expected the culture containing K343007 to spread out in the dark and not to spread when exposed to light. The wild type bacteria should spread out evenly no matter if it is exposed to light or not and the non-motile strain (DH5alpha) should not move regardless of the light conditions. Our expectations from the first experiment were fulfilled, as the bacteria behaved exactly as expected. This made it possible to conclude that the photosensor has an effect on the bacteria's tumbling frequency. Whether it actually reduces the tumbling is not possible to say, since both an increased and reduced tumbling frequency will look alike.
From left to right: MG1655 (Wildtype), Photosensor (Bacteria containing K343007), DH5alpha (non-motile strain)
Figure 4: wild type E. coli strain MG1655 and MG1655-pSB1C3-K343007 grown on motility agar (LB media + 0.3% agarose) incubated at 37 degrees celcius for 24 hours. Plates were placed with one part exposed to light and the other part in darkness. A difference in growth of the transformed bacteria exposed to light contra the transformants that grew in darkness is clearly seen. The cells grown in light did not spread as much as the ones grown in darkness. The wild type seems to grow best when exposed to light while DH5alpha grows a little better in darkness
After this we could conclude that the part had an impact on the bacterial motility, but we had to find out which. This lead us to our next experiment, which was intended for determining what happened to the tumbling frequency:

General information
Figure  6.2.1 Percentage of total capacity of desalination source water in Spain and US.
Spain’s data (Left) comes from (Lei et al., 2015). US’s data (Right) comes from (GWI, 2006b). Original data comes from Global Water Intelligence.
There’re six kinds of water source  as figure 6.2.1. In last section, we identify their different TDS range. The water has 500~15000mg/L is called brackish water and most of them are groundwater (GWI, 2006b). As Figure 6.2.1, every country‘s desalination industry has different major water source depending on their unique geological features. For example, most of Spain’s territory is close to the sea. Therefore, most of its source water is seawater. The desalination process usually focuse on either seawater or brackish water. In normal circumstance, what feed water the area use depends on which water is easier to get.
Yet, when we consider this question in global scale, the distance can no longer be the main standard. We have to analyze the difference of these two feed water in several other aspects such as supply capacity.
Supply Capacity
Figure  6.2.2 Major Stocks of Water on Earth.
Original data comes from Shiklomanov, 1993.
There’s no doubt if the time frozen, seawater will have more water to satisfy global need. As Figure 6.2.2, seawater has 96.5% of water preserve, yet, brackish water only has 0.94% (Shiklomanov, 1993).
However, water is not changeless. What global water demand is truly chasing right now is the regeneration capacity of water resources. Therefore, when we assess these two feed water, regeneration capacity is important as well. As Figure 6.2.3, scientists estimated seawater will have 4000 years of reserved time. Yet, groundwater’s reserved time is estimated to 2 weeks to 10000 years. (NEP, 2008) It’s because the regeneration capacity of groundwater is harder to access. It is a more changeable water resource comparing to seawater.

The paper also mentions that E. coli does not have RamA to control acrAB expression and instead uses multiple proteins to control acrAB expression.  If you put the Salmonella acrAB gene into E. coli will the native proteins also induce expression or will the Salmonella acrAB gene be different enough that the native proteins won't recognize and induce expression?
To help with this question, I plan on doing a BLAST of the Salmonella acrAB operon and the ramA gene to see how similar it is with E. coli. Also I plan on doing the same BLAST but for Lactobacillus. If Lactobacillus doesn't have a acrAB gene, this might prove beneficial because we won't have to worry about other native proteins also transcribing the engineered gene.

In the group meeting with Wes, we discussed about the pBAD35BB mutated PstI site. need to cut with SpeI and PstI. PstI is on both parent and Biobricked clone (this would be to check if the PstI site worked from the PCR amplification on new pBAD35 miniprep.
Also we talked about the logistics of the pH acid test on L. acidophilus and MG1655 E. coli. If we are using a GFP/RFP protien, we need to transform it into the two hosts. Easy for E. coli, but for L. acidophilus better to use conjugation.  There is a plasmid in the Registry of Parts that the MIT 2008 team used to transform into a Lactobacillus spieces from E. coli. So we plan on trying to use this plasmid.  Also Wes suggested chemical transformation.
In lab today, I did a transformation of pBAD33BB (miniprepped 6-21-10) to test the competent cell transformation efficiency. The time constant was 4.6 ms
Also the Lactose-Drug team decided to use the plasmids the parts came in to clone (ie pSB1AK3). Richard still had no clonig success with pBAD33BB and Nate has had greater success using the plamids the parts come in. So we started overnight cultures to beginning cloning in these vectors.

Abstract
While a low-fat diet and regular exercise are popular approaches to combat obesity, one easy alternative is simply to increase energy metabolism. Employing a synthetic biology approach, we are working to create an artificial futile cycle in mammalian liver cells by introducing glyoxylate enzymes native to bacteria. Past research has shown that mice expressing enzymes facilitating an active glyoxylate shunt are resistant to diet-induced obesity. Our team plans to introduce an inducible system that allows us to couple the sensing of circulating fatty acid concentrations with a circuit of glyoxylate shunt. Our inducible system is intended to prevent the risk of fatty acid deficiency, while facilitating greater fatty acid uptake at higher fatty acid circulating concentrations. Such a system should increase the feasibility of a glyoxylate cycle engineered to function in vivo.

Figure Nickel Affinity Chromatography. 12% SDS of Tn5 (expected size 53.3kDa). Lane 1 molecular ladder (kDa), lane 2 whole lysate, lane 3 clarified lysate, lane 4 cell debris, lane 5 flow through 1, lane 6  flow through 2, lane 7 wash 1, lane 8 wash 2, lane 9 wash 3, lane 10 elution 1, lane 11 elution 2, lane 12 elution 3, lane 13 elution 4, lane 14 elution 5, lane 15 elution 6.
A significant amount of Tn5 was observed in the nickel chromatography elution fractions (lane 10-14), however the Tn5 protein was also observed in the flowthrough and wash elution fractions (lane 5-9). It is recommended to optimize the nickel chromatography to reduce these losses. For our purposes, the Tn5 losses were tolerated because the amounts that we obtained were sufficient to proceed to functionality testing of the Tn5. To increase the Tn5 amount, the first five elution fractions were pooled (lane 10-14).

Figure 6: Fits of the promoter activation model described by equation (15), called cooperative promoter activation here, to the data of [1]. The left panel shows the fit for the jbiJ promoter, the right panel the fit for the yqjFB2A1 promoter. For comparison, also the fits described by equation (13) are displayed.
From figure 6, it can be seen that the model described by equation (15) fits remarkably well to the experimental data. It is therefore worthwhile to look into the found parameter values a bit more. The lower dissociation constant for the yqjFB2A1 promoter compared to the jbiJ promoter indicates that the DNT binds better to the yqjFB2A1 promoter. This is not surprising, since the yqjFB2A1 promoter is the result of a directed evolution experiment in which is DNT response was enhanced with respect to the original yqjF promoter, which had similar characteristics as the jbiJ promoter [1]. This is also the most obvious explanation of the lower values for the Hill coefficient. A large increase in both \(k_{1}\) and \(k_{2}\) can be seen between the jbiJ promoter and the yqjFB2A1 promoter. This indicates that the reporter protein production does not only increase for the activated promoter, which is as expected, but also for the repressed promoter. This corresponds to the fact that in [1], for the yqjFB2A1 promoter, a higher background luminescence was recorded than for the non-mutated promoters, see figure 7.
Figure 7: Induction of the original yqjFwt and improved variants by 2,4-DNT: dose-dependent response. Increase in luminescence intensity (\(\Delta RLU\)). The data presented are maximal values obtained in the course of a 4-h exposure. Figure adapted from [1].
Since we plan to use the found values of \(k_{1}\)  in other parts of the modelling, we performed a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation to check if the order of magnitude of \(k_{1}\)  is realistic. In [1], an \(OD_{600}\)  of 0.2 is recorded. This corresponds to a cell concentration of \(1.6 \times 10^{8} \ mL^{-1}\"

Groningen,2018,Team:Groningen#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," mould of the individual bricks. Transitioning for a multinational like this does not just mean searching for the right material. It means transforming the entire production process. Therefore, there is little room for errors when switching to a new composition.
Importance of constant feedstock: scale, constant (reliable) product with uniform properties: We were pointed towards an important bottleneck of bioplastics: going from start-up to scale up. In order to supply industrials, a reliable feedstock is necessary. Therefore, throughout developing StyGreen in the lab ample attention needs to be given to possible commercialization. Read about our dive into this on our Entrepeneurship page.
Minimizing steps in the production process: Minimizing production process steps is appealing when producing plastics. Minimizing steps in the production process will contribute to the success of StyGreen, for example by minimizing energy consumption. This makes our product more competitive.
Who is responsible for this transition: to place our project in a societal context, we also had an insightful discussion on where the responsibility of the energy transition lies.
According to the VP Materials we are operating at the right time. Speaking of an ever-increasing visible framework and the fact that we are currently operating in a more circular economy which will have large consequences.
Optimizing scale and reliable production are of  utmost importance when producing a successful bioplastic
Ludos Imaginem: George van den Nieuwenhuizen (19th September 2018)
Ludos Imaginem is a new company which creates toys with which you are able to create something out of your own imagination. Because they recently started, they are really interested in making their product as sustainable as possible. Ludos is willing to invest in us when we have the first results, and has shared the data about the styrene they need for their product. This way, we can optimize our StyGreen to the demand of the customer. We keep in contact with Ludos to update them on the developments in our process. Ludos is very interested in a biobased way to create plastics. They do not want to compete with the food industry, and therefore encourage our way of working with sludge.

Tianjin,2011,Team:Tianjin#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," recover the production level. For example, many bio-fuel producers conduct detoxification before fermentation in order to remove the inhibition. Although this method works, it complicates the procedure, leading to additional cost and time. Considering that SB has enabled human to modify a living cell to work in accordance to our design, which expedited the velocity of industrial production by a large scale, compared to the ordinary way of cell mutation and selection, and having thought about the disadvantage of traditional technologies, we felt like trying something different with synthetic biology (SB).
It is the allergic reactions of yeast that hinders ethanol production, thus we hope that there is some way to ease the yeast symptoms and ‘force’ the yeast to maintain the high rate of ethanol production. Originally, yeast growth is suppressed by various inhibitions during fermentation, and it takes too long for yeast to reach exponent phase, and symptoms will only relieve after those inhibition being slowly decomposed. However, our modified TOR made it feasible to maintain a high ethanol output without detoxification process. The GE (genetically engineered) yeast is able to sustain a high growing and producing rate even with the toxicant present. This modification is significant in that it completely rid of the need for detoxification process before or after hydrolysis, which saves a considerably large amount of time and energy and serves the purpose of a better environment of biofuel industry.
In everyday life, the only chance people get to know anything about synthetic biology is about various genetically modified (GM) foods. Unfortunately, theresult of this opportunity for the public to know synthetic biology did not turn out well. There were times when foods that are made of GM corns, wheat, potatoes were proud of their GM ancestry, and favored by consumers. As time goes by, however, worries pertaining the possible danger those GM foods may bring began to fly all over the news and several governments banned GM crops from entering food market. It is natural for some people to feel concerned about the destruction brought by the uncontrolled proliferation of those GM species. People cannot help thinking that the synthetic biology technology must be a monster because everyone says so, and in that way we need to stay away from any GM product as far as we can. As result, people not only stopped buying GM food, but also began to vote against GM technology.
The public is just seeing part of the picture. Admittedly, there are some parts of GM food that we may not completely understand, for those parts may pose unknown risk in food consumers. However, it is unjustifiable to veto the whole technology because of unfamiliarity of SB. Synthetic biology, which has its application in"

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Log_-_-_TEXT.html," prospective third year module and trying to find ways that the third year module could build upon the second year one.
Emily and Pablo worked in the lab today - they did CFU counts on plates. Two of the spread plates - RFP 10-3 in the dark and KO 10-5 not induced - were found to be anomalous due to an issue with the spread plates used.
September 5th
Log entry
Today was a day that focused on writing up wiki content. Dan uploaded and started to analyse the Killer Red and Killer Orange data from the last few weeks, and typed up the latest few lab book entries.
Emily had a meeting with Dr John Love and Dr Paul James about the second and third year modules we are developing - the meeting was very positive, with them giving advice on how to improve on the current module ideas. She also worked on the wiki home page, improving on what is currently written.
Leanne worked on writing up sections for the Human Practises page on the wiki - she typed up about the science fairs (Big Bang Science Fair and Britain Needs Scientists Fair), the work experience students who have joined us through the summer (Barnaby, Juliet and Jorge) and the data analysis on the BioMech survey we conducted at Colyton Grammar School.
Today’s lab team - Emily and Dan - prepared and autoclaved the ministat chambers so they are now ready for use, and set up a new configuration using 1L Duran bottles to deal with previous effluent problems. They also prepared overnights of Killer Red, Killer Orange, Lysozyme, RFP and the wild type."

Wells 19 and 20 act as a positive control to indicate a successful transfection, as they are transfected with Puc-GFP, a vector that can express green florescence protein (GFP). We expected to see GFP expression when examining these wells in a fluorescence microscope, which would indicate a successful transfection..
Results:
We found that the values of pTIMP1 and pF4/80 are about 2.5-4 fold when compared to the empty vector (negative control). These values are lower than enhancer 7 that is positive in HEK293 but are still show promoter activity. However, the value of pSTEAP4  is about 24 fold when compared to the  empty vector, which suggests that pSTEAP4 is a strong  promoter in HEK293 cells.
Figure 11: The activity of TIMP1, STEAP4 or F4/80 promoters in HEK293. Luciferase reporter assay demonstrating transcriptional activation mediated by promoters of TIMP1, STEAP4 and F4/80 in HEK293 cells. The TIMP1 promoter showed 2.4-fold increased activity, as compared to the control (empty vector). The STEAP4 promoter showed 24-fold increased activity, which is 10 time more that pTIMP1, as compared to the control, and the F4/80 promoter showed 4-fold increased activity, as compared to the control. Enhancer 7 that serves as a positive control for Luciferase activity in HEK293 showed 5 fold increased activity. Relative luciferase expression results are presented after normalization to Renilla activity and represent the means ± standard deviation of three independent experiments.
Discussion:
We found that these promoters are active in HEK293, but they have different activity. While TIMP1 and F4/80 showed lower activity than the positive control (enhancer 7), STEAP4 promoter showed high activity that is 10 fold from TIMP1 suggesting that this STEAP4 promoter is a strong promoter in HEK293 that can drive high expression of gene/s in this cells as well as in reactive astrocytes (previous experiment). Therefore, we can use this promoter to test our model system in HEK293 as these promoters are active and will be able to activate the required transcription in our model.

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into"

Overview

Aiming to rationally design synthetic gene circuits with specific functions, we develop a software for automatic design which integrate methods including electrical engineering, stochastic simulation, and circuit performance analysis.
Given a truth table where the inputs and outputs take only 0/1 values by applying the standard procedure of electrical engineering to biology, we convert the truth table into Boolean Formula and use relevant algorithm to find corresponding digital circuit scheme which is as simple as possible in the sense of electrical engineering.
Appropriate biological structure of logic gates will be chosen from our database and embedded into the digital circuit. Among all these possible gene circuit designs, our software can recommend one or more most reliable circuits according to gene circuits’ fitness score which evaluates their complexity. Users can either accept the recommendation or choose any gene circuit they like. Meanwhile, the detailed biological structure will be screened for users’ reference.
Once a gene circuit is generated, our software will numerically simulate the stochastic time evolution of all the inputs and outputs.
If the simulation results correspond with the initial truth table, sensitivity analysis and optimization will be done to further maximize circuits’ practical realizablity, and robustness analysis will access their relative immunity to perturbations.
Finally, a thoroughly considered gene circuit will be generated by our software, available for wet-lab experiments.
Our software keeps the compatibility of various methods or algorithms and reserves the space for users to redesign. Moreover, our software adopts user-friendly GUI and visualize the designing process, which makes the operations much more convenient for users.
For more details, please read our User Guide .
Motivation
Since its inception over a decade ago, a series of remarkable progress have been made in the field of Synthetic Biology. As the design and testing cycles rely more on DNA synthesis and high-throughput assembly methods than on the traditional molecular cloning tools, workflow for a biological circuit engineer may no longer be limited by the pace of fabrication but instead by their ability to analyze circuit behavior in the near future. Therefore, our team adopts a workflow for biological circuit design with multiple-inputs-single-output and given functions in Boolean value. By discipline borrowed from electrical engineering and the analysis of connecting logic gates, our software is able"
Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Notebook#InVitroAssay_-_-_TEXT.html," were extracted and simultaneously tested on brush border membrane vesicles obtained from T. molitor. 8 measurements were performed for both Cry3Aa and a blank. However, the obtained kf-values did not show a significant difference.
Expression of the protein was visualized with SDS-PAGE. Both supernatant and pellet of the protein extracts were run with SDS-PAGE. A picture of the gel can be found in Figure A4. The predicted size of the Cry protein with HIS-tag is 75 kDa. This band is not visible in the supernatant, but a small band around this size can be found in the pellet. An explanation for this is the formation of inclusion bodies around the Cry proteins, which is known to happen with the expression of Cry proteins in E. coli. The inclusion bodies can be solubilized in an alkaline solution 1 . For the carboxyfluorescein leakage experiments, only the supernatant data could be analysed,  because the pellet contained too much contaminants, such as lipids, to have a reliable measurement. The absence of a band probably explains that the concentration of Cry protein is too low to influence the carboxyfluorescein leakage measurement noticeably.
Figure A4. SDS-PAGE gel. M represents the marker lane. In lane 1 and 2 is the supernatant of the protein extract is visible and lane 3 and 4 represent the pellet. Lane 2 and 4 are the negative controls, whereas the protein extracts from lane 1 and 3 originate from transformant. The expected size of the Cry3Aa_TEV_HIs protein is 76 kDa.
From this can be concluded that the current method method that is used to extract the Cry proteins from E.coli is perhaps not the best method when testing Cry proteins on BBMVs. It is not expected that Cry3Aa proteins with mutations in their binding sites obtained by this method will result in accelerated fluorophore leakage within V. destructor BBMVs. If this happens nevertheless, this might be due to two reasons. Either there were other substances in the samples present that caused this, or a functional Cry toxin for V. destructor, with a higher efficacy than Cry3Aa on T. molitor, was present. To confirm this, the protein should first be produced in higher concentrations and preferably purified. The latter is possible due to the presence of a HIS-tag. The measurements then need to be repeated. For now, all results, both negative and positive, obtained with the Cry toxins produced by E. coli, are preliminary indications"
