Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," broader socio-economic, cultural, health and environmental implications not simply for their misuse in the hands of 'evildoers.'
We can end that reflexion about society and synthetic biology with something pointed by Kaushik Sunder Rajan in Biocapital (Rajan 2006). He analyzes how genomic companies are building ethical discourses, mostly focused on biosecurity concerns, as in the Report on Synthetic Biology Governance. Rajan shows, by quoting them, that ethical discourses pronounced by genomic companies seek legitimacy in slogans such as « saving life », « genomics for life », etc. Thus, companies are not only defending ethical statements and values in order to prove that they are responsible, they gradually become themselves “ethical entities”. The biosecurity problem allows discourses to be constructed about the “bad” and “malicious” , as opposed to them, the ethical company. To understand this, we refer to Michel Foucault’s concepts of “biopolitic” and “biopower” to consider how life can be used as a means to exert power and how power is now expressed on individual and collective life. In that light, bioterrorists use biological material to affect your life whereas genomic companies are at the service of your life, by defending and ameliorating it with individual biomedical consulting and by writing ethical reports. Life and its possible improvement through biotechnologies is now a fundamental concept in the constitution of a political and economical scene with huge stakes. The scale of genomic is now so precise that we are not talking anymore about life as an abstraction, a pure concept. Through genomic information, we are now talking about your individual life, as your life can be reached by bioterrorism, your life can be saved by genomic biomedical companies. Individualization is now biological through our genomic information. Our bodies, our health are now included in the individualism paradigm of our western societies, added to the political and economical individualism we are already used to.
C. Forms of critics
That brief presentation and reflexion about civil society proposal has to be deepened.
Indeed, the tone of such critics, although still legitimate to me, presents a quite simple image of what we call the “synthetic biologist”. Who is that scientist? Is every biologist like Craig Venter? Of course, the ETC Group is not so simplistic, some scientists are even very activist in such pro democratic science movements, but, I think we can use this conclusion to show how the youth of the discipline, already conceptually mentioned, is embodied in practices and scientists, and how because of new methods and ways,"
Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#SinceAmsterdam_-_-_TEXT.html," was also fluorescence  measurable in the flowthrough and wash fractions. This indicates that the used 1 mL HisTrap FF crude (GE Healthcare) was overloaded or the protein was bound only weakly to the affinity matrix. The resulting purity in the elution fraction, the saving of time and the easiness makes this procedure to the preferred purification method.
Figure 11: SDS-PAGE gel of a denaturating immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) of a SgsE fusion protein containing an N-terminal mCitrine and a C-terminal His-6-tag. A 1 mL HisTrap FF crude by GE Healthcare (Ni-NTA) was used for purification. The binding buffer contained 10 mM imidazole and the elution buffer (buffer B) 500 mM imidazole. The bound proteins were eluated by a stepwise increasing imidazole gradient (10 % buffer B per step). The SgsE fusion protein (111,2 kDa) was eluated in the 10 % buffer B fraction in a high purity.
Figure 12: Fluorescence in the fractions of a denaturating immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) of a SgsE fusion protein containing an N-terminal mCitrine and a C-terminal His-6-tag. A 1 mL HisTrap FF crude by GE Healthcare (Ni-NTA) was used for purification. The binding buffer contained 10 mM imidazole and the elution buffer (buffer B) 500 mM imidazole. The bound proteins were eluated by a stepwise rising imidazole gradient (10 % buffer B per step). The SgsE fusion protein (111,2 kDa) was eluated in the 10 % buffer B fraction in a high purity.
Because the method is so quick and easy now we developed a guide to do it yourself nanobiotechnology in which the method is presented in a vivid way.
Sometimes, the inclusion body purification does not give very clean fractions. Therefore, we developed another purification strategy for <partinfo>K525405</partinfo> monomers after inclusion body purification. This strategy consists of a capture with an IEX followed by a purification with HIC. Because of issues with the PES membranes we used to rebuffer our samples (see below - PES binds most of the S-layers) we lost a lot of our proteins in this step between the two chromatographies. So there was not enough protein left to colour it with Coomassie in an SDS-PAGE and time ran out to perform a silver"

For centuries, alchemists believed in the existence of the Philosopher’s Stone, a mysterious substance not only able to turn common metals into precious ones, such as silver and gold, but even capable of fulfilling mankind’s ultimate desires: rejuvenation and immortality.
Although the Philosopher’s Stone has never been found, the quest for it has pushed alchemists to test in their laboratories numerous substances and their interactions, building up a solid knowledge that can be found nowadays in the sciences of chemistry, metallurgy and pharmacology.
Living in the 21st century research-driven world, our belief in the Philosopher’s Stone has faded. Yet we are, now as ever, still on a quest, looking for solutions not only to help individuals live long and healthy, but also to solve the ecological problems we ourselves have created in the course of modernization. Contrary to the past, we now believe that we should not simply look for magical substances hidden somewhere in nature, rather we shall be inspired by it and create new tools for actively addressing the challenges of our society.
Let us take you on a journey where you will meet a new class of molecules that holds the potential to revolutionize synthetic biology: the non-ribosomal peptide synthetases. We will teach you how to unlock their enormous potential for generating entirely synthetic peptides with various, customized functions, such as recycling gold from electronic waste.
Take your chance!
Join our quest!

Hardware
iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!

The compression package is about 142 MB on the disk, and when the package is uncompressed, all the files are 415 MB on the disk
Then begins the setup process. Double click the file “setup.command”, and the terminal opens. The software automatically configure the environment needed to run CORE.
After about 4 minutes (depends on the Internet), the process successfully completed (if the connection to internet.
Then double click the file “runserver.command”, and after a few seconds, the process completed.
Then open Safari, and navigate to “localhost:8888”. Now comes the CORE. Run smoothly.
User Studies
As good practices in software engineering, user studies can help us do some research on how users interact with our project, to what extent has our software met the needs of users, and what can be improved to better meet the needs of users.
Due to limited time period for software development, we could only do user studies covering only a limited number of people. It is a great honor for us to invite Yu Zhou (team leader of 2015 NJU-China), Jiyong Ma (bioinformatics graduates in Ren’s lab), Jinyu Li (team member of 2013 and 2014 SYSU-Software, and now PhD at Yale University), and Haoquan Zhao (team member of 2013 SYSU-Software, and now Master at Harvard University) to help us find out the user experience of CORE.
Our user studies invited them to try out our software (with the help of the easy user guide or some guidance given by us). Then give some feedbacks on the three modules (i.e., CORE Bank, CORE Design, and Co-development) of CORE.
The reasons why we chose these four persons to do our user studies are: first, we should choose participants that can cover different background, say, wet-lab background, to ensure that we can study how CORE could meet the needs of individuals of different background, not only from wet-lab; second, time is limited and we can only do user studies of a limited number of people who are also familiar with us or at the nearby.

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportNaturalityArtificiality_-_-_TEXT.html,"ization and constitution of norms and standards of production and uses of the technology. That brief list, non exhaustive, of the objectives of the engineer's practical and methodological needs seems at work in synthetic biology. These aims are then transformed into ambitions, challenges when they try to apply themselves to the living world. Indeed, after even a rapid talk with laboratory operators, we can realize that the success or failure of a manipulation is quite unpredictable. Even deeper, it will be difficult to figure the nature of it : is it a human error? a failure or the occurrence of a “unhappy hazard” in a manipulation? That point underlines the importance of the steady tracking of the lab notebook. But, even the lab notebook only permits a retroactive reading of the experience and does not permit any prediction. Probable fallibility human handling, the variability of local manipulations (which are often hardly reproducible from one laboratory to another) or the “aleatory” characteristic of the development of the organism or colony in the manipulation process make the engineer's ambition very hard to succeed.
Thus, we have to call up artificiality and naturality, relating each of it to practices, in order to wonder about the making of the aims of the biological applications of engineering. Artificiality, devices will, in that perspective, understood through its controllable characteristic, able to be submitted to the abstract process of the engineer, when the living escape to that logic.
Of course, the fact that calibration, homogenization and grading of the living are now totally improved in the field of agronomic engineering can make us suppose that this challenge could overcome. But, taking into account the genomic scale and the bacterial level of challenge, technical, practical and methodological stakes are numerous.
Beside the question of practices we can find another element which leads us to the question of naturality and artificiality. That reflexion will take us along to our final part, by wondering about models of exchanges in synthetic biology.
The question of exchange will indirectly question the “nature” (or at least, qualify it) of the exchanged good and, that way, could be a good way to clear up the debate.
That question, already opened through debates regarding GMOs is now reconfigured in synthetic biology about animate beings. Intuitively, forms of property that we are used to about animate living are about individuals or groups of individuals. For example, we are proprietary of our dog, or of a herd, etc. That form of property is material and could be compared to land ownership.
At the contrary, the living are seen as “nobody's property”, good of their"

Bioswitch:
A basic bistable switch requires two inverters, and some way of making it change state.
Important papers on this concept in synthetic biology include:
""Construction of a genetic toggle switch in Escherichia coli"" Gardner, Cantor & Collins 2000 http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v403/n6767/pdf/403339a0.pdf
This paper was followed up with a second, ""Programmable cells: Interfacing natural and engineered gene networks"", 2004 http://www.pnas.org/content/101/22/8414.figures-only
The authors showed in 2000 that a genetic toggle switch was possible. They investigated using different promoters, and found only some combinations to give bistability.
Many iGEM teams have attempted to recreate a bistable switch; none have so far fully succeeded! The most recent were Peking 2007 and Bologna 2008.
Peking 2007 designed a bistable circuit as part of their ""push on, push off"" device. They connected together two mutual inhibitors, and showed that this gave an agar spread that had red in places and green in others. This suggests that they made a bistable device. However, they did not progress to activation by external sources.
Bologna's iGEM project in 2008 was a bistable circuit, called ""E.coli PROM"". They performed extensive modelling of the device, but did not complete fabrication.
This leaves an iGEM team with a good opportunity. Building on Peking and Bologna, amongst others, a working, and inducible bistable could be made, an iGEM first.
However, we decided that given the large amount of work which we need to do on pigments, and the fact that a non-functioning bistable would not be novel, we would not progress further with this idea.

IV Results
A. Self-killing test
1. Test of self-killing: Warrior I kills itself but warrior II doesn’t
    We compare the amount of warriors in medium containing A+K with the amount of warriors in medium containing C. If the amount is apparently lower in the medium containing C, the warrior must have killed itself.
    We find that the amount of warrior I is apparently lower in C group, which means that warrior I kills itself.
    The figure shows the result. The ratio represents the amount of warriors in C medium divided by in A+K medium.(group 4/group 1, group 5/group 2)

""I joined iGEM my sophomore year of college hoping to get more involved in lab work on campus. My freshman year I did not do too well in some of my classes and I had not joined many clubs on campus. I had been interested in working in a lab where I could interact with my fellow students and I was interested in many of the ideas from past iGEM projects. I joined to get more hands on experience in labs and to learn more about the field of biology. After joining the public relations committee I became more involved with outreach events and teaching students about synthetic biology. After the first month that I joined I realized that I was much more passionate about teaching and talking then I was about lab work. I am a now a senior in Biological Sciences with a minor in Chemistry and Psychology and the PR officer of iGEM. I could not have asked for a better experience in working with others and putting on outreach events. ""

The team's PR committee put on a program at TJ called ""Play With DNA."" It involved extracting DNA from bananas and seeing the chains it created. I had a vague idea of what synthetic biology was before that event, but I understood it a lot"

0. Important Questions beyond the Bench
 
Beyond the bench, our project contains a major question: how to make iGEMers and other students majoring in biology understand economics (see Understanding Economics for more detail). Our approach to this question, which was obtained from interaction with the general public, was development of educational tool for economics using E. coli.  We thank this interaction which strongly influenced our scientific-project planning. Evaluation of our educational tool from students majoring in biology clearly showed the usefulness of the tool (Fig 6-1-0-1). We think that our presentation supported with BioBrick parts and modeling can be easily adapted to not only iGEMers, but other students majoring in biology, who are great human resources of innovation.
Fig. 6-1-0-1. Effects of our presentation
 
Through activities beyond the bench, we also encountered other questions for safety, future, and image of synthetic biology. An example of such question is how we can solve the safety problem for distribution of our educational tool.  We consulted the biosafety expert, Mr. Tomoya Saito, who is working for National Institute of Public Health. He gave us a lecture on dual-use technology. After that, we asked him some questions about biosafety (Our questions about biosafety is below ).
 
1. Abstract
 
We aimed at letting a broad range of people know synthetic"
SCAU-China,2016,Team:SCAU-China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,". What's more, we are also analyzing coding products by HPLC and trying to make sure that there is no harmful products in our rice.
Rice was chosen as the chassis though it isn't included in the white line, but we checked-in with the official website in the beginning. Because we are the first team who choose rice as chassis, we have to assess the safety for rice.
Rice is the self-pollinated plant, the probability of crossing is just 1%, and the distance of the effective spread of rice pollen is hardly beyond 1 meter.
The phenomenon of pollen escape is the main way which leads to the flow of exogenous gene of transgene plants. Recently, the researches of transgene plants verified that the exogenous gene of transgene plants will flow to the same species or weeds and even the conventional species. As iGEMers, we took safety into consideration carefully so that we consulted plentiful papers, and then we found a conclusion that under the close distance less than 1% adjacent non-genetically modified plants would take place gene flow. If we increase the distance to 5~10 meters, the probabilities decrease to 0.001%~0.0001%, which means nearly no gene flow would happen in theory. When planting rice, we follow the safe regulations of transgenic plants strictly, to reduce the risk of gene flow.
8. Laws & regulations
The credibility of the policy about ""aSTARice"" transgenic rice project:
The Chinese government makes great effort to manage the safety of agricultural GMO, and has formed a set of laws which are suitable for Chinese domestic situation and consistent with international convention of laws and regulations, technical regulations and management system and has achieved remarkable results in accordance with the implementation of safety management.
(1) The legal system: the agricultural GMO safety management regulations, the measures for the administration of agricultural GMOs safety assessment, the safety measures for the administration of import of agricultural GMOs, the identification measures for the administration of GMOs, the agricultural genetically modified organisms processing measures for examination and approval, the inspection and quarantine measures for the administration of entry and exit of GMO products.
(2) The administrative management system: joint inter-ministerial meeting, agricultural genetically modified organisms safety management leading group, the provincial administrative department of agriculture, municipal (county) level administrative department of agriculture.
(3) Technical support system, safety evaluation, detection, monitoring and technical standards."

endo-1,4-beta-xylanase xynA from Bacillus Subtilis Subtilis 168
The endo-1,4-beta-xylanase gene xynA cleaves xylan polysaccharide chains to form shorter xylan chains. This gene has been isolated from the bacterium Bacillus subtilis subtilis 168.
Usage and Biology
Xylan is a molecule similar to cellulose, and after cellulose the most abundant biomass material on earth. It is a major structural component of plant cell walls. Furthermore, xylan crosslinks with cellulose and other cell wall components, inhibiting access of cellulases (1). Xylose is the sugar monomer of xylan as glucose is to cellulose. Xylose cannot be used in the human body as a source of energy. Endo-1,4-beta-xylanase (xynA) breaks the xylan chains into shorter chains, and may be stearically hindered by side chains (2).   A beta-xylanase such as Endo-1,4-beta xylanase may be used to degrade xylan to facilitate cellulase activity. Another use may be in conjunction with an exo-xylanase to efficiently break down xylan into xylose monomers (a pentose sugar).
Enzymatic Activity of Gene Product
As stated above, the function of the gene product is xylan degredation. The enzyme's catabolic activity results from endohydrolysis of 1,4-beta-D-xylosidic linkages in xylan molecules (4).

The NHEJ pathway for DNA repair is commonly disrupted in laboratory strains to improve the efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9 induced HR integration of heterologous DNA. However, an intact NHEJ pathway can be utilized to disrupt genes without the need for an DNA repair template, as this DNA repair pathway is intrinsically more error-prone than HR. Thus, in order to disrupt the native Y. lipolytica PEX10 gene, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid (pCRISPRyl) containing a protospacer that targets PEX10 in the PO1f strain. For the URA3 insertion, we co-transformed the same CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid and a linearized HR donor plasmid (pIW501) in the PO1fΔKu70 strain. An overview of our workflow is provided in Figure 9. Overviews of pCRISPRyl and pIW501 are provided in Figures 10 and 11, respectively.

Left: transformation of pCRISPRyl should result in gene disruption through error-prone repair by NHEJ (bases shown in yellow). Right: co-transformation of pCRISPRyl and a HR donor plasmid (pIW501) should result in integration of the desired donor gene (bases shown in orange). For plasmid map details, see Figures 10 and 11.

  About Rfal
Based on the literature, the natural formation of a colanic acid capsule naturally takes about 2-3 days. We hope that the upregulation of RcsB will shorten this time. Either way, we will be able to share more of our results with you at the Jamboree.
Acid Resistance Results:
To characterise colanic acid encapsulation, we assembled the following testing constructs:
BBa_K200025
Module 2: Encapsulation Testing Construct
BBa_K200029
Module 2: Encapsulation Testing Construct
Freeze Drying Theory:
Freeze drying is the process by which a material is preserved via dehydration at a very low temperature. Freeze drying our chassis would slow the decomposition of the polypeptide and prevent the growth of any contaminanting micro-organisms. Unfortunatly, freeze drying can seriously damage cell membranes and denature the internal polypeptides. To prevent this from occuring we have decided to upregulate the biosynthesis of the cryoprotectant trehalose. Trehalose is a disaccharide formed from two glucose molecules. Throughout nature, trehalose is associated with resistance to dessication and cold shock, and is naturally produced in E.coli. The genes OtsA and OtsB are required for trehalose production [6].
Module 2: Initiation
Freeze Drying Results:
To characterise the protective effect of trehalose against freeze drying, we assembled the following testing constructs:
BBa_K200017
Module 2: Trehalose Production Testing Construct
Conclusion:
We have selected E.coli as the most suitable chassis for encapsulation and carefully modulated endogenous pathways to result in the synthesis of a safe colanic acid capsule. In addition, we have designed a treahlose production system that will faciliate the storage of our final product for extended periods of time.

The importance of the environment for the subsistence of life on earth is unquestionable. The magnitude of its value is represented by the human right to a healthy environment, a prerogative that protects the environment as a fundamental legal right and expresses the relevance of this to have a dignified life. This human right constitutes a guarantee for the realization and validity of the rest, since human being are in an indissoluble relationship with its environment and nature1. For this reason, achieving sustainable development would ensure the quality of present and future life. In this sense, the dignity, autonomy, and sanctity of the person depend on the health of the planet, its resources, and species.
Food Security is a central topic in the global agenda. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that by the year 2050, world population will exceed 9,000 million, of which 150 million will dwell in Mexico. This should increase agricultural production by 60% in the country by that year 2.
Beekeeping is a fundamental activity to achieve Food Security in Mexico and the world, which is why authorities, researchers, farmers, beekeepers, and members are aware of the importance of bees. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says 100 crop species provide 90% of the food worldwide, and bees pollinate 71% of these3. It is for this reason, given by the engineer Manuel Ramirez Salcido, that bees have been presented as a parameter of environmental health, talking about ecology.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA) says that if bees disappear there would be a food crisis; 84% of cash crops
depend on their pollination.4 In the same way, SAGARPA states that multiple varieties of fruit trees depend on cross-pollination that uses animals as vectors, such as bees; that is to say that there is an enormous amount of zoophilic plants.
According to the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT), the links between the population, environment, and natural resources are mediated by multiple factors. The immediate environmental"

Figure 1. Representation of our bacteria powered light bulb consisting of light sensitive bioluminescent E. coli cells co-cultured with surcrose secreting Cyanobacteria (Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942)
The bulb will contain light-sensitive E. coli that detect levels of sunlight and regulate their bioluminescence, encoded by LuxCDABE, to only be active during night time. This is achieved through the incorporation of a photosensitive protein (EL222) and a blue-light repressible promoter (Pblrep) to regulate the bioluminescence of E. coli, in response to external sunlight levels. Additionally, engineered photosynthetic cyanobacteria, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, will produce and secrete sucrose using heterologous sucrose transporters  to feed our recombinant E. coli for their long-term survival.
Through mathematical modelling we developed the optimised dimensions of the light bulb for maximum bioluminescence (160 watts). Finally, we did a cost analysis for the production of our LIT Bulb and developed a financial plan for its implementation into the current framework of street lighting in London, considering the current EU policy.
All current electricity generating methods have a carbon footprint [1]. Almost half of our carbon footprint is due to electricity and 17% is due to lighting alone [2]. In the UK alone (2005), street lighting was using approximately 3.14 TWH of electricity giving rise to CO2 emissions of 1.32 megatons [3].
To produce 60 watts of light, a single incandenscent light bulb consumes 3000kWh of electricity over a period of 50,000 hours and produces 185kg of CO2 emissions in a year [4]. A single LED bulb uses 400kWh and produces 70kg of CO2 emissions yearly [4]. Our LIT Bulb will reduce this values to 34kWh usage and only 2kg of CO2 emissions yearly.
The above calculation was determined with the fact that one bioluminescent bacterium produces about 1000 to 10,000 (103 to 104) photons per second [5]. 1014 luminescent cells contained in our LIT Bulb would produce the light output of a 160-watt bulb (a 100-watt light bulb emits 1018 photons per second) [5]. Therefore the only electricity requirement to emit 160-watts is the"

BSc Chemical & Molecular Biology Graduate, Birkbeck, University of London
Luba recently completed a BSc in Chemical and Molecular Biology at Birkbeck, University of London. As part of her undergraduate degree, she undertook an experimental research project on directed evolution of XNA ligases and in parallel she also focused on the use of bioinformatics for enzyme engineering. Previously, Luba volunteered and was an intern at a biomedical chemistry lab, gaining experience in organic synthesis and analytical techniques. Her passion for science, synthetic biology and academic scholarship sparked the initiation of the first Birkbeck iGEM team.
Luba’s first degree was in law, yet her strong interest in science has led her to Birkbeck to study for a second degree, whilst taking up a support role at the Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development / Birkbeck BabyLab.

Effect of ACC deaminase engineered endophytes on plant growth in drought and high salinity conditions
An illustration of our engineered endophytes fighting drought and salt stresses in the roots of a model plant!
Due to impending climate change related variation in rainfall, increased drought and soil salinities are predicted to become serious problems that lead to reduced crop yields from osmotic stress. In environments with high salinity and dry soil, plants respond by producing more ethylene, which engages regulatory pathways leading to premature senescence. Beneficial microbial endophytes are thought to increase the stress tolerance of plants in part by modulating signals from the ethylene pathway. For example, endophytes inside the roots of plants are known to secrete the enzyme ACC deaminase (ACCD), which converts 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC), the precursor to ethylene, into α-ketobutyrate and ammonia. The degradation of ACC reduces the formation of ethylene, thereby delaying the onset of senescence.
We seek to import efficient ACCD genes into endophytic bacteria that lack this pathway. Optimized ACCD genes from bacteria and fungi will be inserted into endophytic bacteria taken from grass roots. Brachypodium distachyon, a model grass species, will be inoculated with these bacteria to compare growth to a control plant. Another focus is to identify as many transformable endophytes as possible. This will be done by collecting root samples of common grasses, harvesting bacteria, sequencing for identification, and screening for ACCD activity. ACCD genes from numerous sources will be either amplified from culture or synthesized, then assembled and inserted into endophytic grassroots bacteria. Then these bacteria will be tested on B. distachyon to show increased growth. If such engineered endophytes confer additional stress tolerance onto B. distachyon, this technique may be a useful approach to boost crop yields, especially in developing countries and other areas where irrigation practices are difficult. Engineering of endophytes provides a way to promote plant growth without actually engineering"
Missouri_Miners,2012,Team:Missouri Miners#Community_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM team won the Outstanding Student Leaders' Most Improved Organization award. This honor was presented to us by Missouri S&T's Corporate Development Council and Student Council. Our iGEM team was nominated based on the reasons presented below.
In the past iGEM's success had been limited by small membership, lack of funding, poor leadership, and lack of lab training that made it difficult for new members to get involved. However, with the hard work of a few students and the executive board elected in December 2010, iGEM began to flourish. Missouri S&T iGEM had gained status as a recognized student organization and applied to be a student design team (which was approved January 2012). We gained a lab space in Schrenk Hall. Membership increased by about 30% in 2011 alone, and non-officer members had become much more active, whereas before only a couple of officers did most of the work. iGEM had also raised about $1000 from fundraising efforts the spring semester alone, received corporate sponsorship, been approved for funding from S&T's Student Council, and been approved to receive funding from the professional projects fund in the future. The executive board had formed a spring class to teach new iGEM members lab techniques and develop quality research project proposals that were later presented at the 7th Annual Undergraduate Research Conference. Some iGEM members had also applied to do research through the Opportunities for Undergraduate Research Experience Fellows program about public opinion of synthetic biology and how education can affect that opinion. Missouri S&T iGEM had also recruited members studying majors other than biology and chemical engineering. We had scheduled a synthetic biology informational for April 13, set up an ethical discussion about synthetic biology through Speak UP Speak OUT, and spoken to the Rolla High School's Science Olympiad team about synthetic biology.
Recruitment
In-Class Informationals
Our iGEM team collaborated with faculty members in the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, and Psychology to give guest presentations in classes. These presentations covered the basics of what iGEM is all about. The main goal of these presentations was to recruit new members for our team, while at the same time educating whole audiences on reasons why synthetic biology is such a diverse and exciting field. We talked about how standard parts work and the breadth of applications of many different types of iGEM projects. We also gave a run-down on some of our team's past research and why being a part of our iGEM team is such a great experience, from late nights in the lab to having fun and learning at the"

Cellular components are destroyed! ……In the short, precise life cycle, cells just like a space ship waving in the universal but have their certain destination, It's normal for it to fix and replace the damaged components, but when the cells are given the task that its predecessors never had, which means there're no certain methods can be find to solve the problems. At that time, Csy4 can be helpful.

⑤Recognition: Some cells are nothing special but actually have the vitally important task. One day, Clark Kent walks down the street as usual, doesn't recognize the world waiting for him to save. He has no response to cosmic signals…… Csy4 can be helpful, let's change the signals that make it easy to understand. Well, it seems we did it.

1. Clotho Core
The ClothoCore object (#1) in Figure 6 maintains control over the hubs and (by implication) the connections in the system. The core is responsible for routing ClothoData objects to the correct hub . The core is also responsible for setting up initial connections in the system. The core has both a hub and connection addressing scheme. This system allows for the core to know both how to address a connection in a hub as well as where connections are without having to directly speak to the hub. This bypassing is useful if general system information needs to be queried or to perform common operations faster. For example, once a connection has been contacted by the core, it then can initiate a transaction back to the core in response to the sender of the data. The core can store the information about this link and therefore prevent redundant setup information to be repeatedly passed back in forth in the event that each connection wants to transfer more than one ClothoData object. This can occur as long as needed to finish the transaction. This is similar to direct memory access (DMA) transfers in computer architecture.
Because of the modular way in which Clotho has been designed, a developer wishing to use Clotho need only create a connection derived from one of the 4 basic types of connections. Once the connection has been defined, it need only be instantiated in the Clotho main file and then call the required activate method. The ClothoCore takes care of the rest. Activation of a connection associates it with the core, a specific hub, provides it a global and hub address, and runs any needed start up routines. The core is used to not only activate connections but it can also run regular start up operations, load preference data on start up, and save preference data to various files in the Clotho system.
For more detailed insight into the core's operation you can check out the java doc here .

To put it in detail, we centrifuged 5 mL bacterium solution under overnight shake culture at 4°C, 6000 rpm for 10 minutes, which was boiled for 10 minutes, then with protein loading buffer added. Afterwards we ran SDS-PAGE of the mixture with the running gel concentration 12%.
Fig. 2 SDS-PAGE of whole-cell protein
As the whole cell layer was too stick, we couldn’t make an accurate estimation from the result, but anyway there was no sign of expression of the objective proteins whose molecular weight were about 46 kDa. Then we tried normal SDS-PAGE of the homogenate and supernatant and the result came out as Fig.3 has shown.

The bands this time were clearer to see, whereas still there was no significant difference between the empty vector plasmid and the transformed ones.
After two times of unsuccessful attempts, we searched the internet and reviewed some literatures of a reliable protocol for membrane extraction and detection. With the protocols collected we processed the experiment the third time.

Bacteria transformed with plasmid pSB1C3 as a negative control.
From this result we can conclude that there are some differences between the bands of controlled plasmid and the experimental ones, whereas it seems these differences have nothing to do with our objective product. So it came out that we failed another time.

Therefore,    the domain, expands between 20th – 160th amino acid, was selected from    natural HB-EGF protein. On the other hand, the Tar domain that are    functions to establish intracellular chemotactic signalling includes    NdeI cutting-site (around 257th amino acid) until the utmost C-terminal    of the protein (the 553rd amino acid).8-11 By those factors, our team also    selected Tar domains involving the 1st – 33rd and 191st –    553rd amino acid as part of chimeric protein.
Figure 1. The selected segment of Tar protein. The functional    intracellular domain of Tar is shown as yellow box, blue box is    transmembrane domain and orange box is periplasmic domain. Selected Tar    domain expands from 1st -33rd amino acids and 191st -553rd amino acids.    Modification of binding domain is located between 33rd – 191st amino acids
Our team have predicted the HB-EGF/Tar protein orientation in the Escherichia coli membrane. For this purpose, server TMHMM and OPM Membrane,    are utilized to predict protein orientation.12,13 Conceptual hypothesis    about the chimera protein is that it should begin its orientation of    C-terminus in cytoplasm, then continued to fold into transmembrane and    extracellular sites, as well as re-folding towards cytoplasm.
Figure 2. The graph above explains the result of HB-EGF/Tar    orientation, which began from C-terminus (left) to N-terminus (right).12 Y-axis pictured the possibility of nth amino acid on protein located somewhere    between transmembrane (red part), intracellular (blue line), and    extracellular (pink line). There is also a diagram located above the graph    that represent the most possible location of each domain (with elongated box).
From the results, it could be concluded that the protein was oriented    as expected in the hypothesis. Therefore, the usage of chimera protein is    predicted to be functional anatomically.

Multiple Start Codons
A frustrating yet commonly observed phenomenon in the lab is the production of unexpected proteins. These occurrences may be explainable by multiple start codons in the mRNA strand. Codon slippage is a theory practically untouched by research, and this project aspires to shed some light on the issue.
Multiple Start Codons
Sample navigation menu:
Overview | Design | Results
Background
mRNA is the molecule that carries information about the sequence of amino acids in a protein. However, much like the lines on a sheet of paper, the protein coding sequence of an mRNA molecule does not start right at the beginning, or top of the page. Instead, once the mRNA is bound by a ribosome, a start codon must first be read before the protein can be translated. This start codon is generally AUG, or Methionine.
The Problem
Once this start codon in read the ribosome will continue reading and building the polypeptide (protein) until a stop codon is reached. But what happens if you have two AUG codons close together? That is the question we are attempting to answer.
We are trying to understand what happens when there are two start codons very close together, but out of frame. Out of frame refers to how the ribosome reads the mRNA. Remember those codons and how they are groups of three bases on the mRNA? The reading frame refers to which group of three. If you start at one base and read the bases in groups of three from that point on, that is one frame of reference. If you then move your start point ahead one base, then you are reading in a new reading frame. If you advance you starting point one more base, that is the third reading frame. If you advance it again you are now back in your first reading frame, but you have skipped the first codon. We are looking into what happens when you have multiple start codons close together, but in different reading frames. Which frame will be preferred?

What is a genome-scale metabolic model?
A genome-scale metabolic model (GSM)  is a network reconstruction of all known metabolic reactions in an organism and the genes that encode each associated enzyme.1 Through the construction of these networks, we can assess the metabolic capabilities of an organism as well as its potential to produce biologically useful metabolites.
What are the components of a genome-scale model
Gene-Protein-Reaction (GPR) relationships
Set of known metabolic reactions represented in a stoichiometric matrix. Identifies stoichiometric coefficients and directionality associated with each reaction.
Scaled biomass equation. Assumes flux through the biomass equation is equal to the exponential growth rate of the organism. This is made from experimental measurements of biomass components.
You can download our GSM, adapted from a published model of E. coli strain DH10B (Monk et al) [2] , of nitrogen-fixing E. coli (strain WM1788) here .
What is flux balance analysis?
Flux balance analysis, or FBA, is the method by which we determine the flow of metabolites, or flux, through the constructed metabolic network of a GSM1. FBA allows us to predict growth rates of an organism under certain media conditions, along with the production levels of targeted metabolites, such as ATP.

Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant"
TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Results#Moss_-_-_TEXT.html,"rella patens on solid materials
For implementation of the PhyscoFilter it is elementary to know about the mosses growth behavior on different surfaces. We therefore tried 5 different materials and came to the conclusion that the moss grows very well on all of them, but especially felt material would suit our plans for implementing the filter system in form of a remediation raft since the moss can easily cling to the fibers, which are also dense enough to prevent the moss from being washed away. Also the spongy properties of felt make it an ideal surface for the plant as it ensures a constant supply of water. The second best material is probably agar or metal grid on agar, but this has the disadvantage of being washed away gradually.
Determination of growth rates for different liquid culture forms
In parallel to the determination of growth conditions for solid materials we examined different growth conditions in liquid culture, too. In general the handling of liquid cultures of moss is more easy than the one of those growing on solid media as the moss can be disrupted mechanically with an Ultra-Turrax. That way homogenized cultures can be achieved very comfortably. Moreover the growth of moss in liquid suspension cultures provides an improved and constant nourishment of cells without any nutrition gradients and continuously pH adjusted. Even if the up scaling process up to volumes of around 20 L in standard stirred tank bioreactors is more convenient at a first glance, the further up scaling process is often limited by an insufficient light input resulting in suboptimal growth rates. This is physically determined as the volume increases in the third potency whereas the surface only increases in the second potency. Therefore larger suspension volumes require different and often technically more challenging bioreactor forms as tube reactors, plate or wave reactors.
In our approaches we tested mainly the influence of mixing and coupled to this of aeration on the growth of moss. For this purpose 500 mL flasks containing 250 mL Knob media were inoculated with 50 mL moss suspension which had been disrupted 24 h ago (corresponding a moss concentration of 80 mg dry mass per liter). In triplicates the growth conditions in standing, shaken and aerated flasks were determined for 9 days at room temperature and a normal dark/light rhythm (8/16h).

To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

Our project retold the nightingale and the rose [1]using the tool of synthetic biology. In the story, the nightingale song all night under the cold moonlight, stained and scented the flower by its blood. We picked out four elements—sound, light, color and odor from the original story and combined them together. In our project,  E. coli needed light and sound as inputs to produce color and odor as outputs. The process was mainly divided into three parts: sound to light, light to color, and light to odor. The light-color and light-odor conversions were achieved with the RGB system[2] which was based on the phage RNAP system as a resource allocator. As for the sound-light conversion, we developed a software that allowed users to upload their own music to generate their unique dynamic pictures, with which people could color and ‘ensoul’ their own roses.
The improve of ‘the E. coli Pen’:
In 2010, team KIT-Kyoto invented an ‘E.coli Pen’ which used genetically modified E.coli and the medium as ink, as a new art tool to draw pictures[3]. (More information about team KIT-Kyoto, please see KIT-Kyoto 2010 ).
.
Our project mainly improved the project in three aspects:
First, we improved the input into a more convenient and harmless one. Although it was said in the project that the concentrations of Hydrogen peroxide in the ink could be controlled, the carcinogenicity of Hydrogen peroxide still remained uncertain because Hydrogen peroxide was classified as Class "
Paris_Bettencourt,2011,Team:Paris Bettencourt#HumanPractice#wikiAnalysis_-_-_TEXT.html," just extending the Synthetic Biology principles already exposed by Jimmy Huan of the 2008 UCSF team but applying them to the whole Living and all genomes. This open source approach in essence makes a common database of genes accessible to all researchers worldwide.
Noteworthy: I am not condemning patenting, it is a perfect way to reward an inventor (a finder more like in the context of biotechnology) for its ingenuity and hard work. However, it must not impinge on further research so, in a way similar to the BioBrick legal situation, all DNA must be open-sourced even though a particular application may be patented. In my opinion, this would be putting into practice one of the ideals of synthetic biology.
A possible solution that I foresee is to be able to patent only the final product of the genetic circuit may it be a function, a medicinal molecule etc. if and only if it has the previous requirements of general patentability.
Pragmatic approach needed
Not even considering religious issues, how can one really claim to make someting new if it is just “discovering” something that existed? The term discovering is used sarcastically since on a conceptual level even if one made a modified antibiotic or whatever he still started with the existing genetic sequence and worked in such a way that one induced a conformational change in a protein that so happened to be beneficial. This point is very debatable but nonetheless patents are useful to get the credit for one's research and efforts. Taking an example of the possible absurdity of the application of patents and the distribution thereof is given by the European Office of Patents 3 : there exist a practice that consists of collecting, characterizing and then use exotic plants to create novel drugs even though the properties of it were known for centuries. Bio-piracy 6, as it is called, aims at patenting genes that have an obvious function but have not yet been characterized and hence are patentable. This practice is unacceptable because the population that were cultivating it might just have to pay the pharmaceutical firm to get the exact same product. I believe that once again if genes were removed out of exclusivity then no problems would arise. The said firm would have to use fair techniques to compete against the local production: such as proposing cheaper drugs. In the envisaged solution (final product only equals possible patentability) only the final molecules would be patented under this conditional name: molecules ""X, Y"" coming from a ""W"" enhanced genetic circuit in microorganism ""Z"". Under this condition, no genes could be patented, the plant genome's or the respective sequenced part"
Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Decarboxylation_-_-_TEXT.html," gas chromatography of the eight tubes created last week, and unfortunately no hydrocarbons had been produced in any of them. It was thus very important for us to spend time researching why this was unsuccessful. We have found a number of things to consider. Firstly, the Washington iGEM team (creator of the PetroBrick has worked on system optimization , and has come up with an number of ways to increase alkane production. Information regarding this can be found here: https://2011.igem.org/Team:Washington/Alkanes/Future/Vector. There are many other considerations as well. We have received feedback on our sequencing results, and have been told that 87% is not high enough; we should be obtaining results of 100%. This is a problem because it presents the possibility that there is a mutation somewhere in our PetroBrick that is preventing effective operation. We may need to design inner primers to sequence the entire PetroBrick , as it is 2392bp and this may have prevented 100% sequencing results. We have also been using plastic falcon tubes, while hydrocarbon production has been tested in glass tubes. Incubation time and initial amount of cells to be innoculated are also concerns, as we have been having many problems with cell growth. The Washington Team often had an OD600 of 10 in their production media, whereas we have been tracking the OD of our initial broth only, so it is possible that the OD600 of our broth has been very low. As demonstrated by iGEM Washington, the OD600 is of utmost importance when it comes to hydrocarbon production, and is something critical that we need to improve. We are also considering extracting alkanes from our cells using HCl rather than ethyl acetate, as we many not be removing hydrocarbons effectively from the cells. We will consider each of these things when we attempt hydrocarbon production again.
Week 9 (June 25 - June 29)
The week began initially with planning for continued attempts to produce hydrocarbons (Based on information that was learned using the University of Washington's "" system optimization "" techniques. We also backtracked to determine any additional sources of error within our procedures for the production media protocol. During the week, the sequencing results were examined in further detail, and it was determined that the entire gene sequence for aldehyde decarbonylase ( ADC ) was missing. This explained why our sequencing results for the PetroBrick yielded only 87% complementarity. Based on this, there were two possible justifications for only having the acyl-acp"

Human Practices
This year Team MIT decided to follow the AREA guidelines to make sure that the project idea was not only scientifically     possible but also socially, economically, politically, and commercially viable. The AREA guidelines walk a research team     through the four basic steps of responsive science:
1) Anticipate
2) Reflect
3) Engage
4) Act
In order to Anticipate and Reflect, Team MIT carried out several social analyses (i.e. Stakeholder/Value Matrix & a SWOT analysis)     during the research design phase. This helped the team assess how we should channel our effort, time, and resources towards something     that would be impactful, not just in our lab, but also beyond it. We then spent a significant amount of time mitigating weak points the     SWOT test pinpointed as well as brainstorming approaches to external threats the project may encounter.
Additionally, the Stakeholder/Value Matrix provided insight on who will be affected by the project. By organizing meetings with the     identified stakeholders to hear concerns about the technology (specifically related to the the practicality of our project), the team     was able to modify these values based on real input. The final version of the matrix represents the project's positive and negative     impacts on various communities.
Our next step was to Engage with these identified stakeholders and Act on the feedback provided to us on our project. Team MIT had some interesting dialogues that helped to reflect on and shape the experimental design in order to be more responsible as well as practical. Read more about these conversations below!
Conversations with the Synthetic Biology Community
Ross Jones, Graduate Student, MIT Synthetic Biology Center
Early June the team met with him to ask about preliminary DNA design for comE, comD, and comE driving promoters.             Ross described a promoter he had engineered for the Envz/OpR system at the first meeting and explained in detail             how each component works together. This helped Team MIT better understand how to engineer a new comE inducible             promoter with comE binding sites and a cytomegalovirus (CMV) minimal promoter.
Ross also explained ways to promote activation upon ComE binding, how to create a constitutively active ComE,             the structural differences between activation domains VP16 and VP64, and showed us an example design for linking             a protein with an activating domain"
Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," that can be fused to you protein of interest C-terminally as well as N-terminal. This allows you to add proteins to the compartment that never been introduced to the peroxisomal membrane before.
Experimental Work/Design
In order to test our hypothesis we fused the last 59 amino acids of the C-terminus of human PEX26 (AA 246-305) to a red fluorescent protein, to further elucidate the Pex3 /Pex19-dependent import. mRuby is generally used as a marker in combination with a fluorescent microscope to visualize the localization of the fusion protein. The C-terminus of PEX26 contains a helical signal-anchor, which serves as both, a mPTS and transmembrane domain. We designed our construct with mRuby2 fused to the N-terminal side of the PEX26 -C-terminus, this way the mRuby should face the cytosolic side of the peroxisomal membrane.    Quite similar to our mRuby- PEX26 approach, we designed a construct for the ER-dependent import. Therefore, we fused the mRuby2 fluorescent protein to the N-terminus of Pex3 (AA 1-39). This construct should be N-terminally anchored in the peroxisomal membrane, with mRuby2 again facing the cellular lumen.
Our main goal is to introduce a rather complex membrane protein to the peroxisome that can alter specific traits. For that we fused the Pex3 N-terminus (AA 1-39) to a Halobacterium salinarum bacteriorhodopsin protein (AA 16-262), replacing the first 16 amino acids ( Pex3 -BacR). The original archaeal bacteriorhodopsin acts as a proton pump by capturing light energy to move protons across the membrane out of the cell. The resulting proton gradient is subsequently converted into chemical energy.  Our assumption is that the first transmembrane segment determines the orientation of the following protein and that therefore due to the N-terminal anchoring signal the bacteriorhodopsin will be inserted in reverse orientation, pumping the protons into the peroxisome. This way the pH of the peroxisomal lumen could actively be controlled and adjusted.
Finally, our project involved combining the work of other subteams to verify the localization of our constructs in the peroxisome and analyze the effects they have on the import. Therefore, we are using the superfolded-GFP protein, another fluorescent marker, which is in our case fused to"

Modeling
We developed several models to help design our biosensor to maximize output variation (i.e. the difference between a person with cancer and a healthy person) and to maximize the overall output so the fluorescence can be detected more easily with cheaper equipment, which would drive down net cost of using our sensor in a medical setting.
These include:
NUPACK modeling : Used NUPACK to model the secondary structures of the toehold switches in their closed and open states to maximize dynamic range.
Mass action kinetics modeling : Built a mass action kinetics model to identify the most important parameters to optimize in our design. We ported this model to JavaScript to make it easier for our design team to use and to explain the model to others.
Stochastic modeling : We collaborated with Oxford to validated our mass action kinetics model, by stochastic modeling of the uncertainties of the parameters.
We also built a cost model to provide insight into using our device as a mass-screening tool, which we tied into our human practices work.
NUPACK model
NUPACK is a software tool that can model the secondary structures of RNA systems. [1] We used NUPACK to optimize the design of our toehold switches.
We ran our simulations at 37°C, with 100 picomolar of miRNA, 20 nanomolar of DNA and 500 picomolar of anti-miRNA. We chose this temperature as it is the optimum for E. coli derived enzymes.
Using NUPACK, we"

These four parts are artificially designed RNA strands that function as the silencing tool for BCL2 gene’s expression through base-pairing with corresponding mRNAs. BCL2 protein is anti-apoptotic, mainly located in the cytoplasm side of the nuclear membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum and the outer membrane of mitochondria. By muting BCL2 gene’s expression, we can induce more cells’ apoptosis theoretically. We design four sequences and have a DNA synthesis company produce plasmids with codes inserted for each of them.
SYSU-Software Team
As we showed our concern to people’s attitude towards obesity, the SYSU-Software helped us record emoji netizens would use when netizens talk about weight-related topics through web-crawling. Their work provided us with interesting data about netizens’ true reaction to weight-loss and enabled us to cater to ordinaries’ need.
CPU_China
CPU_China were very willing to help us, and they designed two other BCL2 siRNA (si-RNA 3 and 4 ) after we designed two.
We helped the CPU_CHINA team to detect the expression level of Myc-CAR-CD20 and IL-17RA-SynNotch with Western blot. Flag-FOXP3-Jurkat cells expressed the proteins after transfection by electroporation. The result was shown in the figure. We also provided them with human IL-17RA antibodies as one of our collaborations.
our siRNA ( 1&2 is designed by us and 3&4 is designed by them)
NUDT_China
NUDT_China helped us to perform nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) to have a more precise determination of the quantity and size of secreted exosomes. They did a supereminent experiment for us and we collected the perfect data we long for.
We constructed a dual-luciferase miRNA target expression plasmid and performed a dual luciferase assay, to help NUDT_CHINA evaluating the microRNA (miRNA) binding ability of miRNA binding sequences.

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#testtest_-_-_TEXT.html," and antimicrobial proteins towards the treatment of UTIs.
Future
To develop our project beyond a proof-of-concept design, we would adopt a more suitable chassis, such as Lactococcus lactis. L. lactis has been widely used as a expression host for the production of proteins in both the medical and food industries. Being a Gram-positive species of bacteria, it is less likely to be killed by the same mechanisms as major Gram-negative pathogens such as E. coli and P. aeruginosa (e.g. Art-175's peptidoglycan lysis ability is specific for Gram-negative bacteria). On top of that, being Gram-positive means that it will not pose the problems of endotoxicity brought about by the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. Using E. coli as our host was purely a starting point, in view of its ease-of-use as well as availability of pre-existing resources.
In addition to secreting antibiofilm/antimicrobial proteins, a comprehensive treatment for UTIs would be a bacteria engineered to also sense and move towards biofilms. We conducted extensive literature review on this in the early stages of the project but, due to the time restraints of a summer project, could not put our ideas into practice. With further work, we would incorporate both a sensing and chemotaxis mechanism into our design.
Nurses, doctors and professors all raised to us the issue of targeting the multiple bacterial and fungal species that are involved in UTIs, highlighting the fact that the problem extends further than E. coli and P. aeruginosa. We have explored how we would approach this in the Practices page.
Beyond the scientific issues of implementation, thinking seriously about the questions of ethics and public acceptance is also crucial for the further development of synbio-based medical therapies especially in view of the fact that it is currently illegal to even bring genetically-modified organisms outside of the laboratory environment. We have explored this theme also in the Practices page.

UFAM_Brazil,2014,Team:UFAM Brazil#Brazil_-_-_TEXT.html,"In Brazil there is a great importance of public support for the biotechnology industry: BrBiotec according to a study (2011), 78% of the surveyed firms receiving some sort of federal or state support, as shown in the table below. On the other hand, 14.3% of these companies finance projects with the support of firms or venture capital funds, according to data from CEBRAP (Brazilian Center for Analysis and Planning). Although this is a much smaller percentage than the companies that received public capital and it is not possible to know if they are the same companies, it is a relatively high percentage for the Brazilian context and the development of its capital market to enterprises of this type.
According to data from CEBRAP, 56% of businesses are small, with annual revenues of up to $ 140 000; 20.6% of Brazilian companies in the industry have no profit, since their products are still under development and research.  Currently, FINEP is a leading provider of research grants to biotech companies. BNDES provides a significant amount of funds for research, manufacturing and innovation in biomedical and biopharmaceutical. This entity provides direct financing, loans and seed capital. In 2013, BNDES has also announced the funding of a specific part of the branch of biotechnology, PROFARMA , biotechnology dedicated to the advancement of health and capability of the national R & D.
REGULATIONS FOR SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
The regulation is not the same for all industries and biotechnology sectors. Biofuel manufacturers do not face the same challenges of R & D, as well, are not within the same rules as companies seeds.As the biotech industry in Brazil is mainly regulated by ANVISA and by CTNBio. ANVISA is responsible for regulation of biologics and biosimilars (input was introduced in 2010/11) (T Kirchlechner, 2013). CTNBio is responsible for the regulation of all activities (including research and marketing) of GM technologies or products and biotechnological (CTNBIO, 2014).
More recently, in 2003, biotechnology was identified as a national strategic priority, which culminated in 2007 in Decree No. 6041 (Biotechnology Development Policy). This decree focuses on building the international competitiveness of Brazilian biotechnology and contains policies relating to direct support to R & D, construction of infrastructure for R & D, training and human capital development, and the improvement of other existing regulatory frameworks policies (Pugatch Consilium, "

Initial Ideas
When we started thinking about how to turn our project into a product that could be readily used by the beef industry we wanted something that was portable and easy to use. Initial discussions with industry also pointed out that speed was important, as if it took 24 hours to get the result then the infected cow would have already been processed. To get inspiration we went for a walk around our local pharmacy to see what kind of sensors we could buy and explore. As we were walking through the aisles we saw digital and colour change thermometers, pressure based heart rate monitors, blood glucose meters, and pregnancy tests. While the idea of having a digital output was initially interesting to us, we soon realized that the home pregnancy test was one of the easiest and well known sensors with an output that can be understood by anyone. Another bonus was that the designs have already been optimized to use biological molecules as the recognition elements, just like we were planning to do.
With that in mind we sent two of our male advisors (Robert & Iain) to pick out their favourite pregnancy tests. The fruits of their labour can be seen below in Figure 1 (they even got two different kinds!).
Playing with Pregnancy Tests
After some very strange looks from our professors, we wanted to disassemble the tests we bought to see what made them tick. Before risking the integrity of the device though, our male prototypers wanted to watch it work, and thankfully the cup of water we dipped it in (no, we didn't get guys to pee on it) was not pregnant. With our curiosity sated we began pulling it apart. The components can be seen below in Figure 2

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"oya Protocol entered into force on October 14th 2014.3
One of the issues discussed in the Nagoya Protocol is the genome of a particular species may now be sequenced within a provider country and that information may be transferred digitally to a company or research entity for downloading to a DNA synthesizer.2 Another significant issue discussed in the COP is if synthetic biology is different enough from modern biotechnology that it must require a different protocol and a different risk assessment, the GMOs of modern biotechnology.
The Parties to the CBD considered regulation of synthetic biology during their 12th COP meeting in October 2014. There, they agreed to take a precautionary approach to the release of any LMOs resulting from synthetic biology under the Cartagena Protocol. At the same time, the Parties called for the formation of an Ad Hoc Technical Expert Group on Synthetic Biology (AHTEG) to evaluate, among other things, whether existing arrangements constituted a comprehensive regulatory framework for addressing potential impacts from synthetic biology technologies.3
Article 15 of the Cartagena Protocol establishes that to do genetic engineering to develop or liberate a GMO, a risk assessment must be done first. The AHTEG was created to develop a risk assessment guide which was created about 8 years ago. Members from different countries that assisted to the COPs were invited to participate in this group and a risk assessment guide was started within the Cartagena protocol.
Dr. María Mercedes Roca is a professor of Biotechnology, formerly at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Guadalajara campus in Mexico. She was one of the founding members of the National Biotechnology and Biosafety Committee of Honduras (CNBB for its Spanish acronym) which reviews submission for risk assessment of GMOs and advice the Honduran Government.
We were able to contact with Dr. Mercedes Roca thanks to Saúl Fernando Pizarro, a schoolmate and friend of ours who has participated in iGEM as a team member (2015), team leader (2016), and Co-chair of the Latin American Committee (2016). Dr. Mercedes is part of a group of Latin Americans unsatisfied with the rigorous risk assessment guide the AHTEG developed. Aware that in Latin America a risk assessment is needed and by taking into account the principles of biosafety in a very responsible way, this group made a guide under international confinements of risk assessment that people can follow and that countries can address, the guide is named Genetically Modified Organisms Environmental Risk Assessment Guide.

Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," senior scientist at New England Biosciences (NEB), to discuss potential applications within the field of large scale protein production. At NEB, batches of protein are synthesized by E. coli that mass produce proteins. Although antibiotics are used to select for bacteria that have the plasmid containing the desired protein, due to bacterial recombination it is common for strains to arise that lose the protein sequence without losing antibiotic resistance. Our system could be used to protect against this loss by using Cerberus to target the specific protein DNA and initiate transcription of resistance to an additional selection agent.
PROTEIN
For our protein test case we chose to detect human IL1B, a protein expressed in response to illness and fever. We selected IL1B because it is an important human immunoprotein with multiple well-characterized antibodies. We fused two single chain antibodies targeting different IL1B epitopes ( BBa_K2876015 and BBa_K2876011 ) to the lambda repressor and alpha subunit of RNA-polymerase III ( BBa_BBa_K2876002 )described in Dove, Joung, and Hochschild in order to create two fusion proteins capable of activating transcription in the presence of IL1B (Figure 7). For our reporter we used the previously described pOL2-62 from Dove, Joung, and Hochschild fused to a RFP ( BBa_K2876000 ). See more information about our reporter below.
We validated our IL1B with an ELISA which proved production of IL1B, and that the IL1B produced was folded properly so that antibodies could bind. Validation of antibody binding was essential to ensure that IL1B could function as the target protein in our Single-Chain Antibody Prokaryotic Two Hybrid Detection System (Figure 7).

Protein was extracted using a B-PER protocol. We used the negative control to calculate a null hypothesis for the log of absorbance when there is no protein. H0 Absorbance = Log(0.082) = -1.086. We then did a right-tailed hypothesis test to see if our values of Human Interleukin-1 Beta were statistically significant. The z-score was "

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into"

""If you have an apple and I have an apple, and we exchange apples, we both still only have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea, and we exchange ideas, we each now have two ideas.""
This year, we had the honor of collaborating with six other iGEM teams to work together, sharing our ideas from different corners of the world to push forward each other’s project goals.
Mingdao iGEM team
Mingdao iGEM team and our team have had close collaborations because both of us are from Taichung City in Taiwan. In the beginning, we got to know their project design and problems with Salmonella in a meetup. We advised them to clone the synthetic gene expression vector carrying glucose transporter gene from the bacteria and then assemble with the promoter.
Furthermore, we helped them contact a lab PI, Dr. Cheng-Yang Huang, in Chung Shan Medical University who has handled the bacteria before, and then used primers designed by Mingdao to amplify the gene fragments by PCR. Salmonella is well known as a Biosafety Level 2 organism, so Mingdao could avoid the safety issue of Salmonella through the collaboration.
On the other hand, we really appreciate Mingdao iGEM team’s help and advice when we received synthetic DNA from IDT. Since it is our team’s first time participating in iGEM, we were not much familiar with Biobrick and subcloning BioBrick parts. Luckily, Dr. Phil Chen, the instructor of Mingdao igem team, and his students have actually completed in total at least 28 BioBrick parts this year. They did us a favor by subcloning BioBrick parts and shared valuable experience in"

NYMU-Taipei,2011,Team:NYMU-Taipei#immunological-solution_-_-_TEXT.html," have been wildly studied and suggested as a vehicle for drug delivery system, and it seems that this biocompatible, biodegradable lipid bilayer is our good choice. Still, being restricted to the short life time and the cost, we chose not to continue on the path.
The ideas above hold both advantages and drawbacks. After careful consideration, we have decided to utilize the system the Warsaw 2010 iGEM team project developed – BactoDHL, an invasive delivery system based on the expression of minC, Inv, and LLO. We redesigned and modified this system to be compatible with AMB-1 and in vitro symbiosis within glial cell.
Delivering bacteria into human body may seem insane. But knowing that the total number of microbes that colonize the surface of our bodies is ten times greater than the total number of human, cell makes the whole thing less horrifying. The largest collection of symbiotic microbes reside in our gut, harbors trillions of bacteria, representing hundreds of species. However, scientists have not yet found any symbiotic bacteria residing in the human brain that does not cause infections. This year, the NYMU-Taipei team is thinking about enabling our magnetotactic bacteria being engulfed by a human glial cell in advance before being injected in to human brain.
Our Two Constructs
(1) MinC Construct
In E. coli, the min system cooperates with the nucleoid to direct the placement of the division septum to midcell. MinC( BBa_K624033 ), the division inhibitor, is one of the gene products of the min system. Studies show that minC interacts directly with FtsZ and antagonizes FtsZ assembly. While overexpression of minC would lead to septation inhibition at all potential division sites, a circumstance of filamentation.
In our experiments, We have cloned the minC gene from E. coli K-12 strain MG1655 by performing PCR, with a single nucleotide synonymous mutation to eliminate the PstI enzyme cutting site.
The expression of MinC is regulated by tetracycline-regulated system, which has been entirely researched and applied on AMB-1.The original design of a tetracycline-regulated gene expression system is based on two plasmids, one of which constitutively expresses a tetracycline-controlled transactivator protein (tTA), a fusion protein between the tetracycline repressor of E. coli and the transcriptional activation domain of the VP16 protein of herpes simplex virus. The second plasmid contains the gene to be regulated by tTA under"

While we are attempting to fight antibiotic resistance with our novel diagnostic test, we acknowledge the fact that our test only works at a protein level. As the central dogma of molecular biology dictates, protein is the last instance in the information flow in a cell. The problem of resistance genes could of course also reside on a genetic level, upstream of actual enzymes. This is important, as a bacteria may very well have resistance genes without expressing them at a certain time. The expression could even be turned on by the presence of antibiotics, which makes it important to not distribute antibiotics when such genes are present. All of these things points to a need for a diagnostic tool that not only detects enzymatic activity, but also the genes leading to said enzymatic activity. Such a tool would enable us to test for resistant microbes before they actually express their resistance. Further, earlier detection would lower the probability of spreading of the resistant bacteria, potentially protecting a lot of people from painful, dangerous infections.
This reasoning led us to CRISPR/Cas9. Cas9 is useful in this matter because of its ability to recognize specific nucleotide sequences. By now, it is known that by redesigning gRNA/tracrRNA/crRNA, one can design Cas9-system"

Remote Microfluidics brainstorming
some info on microfluidics and on our microfluidic online game idea...
Hardware stuff we need:
a USB I/O for driving 24 Volt solenoids (DIY or from national instruments)
a cheap microscope/camera system: see link
a cheapo PC
a microfluidic device (we might have some simple ones already that we could play with)
Software things to figure out:
remote control of solenoids?
piping video stream?
latency issues?
need active feedback between camera and PC to determine end of game, reset game, etc.
Game related stuff:
We could either implement a one player or a two player game. We should have a virtual clone of the game that players can play if the game is very popular (only one person can play the real microfluidic version at a time). Game should be relatively quick, last only a couple of minutes tops. Games should be challenging and provide room for improvement. Implement a high-score, to award the grand-prize winner at the jamboree? Need a login based interface to keep track of who is playing?
tug of war...
pong clone
snake?
a game that takes advantage of the inherent fluid physics on microfluidic devices (i.e. why emulate physics in computer games if you can play the real deal?)
could we make the game productive? I.e. have some useful output as a result of people playing it?
can we somehow strengthen the link to synthetic biology?
