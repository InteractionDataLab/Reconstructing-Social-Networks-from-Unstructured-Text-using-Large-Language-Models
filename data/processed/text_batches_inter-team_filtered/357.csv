XMU_Software,2013,Team:XMU Software#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," notes when learn new things. SUSTC' fault: Just one function, it may not catch everybody's eyes. She plans to change promoter so as to confirm the system efficiency. Jianxing schedule to learn neural network, after that, he will change the source code to be used on today's system. Huang Xin and Huang Jian now know just a little about Matlab, but they think the code can be changed easily. Wang learned Matlab as well. Tang Chun read some books about system efficiency and downloaded papers to share with others. From N-terminal domain rule, he noticed that choose the parameters is a key point for our project.
Next week's task had been written on the wall. And we suggest everybody to use PowerPoint to explain their ideas.
2013.4.14
Specific our goals: For most of us aren't familiar with GA. We misunderstand the idea at the beginning. We determined to find the best fit BioBricks through genetic recombination and variation inside the BioBricks, and we evaluating them by our algorithm. Compare with other team' work: EbolGENTS (2008, Calgary) and Evolutionary Algorithm (2008, Newcastle University). Both of them had used GA, however, they construct a system with given BioBricks just like build blocks, after which they find the best system in those ""structures"". As for our group, we focus on genetic recombination and variation inside the BioBricks to make further ones, and search for the best with given conditions.
Reduce the degree of difficulty: it may be a huge project to ensure phenotype and fitness result from mutations of the base sequences in the whole BioBricks. So we decided to narrow down and aim at optimizing the decision of particular bases, promoter, terminator and RBS locus. Yijuan had mentioned that SUSTC had done research on computational efficiency of the Terminator's gene sequences.
Core problem: How to ensure phenotype from genotype? How to find the f(x) meet our goal? Fitness function: three ways had been chosen to solve it: first, search for relevant literatures; read the project offered by Professor Fang named “microorganism’s choice of the optimal conditions""; if possible, our wet lab should give us a hand on affording real time data and experimental simulation to ensure f(x).
Current task: Check the project of iGEM ""calculate terminators efficiency by the sequences of the terminators”; all of us need to take a look at SUSTC' work and discuss the next time. Learning Matlab and GA!
Annotations: We had set sail now! All of us need to learn SUST"

China Meetup
Chinese teams began to participate  International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition from 2007, the number has increased to 20 from only 4 at the beginning.    Considering that the new teams are lack of experience in the 2011 competition and a platform for communication and cooperation between teams is badly needed,    a meeting for all Chinese iGEMers -- iGEM 2011 China Meetup -- was held at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) from July 29th to July 31th.
The theme of this conference is ""iGEM -- the breeding ground for the next generation of synthetic biologists"". During the conference,    well-known experts were invited to promulgate their latest research findings and elucidate the development trend of synthetic biology,    and there were also  insightful students to make subjective reports and reviews. iGEM teams  displayed the current progress of their projects,    and shared their experiences with conference participants.
Prof. Xueming Zhao from Tianjin University, Prof. Michael Q. Zhang from CSHL & Tsinghua University and Prof. Jiarui Wu from SIBS & USTC were invited to give lectures.   The conference was open to all undergraduates, graduate students and researchers who are interested in iGEM and synthetic biology. Participants interacted with each other and the lecturers during the conference.    The conference is supported by School of Life Science, USTC and the Committee of Communist Youth League of China, USTC.

Artificial River Media Growth Assays
Determining Food Tank Parameters
With the intention to make a biosensor capable of working self sufficiently for a long period of time, maintaining the biological elements of the system is crucial. Therefore, assays were performed to determine the parameters of the food tank. Using only sodium lactate as a carbon source for Shewanella, the minimum concentration of nutrients that the bacteria needed to survive would be determined. Considering the device was created with six liters of space for nutrients to be added, what would be the maximum concentration and miniumum flow rate that could be used by the device, to maintain successful results? The first step in this is to simulate river conditions and add different ""flow rates"" of sodium lactate. Then this determined concentration should be tested for biosensing ability in a later reactor test.
Developing Synthetic River Media
The first step is to determine the contents of a river of interest. The Athabasca river was selected, as it is of particular importance in the Oil Sands region of Alberta. The information on various concentrations of ions, water hardness, pH, etc. came from the Oil Sands Information Portal . Based on this information, as well as available salts to use, a recipe for Synthetic River Media was created to match the biologically significant parameters of the river's contents to the solution which would be used for later growth tests.
Growth Assays
Various engineered strains were tested with different amounts of sodium lactate in 20 hour or greater growth trials, in synthetic river media. After a few weeks of editing the protocol, a final procedure was developed for the Shewan"

We succeeded in cloning the construction in pSB1C3, but did not characterize it due to lack of time. The final biobrick must be used in an E. coli deficient in EnvZ. The delta EnvZ strain was obtained from the Paris Bettencourt team and has been already described in many other iGEM projects.

Upon the completion of project, I would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to those two doctors, Dr. Gu and Dr. Zhao, who gave us important guidance on project designing and allergy studying. Without their help and encouragement, our work would not have been such an integral project.
CCiC
The fifth Conference of China iGEMer Community
The fifth Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) we attended in August was accredited by the iGEM authority. In the conference, we presented our team’s poster and demonstrated the project. With abundant preparations and excelsior attitudes, we achieved great success and high reputation.
Every night during the conference, our poster attracted a number of students from other universities to discuss with us. After a short period of dissemination, our project’s designs and effects were learned by almost all participants. While giving publicity to ourselves, we paid attention to other teams’ lecture and presentation, taking notes and discussing together late in the hotel.
On the last day, our representation was splendid due to lucid logical structure and full plans to answer the questions raised by famous iGEMer, the special guest of the conference Zhang Haoqian, and get recognition from all guests present.

A big step, but we had to go further. The biggest issue we faced as the summer drew to a close was sustainability. Indeed, a software tool is only accessible if it is properly maintained, updated and if it has a community supporting it. What would happen to Neptune after iGEM? Where will Neptune be in 5 years? If we seriously cared about promoting an accessible workflow, we had to make sure we considered the future of our tool.
What is NONA?
And so we proceeded to reach out to the NONA Research Foundation, a nonprofit whose aim is to broaden access to and develop a community around open source synthetic biology software tools. As cited from the organization, “Nona creates long-lasting solutions to the challenges posed by the rapidly growing complexity of software in the synthetic biology community by using the power of open source.”
Integrating with NONA provided 3 long-term, sustainable solutions to promoting the accessibility of Neptune and microfluidics to the synthetic biology community.
1) NONA would distribute Neptune, allowing Neptune to have a “home” where is can easily be found (beyond GitHub.)
2) NONA is dedicated to integrating all open synthetic biology software tools under one umbrella, thus building a community of researchers and developers who who will use and support these tools. Thus, NONA will be a medium through which other developers can contribute to Neptune, and NONA will be a place researchers can go to learn more about how to use Neptune, ask for help, and so forth.
3) Overall, by having a dedicated community and website where Neptune will always have a place, we are making it very hard for Neptune to be abandoned. Quite the opposite, with NONA will ensure Neptune is sustained for years to come, while also providing the opportunity for a community to flourish around Neptune and similar software tools.
Passing Neptune to NONA
We met with members of NONA to discuss integrating Neptune with their foundation. Discussions went really well; indeed, while NONA offered us a lot in terms of accessibility and sustainability, we found that our team could give NONA a hand as well.
We agreed to pass Neptune along to the NONA community. Neptune, with its installation link and all of the documentation were passed along to NONA. In the coming weeks more and more of Neptune’s supporting content; wiki’s, tutorials and all documentation will be pushed to NONA’s site.
NONA will now holistically support Neptune and ensure it is a successful, long term open source project. By integrating our software, with all its documentation and supporting educational material, to NONA, we have provided Neptune"

We intended to use CrtEBI and CrtEBIY as our bioreporter at first. After our characterization, we decided to use CrtEBI for the serious leakage of CrtEBIY. However, we found a serious leakage when CrtEBI was combined with the promoter PmerT and PpbrA. Leakage was serious regardless of the prefixed promoter in our experiment. For this reason, we chose other reporter gene, such as LacZ alpha instead of CrtEBI.

Besides, she also expounded our team project on chronic wounds to SIAT’s researchers there. After that presentation, she conversed with the university students there, and they expressed deep interests in synthetic biology, proposing that they would like to build a new team and joined iGEM in 2017! They also expressed their will to collaborate with our team SMS_Shenzhen in 2017.
Presentation In SVMA
On Jun 14, 2016, about ten of our teammates went to Shenzhen Vanke Meisha Academy, an affiliated high school of Shenzhen Middle School. A biology teacher from the Academy led us to a school tour, and we visited their labs and biology club. On that day, six students from the club went to their lab and held their club activity, while we discussed with them and gave them a presentation on synthetic biology and iGEM. Specifically we introduced the concept of synthetic biology first, and found that even the club members did not know about this field much. We mentioned some detailed steps of synthetic biology experiments, which raised the students’ interest a lot. Then we presented more about iGEM and our project, and invited them to also take part in this competition next time. Although the club members were not familiar with this field of knowledge, they expressed great curiosity and willingness to iGEM. We emphasized that we would like to offer help, in whether professional knowledge or experimental resources, and the biology club appreciated our hard work and stated that they would definitely learn more on synthetic biology.

Visit to SZOIL Maker Space
Shenzhen Open Innovation Lab (SZOIL) is a space and platform for worldwide makers to communicate and cooperate. It is also the first Fablab authorized by MIT in Shenzhen as a research and development partner in Fab 2.0. On June 6th, 2016, three of our team members visit SZOIL Maker Space and had a long conversation with the staffs there. Huiqi Xie, the person in charge of the Maker space, led us to a tour around their working lab and had a two-hour discussion with us on Maker and especially, bio-hacking in Shenzhen. During the discussion, we found that the main problems for bio-hacking occur in the lack of mentor/lack of education, and the high cost of laboratory and materials. We offered advice on a bio-lab they planned to build in August, and they invited us to also use the lab and help their Fab"

WashU_StLouis,2018,Team:WashU StLouis#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Our conversation provided valuable insight into how fungicide contributes toward damaging the environment, and how our team needed to be cognisant of the negative externalities our project might have.
Meeting with Professors
We spoke with Dr. Shanti Parikh who has extensive anthropological research experience in the region of Uganda where we met with farmers. She suggested that it would be wrong for us to develop an educational program for farmers. She suggested that this would be far inferior to that developed by ugandan students and farmers themselves. It would be best to have a strategy where we empowered education and change in farming practices to come from within. She cited successful work done by another professor at Washington University, Penina Acayo Laker in award winning malaria education strategies.
Dr. Jim Feher P.E. helped us choose components to use for the hardware as well as strategizing for how to get the best response from the arduino to reduce noise by utilizing different sampling patterns.
Meeting with Microsoft
Cam met with Ervin Flores, general manager of the Microsoft Mid-America district, at the beginning of June to discuss technology collaboration and the human impact of Pgt. This led to our official partnership with the company. We then received a Microsoft Surface as a “digital lab notebook”, plus several appointments with experts in modeling, cloud computing, and hardware.
In Mid-July, Dr. Thomas Abraham and Bryan Roberts met with us to discuss future direction for our device. They suggested using a Raspberry Pi instead of Arduino for our device in order to maximise its future capabilities. They gave us resources within Microsoft in Washington that interface directly with agricultural companies and NGO’s. They also gave us advice on 3D printing our device chassis. After a long discussion, they agreed with us that using Microsoft Azure for a cloud-based software solution for governments to track Pgt would not be feasible for our project time frame. They then made themselves available for a biweekly chat to check in on our project.
August 16: Meeting with Dr. Shah
Our team met with Dr. Shah, a researcher at the Danforth Plant Sciences Center who studies plant defensin proteins, another method of innate plant resistance to fungal pathogens. He compared resistance and defensin proteins, noted the benefits and drawbacks, and discussed how both are being studied as methods of providing durable resistance to pathogen infection. Prior to our meeting with Dr. Shah, our team had intended to use a polystyrene membrane for our spore trap based on what we had previously read in literature. However, Dr. Shah informed us that any hydrophobic material could be used as a spore"

BioDegradation
Figure 2: Degradation of erythromycin by recombinant protein and our PhyscoFilter read more .
Under the headline BioDegradation we investigated effector proteins which degrade pollutants by enzymatic catalysis. For this purpose we introduced the new BioBrick Erythromycin Esterase (EreB) which degrades macrolide antibiotics. Additionally we used well established BioBricks for BioDegradation. We improved the Laccase from Bacillus pumilus, established by the iGEM Team of Bielefeld in 2012, by converting it to RFC[25] in order to be able to fuse it to the extracellular domain of our receptor. Both enzymes were produced as recombinant proteins and purified. Enzymatic characterization was carried out concerning salt tolerance, substrate and pH dependence. For the laccase temperature dependence and the half-life in river water was additionally estimated. All data was fitted in our enzyme kinetic modeling. The aim was to analyze this data and to provide a solid base for our filter calculator. This calculator uses all the data produced in our enzyme characterization to extrapolate from them for the large scale implementation of transgenic PhyscoFilters in waste water treatment plants or on rivers. We assumed the secretory production of laccase by our moss as the laccase degrades a wide variety of important pollutants such as the pain killer diclofenac, the oral contraceptive ethinylestradiol or iodined x-ray contrast media. All these substances are present in nature and are hardly degradable by conventional methods. While using this calculator for modeling , we learned that factors such as the degree of pollution in rivers, the average temperature in a specific country, the enzyme half-life time, as well as the actual amount of secreted protein play an important role for the efficacy of our PhyscoFilter. Generally the results show that approximately an area of 20 football fields would be required to produce enough laccase to reduce the contamination of the large river Rhein with the mentioned pharmaceutical compounds, while half a field would suffice for a large waste water treatment plant. Beside this result we also produced several different stable transgenic moss lines for our BioDegradation module and were able to show that our cytoplasmically expressed Erythromycin Esterase B enables our moss to successfully degrade"

Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," with the expression samples. These were taken immediately after two, five, ten and fifteen minutes. The marker was applied to the far left. From right to left you have to look for the proteins, whose expression becomes stronger with time. One of these expression bands can be found at about 100 kDa. The second band is slightly lower, corresponding to a weight of about 50 kDa. These are marked by the two blue arrows. Thus it is proven that the construct BoNT/C-HiBit was expressed.
Preliminary tests have shown that the Botox construction is split during cleaning via the Strep-tag column. Therefore an approach was tried in which the protein was stabilized only by minimal purification or in this case by dilution with PBS buffer with additional 0.3mM glutathione. 0.66 mg TEV was added to the centrifuged lysate solution to separate the Strep Tag. This would interfere with the process of cell penetration.
Cell Culture
Botox is a neurotoxin and can therefore only affect cells with a neuronal character. This is also the reason why our project represents such a groundbreaking improvement in application.
In order to test our detoxified Botox constructs, we needed cells that were as similar as possible to neurons. Nowadays there are countless different target lines available that are more or less similar.  Our chosen target line SHSY5Y had the advantage that there was already a detailed differentiation protocol  available .
In the beginning, the neuroblastoma were maintained for some time to get a feel for their behavior.  For the final differentiation a fresh vial SHSY5Y Passage 14 was thawed and grown in a culture bottle with Basic Culture Media for one week. The culture was split and divided into 6-well plates with 100,000 cells per well. At this stage the cells still have complete blastoma character. Naturally, this line is characterized by epithelial like cells and neuronal like cells occurring simultaneously and spontaneously merging into these two morphological forms. The aim of the differentiation is therefore to promote the neuronal like form and to filter out the epithelial like cells by splitting them 1:1 several times.
1 day after splitting on 6-well plates the switch to differentiation medium 1 takes place. Here the serum content is reduced and additionally cell proliferation is inhibited with 10 µM all-trans retinoic acid. Tretinoin is also used in a subtype of leukaemia because it causes the leukaemia cells to differentiate.
Morphologically, no clear change can yet be detected, but proliferation is clearly"
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," Finally, we successfully extracted gene doping DNA that we spiked to the serum, guided by the concentration value generated by the gene doping model.
1.1 Gene Doping Model: Understanding Gene Doping
Design: We modeled the process of infection and degradation of gene doping DNA in blood to determine its concentration overtime. We use this model to provide approximate sensitivity requirement for DNA extraction.
Results and interpretation: Based on our model , we determined microdosing was the best doping method for doping athletes, as it avoids high EPO fluctuation, and hence avoids detection through the biological passport. Figure 2 displays the predicted amount of doping DNA fragments in the blood over time as a result of intramuscular (IM) injection every 20 days. Based on this model , we predicted that there will be 40,000 to 50,000 fragments of DNA per mL blood. We based the sensitivity requirement of DNA extraction on this value.
Figure 2. Concentration of EPO gene doping DNA in the blood during intramuscular microdosing with an initial dose of 96 billion vectors followed by smaller doses of 27 billion vectors every 20 days.
1.2 cfDNA Extraction
Design: We extracted cfDNA from bovine serum and confirmed successful extraction with Qubit dsDNA HS assay and nested PCR.
Results and interpretation: We performed cfDNA isolation from the serum using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit. To verify extraction, we quantified cfDNA on the serum using Qubit. We obtained 0.394+/- 0.0149 ng/uL of cfDNA after extraction. To verify the extraction further, we performed nested PCR on albumin gene. Albumin gene is often used for verification of the presence of genomic mammalian DNA and was recommended by Sanquin. The nested albumin PCR consists of a first round of PCR using primers 091 and 092 , amplifying an internal fragment of the bovine albumin gene of 229 bp. We deliberately chose to amplify a short fragment since cfDNA in blood is fragmented. The product of the first round of PCR was used as the template for the second round. We used internal primers 066 and 067 to amplify a 150 bp internal fragment of the first PCR product.The product of the first and second round of PCR are shown on figure 3. The bands on figure 3 lane 2-7 confirmed the success of the extraction.

The IIT Delhi iGEM team whole-heartedly collaborated with Berlin diagnostX team. Berlin team was working on affordable, practical and effective diagnostics of the widespread third world parasitic disease -Tapeworm Infection. Since India is one of the countries where millions of people are infected by this parasite, IIT Delhi directed Berlin team to a suitable site. It was a hospital in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh where many cases of tapeworm were reported. After the successful extraction and lysis of the Tapeworm eggs, Berlin team obtained RNA molecules of the T. Solium species of the Tapeworm. IIT Delhi further assisted them by providing our own lab as -20 and -80 degrees centigrade refrigerators and other required lab apparatus were not available in the above-mentioned hospital. Sequencing of the RNA was also done and all the samples were shipped to them. This was not only constricted to iGEM collaboration as we further plan to adopt this technology for affordable diagnostic of tapeworm infection which is otherwise done using fecal inspection using a microscope. This would help in timely detection of infection and thus would save lives of many people. Following this, Berlin team provided us the protease stains without Degradation Tags required by us to generate oscillations in the form of a square. Here is the link to the iGEM Berlin Team:

PCR Amplification
Important: The following protocol has been optimized using Phusion® DNA polymerase. We strongly recommend you use Phusion polymerase for this protocol.
Primer Preparation
Upon receipt of your RDP part primers, briefly centrifuge each tube to bring the solid material to the tube bottom. Resuspend each primer to a final concentration of 25nm/mL (25μM) in TE buffer using the formula:
Resuspension volume (μL) = nm (from supplier label) x 40
Vortex at maximum setting for 10 seconds, let stand 10 min then repeat twice. Briefly centrifuge and freeze until needed.
Note: Keep track of your PCR primers, since you may be able to use some of them to sequence RDP parts in assembled circuits. Store frozen.
Template preparation
If the starting template for the final RDP part is contained within a circular vector such as a plasmid, then linearize it by choosing an appropriate restriction endonuclease whose site is located in the vector backbone but not within the part sequence. PCR amplification from a linear template increases the final yield of the PCR product while reducing the level of lowerband contaminants.
Since the PCR reaction uses 2μL of template @10ng/μL, digest 100ng of DNA in a final volume of 10μL. Add 2μL of the digest to the PCR reaction just prior to amplification as described below.
Reaction setup
The parts creation protocol requires a minimum of 5μg of PCR product that should be easily obtained from a 100μL reaction as described below:
Keep all reagents on ice. Using a 0.2mL PCR tube, combine in the following order:
2μL forward primer
2μL reverse primer
20μL 5x HF Buffer
dNTPs (@10mM)
65μL H2O
2μL template
1μL Phusion polymerase (@2u/μL)
Mix the reaction by pipetting up and down gently to avoid bubbles. Centrifuge (pulse) briefly. Then keep on ice until amplification.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," sun. This concluded in a visit to the roof terrace of the campus dormitory, followed by dinner. It was requested, by our fellow Danish teams, to make the SDU meetup an iGEM tradition.
Attending Meetups
Besides hosting our own meetup, we also attended several meetups during our iGEM experience. The first of which, was the 5th Annual Biobrick Workshop in March, hosted by the Technical University of Denmark, DTU-Denmark. This meetup not only gave us our first experience with Biobricks, but also worked as a foundation for friendships across different teams.
Our second meetup, the Nordic iGEM Conference was hosted by the University of Copenhagen, UCopenhagen, and took place in June. The main focus of this meetup was the traditional mini Jamboree. Participating in this  meetup gave us useful feedback from both the judges as well as from our fellow iGEM teams. This helped us greatly to shape and develop our project for the better.
To celebrate the beginning of our iGEM summer, we went on a road trip to attend the European Meetup, hosted by the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Here we discussed ideas regarding our project at a poster session, and learned about all the other great iGEM projects. We also made new friends from all over Europe.
Further Collaboration
In regard to our project, we have been in contact with the iGEM teams from Bielefeld and Imperial College, who helped us by sending crucial parts, relevant to the execution of our project.
As our project revolves around global warming and green sustainable energy, we were thrilled to hear about the iGEM Goes Green initiative made by the TU Dresden iGEM team. Following their guidelines, we have calculated the carbon footprint of our laboratory work and travelling. We have, in part, tried to make up for our carbon footprint, by changing our travelling and eating habits in our everyday lives. Furthermore, we have reduced our daily electricity consumption, our wiki became CO2 neutral, and we made an effort to sort our waste. The full report can be scrutinised here. Due to our team being the most green dream team, TU-Dresden asked us to lead the iGEM Goes Green project in year 2018.
We sought expertise from the Macquarie Australia iGEM team, who has worked with the implementation of photosynthesis in E. coli since 2013. We had an interesting Skype call with their team, where we discussed the particular challenges their previous teams had experienced throughout their projects.
We were also able to help"

SyBRE
Past participation of ITESM’s teams on the iGEM competition has not been properly organized from an institutional angle. The first involvement, in 2010, was an entirely student-formed idea and, although it was supported by some school authorities and faculty members, it was not planned. With the experience gained, the second year partaking was more prepared, but it still lacked a formal structure with which to guide, support and fund the project.
For this edition of iGEM, the school division prepared an official elective class –Synthetic Biology- which students had to take in order to access the institution’s official support. This was a step forward, but it had a mayor disadvantage: the class was imparted in the January – May semester. Project proposals were elaborated and discussed during this time while the instructors gave feedback and suggestions. Before a panel of teachers, researchers and the division director, the selection was made at the end of the semester: out of the three final projects, two merged and the school decided to register two teams.
Having the ‘go-ahead’ at May, meant that –due to normal waiting times and some bureaucratic red-tape- the genetic constructs would be ordered in June and would not arrive until late July. Other reagents and materials would have to wait until the start of the August – December semester to be ordered along the usual academic laboratory requisitions. iGEM lab work is supposed to be made during the summer (or, even better, started previously), not frantically during the first two months of a school term.
In order to ensure that future teams from the school can compete in an ordered and productive manner, with plenty of time to spare, we decided to institutionalize the school’s participation in iGEM through an official student group. We already had the intention of setting up a group to form, coordinate and support student research teams in synthetic biology, so we included the organization of the iGEM participation into the work plan and filed all the appropriate papers. The group name is SyBRE (Synthetic Biology Research and Engineering). It was finally approved and sanctioned by AGE (the student group’s governing body) on September 24th.
SyBRE’s mission is to encourage research and engineering in synthetic biology amongst the students of ITESM’s Monterrey Campus. It will seek to include members from a cross-disciplinary background in order to broaden the scope and reach"

After removing this reaction, we had to rerun all of our previous codes to update our figures.
- Experiments From Jun 24
Knockout Malate Oxidase
J_exp8
After knocking out malate oxidase, Laura and I reran FBA codes for the WT and N2WM1788 models. Our updated max biomass and ATP values for the wild type model were 0.821233 and 3.155221, respectively. And for the nitrogen fixation model, 0.454531 and 3.155221, respectively. Our updated ATPmreq constraint was then set from 10.0 to 3.15. We also reran the flavodoxin scripts, and found that our max biomass value, which we derived from maximizing flux through the flavodoxin reaction (0.010442), was 0.4545. I continued rerunning the pyruvate codes with the malate oxidase knockout­ however, I was having some difficulty with running the codes to completion­ several errors kept popping up. I later found out that these issues were arising from available storage space in my terminal, which was later resolved after I consulted Tom.
Original values (N2 outputs)

PDH and PFL
Max biomass: 0.454531
Flux range for PDH: 0 to 10,000
Flux range for PFL: 0 to 59.205
Flux range for POR5: ­9986.136 to 9.202
Max biomass: 0.454531
Flux range for PDH: 26.0981627712 to 10,000
Flux range for POR5: ­9964.701 to 9.202
Max biomass: 0.310129
Flux range for POR5: 24.575 to 24.588
Even though knocking out the PDH reaction seemed favorable when compared to the existing N2 WM1788 model, literature reveals that the removal of this reaction is associated with diminished cell growth, resulting from a buildup of organic acids. Therefore, we can not perform either of these knockouts.

NCTU_Formosa,2014,Team:NCTU Formosa#project_-_-_TEXT.html," a Noctuid moth which is considered as an agricultural pest. It is also known as the Cluster caterpillar, Cotton leafworm, Tobacco cutworm, and Tropical armyworm. It has a very wide host range of over 120 plant species, including: lettuce, cabbage, beetroot, peanuts, geranium, cotton, banana, fuchsias, acacia, African oil palm, amaranth, alfalfa, strawberry, sorghum, sugarcane, tomatoes, asparagus, apple, eggplant, beet, beans, broccoli, elephants ear, horsetail she oak, corn, flax, lantana, papaya, orange, mango, leek, among many others.
Control: The use of Bacillus thuringiensis (BT) may effectively control this pest. Other forms of biological, horticultural, and cultural control that have been studied include: planting near derris and garlic plants, breeding resistant plants from wild plants for example groundnuts from wild groundnuts, breeding resistant plants using bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis genes, using a Baculovirus, using the nematode Steinernema carpocapsae, and using the fly Exorista japonica(10).
Solenopsis invicta
Spread:The red imported fire ant, a eusocial species, are far more aggressive than most ant species. Animals, including humans, often encounter them by inadvertently stepping on one of their mounds, which causes the ants to swarm up the legs, attacking en masse. The ants respond to pheromones released by the first ant that attacks, thereafter stinging in concert(12).
Characteristics: Fire ants are red and black in coloration and, like all insects, they are protected by a hard exoskeleton and have six legs. Worker ants have round heads with mandibles, an armored thorax midsection and an abdomen, made up of the pedicle and the gaster. The head is typically copper brown in color. In addition to their mandibles, fire ant workers also possess an abdominal stinger(11)(29).
Damage:  They are considered to be a pest, not only because of the physical pain they can inflict, but also because their mound-building activity can damage plant roots, lead to loss of crops(12).
Control: Hot water Pouring hot water on the mounds is effective and environmentally friendly, but may require 3 or 4 applications to kill the colony. Water should be at least scalding hot, but does not need to be boiling. This works best when you use 3 to"

In our wet lab part, we synthetized network and constructed plasmids transferred into Hela cells, and we made some adjustment in our design for a better realization in experiment:  We assumed that input (I) is not regulated by the network and remains constant.  We fixed two certain edges (I inhibits A, A inhibits O), because when constructing the system, the components to function as inducers are quite few. So we tend to use 2 repressors to substitute it.  We limited the maximum number of regulatory nodes to 2 to restrict the problem to an acceptable scale.  We chose relative parameters close to the actual experiments in our simulation. According to previous research, we guaranteed that most parameters are within the already confirmed range, such as reaction rate.
Basic Function Analysis -- Massive Parallel Data Processing
The ideal network in our project must be sensitive to the input signal and be able to distinguish the low input and high input from each other. So we expected that the target structure should have a low-input-low-output and high-input-high-output character. Besides, it should avoid ambiguous interim region between low input and high input.
We firstly raised two basic indexes, High-low Ratio and Interim Slope to evaluate the performance of all three-node network structures. To each structure, we scanned the value of input ranging from 1 to 1000 and recorded the corresponding output.
Then we enumerated all possible network structures and illustrated the filtering result in a 2D map. The X-axis represents High-low Ratio and the Y-axis represents Interim Slope, and there are 19683 three-node structures illustrated as docs in grids in the map. According to our target, only networks with high High-low Ratio and high Interim Slope can achieve the required function. In other words, only networks located in the top-right corner of the map are acceptable.
Finally we screened 476 three-node network structures out of 19683 network structures in total, which can achieve the high High-low Ratio and high Interim Slope. The whole process involved massive calculation and parallel data processing. Especially, it requires serious computing power to solve all the ODE equations of 19683 networks and computer cluster is a powerful tool. Computer cluster connects a group of incompact computers which collaborate together to offer stronger processor power and larger space. We finished the first round of screening with the help of High Performance Computing Cluster (HPCC) in Tsing"

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#experiment#exp1_-_-_TEXT.html," incubation with palmitic acid, around45% of cell viability can be maintained even at 2.0mM. For 48 hours incubation, cell viability varied for different concentrations. To maintain 50% cell viability after 48 hours incubation with palmitic acid, we concluded to experiment within range from 0mM to 0.32 mM of palmitic acid.
Fatty Acid Quantification
Quantification Method
Two fatty acid quantification methods were investigated to measure fatty acid uptake rate ofconstitutive and inducible glyoxylate system: 1) Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrophotometry (GC-MS), and 2) Fatty acid quantification kit (Sigma Aldrich). While we managed to measure fatty acid amount in cell culture medium using GC-MS, fatty acid quantification kit could not be tested due to limitation of time.
Fatty Acid Treatment
In measuring fatty acid, fatty acid solution was mixed with ethanol and chloroform. After acidifying by HCl and refluxing in water bath for 30 min, the organic layer containing fatty acid was collected and extracted by diethyl ether and petroleum ether solution. Again the organic layer was sucked out to be dried before NaOH was added. Then after derivatisation by BF3 and bromotetradecane, the organic layer was collected into GC-MS vial for analysis.
GC-MS
GC-MS is a very useful tool to quantify volatile compounds effectively. For our experiment, we conducted calibration test using known concentrations of fatty acids. However, it was difficult to reach a conclusion due to lack of internal standards and uncertain amount of sample loss.

SELF Conference is a TED-like forum jointly set up by CAS Computer Network Information Center and CAS Science Communication Bureau, inviting elites to share new ideas and discoveries. Its name is the abbreviation respective of Science, Education, Life and Future.
This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#SinceAmsterdam_-_-_TEXT.html," of the experiment indicate that the bisdA | bisdB fusion protein has a high specificity for the degradation of BPA. In addition it is possible that the decrease in BPF and BPS concentration is due to internalization of those bisphenols or a endogenous enzyme of E. coli KRX and not the bisdA | bisdB fusion protein was responsible. It can be assumed that false positive signals because of BPF or BPS present in a sample are unlikely.
BPA degradation with constructs containing FNR
Constructs containing FNR, BisdA and BisdB polycistronic (<partinfo>K525551</partinfo>), FNR and a fusion protein of BisdA and BisdB (<partinfo>K525582</partinfo>) and a fusion protein of FNR, BisdA and BisdB (<partinfo>K525560</partinfo>) were tested for their ability to degrade BPA. Cultivations were done using the same conditions as with previous constructs. The results are shown in Figure 3 below.
Figure 3: Degradation of BPA after 24 h cultivation with E.coli KRX carrying genes for FNR, BisdA and BisdB polycistronic <partinfo>K525551</partinfo>, FNR and a fusion protein of BisdA and BisdB <partinfo>K525582</partinfo> and a fusion protein of FNR, BisdA and BisdB <partinfo>K525560</partinfo> behind the medium strong constitutive promoter <partinfo>J23110</partinfo> with RBS <partinfo>B0034</partinfo>. Cultivations were carried out at 30 °C in LB + Amp + 120 mg L-1 BPA for 24 h in 300 mL shaking flasks without baffles with silicon plugs. Samples were taken every 3 hours. Two to four biological replicates were analyzed. All constructs were able to degrade BPA, with the constructs containing fusion proteins outperforming the construct where all proteins were expressed polycistronic.
The results indicate that the BPA degradation was improved using fusion proteins compared to the completely polycistronic construct. Also the fusion protein of all three enzymes (<partinfo>K525560</partinfo>) involved in the degradation of BPA worked as intended which is quite impressive.
Comparison of all constructs used for BPA degradation
Figure 4 gives an overview of the constructs employed for the degradation of BPA.

3) The one minute rule means that if you peg that person and if for a minute they do not remove the peg, then you have successfully pegged them, if not then you have to retrieve the peg and continue.
4) You can trick the person to peg themselves. Rebecca found this out the hard way and the rule stayed.
5) Once someone has been pegged, then the pegger tells the pegged and the pegged surrenders all their pegs to the pegger. Therefore, if the pegged has 4 pegs, then the pegger is very lucky indeed.
6) If you get a peg with your own name on it, then that means you can peg anyone with that peg. This seemingly messes the game up but it actually makes the game rather interesting.
7) When there are only two people left and you can't seem to successfully peg each other, then there is a tie breaker. The tie breaker is to peg someone the first. This is decided by the team. For us, it was anyone who is extremely hard to peg. To make things harder, you must peg them and remove the peg after a minute, without them noticing.
This is a good game to get advisors into too. Not just the 7 of us undergraduates played this, we roped in Richard Kelwick and Richard Bowater. Pegging rules are quite relaxed so have fun and make up and change some rules, these are rules that we kept to but some of the best games are ones that you create so create some of your own too.

UCLA,2015,Team:UCLA#Notebook#Honeybee Silk_-_-_TEXT.html," which has specific affinity for SpyCatcher. It also contains regulatory elements like a promoter and rbs for expression. You can view the sequence BBa_K1763008 here .
The fourth sequence BBa_K1763007 is our honeybee silk sequence with a T7 promoter upstream for effective protein expression in bacterial strains containing t7 polymerase.
The fifth sequence, BBa_K1763015 is our honeybee silk sequence+sfGFP with a T7 promoter and RBS upstream that can be used in bacterial strains that contain T7 polymerase.
Protein Expression
We have just finished our first round of honey bee silk expression from BBa_K1763001
Here is our first attempt at protein expression along with the gel.
Fig. 1 Expected size of product is 40.0 kDA
Unfortunately the purified protein that we see on the gel (should be in next to last lane on the right) doesn't seem to be the right size.
We will try again using a T7 promoter and a slightly modified protein expression and purification protocol.
Here is our most recent attempt at expressing honeybee silk protein and the SDS PAGE results. We see a band at the expected size of 40 kDA!
What we are working on now
We are currently optimizing our honeybee silk expression protocol. We are getting a band at the right size (40 kDa) on our SDS PAGE gels, but there is a fair amount of contamination. See example below (The purified product is in lane 7).
Fig. 1 Expected size of product is 40 kDa (lane 6 and 7)). Lane 8 is BSA protein positive control, and lane 1 is Biorad dual color ladder. From lane 1-8 S1,F2,F3,S2,Final product 8/7, Final Product 7/29,BSA positive control, (see table)
We are optimizing out cell lysis and purification protocol in the hopes of getting higher yield and a more pure protein product.
In terms of producing fibers, we have ""purified"" honeybee product dissolved in SDS ready to go. We are waiting on the protein concentrators to arrive so that we can have a concentrated enough dope for spinning into fibers.
We hope that the protein concentration will also help to get rid of some of the contaminating proteins that are under the 30 kDa cutoff.

While putting BeeT into use during the competition was out of the question (as per iGEM’s Do Not Release requirements ), the fact remains that BeeT was designed as a proof-of-concept for a commercial product. As such, the organism itself needs to be safe to handle and apply by layman beekeepers as well as trained lab workers. In addition, there are major ethical and legal concerns regarding the possibility of any GMO - even one as simple as BeeT - escaping into the natural environment. As it is better to be safe than sorry, we included a dual kill switch in the organism’s design as a biocontainment measure.
Minimum-risk Organism
BeeT is designed to minimize the risks in both its creation and application. The machine’s chassis is Escherichia coli, a very well-understood level 1 organism. The same risk level applies to the majority of organisms used during development. In the rare occasion that a gene from a Level 2 organism"

Central China iGEMers' Consortium (CCiC) and Meet up in Wuhan
 iGEM encourages  communication and mutual assistance between teams. And the science should not be made behind the doors. Therefore, in June, we put forward the idea to establish the Central China iGEMers' Consortium in Wuhan University Exchange Meeting to achieve resource sharing and mutual help, which immediately got everyone's response. Therefore,  the Central China iGEMers' Consortium was formed by HZAU-China, HUST-China, WHU-China and WHU-Pharm four teams. Then, we proposed the idea to convening of the 1st central China iGEMers' meet up in Wuhan. The meetup was hosted by HZAU-China, cooperated by the other three teams. We were worried that there is only few teams will join us at first, but finally the popularity of meetup are far beyond our imagination.
Our meetup will mainly revolve around two topics, our projects at hand and team management. We have invited Zhang Haoqian and Liu yang, the accomplished former leader of PKU and OUC, as well as several other experienced former leaders to share their experience and thoughts with us, and give their suggestions.

Background
A Problem We Are Facing Right Now
Heavy metal contamination in the marine environment is becoming an increasingly serious problem throughout the world. There was a shocking news published by the Xinhua News Agency On August 18, 2016 about the execrable current contamination situation of the Bohai Sea in China. It revealed that the Bohai sea has almost become a dead sea and bears about 2.8 billion tons of sewage per year. And this calamity has a great passive impact on the fishing industry. People will never realize what consequences the environmental contaminations will brought to life unless they encroach our beautiful world piece by piece till the end.
(A) The Kuanhe Pump Station located in the upstream of Tianjin Distributary which will flow into the Bohai Sea is discharging sewage.
(B) There was once scads of dead fish estuary of Tianjin River, 2016.
(C) A mother brought her children to mourn the dead after the 50th anniversary of the confirmation of minamata disease in Japan.
(D) The level of mercury in the fish exceeds standard. They live in an area that was once under the minamata disease.
Heavy metal is one of the main sources of pollution. They may be a natural part on the earth but they became toxic due to so many anthropogenic activities. Heavy metals are stable and can't be broken down, which makes it easy for them to accumulate in the environment. Because of the high affinity for organic tissues, heavy metals will be bio-accumulated and biomagnified through food chains and became a threat both to ecosystem and public health.
Introduction
Heavy metal pollution in marine and coastal areas is mainly derived from oil pollution, desalination plants, industrial effluents, and sewage discharges. In particular, mercury pollution in fish is even more serious. Fish is a vital food for humans and many animals. As a main source of protein, it is now considered to be an important dietary threat of heavy metal toxicity via consumption. Mercury in fish is easily converted to methyl mercury (MeHg), which is highly toxic and can cause diseases. For example, Minamata disease caused by MeHg poisoning affects people who have ingested shellfish and fish contaminated by MeHg discharged in water. Therefore, it is essential to address the problem of mercury contamination in fish.

Began to troubleshoot PCR
Nanodropped samples of the TEF primers, and realized that their actual concentration was about 3 orders of magnitude less than the concentration they were labled with.  Perhaps in diluting them the first time, Aaron mistook the number of micrograms of each primer in the tube for a number of micromoles.  In fact, there were only ~20 nanomoles of each primer synthesized.  Based on the nanodrop readings of DNA concentration and the number of micrograms/micromole printed on the tubes, I rediluted them to 20 micromolar.  I checked these via nanodrop.  The 20 uM dilutions of both the TEF primers and the GalKO primers were put into microcentrifuge tubes lables with a $, as I believe that they are on the money.
I made new dilutions of the templates as well (TEF and pCS33), bringing them to ~."

Synthèse des réflexions
« L’éthique c’est le mouvement même de la Liberté qui cherche une vie bonne, dans la sollicitude envers autrui et dans un juste usage des institutions sociales » ; citation de Paul Ricoeur philosophe du 20e siècle. En d’autres termes, l’éthique représente la branche de la philosophie regroupant les valeurs morales qui définissent la façon dont nous devons nous comporter.
Appliquée à la biologie synthétique, l’éthique indique le chemin qu'il faut suivre pour permettre le développement de cette discipline en évitant ses dérives. En effet, bien qu’elle laisse rêver à de grandes perspectives telles que des sources propres d’énergie, des thérapies accessibles à tous ou des méthodes de remédiation biologique, manipuler le"

The waste solution was empty by releasing the clip at the bottom of the tube, and then used distilled water to wash Magnetosomes, the process was repeated more than three times, and the Magnetosomes were allowed to bind at the side of the tube by magnetic force. The final step was turning off the device, using PBS to resuspend Magnetosomes.
Fig.6 Electromagnet separator
The pulsed magnetic field generator
According to reference, the pulsed magnetic field could enhance Magnetosomes formation. So we design this device, the pulsed magnetic field generator, it is composed of the pulse signal generating circuit and the magnetic field generating part. The circuit generates pulse signal, and pass through DC electromagnet coils, which provide a highly homogenous pulsed magnetic field. The instrument was kept at 30℃ in a constant temperature chamber for AMB-1 incubation.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them. Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a more"

BactaSun - Work, Learn and Have Fun!
about us
We Are Awesome
It is very simple to describe … “Work, Learn and have Fun” is our motto. This represents quite well our crazy team. Since the beginning we are creating a great atmosphere between us. Our agenda is full of iGEM activities!! Road trip to Wageningen for the iGEM Benelux meeting, team working each week to meet us and share about the project, presentation of our adventure during a conference, etc…  Though we come from various faculties, we see skills differences as a real added value and all of us have something to say around the table. Responsibilities have been allocated according to our expertise and preferences but jokes duty is exclusively for Marine.
So, we do not need to say a lot but only: “It is a great experience with great people”.
What We Do
Solar Biobadges
Our objective is to design a biobadge detecting excessive UV exposure and therefore warning us to seek sun protection should it become necessary. This badge would work as a capsule holding E. coli cells, changing colours as the UV intensity increases. Therefore, we investigated two approaches using photocaged tyrosine (o-nitrobenzyl tyrosine). In both cases, UV-rays will release the tyrosine and enhance a reporter signal. (1) Starting with a tyrosine auxotroph E. coli strain, a reporter RFP will be synthetized once tyrosine is liberated from its cage. (2) Using a photocaged peptide and a specific transcription factor called ComR, we also aim at UV-controlling the expression of the reporter gene. The capsule would also work as a safe and reliable containment, destroying the engineered microorganisms once the biobadge is discarded.

The right: Survival rates of synX and S1 in cadmium ion solution. In order to eliminate the error brought by the different amount of cells picked up from the media, the survival rate equals the value of the number of the colonies developed on growth media after immersed in cadmium solution for a certain amount of time divided by that of the colonies developed on growth media after immersed in cadmium solution for 10 minutes. Mean values are shown in the graph. The error line stands for the standard deviation.
Fig.3-5 Picture of the third survival rate experiment results. Growth media: YPD. Experimental strain: S1; control strain: synX. Cells were plated onto the media after immersed in 5 mM cadmium solution for 10 minutes, 30minutes, 1 hour, and 2hours.
The Fig.3-4 and Fig.3-5 showcase that the survival rate of S1 is higher than that of synX after yeast cells are immersed in cadmium ions solutions of identical concentration for the same amount of time. We painstakingly counted and recorded the number of the colonies on each individual growth media. The quantitative results are that compared with the control strain, the experimental strain S1's ability to tolerate cadmium ions has increased by 23.8% (30 minutes), 231.9% (1 hour), and 192.4% (2 hours). The longer the time of immersion is, the more obvious the difference of survival rates is. The results are consistent with the dilution assay, which is that the mutated strain has a better resistance level of cadmium ions .
As for copper, the seemingly best strain, S5, is chosen as the experimental strain to test its ability to survive high concentration of copper ions compared with synX. Results are shown in the pictures and tables below.

Abstract
 It can be seen from the previous introduction that the detection of biomarkers requires  two reactions and one detection:The reaction of biomarkers and aptamer,the change of fluorescent protein’s concentration in E.coli,and the detection of fluorescence intensity .That means we need an instrument which can both provide platform for reactions and detect the intensity of the fluorescent protein.Unfortunately we did not find an suitable instrument for our project,so we decided to design one by ourselves(The structure can be seen in Figure).By reviewing literatures, we decided to use microfluidic chips.Microfluidic chip is a microchip that integrates man-made micro-pipelines and can controls the flow of liquid inside it.Microfluidic chip is a perfect platform for biochemical reactions and fluorescence detection,and it can be combined with external devices.In the case of microfluidic chip, we designed other functional modules such as optical detection module, temperature control module,so that the whole detection process can be completed on only one instrument. Microfluidic chip is important for our project, because it significantly reduces the time and cost of whole detection.Next I will introduce the design and performance testing of every functional modules. We hope that our design can provide reference for other teams.
Ⅰ.Microfluidic chip
 We chose the microfluidic chip because it has three significant advantages in the application:
  1.The tiny volume of the microfluidic chip allows the liquid reaction system to be miniaturized and integrated. It can use a small amount of liquid and space to achieve complex biochemical reactions;
  2.Reactions on the microfluidic chip can be quantitative analysis and detection;
  3. Microfluidic chip can be combined with external devices to make biochemical reactions become automated and intelligent.
 Based on the characteristics of microfluidic chip, more and more people use microfluidic chip as the platform of biochemical detection and POCT [1]. For example, there has been a microfluidic platform which can detect C-reactive protein in 2008,and the limit of detection is 2.6 ng/ml.Besides,it can be produced in large quantities[2].Similarly, in the case of hepatotoxicity assessment, a POCT method based on microfluidic systems overcomes the shortcomings of long processing times and high levels of personnel in traditional methods[3].It is worth mentioning that there already have mature POCT equipments based on microfluidic platform in"

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#SDP Results_-_-_TEXT.html," was still present. Usually linear DNA will be degraded inside a cell, so if the restriction site had been cut, one would have expected the plasmid to have degraded (at least partially).
The reason that I-SceI restriction inside the cell failed could be due to the LVA-tag attached to the homing endonuclease. Either it made the protein so unstable that it would get degraded at such a high rate that it could not restrict the plasmid. Or the tag itself prevented it from folding properly, and thereby prevented it from doing restrictions in the first place.
The reason why no fluorescence was observed after aTc induction is not well understood. Sequencing of this part only succeeded in the reverse direction (see ). It showed the presence of the GFP-LVA gene. Also the I-SceI restriction site has been shown to be present in the restriction analysis, so it is unlikely that anything between the restriction site and the GFP-LVA gene has been changed, because the observed length of the insert corresponds so well with the expected lenght.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the"

Project Description
Yeastilization
The global population has been increasing constantly for the past several decades and this trend shows no sign of stopping. With this comes a number of problems, which we will describe in the following sections and seek to address in our project.
""If you want something new, you have to stop doing something old.""
Peter F. Drucker
Background
Waste Management
In 2012 the global population passed 7 billion. It is estimated that it will reach 8 billion in 2026 and 9 billion around 2040. The increasing population of the world brings with it a number of challenges, not the least of which is management of the increasing waste generation.
Europe, and Denmark in particular, have worked on this for many years. One of the major goals of the European Union is to work towards a circular economy. A circular economy, as the EU defines it, is an economy with zero waste. This, of course, does not mean that waste is eliminated, merely that the entirety of our waste is recovered and recycled.
Denmark has been recycling and recovering waste for a long time. For more than a century, Denmark has incinerated waste and for many of those years, it has been one of the major heat and electricity sources. In recent years, great strides have been made towards recycling still greater amounts of waste. In 2015, 35% of our waste was recycled 1 . Exact numbers for recovery are unfortunately unavailable, as the Danish system of incinerating both for energy recovery and to get rid of waste muddies the picture significantly, but the number likely exceeds 50% 1 .
Figure 1: Danish waste management from 2011 to 2015.
The EU(28) recovers approximately half of their waste, excluding energy recovery 4 . The greater part of the remaining waste is incinerated 4 .

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," the Transport of Infectious Substances 2015-2016 [5] to “provide practical guidance to facilitate compliance with applicable international regulations for the transport of infectious substances and patient specimens by all modes of transport, both nationally and internationally”
CryptoGErM must take into account, those three different guidelines and regulations to ensure that the Bacillus subtilis spores containing the encrypted information can be sent freely nationally and internationally.
Consulting national and international regulations, we ensure that CryptoGErM obeys the legal standards for the shipping of GMOs
According to the guidelines from the World Health Organization, the Bacillus subtilis spores used in CrytpoGErM are classified in Class 9 and assigned to UN 3245 since they “do not meet the requirements of infectious substances but are capable of altering animals, plants or microbiological substances in a way which is not normally the result of natural reproduction”
“Bacillus subtilis spores used in CryptoGErM are assigned to UN 3245 for their shipping”
GMOs assigned to UN 3245 must be shipped by following the Packing Instruction P904 [6] . This instruction states the requirements for the container used in the shipping of GMOs:
An inner package: Primary receptacle and secondary packaging, must be leakproof for liquids or siftproof for solids. In case that the sample is liquid, absorbent material must be placed between the first and secondary packaging
An outer packaging shall: Strong enough for its capacity, mass and intended use
These requirements are explained graphically in Figure 1 from the “Guide to Shipping Biological Materials” [7] document from the North Carolina University (NCSU). Please refer to this document for graphical consultant of the shipping
However, CryptoGErM found out that the labelling in the transatlantic shipping is not common since the legislations for the transboundary shipping are rather different between countries in America and those in the European Union.
This is particularly true for the Parties and Nonparties of the Cartagena Protocol, whose regulations and legislations are rather different. In order to solve problems that might occur between those parties, it is stated in the Cartagena Protocol that “Parties may enter into bilateral, regional and multilateral agreements to avoid potential conflicts”
We sent the spores of Bacillus subtilis with the encrypted message to the Wageningen UR Team and iGEM TU Eindhoven through the facilities of the University of Groningen to ensure a secure and safe shipping.

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#human#interviews#expert6_-_-_TEXT.html," of Enlightenment that physics could serve as a theoretical basis for theorising all phenomena.  Today we came back of this enthusiasm because of complexity and because of the incredible difficulty to find a theory which is valid at all scales. We still think in terms of reductionism, but we compartmentalise more and more the different levels which become more and more hermetic. It is becoming more and more difficult to follow the synthetic ascent approach. Science has become very complex. Are we able to follow this evolution? We have the utopia of hearing a simple speech one day.
The risk of reductionism is to forget that what we had to neglect indeed exists. Our mind naturally tends to consider that what we don't need doesn't exist. You discover quarks, neutrons, and this leads you to consider that there are only quarks and neutrons. Are we a mass of quarks? What makes that sometimes there is complicity between two humans, sometimes not? There is always something beyond our understanding. If on the other hand you try to take everything into account in a whole theory, how can you check that your whole theory doesn't miss anything?
IS COMPLEXITY ALWAYS REDUCIBLE IN PHYSICS? CAN PHYSICS LIMIT ITSELF TO A REDUCTIONIST APPROACH?
Complexity is not always reducible in physics: we are not able to understand turbulence for example. We run simulations in order to go on, we find empirical laws with domains of validity… A traffic jam is also complex.  What makes that a traffic jam appears? What makes that it disappears? This is not really something that you can model. One uses statistics in order to make predictions. This is not really what we call comprehension. Physics can limit itself to reductionism, not in the corpuscular sense of reductionism, but more in the sense of a non-naive reductionism. The fundamental object is a field, not a thing. I don't know if we can still call this reductionism.
IF TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL DIMENSIONS OF A PROBLEM IS TOO COMPLICATED, SHOULDN'T WE ACCEPT THAT WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING AND PROCEED BY TRIAL AND ERROR IN ORDER TO GO FORWARD?
In my research, I collaborate with neuroscientists and I see how they proceed. They use this approach indeed and have incredible difficulties interpreting their results. They don't have a full epistemological frame. The research director decides on thought experiments to carry and everyone else follows. But I discussed with him and we don't agree at all on the notion of causality. He considers sequences as consequences"

And given that both sequences are connected to the same promoter, the activity is the same for siRBS1 and siIRES.
Equations for de-greening regulatorsystem
An inducible two way promoter is connected downstream to a de-greening system and upstream to a regulator from the mer operon. This regulator, called merR, lead the expression of the PmerOT promoter.
In normal conditions, PmerOT promoter is induced by mercury in the cell and transcribes downstream. However, when HG is absent, PmerOT transcribes upstream and express the protein merR, which also works as an activator-repressor for PmerOT.
PmerOT repressed the expression upstream in a negative feedback. Reaction coul be expressed as:
Where, merR is in charge of inhibiting the transcription rate.
The negative feedback reaction can be expressed as:
Being f (merR), the predictive function for the transcription rate. From the Hill’s function, it can be inferred for a repressed promoter that:
Then, the function for merR messenger is given by:
Thus, the function behavior will be cyclic, autoregulating itself.
Equations for the downstream de-greening system
Downstream, PmerOT promoter will be activated by metallic mercury. Thus, the activity for the promoter downstream is given by the Hill’s function:
Where DPC, represents the De-greening protein complex. Starting from this, we can infer the concentration of the construct by the equations:

Today we’re doing colonies’ PCR to confirm if our fragment was cloned on PSB1C3. We selected:
6 colonies of DH5a with BB_Essential in PSB1C3.
4 colonies of DH5a with BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3.
6 colonies of DH5a with BB_Bioremediation + BB_Essential in PSB1C3!
We used the following system:
Used primers: VR, VF2, for PSB1C3.
Electrophoretic PCR’s profile:
1– 4: BB_Bioremediation in PS1BC3
5 – 10: BB_Essential in PSB1C3
11 – 16: BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PS1BC3.
Yaaaayyy! BB_Bioremediation and BB_Essential were amplified, with the size we wanted. Now we have our bio bricks cloned separately in PSB1C3! Unfortunately BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation wasn’t amplified.
We made inoculum of the amplified colonies 2 and 3 from BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3; 2 and 4 from BB_Essential. Also – just out of curiosity – we made an inoculum of samples 1 and 4 from BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation.

We collaborated with Yale on their handout collating information from iGEM teams that have worked with non-model organisms; the handout being meant to guide and offer future iGEM teams considerations they may utilize if they choose to work with non-model organisms. Our 2015 team was contacted by Yale's iGEM team for input as we used Lactococcus lactis as the organism for our project. We also managed to get members from our 2014 team to fill out the survey as they had experience working with  non-model organisms such as Chlamydomonas reinhardti,Chlorella kessleri, and Chlorella vulgaris for their own iGEM project, Clean Green Lipid Machines."

Perhaps           critical thinking and ask questions in class is very common in Western country, however for the asian students, most of the time we are passively receiving from the teachers. But after the conference, we have set our mind to do some change.
We made a new friend tonight, a Taiwanese girl who studying in the United States.
She is a talkative girl and willing to share her experience and her life in the United State. We visit the campus National Tsing Hua University and enjoy our dinner together even we were a little bit messy due to the sudden pouring. In           the night, all of the participants take their time to get along with each other more and even play some cards game. We felt enriched today, everyone did a great job in this conference!
Day 4
We started our last day at the conference from the most hard-working and most amazing host, team NCTU-Formosa’s presentation. They have very amazing idea and they present in a creative way, we really learned a lot from them. Later, we watched a video           full of memory and reminded us those delightful time and friendship we have made together.
As for lunch, a hearty Taiwan traditional ”Ban Do” really surprised us with a lot of seafood and dishes, we really enjoyed it. It is a feast with many taiwanese dishes, our last meal at the conference really make a perfect ending.
In the afternoon, we went to Taipei with some new friends from NAU. We took a look at one of the most famous and the tallest building in Taiwan—Taipei101 and visited some department store near by. But tonight’s highlight will definitely           be when we were taking a stroll after dinner. Some street artists caught our ears with their amazing guitar sound and voice. Even more, a woman with grey hair dancing lovely to the music they played. After a song was ended, the woman introduced           herself with passion. And she was so smart that she knew our leader was just outshining. Both of them soon became friends and the scene of them dancing dynamically to the music is definitely the best picture on the street of Taipei!
Time flies. No matter what you do, we still have to say goodbye to each other. But at least, we are leaving with a lot of rewards!

Our team consisted of a dedicated group of 11 high school students that worked over the course of a year and two summers at the Ellington Lab at UTAustin.
We, in fact, began working on our project in the summer of 2016. However, all team members with the exception of one were new members who had acquired their lab skills and knowledge through the mentorship of past club leaders during the spring of 2016. As a result, the project moved along slowly and due to difficulties in raising money and in finishing the project, we decided to postpone going to iGEM 2016 and instead chose to work over the course of the upcoming year to make it to iGEM 2017.
Even with the added year, working as high school students with hardly any prior experience was very difficult. A massive influx of team members with no knowledge on synthetic biology and lab work also led to unforeseen complications during the 2016 - 17 school year. While headway was made on the project, we did not reach several of our initial goals:
In our initial project design, we aspired to eventually test our constructs alongside one another. We did not have enough time to reach this stage in our project.
We also had aspirations to do a video series where team members interviewed patients afflicted with Parkinson’s as well as other individuals with ties to the disease, such as medical professionals, family members, and directors of Parkinson’s organizations. This was unable to take place, though, as we were unable to get in contact with a number of groups and individuals.
Our project would not have been possible without the support we received. Below we have listed all the individuals and organizations that helped us go to iGEM:
GENERAL SUPPORT
Special thanks to Dr. Andrew Ellington, our PI, who provided us with the space, materials, and ideas needed for our project in addition to his guidance and financial support.
Dr. Dennis Mishler, our team mentor, provided us with advice on iGEM.

Procedure
Prepare a sheet in silico that contains all information you need for pipetting. For our purpose we created a suitable excel spreadsheet based on the one from Sun et al., 2013
Clean your working place thorough with 70% EtOH. Prepare RNase free micocentrifuge tubes. Let all aliquots thaw on ice.
Start to prepare your DNA samples by adding water, DNA, glutamate salts and any other item of choice to microcentrifuge tubes at room temperature.
Combine aliquots from 2. to a reaction buffer in a microentrifuge tube. Shortly vortex after the addition of each reagent and keep on ice.
At the latest after your reaction buffer is ready, prepare your measurement device (software program, temperature and so on).
Prepare a master mix made of reaction buffer and E. coli cell extract according to your spreadsheet, shortly vortex and keep on ice for now. From now on, do not waste excessive time with dreaming but work eagerly so that, as long as your template is missing, no energy in the buffer is wasted by cell extract proteins!
Add the calculated master mix amount to each of your DNA sample after carefully mixing the master mix. Attention: The master mix is viscous, avoid bubbles by pipetting the last drop to the tube wall.
Shortly vortex each sample and centrifuge for 30 s at 10000 g at room temperature. Thereby any residual sample will be brought down, and bubbles can be reduced.
Run the reaction
in the microcentrifuge tubes or
in a multi-well plate by transferring the samples into wells, sealing with appropriate foil to prevent evaporation. Optional: If you have a plate centrifuge, you can minimize bubbles in the plate with a short centrifugation step prior to measurement (4000 g, 30 s according to Sun et al., 2013 )
Attention: Consider a volume loss during pipetting. We routinely performed reactions at a final scale of 15 µL, but in our spreadsheet we calculated with 15.75 µL.
Run the reaction at the desired temperature for a desired time. In most of our experiments we measured for 3 h and saw no further raise in fluorescence signl. In most cases this is 37 °C but optimal temperature varies depending on protein product. Some proteins are well produced over a wide range of temperatures, which is the case for sfGFP.
Other considerations
For best performance, a DNA plasmid of high purity and water of high quality are recommended. For sfGFP expression plasmids we found that plasm"

Our goal is to specifically describe the system given different conditions, using ODE. The concentrations of the chemical species in the system are regarded as variables, which change over time. Thus, depicting how the concentrations of the molecules of interest change is the primary step.
Figure 1  Illustration of How the System Works
2.2 Notations of Important Variables and Chemical Species
In the model, a set of variables representing the concentrations of various chemical species in the system are used. All these variables are functions of time. The notations and corresponding meanings are listed below.
$H(t)$——concentration of 3OC6HSL in the cell
$I(t)$——concentration of luxI
$H_{ex}(t)$——concentration of 3OC6HSL outside the cell (in the medium)
$C(t)$——concentration of 3OC6HSL-LuxR complex
$R(t)$——concentration of LuxR monomers
$G(t)$——concentration of GFP
$Cas(t)$——concentration of dCas protein in the cell
$C^*(t)$——concentration of dCas/gRNA complex
$gRNA(t)$——concentration of unbound gRNA
$I^*(t)$——concentration of lacI
2.3 Details of Model Development
Next, we will dissect the reactions and events involved in the model. For each reaction involved, we will present the relevant assumptions, molecules involved, and formulae and parameters related to reaction rate or steady state.
1) AHL synthesis inside the cell
- Reaction: Precursors $\to$ AHL (3OC6HSL)
- Reaction rate: $v=k_0 I(t)$
- Relevant parameters: $k_0 \Rightarrow$ rate of synthesis of 3OC6HSL
Explanation/Assumptions: In bacteria, AHL is synthesized from its precursors via several enzymatic reactions. The last step of synthesis is catalyzed by protein luxI. Due to the scarcity of luxI protein in our system, it can be seen as the rate-limiting factor in the synthesis reaction. Thus, we assume the rate of synthesis of AHL is directly proportional to the concentration of luxI.
2) Diffusion of AHL out of the cell
- Event: AHL (in the cell) $\to$ AHL (outside the cell)             - Rate:$v=r(H(t)-H_{ex}(t))$"

We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system"
