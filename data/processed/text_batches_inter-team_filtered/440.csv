What to accomplish next
We are working on optimizing PCR amplification of MaSp and BsaI digestion so as to get the most amount of working monomers for ICA.--DONE! see here
We need to characterize our MaSp monomers and how they behave when used with the initiators, terminators, and capping oligos that are also used in ICA.--DONE! 6/3/2015
We are going to start actual ICA soon.--STARTED! see 6/19/2015
We are optimizing ICA to get it to work just right!
Our final goal is to make a several different 15-mers that have different rations of MaSp1 and MaSp2 that we can express and characterize.

Evry,2012,Team:Evry#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," with iGem from my bachelor. Because no team existed yet close to our university, William and I decided to create this team in November and we looked for interested people, funding and projects. I am very excited to be involved in this project with this wonderful team.
Jorgelindo Da Veiga Moreira
Master 1, AIV, Diderot University
I’m a bachelor graduated student from a Parisian engineering school. I look forward to a Master degree in biotechnology. I discovered synthetic biology mainly through conferences and I’ve been immediately fascinated by this new biological approach to work on living systems. iGEM is a good opportunity for me to start in this field and to acquire experience for my future engineering carrier.
Carolina Gallo Lopez
Master 2, mSSB, Evry university
Having acquired a background in biology and a first year of master in “Genomics, Cells, Development and Evolution” at the University of Paris Sud 11, I started to be interested in systems biology since my last year of bachelor and decided on getting involved in this approach during both my second year of master and my master’s thesis. I am participating in the iGEM competition as it allows me to combine experimental work with theoretical modelling. I am keen to learn not only different biological techniques and modeling approaches but also to learn from my teammates and other iGEM teams.
Tiffany Souterre
5th year, Sup'Biotech Paris
After a BTS in Biotechnology, I went to Sup'Biotech, an engineering school in Biotechnology. For 6 years, I have been studying DNA manipulation, bacteria transformation... but it is only recently that I have heard about Synthetic Biology. It is such a promising and interesting field but requires multidisciplinary skills. I am eager to increase my knowledge to be able to work at the interface of biology and computer science. I discovered iGEM thanks to the 2009 Sup'Biotech team and I have no doubt it will be a great opportunity to learn more, gain experience and hopefully bring a modest contribution to Synthetic Biology.

I did my bachelor in Edinburgh university, and came into contact with synthetic biology when I participated iGem with the 2010 Edinburgh team. My background is mostly molecular microbiology and biotechnology, but during iGEM I came into contact with modelling and how it could serve biology, thanks to the great modellers in our team. I decided to participate in mSSB in order to learn some more about modelling and programming so I could"

We did a group of pT181 attenuator expression experiments. First, as a part that needs to show strong inhibition, we should ensure that its inhibitory effect is obvious enough. Therefore, we compared experimental group and positive control group, which is transformed into a normal GFP plasmid. Depending on the GFP expression, we can prove that our work has a high credibility. Additionally, in the group above, three types of flora from Interlab are cultivated for contrast. The aim is to compare the statistics of pT181 attenuator and verified Interlab to find out which repressor level pT181 attenuator is in when put into practical application.
For this group, we transform different plasmids into the E. coli in the tubes and cultivate for hours (37℃, 220RPM). Then we used ELISA plate to detect the change of fluorescence and OD600 over time. What should be noticed is that we set the original flora at OD600=0.05 to guarantee flora proliferating at the same concentration. As the repression of pT181 attenuator attenuator is so powerful that the fluorescence of the experimental group is hard to detect. As a result, to remove LB medium’s fluorescence background, we centrifuge fluid, take out supernatant, add PBS buffer and resuspend before detect.
Results
The form showed in figure 21 tells that the expression of GFP is greatly decreased in the presence of pT181 attenuator of 18 hours of culturing. The data from figure 19 shows that the pT181 attenuator is not harmful to the cells. The data suggests that pT181 attenuator is a promising tool for the regulator part in our Three-Node Feedback Loop.

The result shows that the pT181 antisense is not harmful to the E.coli, which provides convenience for test for fluorescence as we do not need to normalize the OD600.

NCTU_Formosa,2012,Team:NCTU Formosa#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"Brick parts we used aim to translate enzymes or proteins which the pathway need and most of them are from MIT or the old BioBricks parts. Actually, they are really safe. As to promoting the yield, we use a temperature control mechanism, which was built up by our 2011 iGEM team, and add zinc finger to our primary BioBrick parts. Both of them are also quite safe though the latter is new part. For conclusion, no matter new or old, the BioBrick parts we used will not raise any safety issues.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
1.If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
2.If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
Yes, we have local biosafety committee and well discussed our project with them. In our university, National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), the Environmental and Safety Center (ESC) is strictly responsible for safety of all laboratory in the school. (National Chiao Tung University - Environmental Protection and Safety Center) All things we do or conduct in our project should follow the rules they have established. ECS manage all instruments and chemical materials, especially for toxic and dangerous ones. Before we begin our project, we have informed ECS on the basis of our project and what we are going to do and planning to do as detail as possible. We started the project only if we got ECS’s permission. In fact, they support our project and think it will not raise any safety issues in terms of researcher, public, even environment.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Enhancement of biosafety in the iGEM competitions needs the collaboration of every team as well as the iGEM committee. Every team should seriously follow the rules or guidelines their country, local biosafety group, or review board established. With doing so, we believe any issues about biosafety will be minimize. Moreover, everyone who participate in this competition should has some basic knowledge background and attend special lectures about how to minimize and deal with biosafety issues raised by experiments in synthetic biology. People who have nothing to do with iGEM or synthetic biology should also have simple concept about what synthetic biology or iGEM is. As so-called Human Practice, we really think that is very important. By knowing what we are doing, they will understand it can be safe if we conduct experiment"
UCL,2016,Team:UCL#HP#Silver#Elderly_-_-_TEXT.html," Kindergarten teacher, her children and their children and how things changed after her husband died and she moved to a home for the elderly. She told me about how she used to always be independent and saw herself as a modern woman taking fate into her own hands. Even at her nearly 90 years of age, the strength, resilience and power of her personality she was describing when taalking about her youth, shone through. It was difficult for me to change the topic from the positive and empowering aspects of her impressive life to the potential hardships she may be facing now in a care home.
I am not sure whether it was sheer ignorance to assume that when you are put into a care facility, you are stripped of your independence and pride, or whether it was the fear of the unknown for my family or even myself in the distant future. Nevertheless, I couldn't have been more wrong (or at least I was in Monika's case.) With the everlasting excitement in her eyes, she told stories of her grandchildren visiting her and how she was proud to be known as “cool grandmother”, always having their backs and helping them out when they have made a small mess of a situation.
When I asked her how things had changed over the years she told me “I used to always be happy… But now the sad thoughts are catching up with me but I don't let anyone know. Especially not my grandchildren - to them I still am a ‘happy grandma."" When I tried to enquire further about her sad thoughts, she blocked me off and told me it did not matter and that it was just a thing that happens when you get older. The momentary sadness in her eyes vanished in an instant as I saw the strong powerful woman inside trying not to let the distress get a hold of her.
Monika showed me that the character you have built up in your youth and early adulthood does not need to change as you grow older. She was still the strong powerful woman that she had described to me and, although she does require some assistance, she does not seem at all dependent or unhappy about the help that is provided to guide her through her everyday life. Lastly, she also opened my eyes to the fact that ageing is more than just a physical process but also a psychological one that can affect your mental wellbeing, which may need to be taken into greater consideration when providing for the elderly.

StanfordBrownSpelman,2014,Team:StanfordBrownSpelman#Amberless Hell Cell_-_-_TEXT.html,". The engineered genes will not have any effect in naturally-occurring bacteria in the environment, which lack the ability to translate UAG into leucine. We call this strategy Codon Security. Our project involves synthesizing UAG-leucine coded versions of the Hell Cell genes and inserting them into the amberless E. coli strain, along with a UAG-leucine (supP) tRNA [2]. This will create a strain of bacteria that is both resilient and safe for environmental applications.
Approach & Methods
We were interested in two avenues of research. The first was test our hypothesis that the amberless chassis would enable us to create an orthogonal protein expression system that would not function properly in other bacteria. By replacing 2-4 leucines with TAG stops in a gene, we make it such that an organism that does not express the supP tRNA, which translates UAG into leucine, produces a truncated product. We have named this novel system Codon Security. The second goal of the project was to apply Codon Security to the Hell Cell genes from our 2012 team in order to limit the horizontal transfer of resistance genes when using synthetic biology in the environment. Applying the Leucine->Stop modifications to the Hell Cell genes and transforming them into amberless cells, we could make the world's first Amberless Hell Cell.
Figure 2. We transformed DH5-alpha and amberless cells with test plasmids containing GFP or aeBlue reporter genes with stop codons and the supP tRNA in order to establish a proof-of-concept for Codon Security.
In order to test our hypothesis for Codon Security, we designed two test plasmids with GFP and aeBlue reporter genes. The BioBrick parts pages for these constructs are BBa_K1499252 and BBa_K1499253 respectively. The GFP generator construct was synthesized by taking the BBa_E0040 sequence, then modifying two leucine codons into TAG stops. Similarly, the aeBlue  construct was modified from iGEM Team Uppsala 2012's chromoprotein BBa_K864401 with three TAG stops coding for leucine. We chose to have the supP tRNA, which translates UAG to leucine, downstream of the terminator for the reporter genes. The supP tRNA sequence was found in Thorbjarnardóttir et al. [2]. However, we decided to include 100bp downstream and upstream of the tRNA coding region in the original organism to include any native promoters and assembly sequences to ensure normal tRNA"

Dilution Equation
Overview
The Imperial iGEM 2008 team has made an equation for calculating CFU from OD600. We tried to validate their equation by using our own data. Unfortunately the variation in our results was too high to validate their equation. Based on their results we made a calculator that could compute the optimal dilution for plating to get a countable number of colonies.
 
Method
All the LB plate counts that we have done in our project was gathered and analyzed for this experiment. the data that was used can be seen here.
 
Results
The Imperial College team  modulated following equation.
Imperial equation: Y= 2*108 *X
Y = CFU/mL
Figure 12. Our attempt to validate the Imperial College 2008 teams OD too CFU measurements. It is clear that the R2 value is not close optimal.
 
As can be seen from the figure 8 shown above our data could not validate the equation completely. Though our data trends towards Imperials 2008s equation.
 
Dilution predictor
An equation for predicting a dilutions that will result in a countable number of CFUs was made from the Imperial College equation. The equation assume that 100µl is plated on a LB plate. The optimal amount of colonies is set to 150CFU on each plate.
 
YCFU=2*XOD*108
Yoptimal=150CFU/plate. This number can be varied to fit the user's preference.
d is the optimal dilution factor for getting 150CFU/plate.  E.i. optimal dilution will be 10d.
\(Y_{optimal} = {{Y_{CFU} } \over {10^d* 10}}\)
\(Y_{optimal} = {{2*X_{OD}*10^8} \over {10^fd* 10}}\)
\(10^d= {{2*X_{OD}*10^8} \over {10*Y_{optimal}}}\)
\(d= log_{10}( {{2*X_{OD}*10^8} \over {10*Y_{optimal}}} ) , Y_{optimal}=150\)
\(d= log_{10}( {{2*X_{OD}*10^8} \over {10*150}} ) \)
\(d= log_{10}( {{1.33*X_{OD}*10^5} } ) \)

SAFE LAB WORK
To ensure the safety of team members and prevent hazardous side effects from our laboratory work, we strictly followed the basic standards of laboratory safety. All of our members were required to attend a lab tour offered by the School of Biomedical Sciences before gaining access to the lab. During the tour, rules and guidelines are reminded and procedures of operating different equipment are demonstrated by the lab technicians. Laboratory sessions were always conducted under the supervision of instructors.
With the concern of contamination, laminar airflow was ensured and safety equipment such as lab coats, surgery masks, and gloves were always worn. Also, since our lab work result in biological waste, the disposal of waste is carefully done under the required standards of lab safety to prevent risks to the environment. We classified the wastes into gel waste, bacterial waste, and the others. Liquid waste such as cell culture and agar plate treated by decontamination with autoclave and was disposed to the sanitary sewer system. For the dye, we do not use any EB throughout the project, but SYBR Safe instead.
SAFE PROJECT DESIGN
In our project, E. coli BL21 (DE3) and E. coli DH10β were used. Both of strain are classified in biosafety level 1 and included in risk group number 1 (low risk). It does not pathogenic in healthy people and also require no additional safety precautions. Yet young, elderly, immunocompromised individuals do have a higher risk of infection. To reduce the risk and minimize contamination of the experiment whether in the laboratory or workshop for the society, we wear lab coat and gloves and wash hands before leaving lab. The waste and contaminated gloves are also sterilized.
Our project design is also about biosafety! For the details, please visit our Project Description and Design page."

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Project#Implementation_-_-_TEXT.html," for the ONE PRIZE: Water as the 6th Borough was designed by the Canadians Ali Fard and Ghazal Jafari. These triangles, so called pods, fulfill different tasks such as the fixation of carbon dioxide, food production and local recreation without hindering the renewable energy generation, furthermore the transportation of passengers and goods.  As we were amazed finding such a great sustainable concept, we didn't hesitate to get in touch with Op.N (Ali Fard and Ghazal Jafari). We asked for their permission for mentioning their work on our page, and they gave us a nice and fast feedback affirming the ""great structural flexibility and expandability of the triangular floating pods"". We believe that this design is feasible and that an additional PhyscoFilter pod could extend this design. Using the rafts close to big cities doesn't bring along the problems other solutions have to face. Most cities use just a fraction of their water surface, leaving much space that could easily be made use of. At this point the the PARALLEL NETWORKS concept establishes. The raft's great flexibility also enable a short time of usage, simply changing their location if they get in the way of other schemes, avoiding greater costs.
Commercially available rafts called ""Kampen""

Figure 2 : Analyze of the  GFP fluorescence on non recombined Lambda phages (Lambda), recombined Lambda phages with the fragment 286-393 of the penton base (LambdaPb286-393), recombined Lambda phages with the complete penton base (1-571), GFP tagged adenovirus (Ad10 and Ad100)
Firstly, we observe that the recombined phage shows a tag difference independently of the fragment of the penton base used compared to the non transformed bacteriophage. Secondly, the recombined phage with the RGD fragment alone (286-393) has a higher fluorescence than the phage with a complete fragment and closer to the adenovirus one (figure 2).

Discussion
Even if the tissue vector has not been finished, scientific literature shows that a recombinant phage creation with a protein coding the adenovirus penton base is possible. It demonstrates as well that fragment coding for RGD sequence alone has a higher capacity to infect eukaryotic cells compared to the penton base complete fragment (figure 2). In the case of our application it is possible to use a recombined Lambda phage to insert our therapeutic gene.
Back to top
Conclusion
To conclude the RGD fragment of the penton base alone has a higher efficiency of interaction with integrines of eukaryotic cells. However for our project, it was more judicious to use the complete sequence of the penton base (fragment 1-571) because the use of the cell vector and the induction system by doxycycline give a very fast and target injection of bacteriophages. The use of a highly efficient transfection system is not advised because phages do not have the time to disperse properly and will infect several times the same cell. The use of the complete fragment of the penton base is sufficient for the phage to infect properly eukaryotic cells and let it time to have a bigger dispersion.

Antitumoral Plasmid
Context
In non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, like in all other cancers, the loss of apoptotic capacity of tumor cells is due to the functional loss of various tumor suppressors incoming in the apoptotic pathway.
The DVS application in the anticancer fight is based on the reactivation of this apoptotic pathway by bringing into tumor cells the wild type genes coding for functional tumor suppressors.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Project#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEM teams from all around the world to participate!
We (iGEM Calgary) helped out by asking Calgarians their favorite application of synthetic biology, containment concerns and how they feel about ethical issues surrounding genetically engineered organisms. A few of the responses we got are posted below. To view more pictures please visit the “ Humans and Synbio” Facebook page!
Do you think there is a limit in how far we should go with syn bio?
""Synthetic biology is an area of research which has unlimited potential for growth and innovation. I believe that synthetic biology has the capacity to be hugely advantageous to the scientific community and to society as a whole. It would be irresponsible to ignore the potentially harmful applications of synthetic biology, however, the potential benefits provided by research in this area exceed the disadvantages. Through establishing firm regulations in this area I believe that research can be conducted in a safe and productive manner. I believe it is the responsibility of members of society, including those in the scientific community, to establish the ethical groundwork which will shape the aims and applications of synthetic biology.""
In general, how do you feel about humans purposely modifying organisms or species so they will be more useful to us?
""If humans can benefit from modifying organisms or species they should, as long as it is done in a humane sustainable way.""
How would you define humane use of animals?
“By humane I mean in a way that doesn't cause unnecessary suffering or excruciating pain to the animals because life is precious and shouldn't be mistreated if we can help it.”
What is you favorite application of synthetic biology?
“I know it's an old school example, but my favorite application of syn bio would have to be when they got E. coli to make human insulin. That definitely revolutionized how we look at type 1 diabetes and really improved people's lives.”
Synthetic biology creates biological systems that do not naturally exist. Does anything about synthetic biology make you feel uncomfortable?
“The idea of synthetic biology doesn’t make me feel uncomfortable but the applications and potential outcomes are somewhat worrisome. I don’t know much about the topic on hand but just as long as there are regulations in place and governing bodies to overlook the research and applications, I would feel at ease with it all.”
How do you feel about humans purposely modifying organisms or species so that they will be more useful to us?
""I’m sure that there are benefits that do go along with that type of research, but I am a firm believer in the earth is where it is for a reason and we are where we are for a reason and life has evolved over millions of years without us having to make it better"

From the comparison between INSERT 2 and 3, we can see that activity of phytase from insert 3 drops more drastically than that of from INSERT 2, suggesting that SAPs will improve thermostability of phytase.
Project Achievements
Successes
We confirmed the deactivation of phytase due to heat shock.
We found the improvement of thermostability by SAPs.
Exposure of the His-tag due to SAPs is suggested.

Collaboration
Collaborations with iGEM Tec-Chihuahua Team were full of difficult challenges, but hard work and effort from both parts gave good results. Our team helped Chihuahua with the nanoparticles that they will use in their project. They sent us their protocols, and we conducted additional research by contacting experts on the field. This lead to us proposing a new protocol to Chihuahua Team, which they accepted, involving the transformation and chemical encapsulation with chitosan to improve the efficiency output of the reaction, as well as the preservation of the nanocapsules.

Düsseldorf
Collaboration
For our collaboration with iGEM Düsseldorf Team, our mathematical model members came up with an appropriate system of differential equations, MATLAB code, and Python code that accurately described the complex Trinity system, which involves three codependent entities growing in the same medium. Although we got stuck a few times with grasping conceptually the functioning of the system, and some technical aspects of the python simulation, our results and ideas proved to be very useful to their team, leading to the determination of the correct ratio of nutrients needed in order for their organisms to grow into a stable system.

Who is afraid of Synthetic Biology?
The mission – Conveying the message to the whole community
“Synthetic Biology” sounds like a very distant and complex field as well as being a fascinating field. This is the reason we decided to spread the team’s topic to as many people as possible who come from different backgrounds and ages. Kiryat Shmona is a small town bordering Lebanon and Syria. Surrounding the town are various types of settlements – Jewish settlements, Arab settlements, Kibbutzim (a type of communal village) and etc..
Social Justice
The concept is very familiar in the area we live: The northern periphery of Israel. Despite the cultural and economic disparities in the region, we decided to reach all population groups where it is possible to enrich their knowledge in the field of genetic engineering, At the same time to collect personal data. It is clear to us that the fact that we are participating in the competition is an extraordinary privilege we received and we wanted to share it with more groups.
We decided to approach everyone secular and religious; we went to Arab villages, kindergartens, old age homes, center for the blind and the cream of the crop – a respectable conference held at our high school. The topic of the conference: Synthetic Biology.
The messages conveyed at the multicultural meetings were scientific, educational, however at the same time motivational messages were transmitted by which anyone can fulfill their dream if only they are committed and willing to fulfill it.
Educational and scientific content at the multicultural meetings.
Wherever we visited we tailored the activity to the local culture and age.
The Center for the Blind – “Synthetic Biology Beyond Imagination.”
The blind population especially interested us, because we are talking about the sense of taste we thought that taste was very sharp with the blind. That called for us to prepare suitable activities for blind people and to have a more accurate explanation about Synthetic Biology.
The blind also came with the question whether it will be possible in"

The teams were given a total time of 2:30 hours to process the problem, come up with prospective solutions using the tools of Synthetic Biology and sum them up in a 5-minute presentation. Our team members as well as iGEM Thessaloniki’s members had a mentoring role in the aforementioned session, assisting the teams, discussing with them and offering their feedback.
Of course, the time given was not sufficient to fully grasp the essence of a problem, research all the relevant aspects and propose a well-defined solution. However, this was done intentionally, as our team’s main goal was to introduce the principles of synthetic biology and trigger students into engaging with SynBio.
The teams’ presentations exceeded everyone’s expectations. Some of the teams chose to tackle problems of their own interest, for example the development of an “Anti-Doping test for athletes” or the creation of a product that would “detect whether pesticides were used on fruit and vegetables.” At the same time, other teams amazed us with the approach of the problem, their ideas and their suggested solutions.
During the presentations, four specialists in the field of Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology joined us in order to provide the teams with feedback. Among them was Dr. Kostas Vavitsas, Prof. Georgios Skretas of the National Hellenic Research Foundation, and Dr. Pelli Foka and Dr. Timos Karamitros of the Hellenic Pasteur Institute. Along with the four specialists-judges, the mentors and the audience engaged in a discussion regarding the teams’ proposals and the tools of Synthetic Biology.
Apart from successfully organizing and hosting the SynBio Workshop, our team must, and is proud to, note the creation of two new iGEM Teams for the 2019 Competition. Both those teams were created by university students that participated in our workshop. Naturally, we are elated to observe that our initiative sparked students’ interest in Synthetic Biology and led them to create their own iGEM teams.

T7-terminator plus signal
Optimization of the signal sequence
As for the His-terminator, we tried to optimize our signal sequence to find the minimal sequence length which still enables antitermination.
We finally found that a signal with overall 8 nt, 3 nt for the random signaling part and 5 nt for the part which partially binds to the T7-terminator,  5' AUGCUAUA 3', suffice to enable anti-termination as the picture and the corresponding video below display.
Minimal signal length that still enables anti-termination.
Close
Results
We demonstrated that in theoretical simulations the T7-terminator work well. It's less stable than the His-terminator (and rather a lot of bases are unpaired), but its more stable than the Trp-terminator. For appropriate signal length the terminator is not folding at all, that is antitermination occurs. We also demonstrated that a signal length of 8 nt is sufficient for antitermination to happen.
Logic gate
After establishing that our switch works as designed, we combine two switches to build an AND gate an investigate it with further simulations. We used the His-terminator, the Trp-terminator and two corresponding signals with different random signaling parts. Having different signaling parts is necessary, as if one uses the same one in both signals, the AND gate will be transformed into a OR gate and will have the output 'true' even in the case that only one signal is present. We linked all the sequences with a 34 X linker. As above both terminator and signal sequences comprise two and three parts respectively:
the terminator and a part which partially binds to the terminator respectively (marked green),
random signaling part and antisense to the random signaling part respectively (marked red).

What comes to your mind when you are told about biotechnologies?
The horizons that synthetic biology opens up are simply extraordinary. For me this is only the beginning of this discipline and the advances that we could make in the years to come could change many aspects of our society. I am really proud to be able to participate in its development through this student project.
Younes Bouchiba
Why did you take part in iGEM?
Since i heard about the iGEM competition, it became a goal to me. The opportunity of conceiving and achieving a scientific project is the consecration of my universitary life. It is a huge challenge and it allowed me to challenge my limits and my will of succeeding.
What was your responsability during this project?
I was chosen as the student leader of our team,. I was also accountable for the experimentations and lab organization. As I am studying Bioinformatics, I took part in the wiki creation and overviewed the molecular modeling aspect of our project. My fluency in molecular biology permitted me to take a big part in the molecular design of our project.
What did you learn from this experience?
I first learned how to properly perform a bibliography about a scientific topic. During our brainstorming time at the beginning of our project, I learned how to find, analyse and summarize information. I also learned how in silico design can be transposed in vitro and in vivo . For the first time of my life I was able to concretize an idea in the wet lab, from the conception to the experimentation.
To what extends have this experience changed the way you conceive your future job?
As my dream is to become a researcher in system biology, the experience of this scientific project allowed me to test myself in a real situation. The universitary cursus gave me a wide point of view of biology but did not bring me to take part in such a project. The opportunity of designing and realizing a synthetic biology project is a keystone for my life as a scientist.
What comes to your mind when you are told about biotechnologies?
Biotechnologies are a newborn field in the experimental sciences. Sadly, due to controversies, it could have a bad reputation. From my point of view, it is a tool, and as every tools, how you use it will define the impact that it will have on society. I love biotechnologies because they help us to understand biological systems and give us hopes for a better future. It has already revolutionized health by increasing our understanding of diseases and decreasing the cost of drugs,"

Smile, you're on camera!
The promotion of our iGEM project is important, both for allowing many people to know about our project and for helping us for the sponsoring. This year, we are lucky to be interviewed by two radios: Radio Campus and NRJ but also by the newspaper Direct Matin and our University.
We also created a Wordpress in order to keep the memories of this 2016 edition (but it is only available in french).
As last year, the University is still interested by our project for the iGEM competition. This year, Yoann Frontout came to visit us at our laboratory to interview the team in order to discover our new project. The interview was very fun for everyone and the journalist really saw our passion and our motivation through the answers to his questions. Click here to read the interview!
iGEM Bordeaux: Guests of
What is synthetic biology?  What is the iGEM competition? Why are we interested in synthetic biology? Is it a new mood?
Our team members tried to answer to those questions at Radio Campus, the official radio of Bordeaux University.
Hiba, Alice, Linejy and little Marie, 4 members of our team assisted to « Campus News ». First, we presented what is synthetic biology which was a good exercise for us because the audience is a mix of students and non scientific people. We talked about the competition and the recruitment process, the journalist was impressed by our passion and our motivation to do all that work. She asked us to describe clearly and easily our project “Sleep with EpiC elegans”, which concern a majority of students who doesn’t sleep a lot because of homeworks or parties. During the show, we also played answering to some scientific questions related to history, or daily life.

Cell vector
The cell vector has to reach the target cell and delivers the therapeutic gene insert .
To be an efficient targeting cell vector, he has to get several important characteristics. He has to target specifically the interest cell type, the one to cure. As a phage vector, he has to be able to cross the eukaryotic cell membrane and deliver his content in an efficient way.
You are going to discover, across this chapter, what kind of characteristics have been decisive in order to choose the best bacteriophage.
Then, you are going to discover, in details, its properties according to the DVS characteristics: tissue deliverance, therapeutic plasmid encapsidation, and cell targeting.

The cell vector: The lambda phage [1,2]
We have studied several kind of phages, in order to select the cell vector the most controllable, and adaptable. So, we have identified all the different kind of phages, and in one kind of phage, the species the most described. Several candidates have retained our attention, but it is the lambda phage which seems to be the most adapted.
The lambda phage is a prokaryotic virus, which infects the bacteria Escherichia coli. This is a tempered phage, because it can alternate lytic and lysogenic cycle under some conditions. During the lytic cycle, the circular DNA is replicated in great quantity in the cytoplasm; a lot of viral progeny are formed, driving to"

This conversation with Alexandria allowed us to deepen our understanding of Australian patent law which help shaped the legal and regulation component of our project.
Dr. Brad Walsh
Chief Executive Officer - Minomic ™
Dr. Brad Walsh is the CEO of Minomic, an immuno-oncology company headquartered in Sydney, Australia. We spoke with Brad to discuss the science behind our project, and the challenges involved with commercialising biological inventions in Australia. Brad has significant experience in both of these areas, holding a PhD in chemistry, a seat on the NSW State Committee for AusBiotech Ltd and has 30 years of experience in the Australian biological commercialisation space.
As we discussed the function of our scaffold with Brad, he noted that intermediate loss within enzyme mediated reactions isn’t the only problem our scaffold fixes. He highlighted how arranging the enzymes themselves into tethered spatial organisation could have further applications. For example, the possibility of assisting bioremediation through metabolic engineering, or even adapting our system to the drug targeting space. Although these suggestions weren’t directly incorporated into our enzyme-centric design, the suggested apllications were in the forefront of our minds as we discussed the future of our project with the wider community.
Brad also explained the products that Minomic is developing, focusing on MiCheck, a prostate cancer diagnosis tool, which works through antibody mediated analysis of serum samples. From when Minomic attained licence for this product, it took 4.5 years and $25M AUD to take it to market, despite the large quantity of research available verifying both its function and safety. One of Brad’s key messages from this was how important it is to know your target customers before attempting to integrate the product into the market, something we took on board with our product design and commercialisation . He explained how Minomic achieves this through surveys of relevant industry professionals, such as insurers and healthcare practitioners, to ascertain where their device would fit on the industrial market compared to current technologies. Brad advised us moving forward to conduct market analysis inorder to suitably determine a market need and prince for our scaffold if we were to scale it up in the future.
The conversation then turned to the social and ethical aspects of synthetic biology. Brad brought to our knowledge the problem of underrepresentation of women in the synthetic biology space wile also delving into the importance of collaboration, with him telling us the need for the support of his collaborators whilst trying to prove the legitimacy of the Minomic in an overseas market. This influenced the direction of our outreach work , with our team"

British_Columbia,2013,Team:British Columbia#Project#Caffeine_-_-_TEXT.html," would largely build on the previous efforts of the 2012 TU Munich team , which successfully obtained caffeine precursors when expressing caffeine’s biosynthetic machinery in yeast.
Chemistry
Caffeine biosynthesis occurs by successive modifications to purine nucleotide precursors such as AMP and GMP. Starting with xanthosine as substrate, the pathway below depicts the final stage of caffeine synthesis in organisms such as Coffee arabica. Xanthosine methyltransferase (XMT) starts by methylating xanthosine with the ubiquitous methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-Met (SAM), which acts as methyl donor for all subsequent methylations in the pathway. XMT also catalyzes the second step of the pathway, the removal of the ribose group.
Characterization
We obtained the three genes required for caffeine biosynthesis from the 2012 TU Munich . This included CaXMT, CaMXMT, and CaDXMT, which had previously been based on the natural plant genes and codon-optimized for expression in yeast. While not codon-optimized for expression in bacteria, believed that we could express them first in a rare codon-supplemented bacteria such as Rosetta Cells™. That way we could determine if it was possible for these three enzymes to be well expressed and obtained in an active form in bacteria before proceeding to the more costly step of codon-optimizing them for bacterial expression.
We proceeded by removing the yeast ribosome-binding site (rbs) and replacing it with a bacterial Shine-Dalgarno sequence. Each gene was cloned separately under an arabinose-inducible promoter (pBAD) and a constitutive promoter (pTET), in addition to a construct with all three under the same promoter. Expression was tested in a variety of conditions in E. cloni® 10G cells, but no expression was detected (Figure 1). This was expected as the genes are not optimized for normal bacterial expression. Unfortunately, Rosetta Cells™ already contain a chloramphenicol plasmid, pRARE, and as such, these caffeine constructs could not yet be transformed into the Rosetta Cells for further expression testing. Efforts are now under way for a kanamycin resistance marker to be cloned into each caffeine enzyme construct to allow for compatibility with the Rosetta Cells™.

The N-terminal transmembrane α-helix of human EGFR ( UniProt P00533 , amino acids 622-653) was herefore chosen (see below the topology prediction of EGFR via the TMHMM 2.0 server for the prediction of transmembrane helices [5] ). A stop-transfer sequence, that is also present in the endogeneous EGFR, consisting of clustered, positively charged amino acids - being characteristic for type I membrane proteins - was added at the C-terminus, and the sequence was furthermore flanked by a (GGGGC)2-linker at the N- and C-terminus, respectively. The addition of a stop-transfer sequence as in the naturally occuring EGFR sequence, as well as the addition of flexible linkers, makes our EGFR-TMD an improvement over the BioBrick BBa_K157002 , which does not possess either of these elements.

C) Schematic depiction of the C-terminal stop-transfer sequence of the receptor.
Reporter proteins were included into the design to facilitate later characterization
Moreover, the receptor contains three functional elements for its detection: The intracellularly located red fluorescent protein mRuby 3 for detection of the receptor via fluorescence microscopy, an extracellular epitope domain for immunochemical detection via A3C5-antibody fragments and an intracellular Strep-tag II for the detection and purification via immunochemical methods.
The vector furthermore contains the poly-adenylation signal of human growth hormone (hGH) for functional polyadenylation of the transcribed mRNA. A description for the respective functional elements is given in the following sections.

All of the great time and long hours we spent working in the lab led us to this very point where you are reading the lab notebook                  of our project in our wiki. Please keep in mind that this page took the longest time and the biggest effort to write, since it was                  compiled out of a whole summer. We’d be delighted if this page could provide the slightest help to any future iGEMmers as we’ve all                  been through this path.

with initial conditions:
$$ \large{ \begin{eqnarray} LS(0)&=&LS_{0}, \quad \mu M \nonumber \\ \nonumber SE(0)&=&SE_{0}, \quad \mu M\\  PC(0)&=&0, \quad \mu M \tag{Eq 2}\\   La(0)&=&0. \quad \mu M \nonumber \end{eqnarray} } $$
The parameters were estimated by considering the steady state of the system. Setting the left hand side of (Eq 1) to zero gives:
$$ \large{ \begin{eqnarray} K_{2} PC&=&K_{1} LS \cdot SE, \nonumber \\ K_{1} LS \cdot SE&=&K_{2} PC - K_{3} PC. \tag{Eq 3} \end{eqnarray} } $$
Rearranging (Eq 3) gives:
$$ \large{ \begin{equation} \frac{PC}{LS \cdot SE}=\frac{K_{1}}{K_{2}}. \tag{Eq 4} \end{equation} } $$
Considering the first binding reaction, it was found that the total concentration of lanosterol synthase, \(LST\), will be equal to:
$$ \large{ \begin{equation} LST=LS+PC. \tag{Eq 5} \end{equation} } $$
Now using (Eq 4) and (Eq 5) it can be written that:
$$ \large{ \begin{equation} \frac{LS}{LST}=\frac{1}{\frac{K_{1}}{K_{2}} SE_{0} + 1}. \tag{Eq 6} \end{equation} } $$
It is known that the ratio between lanosterol synthase and squalene epoxide is:

Motivation and Goals
This year’s modelling project focused on extending the work done by the modelling team in 2010.
Waterloo’s 2010 iGEM project, ""Staphiscope"", utilized amplifier parts developed by Cambridge in 2009 to detect low levels of Staph Aureus. These amplifier parts were characterized by the Cambridge team, but only under control of AraC/pBAD promoter, which differed from the promoter used in our 2010 Staphiscope project.
In order to characterize the amplifiers, a parameter scan was undertaken to find promoter-independent Hill parameters of each amplifier, consistent with data of full system. However, empirical verification of our results was lacking. This year, we sought to obtain this data, which (in conjunction with Cambridge data and model), would allow us to find Hill parameters for each amplifier.
Model
To allow for comparison of data, we used the same model as Cambridge in 2009 .
In this model, araC represses the pBAD promoter in the absence of the inducer, arabinose. When arabinose is present, it binds to araC, preventing repression of the promoter and allowing transcription of reporter (GFP). This situation is modelled by a Hill function; we seek the Hill parameters of this function.
Thus, when AraC/pBAD system is induced with arabinose, we expect to see a steady increase of fluorescence from a low level, followed by a plateau of fluorescence at steady state.
Method
To measure fluorescence, we closely followed the assay described in the paper ""Measuring the activity of BioBrick promoters using an in vivo reference standard"" , in the section ""Assay of Promoter Collections"".
Three cultures were grown overnight at 37 degrees Celsius with spinning at 200 rpm: untransformed BW27783, BW27783 containing BBa_I0500, and BW27783 containing BBa_I20260. These were then diluted 1:100 and regrown for roughly 4 hours under the same conditions. They were then"

learnsynbio
Our main outreach initiative is a series of Synthetic Biology learning modules which we call LearnSynBio.org.             After the success of our 2015 educational outreach, we wanted to switch gears and target our outreach efforts             to a demographic which has not received as much attention for educational outreach.
Most outreach seemed targeted either to young children, with the hopes of  introducing them to science in general,          or to the general population, with the hopes of sparking a discussion about the ethical concerns and societal          implications of synthetic biology. But we found comparatively little that reached out to high school students          who are on the cusp of deciding potential career paths in a way that introduced them to synthetic biology as an          actual scientific field. These students seemed like an ideal audience for our outreach efforts.
Since many of the core concepts within synthetic biology are fairly simple to understand with only limited background          knowledge, we set out to create educational materials targeted explicitly towards these high school students in order          to introduce them to the field of synthetic biology as a potential, and perhaps exciting, career option.
LearnSynBio consists of four modules of instructional videos and supplemental materials (worksheets) which are meant          to introduce high school students with basic biology and math background to the ideas in Synthetic Biology. LearnSynBio          is organized into four modules: an Introduction to Basic Biology Concepts, an Introduction to Experimental Techniques          used in Synthetic Biology, an Introduction to Genetic Circuit Theory and Mathematical Modeling, and a module on the          Ethics and Implications of Synthetic Biology.
In order to develop our materials effectively, we spoke with our former high school biology teachers to ask them what          features they would like to see present in LearnSynBio in order to best facilitate its incorporation into the classroom.          They emphasized the relatively short, discrete nature of the videos (preferring several videos in a module to one long          video), and really emphasized the importance of supplemental materials like worksheets which reinforce and complement          the material presented in the videos, and we incorporated these suggestions into the design of LearnSynBio.

Because LearnSynBio is hosted on an independent domain, it is easily accessible anywhere by anyone and can easily          be maintained and updated with feedback from teachers who use it. This allows our outreach efforts to continue even          in places and times where we cannot be physically present!

NAWI_Graz,2018,Team:NAWI Graz#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," really that much of a concern about deforestation, species extinction and the like.
Our interview-partner didn’t seem opposed to our project and thinks that Malaysians will be accepting of it. The University of Manchester iGEM Team 2013 concluded in their Human Practice work that the best way to avoid negative consequences for the economy of the palm (kernel) oil producing countries would be to patent the project and give patent licences to these countries (1). In our interview however, the plantation owner wasn’t convinced that Malaysia will adept to such change.
We are very glad that we had the chance to get the perspective of somebody who is involved in the palm (kernel) oil industry, as we want our project to be as ethical as possible.

Interviews
Interview with Marianne Klute from „Rettet den Regenwald“ (summary)
Marianne Klute is graduated chemist and lived in Indonesia for about 15 years herself. Within the environmental organization “Rettet den Regenwald”, which means ‘save the rainforest’ in German, she is responsible for the Indonesia program. The main activity of the institution is the support of local organizations in concerned regions, both financial and with knowledge. At that, they work together with partners in different countries like Indonesia, Africa and South America but also with other European and local environmental organizations. The biggest strength of the institution: petitions and a wide range; these ‘weapons’ can help and change a lot.
The catastrophe of deforestation: causes, impacts and solutions
The exploration of the rainforest started in 1984 along with the first boom in palm oil consumption. Despite for palm plantations, forest is cleared for wood and paper industry. The deforestation occurred in steps and stands in close relationship to expulsion and destruction of the rainforest.
Since 2000, the political development and the Asiatic crisis played an important role. Enormous pressure of finance institutions to invest in money-spinning sectors, leads to further exploration of resources. As a result, palm oil is ranked in first place as crude product. At this point of time the majority (~70%) of the oil is used in food industry, a small part in cosmetic and household industry and only a fractional amount is used for bio fuels. In 2005, with changes in energy politics and the promise of industrial countries to use renewable resources in propellants, the palm oil use in the energy sector took a big leap. This happened at expense of the rain forest.

Experiment:
10/08/16: sfGFP(Sp) was amplified from pNW plasmid together with its    promoter (Ppta), which is a constitutive promoter from Geobacillus DSM2542 for phosphate acetyl transferase expression, and a triple    terminator (3TER). Primers used for the amplification were F-gfp insert    and R-gfp insert (primer sequences can be found here ).

Figure 2. DNA electrophoresis with amplified     Ppta-sfGFP(Sp)-3TER (1147 bp in size).
Conclusion:
Amplification of the Ppta-sfGFP(Sp)-3TER was successful. It was    verified by DNA electrophoresis. Correct size of a band    could be seen and that was 1147 bp. However second band could be seen,    that was probably caused by unspecific binding of the primers used.    Therefore lower band of correct size was cut out from the gel and DNA    was extracted.
Procedure after gel validation:
DNA extraction was done according to this protocol .
Restriction digestion
Experiment:
10/08/16: On this day restriction digestion of PCR product of the    sfGFP(Sp), pDR111 integration plasmid and pDR111+message    integration plasmid was done. sfGFP(Sp) as an insert was cut with BglII    and NheI restriction enzymes. Integration plasmid pDR111 and    pDR111+message as a vector was cut with BamHI and NheI. BglII could not    be used as a restriction enzyme for pDR111 due to multiple recognition    site of this cutter. BamHI as a compatible restriction enzyme to BglII    was used instead.

Brown,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Limiter#network_-_-_TEXT.html," a constitutive promoter by putting a repressor under the control of each (alpha and tau, respectively) and setting them in mutual inhibition.
Where A induces a level of expression below that of the constitutive promoter, tau represses alpha, is expressed at a stable level, and represses R as well.  In this manner, the activity of R is switched off when G's expression is below the defined threshold.  Where high levels of A cause G to be overexpressed, it induces alpha as well, repressing tau and allowing R to bring the expression of G back down to a normal level.
In a possible end-use of this limiter network, the gene we wish to limit ""G"" and its activating transcription factor ""A"" are endogenous to the organism we wish to regulate.  We introduce the transcription factor ""R"" to repress G, as well as the bistable pair alpha and tau that serve to regulate R's repression.  As natural transcriptional control systems lack the modular specificity that our network requires, to implement our network we turn to a rationally-designed synthetic system of transcription factors.

Cell Viability & Fatty Acid Quantification
Cell Viability
Cell Culture and Transfection
We cultured HEK293FT cells following the American Type Culture Collection’s standard procedure, except that we have used DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin for our culture medium. For transfection, we followed the manufacturer’s protocol of LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen). We used serum-free and antibiotics-free DMEM to form a DNA-lipofectamine complex.
Cell Line
In our project, two mammalian cell lines were used: human hepatoma cell (HepG2 cell) and human embryonic kidney 293 cell (HEK293FT). HepG2 cells were used for characterizing inducible promoters and glyoxylate systems. For higher transfection efficiency, the characterizations of mitochondrial leader sequence and constitutive promoter CMV were conducted using HEK293FT cells.
Cell Culture
HepG2 and HEK293FT cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 50ug/mL penicillin, 50ug/mL streptomycin at 37℃in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were transfected in petri dishes and multi-well plates with different construct Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen; Carlsbard, CA) according to manufacturer’s protocols. Any GFP signals were observed under fluorescent microscope or under confocal microscope if necessary.
Cell Viability
We designed to introduce an inducible system that allows tunable fatty acid uptake by sensing fatty acid concentrations. Fatty acids uptake was to be quantified to compare the activities of wild type cells and cells expressing inducible glyoxylate shunt.

It also increases the degradation rate of mRNA when it is bound in dsRNA due to the presence of the Hfq binding site on the asRNA sequence which is suspected to recruit RNase to degrade the targeted RNA chain.
Fig. 1 Positive Feedback loop of the Sensing Module
2 System of Reactions
We can describe the Sensing module as elaborated above with this set of reactions:
Note that in our construct LuxR is constitutively produceed, and thus, treating its production and degradation as in         equilibrium, we assume they are conserved.
Note that in the second equation, which accounts for the diﬀusion through the membrane, if the intracellular AHL concentration         is lower than the extracellular concentration, the rate would become negative and this would represent AHL diﬀusing         into the cell. If the rate is positive, it would represent AHL diﬀusing out of the cell.
3 Approximations
3.1 Quasi-Steady-State Approximation
To simplify our model, we apply the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA). Because the rate of binding and dissociation         are much faster than the rate of transcription and translation, we can simplify the set of reactions by treating         some reactions as being in steady-state equilibrium.
This approximation is applied to the reactions of
AHL and LuxR into LuxR_AHL and (LuxR_AHL)2
(LuxR_AHL)2 and pLuxR
asRNA and mRNA
3.2 Solution Volume Approximation
Because the volume of a cell is generally much smaller than the volume of the solution it is in, we apply the approximation         that AHL diﬀusing into or out of the cell has no eﬀect on the extracellular AHL concentration.
This approximation is applied to the diﬀusion reaction of AHL into and out of the cell.
4 Simulations
To simulate the system, we implemented Euler’s method for approximating ordinary diﬀerential equations and applied             the approximations as stated.
4.1 Simulation without asRNA
First, we simulate the model without asRNA to show how leakiness can potentially cause problems due to the positive             feedback loop.
Fig. 2 Positive feedback loop simulation from [AHL]extracellular = 0 M
The graph shows a simulation where the initial concentration of AHL is 0. The amount of AHL in the cell steadily             increases even though no AHL was added, which means that the leakiness of the promoter is creating more AHL,             which then"

We choose to approximate the citizen science group by examining the DIYBio network. As of October 2013, there are 42 groups DIYBio groups declared worldwide and 3353 members on DIYbio Google group mailing list. Disposable income for biotechnology pursuits vary, and we approximate expenditure between £500 and £1000, therefore we used £750 to estimate the DIYBio budget, placing it at 2.25 million. At present, only the UK market is accessible to us, which is approximately 0.67 million pounds.
Initially we predict to sell our products to secondary schools and citizen science early adopters. In the mid-term we want to increase our sales to the citizen science market, which we expect to become our main market in the long-term future. Currently citizen science in biotechnology is still a very niche field. However, as stated our aim is to increase biotechnology visibility in society and create a personal synthetic biology market.
Competitor Analysis
Market reaction
We considered 3 different groups that could be possible affected by our product's entry into market: DIY Biology companies, Global Biotechnology companies and Specialised companies. For each, we choose one example and evaluated the impact of our product.
DIY Biology Companies
Example: IO rodeo Most likely group to be affected initially by the Darwin Toolbox entry into the market, and also the most important group with regards supporting and growing our target market. Like our start-up, small companies typically struggle to compete with regards resources and reach. However they may also be sources of collaboration instead of competition.
Global Biotechnology Companies
Example: Bio-rad This group is unlikely to be affected in the first couple years. As their products are currently sold in mass quantities and with restricted accessibility to individuals, they don't currently reach Darwin Toolbox's target market. They may react to youGEM's entry by making their products better towards individuals.
Specialised Companies (e.g. forensics)
Example: Sirchie Similar to global companies, this group is unlikely to be immediately affected initially as it is well established. However as this group target a niche market, they may later be challenged by Darwin Toolbox's broader scope.
Competitor Analysis
There are no direct competitors who provide an alternative to our product. Our competition is more indirect and falls into three broad categories: companies offering laboratory equipment hardware kits, laboratory equipment supply and educational biotechnology kits. We assessed our product in comparison to other companies by the following criteria, and the results can been seen in the table below.

Human Practices - TECH
Sharing information and igniting interest in synthetic biology
Even though the field of synthetic biology may seem difficult to define and beyond the remit of many people’s day to day lives, its presence in our homes and workplaces is ever growing.
Many of the foods we buy, medicines we use and services that are offered would not exist without synthetic biology and are very much taken for granted. This means that without knowledge of a product's origin, production process, proper usage and disposal, some risks are inevitable. For these reasons, we believe it is vital to make information accessible to people in all walks of life, allowing them to make informed decisions.
We have tried to demonstrate a model for achieving this through integrating education, increased public awareness and of course, igniting curiosity in synthetic biology.
iGEM Stockholm’s human practices project extends far beyond the bench through our novel integrated TECH (iTECH) model, bringing together the four different components of our Human Practices work: Teaching, Evolving, Community & Health.
TEACHING: Schools Projects
EVOLVING: Makerspace Lab & Workshops
COMMUNITY: Integrating Human Practices & Nordic iGEM Conference
HEALTH: Expert advice and the development of SMITe
The iTECH model framework has allowed us to develop a public dialogue, which engages with different groups of the population about synthetic biology and the journey from the lab towards our product. Overall this vastly improved the foundations of our research and challenged us to question how and why our project could be successful.
The following are different ways our Human Practices project has impacted our society:
Raising awareness of synthetic biology at all educational levels (spanning ages 9-11, 15-18 and 20+ in different arms of the project)
Providing an educational backdrop for young researchers on a practical and theoretical basis
Encouraging creative thinking in the approach to combating deep seated problems
Introducing innovative new approaches to treating chronic wounds
Promoting consideration of the global impact of human civilisation and how we can use synthetic biology in the future to adapt to a changing world
Predicting the consequences of inaction in relation to antimicrobial resistance on future generations

Overview of our Design
There we show the schematic diagrams of both Excision-model and inversion-model we designed. Both of these models are designed in a very compact way, involving transcription in both sense and anti-sense direction. Each model contains 4 MCSs representing 4 separated regions A/B/C/D we’ve discussed above. User can insert target gene selectively to construct desired logic gate. For example, if we insert RFP in all MCS_B/C/D as well as a GFP linked tandemly behind RFP in MCS D, then we can get a circuit calculating OR gate for RFP and AND gate for GFP simultaneously. Quite convenient, isn’t it!
Let’s move on and take a closer look at how these models operate, starting with excision-model.
In low-[Tet]-low-[TM] condition, pTRE promoters are silenced. And transcripts derived from MCS_C will undergo rapid degradation due to existent of ribozyme in their 3’UTR, leaving transcripts from MCS_A be the only active mRNA capable of translating.
In high-[Tet]-low-[TM] condition, all pTRE promoters start to work. Tet-induciable shRNA targeting A&C starts to knock them down. In two kinds of remaining transcripts derive from pTRE, only C can survive while D carrying a ribozyme in its 3’UTR.
In low-[Tet]-high-[TM] condition, Cre reconbinase is activated by TM. Therefore sequence between two loxPs will be excised, while all pTRE will go for strike unless Tet is added, leaving C the only active transcription cassete free to express.
In high-[Tet]-high-[TM] condition, every pTRE that went for strike, back to its position due to present of Tet. Among them there is shRNA targeting C, thus D becomes the only survivor to report its signal.
excision-model is quite straight forward as explained in “Fill in Elements” section. Yet inversion-model is trickier. Let’s forget about region A and consider a 2-input-3-output inversion-model first.
In high-[Tet]-low-[TM] condition, only B is transcribed and translated. When it comes to low-[Tet]-high-[TM] condition where pTRE is off，activated Cre recombinase recognizes and inverses two loxP along with sequence bedded within, turning CMV promoter toward MCS_C and start transcription.
In high-[Tet]-high-[TM] condition, sequence between two lo"

Since there were 2 of our team members participating in UIUC’s summer studentship, we had on-line conference with Team UIUC as well. Through the discussion, we introduced each member in both teams, shared our works, designs and any other problems about practicing the project to each other. After the project discussion, they shared their experience of iGEM, especially about the regional jamboree.
On-line Conference with UIUC
Questionnaire and Analysis
We also performed a survey on how medical students and doctors know about synthetic biology, and their interests in related research. Results of the survey showed that after our introduction, most of the medical students in NTU didn’t understand what “synthetic biology” was, its application and implication were before. But more than 75% were quite interested in knowing more information or participating related research. The doctors’ points were more conservative, especially on the issue of utilizing synthetic biology on medical and pharmaceutical use.
Questionnaire
Results and Discussion
1.Have you ever heard of the term “synthetic biology”?
The pie-charts below showed that the same percentage of the doctor and the student attendees heard of the term “synthetic biology”. This result means that less than 40% of the attendees knew what synthetic biology is.
2.Have you ever heard of or gotten involved in research regarding synthetic biology?
The pie-charts below showed that the less percentage of the attendees knew some related research than the one heard of “synthetic biology”. And the student attendees knowing related research were slightly higher than doctors.
3.Have you ever heard of or used synthetic biology-related medical products, drugs or therapies?
Compared with question 2, there were more attendees heard of synthetic biology-related medical product than research. This suggests that it was easier to get the information of product than research, and that the medical students and doctors might know synthetic biology-related research via medical issues.
4.Our introduction enhanced your understanding of synthetic biology.

A MTT test allowed to quantify the effect induced by the p53 wild type expression into infected cells.
Figure 3 : AdCMV.p53 effect on cell survive. Control and AdCMV.p53 infected cells were incubated in serum-free media after 1h of infection.
In serum absence, non-infected and ßgal infected cells continue to proliferate. In contrast, for p53 infected cells, proliferation is stopped and followed by an important fall of population. After 72h, nearly the totality of p53 infected cells were dead (figure 3).
According to this study, it appears clearly that to bring a p53 wild-type version into the p53 mutated cell population induces the apoptosis phenomenon and decreases significantly the tumor population.
Similar results were reported in the study leaded by Corrado Cirielli (in 1999) by using similar analyses on a U251 cancer strain from a glioma.

Experiments and Results
In this project, we designed and contructed 2 DNA nanostructures: NDC and NDC-AS, demonstrated their therapeutic effects on MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, and synthesized them by operating BioBricks in E. coli DH5alpha.
All error bars in graphs indicate 95% confidence interval of triplicates in experiments, unless otherwise specified.
DNA Nanostructures
Construction and Action - Native PAGE
To test the feasibility of our designs, chemically synthesized DNA oligos of the sequences generated by Tiamat were used to assemble the NDCs. DNA-21 and DNA-217, which are DNA equivalents of miR21 and miR217 were initially used as the inputs, before using RNA. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was used to visualize the component strands, the assembled NDCs and strand displacement outputs suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS).
NDC
After assembly, component strands were seen to have formed complexes too large to be ran through the PAGE gel (Fig.1). These large complexes close to the loading well were expected to be successfully assembled NDC that could not pass through the gel due to its large 3D structure, with a tetrahedral base of around 16nm per edge. The band of around 20bp seen below NDC were unbound Strand 5, which was designed to be only partially complementary to Strand 1.
To confirm the assembly of NDC from the 5 component strands, PAGE of structures formed by different strand combinations was done (Fig.2). After annealing, component strands formed complexes larger than their individual sizes, proving DNA structure assembly due to base complementarity. Large complexes close to the bottom of wells could only be seen in samples containing Strand 1, 2, 3 and 4, which together form the 3D tetrahedral base of NDC. These results supported the successful formation of a specific 3D DNA structure.
Our NDC was designed to release to an anti-microRNA oligonucleotide upon binding with intracellular miR21 and miR217. As a preliminary test of strand displacement efficiency, we incubated DNA-21 and DNA-217 with NDC in phosphate"

The field of synthetic biology relies heavily on mathematical models to simulate and predict the process of biological systems. Our team established two models simulating the process of sweeteners binding on T1R2-T1R3 receptor and the process of sweeteners signal transduction in GPCR pathway. After that we designed and improved our biological systems based on the simulation results.
We developed our models for the following four main purposes:
1. Simulate different sweeteners how to bind on receptors.
2. Build a structural model to provide us with a solution for retrofitting and designing Gα.
3. The establishment of the GPCR signal transduction model gives us a better understanding of the sweetness signal in our system.
4. Simulate the relationship between sweetness signal and RFP fluorescence intensity and define the relationship between sweetness and fluorescence intensity.
Our structural model used the method of homology modeling on the SWISS MODEL server and then used AutoDock for molecular docking. The GPCR model was established by the reaction kinetics equation (RKE) of each signal transduction process. We used MATLAB to solve the ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Finally, we obtained the relationship between sweetener concentration and fluorescence intensity of our biological system.
System Overview
Our goal is to detect the sweetness of the sweeteners by retrofitting the GPCR signal transduction pathway in yeast (Cen.PK-1C).
The structure of TIR2-T1R3 (Picture from：Molecular mechanism of sweetness sensation)
In order to make the signal more accurate and reliable, we established T1R2-T1R3 receptor structure model and took aspartame, glycyrrhizic acid, stevioside and so on with its docking. And we got the binding sites of different sweeteners with T1R2-T1R3 receptor.
The design of sugar hunter
As you can see, this is a simple line model for our biological systems. We can divide it into four modules: the T1R2-T1R3 receptor module, the nucleotide exchange reaction module, the MAPK kinase module, and the RFP expression module.

Our circuit design was informed by several meetings with experts in the fields of endometriosis and synthetic biology.
June 13 - Asgi Fazleabas Visit
Asgi Fazleabas is a researcher and professor of Obsterics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology at Michigan State University. He gave a talk to our team in early June, enlightening us about an important characteristics of endometriosis: estrogen dominance, progesterone resistance, and differing miRNA profiles.  We learned progesterone resistance is, simplified, due to a lack of progesterone receptors in the cells. Here, “progesterone receptor” refers to the PGR-B isoform, the one that activates due to progesterone and binds to DNA transcription factors. This isoform is downregulated in ectopic endometrial cells. Since progesterone was a biomarker we initially designed our circuit to sense, we searched for another way for our circuit to sense a high level of progesterone present in the cell’s environment. Professor Fazleabas, doing research on a baboon model, found that in endometriosis, estrogen responsive genes are upregulated constantly, while progesterone responsive genes are always downregulated. The reason estrogen is present in abnormally high levels in ectopic cells is due to the way it’s metabolized. E2(estradiol), what we are referring to when we say “estrogen” is metabolized in the cells by a chemical reaction that needs a certain form of progesterone present to occur (research this reaction a little more so you can be more scientific). When progesterone is scarce, a buildup of unmetabolized estrogen occurs in the cell. Additionally, Asgi educated us on the fact that ectopic endometrial cells make a lot of aromatase, the enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction that produces E2.  We thought: if we cannot sense progesterone levels in diseased cells, maybe instead we can sense for unusually high amount of estrogen?

You need to assign the content which converted from Word                   or iWork documents to the template. In this step, there will be                   numerous words and sentences that will be copied and pasted,                   which cost a lot of time and memory.
With Flight iGEM
Flight iGEM can assign contents with template                   automatically, all you need to do is to select what you want to                   display, and then click 'Magic'.
Step 5
Without Flight iGEM
After you merged this two component, you should                   upload the ""code soup"" to the iGEM server, and this                   is the final step of the whole procedure.
With Flight iGEM
Flight iGEM will upload your pages to the iGEM server                   after step 4, and the only thing you need to do is to visit                   your target page and check if the page is exactly what you                   want.

Deadline alarm
According to our investigation among 66 teams, 19 of them                 thought there were too many deadlines in iGEM and they might be                 forgotten easily. Moreover，43 teams surveyed indicated that it                 would be better if there were certain reminders for the                 deadlines. As we all know, iGEM is a competition composed of a                 lot of events. To help users manage their"

Cell Movement in Microscopic and Macroscopic Aspect
Basically, we considered the movement of a cell  as a process of random walk, since an individual E.coli cell was always in the states between moving and tumbling  (Fig.1).Similar to Brownian particles, the random walk of E.coli followed the Einstein-Smoluchowski theory [ 1 ].
Fig . 1 Genetic circuit related to cell movementin(left)
and cell random walk(right)
Firstly, for the one dimension of random  walk, let x (t) denote the position of an E.coli cell at time t, given that its position coincided with the point x=0 at time t=0. And we assumed an E.coli cell moves an average distance l—in  either the positive or negative direction of the x-axis—each step (during a time (τ) between two tumbling states). The probability that the cell was  found at the point x at time t was now equal to the probability that,  in a series of n (=t/τ)  successive moving steps, the cell made m more steps in the positive direction  of the axis than in the negative direction. The desired probability was given by  the binomial expression [ 1, 2 ]
where
,
v= l/τ was the average speed of the cell movement, and f=1/τ was the tumbling  frequency of E.coli.
In two dimensions, the square of the distance  from the origin to the point (x, y) was r2=x2+y2; therefore
For a macroscopic view, D was defined as the diffusion coefficient. Normally, as the  swimming speed of E.coli is about 20um/s and the tumbling frequency is about 1 Hz,  the diffusion coefficient is about 200um2/s [ 3 ].
