We  learnt  a  lot  about  iGEM  through  this  meetup,  got  to   meet  a  lot  of  people,  and  are  confident  that  the  advice  and  suggestions  given  during  this   meetup would definitely help us give this first attempt at iGEM our best shot.
NCTU­Formosa regional meet up:
The NCTU Formosa iGEM Meetup was held during July 19­23, 2015. This was the third time  NCTU organized its own meetup, and this time, it kept it open for all the Asian iGEM teams. It   was organized on a pretty grand scale with 30 teams (from countries like Taiwan, China, India,   etc) participating in it. The two Indian teams participating in this meetup were IISER Pune and   IIT Kharagpur. The option was given to teams to either go and attend the meetup in person, or   to present their ideas via video conferencing (Skype). Accordingly, our team went ahead with   the second option, and was allocated a video conference slot for the evening (Taiwan Time) of   the third day of the NCTU Meetup (21st July). The  main  idea  behind  our  team’s  participation  in  this  meetup  was  to  get  advice  and   suggestions  from  experienced  iGEM  teams  with  regard  to  our  project  ­  wet  lab,  policy  and   practices (social outreach, meetups, collaborations, lab visits), modelling and so on. The format   of the online conference was 20 minutes for the presentation and 20 minutes for the question   and answer session. Harsheel, one of the senior members of our team gave the presentation of   our project idea, and the questions that followed (which were pitched by the audience gathered   at  the  seminar room  in  NCTU,  Taiwan)  were  tackled  by  some  of  the  senior  members  of  the   team,  as  a  whole.  Very  valid  questions  were  raised  by  the  audience,  and  many  useful   suggestions were given with regard to how we could improvise our presentation for the Giant   Jamboree, and tackle each of the factors (taken into account by the iGEM judges), so as"

COLLABORATIONS
Notre Dame Collegiate
We first came into contact with the Notre Dame Collegiate iGEM team at the aGEM competition in September, where we watched them present about their project ""The RMS E. coli"". They were working on creating E. coli that express an esterase capable of breaking down ""fatbergs"" that cause issues in wastewater treatment facilities. During this presentation, they indicated that they were interested in using spectrophotometry to gather quantitative data pertaining to enzyme kinetics under different reaction conditions. However, as a first year high school iGEM team, they had limited access to certain laboratory equipment.
We helped them design their spectrophotometry experiment and helped them run these assays using our spectrophotometer. They travelled from their neighbouring town of High River to our lab at the University of Calgary multiple times to attend a workshop hosted by our team's graphic design specialist and to perform the spectrophotometry experiments.

University of Lethbridge
Even before meeting at the North American iGEM Kickoff, the Calgary and University of Lethbridge iGEM team had hoped to build a proof of concept to integrate the strengths of their respective systems. It was a match made in biomolecular heaven: Calgary provided the gene editing machinery, while Lethbridge offered the delivery vector. By their forces combined, a scenario could be envisioned where Snip Equip Flip could be delivered in vivo, similar to a traditional viral vector, but while avoiding many of their intrinsic risks. After having brainstormed possibilities at the North American Kickoff for how the entire Snip Equip Flip system could be encapsulated in Lethbridge's PNCs, it was decided to first work towards validating that the encapsulated CRISPR component could be effectively delivered to mammalian cells in culture. For Snip Equip Flip to be fully implemented within a PNC-based delivery system, the donor DNA and integrating plasm"

Later we met with Dr. Leal, and he recommended us the following very important paper: Cooper et al.  2009 – “A protocol for the production of recombinant spider silk-like proteins for artificial fiber spinning”.
April 23-29, 2012
We did a new Gibson Assembly to build our working plasmid. This time it worked! We obtained some twenty or thirty colonies.
Additionally, we made our first video with 3DS Max, and Max almost destroyed his notebook with that amount of processing! You can see it here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je5JkoOMITE . Hopefully we will use these tools to make our wiki more attractive.
Also, this week we participated in Ingenia Fair.  You can find more information in our wiki section Human practices/Ingenia Fair.
April 30 – May 6, 2012
Analytical PCR was done to verify if the parts that we obtained from the Distribution Kit 2011 to build the GFP Reporter and Protease Producer plasmids have they corresponding size. The results were positive. Then we proceeded with the PCR products purification. Finally we did the Gibson Assemblies to build the GFP Reporter Plasmid and the Protease Producer Plasmid, using pSB1K5 and sfGFP as positive controls. The Assemblies worked all right! Afterwards, we sent all our constructs (Working Plasmid, GFP Reporter Plasmid and Protease Producer Plasmid) for sequencing.
Also, we are very happy because we received the free license of Matlab. Hopefully we will use this tool for modeling.

The Calvin cycle involves eleven enzymes, of which eight are intrinsic to E. coli. The three heterologous enzymes are RuBisCo, SBPase and PRK. The latter phosphorylates ribulose-5-phosphate to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. This is the substrate for RuBisCo, which catalyses the carboxylation, whereby glycerate-3-phosphate is produced. Later in the cycle, SBPase catalyses the dephosphorylation of sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate to sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, which is later converted to ribulose-5-phosphate, completing the circle. The net effect of three full cycles is the conversion of three CO2 molecules into one molecule glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which can be used for energy production via glycolysis or polysaccharide biosynthesis. Separately, these enzymes have previously been heterogeneously expressed in E. coli using various donor species, such as wheat Dunford RP, Catley MA, Raines CA, Lloyd JC, Dyer TA.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"Combining DNA isolation, amplification and transcription
The next step was to combine the DNA isolation step with the consecutive amplification and transcription step. Therefore, pSB1T3 was transformed into DH5-α and the cells were diluted in milk.
To assess the sensitivity of the boiling method on gram-negative bacteria in milk, we prepared a dilution range of 10-3 up to and including 10-9 in milk. The DNA was isolated following the boiling method protocol.
After amplification and in vitro transcription of the isolated DNA, the RNA was purified and loaded on a gel to check the result (making use of the RPA+in vitro transcription protocol, the RNA  isolation protocol and the RNA electrophoresis protocol). The results can be found in Figure 14.
Figure 14: Target RNA made by RPA and in vitro transcription from tetracycline resistant bacteria diluted in milk. Both the isolation method and the RPA and in vitro transcription reaction were tested on pSB1T3 in DH5-α at 37°C. To assess the sensitivity of the method, different dilutions of DH5-α transformed with pSB1T3 were prepared in milk. The dilutions are indicated per lane.
With a teardrop assay , we estimated the number of cells in the sample we used. There were approximately ~3 x 108 cells. We were able to isolate, amplify and transcribe DNA up till a dilution of 10-8 in milk, indicating that we could detect our target in the range of 1-10 cells per sample. However, one should keep in mind that the cells contained a high copy number plasmid, which means that our sample contained more DNA per cell than an average biological sample.
To make our device more user-friendly, we tried the amplification and in vitro transcription at 22 °C (room temperature) for 3 hours, instead of at 37 °C. The results are displayed in Figure 15. These results indicate that the RPA is able to work at room temperature. The T7 RNA polymerase we used on the other hand, has an optimal temperature of 37 °C, and is not functional at room temperature. This means that for our device, we need to come up with a way to regulate the incubation temperature for 3 hours.

In the meantime, the program will model the growth of the user specified bacteria with the new metabolic pathway to optimize the plasmid design. Finally, it will construct and display, with annotation, the advised plasmid(s) for the user as well as display important information on projected growth. In addition, it will have the option to adhere to the iGEM biobrick standards and will reference the biobrick database.
As a whole, the program will not only give the user the optimal plasmid design for the metabolic process, but it will project growth for the modified bacteria and connect the user with the BioBrick database which can reference the necessary plasmids.
Purpose/Application
The BioMORTAR project was motivated by the need for a systems approach to assembling components in synthetic biology, and to expedite the design process in metabolic engineering. Since the science of synthetic biology is becoming compartmentalized, the design process should keep up with this progress, and allow for a quick and simple way to find genetic parts for a specific purpose, connect the parts, then simulate a novel cell in silico.
One possible application of BioMORTAR is to use the program to quickly design a library of bacteria to combat an array of possible chemical or biological threats. Other applications for this program are focused towards, but not limited to, the design of large scale metabolic processing and any other function requiring the use of novel bacteria cells to carry out engineered metabolic reactions.
BioMORTAR 3-Part Design Suite
Progression of BioMORTAR
IMPtools - The first part of BioMORTAR is IMPtools, a metabolic pathway generator that allows the user to input an input and output compound, then traverse a reaction network, built from the KEGG Database, to generate the optimal metabolic pathway.
Plasmid Designer - The second part of BioMORTAR aggregates the coding DNA for the enzymes used in the metabolic reactions generated in IMPtools, then joins the DNA sections with user selected promoters, ribosome binding sites, and terminators. The plasmid designer attaches it all to a vector to create the plasmid that would allow a cell to carry out the generated metabolic process. The plasmid designer then searches the BioBrick iGEM parts registry for similar sequences within the plasmid, and references these existing parts to the user.
COBRA Cell Modeling - The third and final part of BioMORTAR is cell modeling using the BIGG database in conjunction with COBRA tools in MATLAB to simulate"

where X [g/L] is the E.coli biomass, V, Vmax [L] are the currently and maximally filled volume of the bioreactor, $S_{glc}$, $S_{glc}^{feed}$, $S_{delftibactin}$ [mmol/L] are the concentrations of glucose and delftibactin in the reactor or the feed, $K_m$ [mmol/L] the Michaelis-Menten constant for glucose uptake, $ \mu $ [1/h] the growth rate of the bacteria and finally $ v_{glc},v_{delftibactin} $ $ \frac{mmol}{g_{dw}h} $ the flux rates of the corresponding reactions with $ v_{glc}^{max} $ being the maximal possible flux.
The starting conditions were set to a volume of 1 L, a biomass of 0.01 g/L and a glucose concentration of 20 mmol/L, as in [13]. The other bioreactor parameters were set as follows: The concentration of glucose in the feed was equal to 1 mol/L, $K_m$ equal to 1 mmol/L [13] and finally, the maximal glucose uptake rate was set to 10.5 $ \frac{mmol}{g_{dw}h} $ [10]. The time step was set to 0.1 h.
Simulations with those conditions were performed for 150 equally spaced growth rate values on the production envelope, as shown previously in Fig.4. Fig. 5 shows the resulting trajectory for the biomass concentration and delftibactin concentration for 3 representative points from the envelope. As expected, higher growth rates result faster convergence towards the steady-state. Reaching the steady state implies the end of the fermentation process. This is expected, as in the model, the glucose feed is stopped as soon as the 10 L of the bioreactor have been filled. Also, the final concentration of delftibactin ranges from approximately 40 to 80 $ \frac{mmol}{L} $, with higher titers achieved for lower growth rates, while dry biomass (10 to 50 $ \frac{g}{L}) $ titer is higher in the case of high growth rates.
The above observations actually illustrate another aspect of the growth rate"

Devices are whole constructs which are functional and have specific     and distinct functions. But, as we have observed, unfortunately, the     term “device” is also being used for parts which are not functional     and do not have specific functional at all. Moreover, within the classification     of devices, we argue that some terms are also being used unnecessarily     and ambiguously. Devices are classified into five types which are protein     generators, reporters, inverters, receivers and senders, measurement     devices. For example iGEM defines protein generators as:
Protein generator = promoter + rbs +gene + terminator
Though we accept the definition for protein generators, we observed     that there exist numerous parts which are defined as protein generators     but actually most of them do not fit to the definition provided above.     Although some parts are not functional and do not generate proteins     at all, they are classified as protein generators, which makes searching     for the parts difficult in the registry. Furthermore, there are also     numerous parts which are defined as “composite parts” but actually they     fit to the same definition with protein generators. In order to overcome     the problem of misuse of device type we have extracted related image     ID information for the composite parts. Image ID information helped     us to correctly categorize composite parts depending on its individual     atomic parts and identify the ones with more than one function, such     as being both inhibitor and activator. In other words, we used image     and part IDs in order to merge an input for its outputs.
Subtitle working conditions, includes all the detailed information     about the experimental properties of parts, and the details about the     working process of individual parts and complete devices. Additionally,     we marked the subtitle “Working Condition” in our standardization template     as potentially the most important title that helps synthetic biologist     to better understand the parts functions at iGEM’s part registry database.     The main problem we have encounter with the subtitle “working condition”     is within most of the parts the details about working process is not     enough and not provided regularly.
Examples of Misuse of Terminology:
For Composite Parts:
PartID: BBa_S04055
PartName: Synthetic lacYZ operon
This part is functional and responsible for the production of LacY     and LacZ proteins. This part partially fits the definition for “composite part” but actually should be a protein generator as it fits fully to     the definition of “protein generators”.

Why Bioethanol?
In essence, bioethanol is no different from daily used ethanol; having the formula of C2H5OH (Zabed et al., 2014). Moreover, bioethanol has a higher octane number, evaporation enthalpy, flame speed and a wider range of flammability than the petroleum-based energy sources which increase its fuel consumption rate, making bioethanol more environmentally friendly (Zabed et al., 2014).
Bioethanol also contains 35% oxygen which is important because of the reducing effect on particulate and nitrogen oxides emission as well as other greenhouse gases such as carbon monoxide, during combustion (Zabed et al., 2014).
In brief, we chose bioethanol as our main focus due to its qualities of being eco-friendly, non-toxic, biodegradable, it reducing crude oil dependency from other countries and most importantly, emitting fewer greenhouse gases, thus creating less pollution (Oliveira et al., 2005; Tesfaw & Assefa, 2014; U.S. Energy Information Administration [eia], 2014; 2017; Melikoğlu & Albostan, 2011; Holzman, 2007).
In order to observe the advantages of ethanol in practice, we found the data below that compares engines that utilize ethanol, clean diesel, and electric-gasoline hybrid to conventional gasoline engines. Our research and observations lead to the table below:
Clean Diesel
Electric hybrid
Ethanol
Cost
$3,000–3,500 per gallon
$3,500–5,000  per battery
$1,000-1,500 per gallon
Efficiency Gain
20–30% more efficient
30–40% more efficient
20–30% more efficient
Emissions
25% lower CO2 emissions
Up to 50% lower CO2 emissions
NOx and PM reduction, compared with clean diesel
Technological Advantages
Better engine performance
Less complex and easier to install than EH engine
Better engine performance
Larger battery means more safety and luxury electronic systems can be added one
Reduced engine weight, more space in the engine compartment, compared with electric hybrids.
Higher torque and horsepower, compared with clean diesel

Bio Sun Block (Evolved Bacterial Sunscreen)
Introduction
No, not sunscreen for bacteria - sunscreen made by bacteria. We are going to make e.coli bacteria create shinorine, a UV absorbing compound that is currently being extracted from algae as an eco-friendly sunscreen.
Genetic Engineering is arguably the greatest leap forward in human understanding and manipulation of nature in the whole history of mankind, above and greater than the invention of fire and the wheel combined. This project makes use of Genetic Engineering to force a bacteria to create a compound that it would never make and then use the tools of evolution to enhance that ability.
E.coli can easily be killed by UV light. By equipping it with the genes to produce UV absorbing compounds, we expect that the E. coli will become somewhat UV resistant as well. After designing the process, we want to make it better, so we will employ “directed evolution” to make the process better. We think that if we stress the bacteria with UV that they will start to evolve better and more efficient mechanisms to protect themselves from UV.
So that is our project: start some bacteria making sunscreen then subject them to a lot of sunshine and they will evolve to make more and better sunscreen.
Physics of sunscreen
Sunscreens are chemical compounds that absorb or reflect UV light, preventing it from damaging cells. We put sunscreen on our skin to protect the underlying skin cells from the damaging UV in sunlight. The Sun Protection Factor (SPF) rating of sunscreen essentially measure how much longer it allows someone to stay in the sun before getting a sunburn caused by UV-B light (290-320 nanometers). This is an imperfect measure of skin damage because invisible damage and skin aging are also caused by ultraviolet type A (UV-A, wavelengths 320–400 nm), increasing the risk of malignant melanomas.
UV rays carry high energy and are suspected of causing cancer through damage to the skin's DNA. High energy in sunlight comes in two forms:
- UV-A (320-400 nanometers)
- UV-B (290-320 nanometers)
The UVB waves tend to receive more criticism than the less energetic UVA waves. But, in actual fact, both UVB and UVA can damage the skin. Unfortunately, the chemistry of sunscreen, in most cases, does not enable the blocking of U"

Analysis of questionnaire content
Which type of cancer treatments do you know?
Figure 8.
During your treatment, what kinds of treatment did you receive?
Figure 9.
Result of question 1 showed that, chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy were the most well-known 3 treatments to patients and their families. Among the three, chemotherapy comprised 88.71%, accounting for the highest number of votes, showing that everyone considers ""cancer"" and ""chemotherapy"" closely linked.
It could be learnt from the question 2 that, chemotherapy plays highest application in cancer clinical treatment, accounting for 87.1% of all investigated patients, which made chemotherapy the most well-known one.
Now when it came to new drugs, it surprised us that around 1/4 of the patients already know about molecular targeted drugs and other new drugs, and 14.52% of patients have received new therapy treatment, showing that patients are no longer unfamiliar with targeted therapy and other new treatments now. Also, doctors would rationally suggest the appropriate patients to actively try new therapies including targeted therapy.
We also learned that, there exists many patients who tried target detection but at last not eligible for targeted therapy; For those who apply targeted therapy, only half of them are receiving good effect, while the other patients choose to give up targeted therapy and regress to traditional treatment due to trivial effect or unaffordable medical expenses.
For different treatment methods, which part do you think is more important?
Figure 10.
The results of question 3 showed that, regardless of treatment types, patients value the efficacy superior to other factors. Many patients and their families told us that they would still strive for an ideal treatment no matter how expensive it might be, as long as it can guarantee efficiency. ‘Side effects’ accounted for the second"

Ferric Iron Standard Curve @ 483nm
Ferric Iron Standard
We produced a standard curve using the UV-Vis Spectrophotometer as per our standard protocol using a pure molecular homolog to the ion under test ranging from 0 to the maximum working concentration of the specific test. The internal working range was determined by the highest concentration attainable while still remaining linear. Since the equilibrium of the reaction will shift toward the soil extract, the reacting reagent will be exhausted thus will not yield a greater signal despite an increase in the standard concentration. Certain tests were limited in precision or unrealistic in terms of real world quantification of nutrients thus a simple relative reading was performed and the data were displayed as a comparison amongst all the soil plots versus the highest plot recorded.
A linear regression model was chosen since the chemical reactions in questions produce a one to one response proportional to the molecular concentration of the nutrient. A trend line was derived along with an R squared value to describe the strength of correlation. Error bars were produced to define the distance of deviation the observed values were from the linear model. The resulting equation was then used to compute the concentration of nutrients in each unknown soil sample as a function of the absorbance at a wavelength deemed most sensitive across the gradient of soil standards. The soil values were recorded in parts per million.

Timo giving his presentation, © yansfotos.de, BIO.NRW
In the afternoon it was time for our iGEM project presentation. We focused on iGEM in general, the main principle of standardized DNA parts, example projects, the motivation behind participating in a competition like iGEM and gave an overview how to build up a project from the sketchbook to the final product. Bielefeld University has still the only iGEM team in the federal state of North Rhine Westphalia , one of the most populated regions in Europe and host of the convention. Therefore our goal was not to present scientific results, but to talk about what is special in projects like iGEM and encourage other students and faculty members to start a new iGEM team in their own schools.
The whole event was a success for us as a team, since we had lots of fun and learned new aspects in the workshops. Most importantly we were able to present about iGEM and show new people what is special about the iGEM spirit as well as open source biology.
Abstract of our talk
The iGEM (international genetically engineered machine) competition enables the possibility for students to fulfil their own biological project. It is an international competition dealing with synthetic biology, in which undergraduates can participate. Once a year it is arranged by the MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) in Boston, USA. Under the umbrella term „Synthetic Biology“, teams with a multitude of backgrounds in life sciences as well as software development, design and art teams can participate. So the project topics are broadly diversified. All teams start with the same toolbox of standardized DNA parts – the Biobricks. These parts combined with new designed Biobricks are used to build novel biological systems in living cells. Further focuses of the competition are biosecurity and the bioethical aspects of synthetic biology. These aspects are taken into account in public discussions.
In 2011 more than 150 teams from all over the world will be participating. The teams have to do all the logistical and organisational work as well as public relations. This includes providing labspace, organizing a manageable time schedule and accomplishing all the fundraising on their own. Another main focus is the scientific communication of synthetic biology, the iGEM competition and the student‘s project. All in all the students will perform a self-organised project from the sketchbook to the final product.

We invited our entire university, including the staff, to join us in a fun ring toss competition on our campus, which we called “Baskarabidopsis"" – Put the Plasmid in the Plant.
We constructed plasmid-shaped loops to throw and plants that were made from recycled plastic bottles.  While enjoying the game, we introduced ourselves and our project goals to our visitors, opening the minds of our student body to the fascinating world of synthetic biology. Even the administration of our university participated! Prizes were won and everybody had a great time!

Interface Design
Screenshot of GUI Home screen
Home Screen
The 'Home' screen is designed to be the hub to which all the functions of the GUI connect. As such, no feature of the GUI is more than 3 mouse-clicks away from the Home screen. This helps to keep the interface intuitive, and easy to learn.
The Home screen is divided into 3 sections:
Menu bar
Button Panel
Text Output Area
The menu bar allows the user to exit the program, and links to the 'About' section of the GUI. The button panel (to the left of the Home screen) guides the user through the steps needed to create a simulation. Each of the buttons either opens dialog boxes or executes code. Finally, the text output area keeps track of the options selected by the user, which is immensely useful when creating complicated simulations.
Screenshot of GUI Simulation Options Dialog
Simulation Options
The 'Simulation Options' dialog can be opened by clicking on the highlighted button on the Home screen.
The first option open to the user is the simulation size (in microns). This is in the form of {x,y,z} co-ordinates, and the shape specified will always be a cuboid, but does not have to be a cube. No matter what size or shape the user chooses, the simulation camera will zoom in or out to show the entire simulation space at a reasonable size.
The second option defines the boundary conditions on the simulation space. These are stated as three boolean (true/false) values, relating to the {x,y,z} planar boundaries of the simulation cuboid. When set to 'true', the planar boundaries become collidable, meaning that objects that intersect them bounce off elastically in the opposite direction. This behaviour preserves the 'conservation of momentum' condition. If a boundary condition is set to 'false', then the associated plan boundaries are periodic. This means that an object passing through the boundary of the simulation will instantly be transported to an exact opposite spatial position within the simulation. Objects re-appear with the same velocity as they had before, preserving conservation of momentum.
The final option in this dialog is the camera angle. This has to be stated in the form {i,j,k}, where i,j and k are real, positive numbers. The camera angle is calculated using the ratio of these three numbers.

Figure source of pretreatment: NEP, 2008, Tampa Bay Water.
Process order:
The idea of combing two methods comes from that bio-desalination water separation process can work under similar circumstance of some pretreatment of seawater in RO desalination plant at first place. As figure 6.3.4 below, the pretreatment of seawater is complicated and throughout. The idea is to ensure that constituents, in the source water do not reduce the performance of the RO desalination facility (NEP, 2008)
After discussing with the Hangzhou Water Treatment Center, we think that bio-desalination should be add in the first step of seawater treatment. It is because the source water has the most impurity and will provide a more favorable environment for cyanobacteria. The other reason is either using its own separation method or altering a few steps of RO membrane pretreatment. The pretreatment of RO will ensure that there’s no cyanobacteria left behind during RO membrane process.
Energy cost:
Figure  6.3.5 The changes of total annual profits by feed concentration changes(ppm);
Data resource: Kim et al,2009
In some way, our project can be understand as one of the pretreatment of RO membrane method. It will lower the salinity. As figure 6.3.5, the lower salinity is, the more profit RO method makes bacuse of less operating expenses. Our project will also helps to expand RO membrane’s life and cleaning cycle.
However, the key is how our project will lower the salinity and if the costs is lower than original costs, especially energy cost. Our project is still in the rotation stage into large-scale industry. Thus, this question needs to be answered in the future.

When generating nutrition made of bacteria our team pointed it's contribution to the considerable task of providing accurate nutrient to developing countries. The contradiction between a common opinion of how  food is produced and finding a solution to obtaining food in the future has been a key issue to our  project. Furthermore, the ethical and social aspects to our project are decisive to include.
This means that we have considered what good research is. Good research includes the common opinion in society, and for this reason outreach in Ghana provided us with different standpoints to our  project.
Interview with Dr. Yaa Difie-Osei:
Dr. Yaa Difie-Osie from the National Biosafety Committee, Ghana. Senior Lecturer in Biochemistry, Dr. Yaa Difie-Osei (Dr. Yaa), agreed to meet with our team member Anne,  during her stay in the capital of Ghana, Accra, in August. The purpose was to talk about GMOs in relation  to our Edible coli. The interview was held at the Department of Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology  at the University of Ghana in Legon. Dr. Yaa has previously worked at the university herself but is now retired  from her position as lecturer. Dr. Yaa is still involved in  the development of synthetic biology in Ghana as a member of the National Biosafety Committee of Ghana.  The fact that Dr. Yaa has much experience regarding synthetic biology and at the same time is a member of  the National Biosafety Committee makes her expertise significant to our project.
When Dr. Yaa heard about our iGEM project she expressed great interest and there was a clear  understanding and acknowledgement of the concepts of iGEM. Dr. Yaa spoke very passionately of  GMOs and made it clear that GMOs would be a considerable solution to malnutrition, which is a recurring  motif in Ghana. As a member of the Safety Committee, Dr. Yaa had recently contributed to the approval of  four GMO projects in Ghana. The four GMO projects include protein rich sweet potato and cotton with  pesticides integrated into the genom (BT-cotton). The projects have got permits to do research but the research  will be subject to strict rules concerning biosafety, management of risks in biochemistry and national biosafety. Source: A.A.

Fudan,2017,Team:Fudan China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," contains three parts: logic gates, sequential memory structures and basic orthogonal memory modules. The logic gates sense two signals. One is the signal we want to record, called Target. The other is the signal used to provide the circuit with information about time, called Clock. Actually, Clock signal can be any signal, such as sunlight and other commonly-used inducers, as long as it can oscillate automatically or artificially.The logic gates process the given signal and transform it into one of the three basic output patterns listed in the table above, making the signal ‘sensible’.The sequential memory structures sense these output patterns to determine whether to trigger recording and in which order the recording action happens. In each time period determined by the Clock signal, different orthogonal integrases are adopted to write the information directly on DNA at specific sites. We can investigate these sites on DNA to get the information of the inducer in various past time periods.
Thus, by arranging the results in the right time order, we can finally know how the signal changes with time.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"ET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in pur"

They tested our combined densitometer and fluorometer . They found that we could hold the light sensor more securely using blue tack, or possibly superglue rather than the electrical tape we had been using. They also suggested we save a recording number rather than just whether or not a reading had been recorded and add the ability to download only the ‘recorded’ data. We implemented this, making data analysis easier and the fluorometer more powerful.
They helped us with our high school teams guide by giving us detailed feedback that we incorporated into the final guide. They gave us lots more advice for the ‘idea’ section of the guide, and helped provide us with other pertinent points for the ‘why enter,’ ‘fundraising’ and ‘equipment’ sections.

What we did for them
We gave University of Westminster advice on how to use the iGEM wiki editing tools, Mediawiki templates, as well as pointing them to some good HTML, CSS and JavaScript learning resources.
What they did for us
We collaborated with the Westminster iGEM team in order to carry our iGEM’s interlab study. We do not have a plate reader at CLS, but Westminster kindly agreed to let us use theirs to carry out the measurements. Their PI, Dr Smith, was invaluable in helping us setup and use the machines - we are very grateful for her time and effort. Take a look at our results on our InterLab page .

A factor 25 characteristic of the system and a variable extra filtering factor that is a function of pulse length and is maximal (8) for pulses of 100 seconds.
Another nice way to visualazise the same filtering effect can be seen in the following figures. In the left figure, 4 input pulses are given in sequence. The first lasts 100 seconds, the second 500, the third 2500 while the last one remains indefinateley. The maximal output (result of the 4th pulse), both non-filtered and filtered are set to 1, normalizing the signals. It is now very easy to see the filtering in effect on the zoomed-in right figure and the ratio's can be compared with the y-values of the previous figure.

Rice,2016,Team:Rice#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," including this in our model, since increasing the number of parameters, without increasing the number of data points usually causes the overfitting of the model.
Finally, since the violacein pathway has not been fully characterized, it is possible that we ignored some reactions in the complete pathway. Moreover, there may be feedback loops that regulate the pathway. We will need to investigate these possible components and incorporate them into our model if they prove to be present in the pathway.
Conclusion
Here we present a method to fit a model of violacein production in E.coli to experimental data of violacein yield with different promoters using nonlinear regression. Although  it fails to calculate the dependence on promoter strength, our model is able predict the average violacein concentration. We expect that small changes on the model, such as including a L-tryptophan production dependence of the metabolic burden, would allow us to successfully predict the violacein production in response to the variation of promoter strength. Once the predictive model is complete, we will be able to find the strains that lead to optimal violacein yield computationally.

In order to be considered for the Best Software Tool award , you must fill out this page.
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honour such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
If you are working on software as your main project, please join the software track. If you are creating software as an addition to your main project, please apply for this award.

DESIGN
Synthetic Biology is largely restricted to well-funded laboratories at major research universities in high income countries. One significant barrier to entry is the capital cost of instruments. The cloning and assembly of BioBricks, for example, includes the transformation of Escherichia coli, which requires the purchase of a refrigerated centrifuge and an ultra-cold freezer. Here we assemble BioBrick-compatible shuttlevectors for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, a naturally competent relative of E. coli that grows as rapidly under identical conditions. We will show that A. baylyi can be transformed with recombinant DNA simply by adding ligation reactions to mid-log cultures; transformants are selected as usual by spreading them onto LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, cefotaxime or amikacin). These experiments will show how BioBricks can be constructed and assembled in modestly funded laboratories in community colleges."

OD600 Reference Point
According to the Reference OD600, We calculate the final result:

All cell density readings using this instrument with the same settings and volume can be converted to OD600, so that we can use this ratio to convert subsequent experimental data.
Particle Standard Curve
We prepare a dilution series of monodisperse silica microspheres and measure the Abs600 in plate reader. The size and optical characteristics of these microspheres are similar to cells, and there is a known amount of particles per volume. This measurement allows us to construct a standard curve of particle concentration which can be used to convert Abs600 measurements to an estimated number of cells.
The final result:

Fluorescein Standard Curve
We prepare a dilution series of fluorescein in four replicates and measure the fluorescence in a 96 well plate in plate reader. By measuring these we generate a standard curve of fluorescence for fluorescein concentration. We will be able to use this to convert our cell based readings to an equivalent fluorescein concentration.

For the curing of pCas, the cell can be grown overnight at 37 °C non-selectively. The challenging part of this is the biological meaning of codA because of its important role in the purine synthesis pathway.  To counteract this, it is advised to supplement with uracil (Mahan et al., 2004).
Design of a Plasmid for the Retention of Unnatural Base Pairs
Selection and screening of the transformants was not possible with our experimental design since the retention experiment had to be started immediately after transformation. Therefore, we designed a plasmid which would kill or inhibit growth of the wrong colonies. Our initial design focused on the use of ccdB, but given that ccdB cannot be submitted to the parts registry, we decided to use levansucrase of Bacillus subtilis, encoded by sacB instead. Therefore, a mRFP-sacB fusion construct was designed ( BBa_K2201017 ). BBa_J23100 was used as a promoter and BBa_B0034 was used as a strong RBS, followed by BBa_E1010 . Between mRFP and sacB, a linker consisting of four alanines was used. As a backbone, pSB3C5 was used. Given that this plasmid was designed to eventually carry an unnatural base pair, a low-copy plasmid was the better choice for a higher stability of the unnatural base pair.   The idea behind this construct is the following: In the initial plasmid, mRFP and sacB are in-frame, meaning that cells turn red when incubated in standard media such as LB, but die or grow weakly when cultivated in media supplemented with sucrose. This is due to the toxic effect of levansucrase, which unfolds when cells are cultivated in sucrose supplemented media.
Figure 4: Fusionprotein of mRFP and sacB. Shown is the linker between the two sequences. A flexible 4xAla linker was used between mRFP and sacB.
The linker between mRFP and sacB represents the insertion site for the fragment containing the unnatural base pair. This insertion, if successful, leads to a frameshift of the downstream located sacB, leading to loss of function. Therefore, cells can only survive in sucrose supplemented media if the fragment containing the unnatural base pair was successfully incorporated. This provides an easy screening method, since cells that turn red and survive in sucrose supplemented media"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#ImprovePart_-_-_TEXT.html," recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E. coli. Both pathways figure to remove excessive ammonia and facilitate fish to live healthily in aquaculture water.
We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.

Modeling
We decided to model the deployment of our bed bug trap in a realistic environment, to understand how it was likely to work and what parameters might be important. This task involved a number of different modeling tasks, that posed different problems: modeling the diffusion of pheromones in the room coming both from a natural bed bug nest and the traps that we plan to deploy; modeling the movement of bed bugs influenced both by the pheromone field and their nest; and modeling the fungal epidemic that we plan to induce in the bed bug population.
Though the model is complex and includes many parameters, it has already allowed us to draw several conclusions, and as the model is improved and the parameters are refined other conclusions will follow.  For instance, using realistic diffusion parameters it is clear that the pheromone field is relatively rapidly established and so the precise nature and concentration of pheromones is probably not critical.  In contrast, the delay between infection and death of bed bugs is critical for ensuring the eradication of the nest.  Our modeling thus helps understand critical aspects of the proposed design.

Why modeling? Descriptions of our goals
As our project was growing, we understood the importance to model our solution in order to better understand how it would work.  Indeed, even if we had the opportunity to make laboratory experiments to test our traps, it would take to much time without the help of modeling.  A model"

Team training and Project start
We officially met for the first time as an iGEM team in late March and immediately started brainstorming our project. Classes ended in early May and after a month break we all came back to campus on June 6th and dove into lab. We had 10 weeks in the lab before a new year of classes began."
Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Executive#_-_-_TEXT.html," ponds, and government regulation requires that oil sands companies monitor their tailings ponds. As well, regulation enforces monitoring water quality in the surrounding lakes, water streams, and ecologically sensitive areas. Present technologies for monitoring water quality in the oil sands are highly analytical, however they pose problems due to their expensive nature, requirements for highly trained personnel, sample processing time, and the need for materials to be transported to off-site facilities. There is a need for new technology in order to meet the growing need to monitor samples on-site in a rapid and cost-effective manner.
Our first target market is water monitoring related to the oil and gas industry. General toxicity sensing in oil and gas holds a market of up to $50 million dollars. Annual financial predictions based on similar competitive products suggest that FREDsense could reach annual revenue of up to $2,250,000 by capturing 30% of the Alberta market. With the growth in the number of monitoring sites, which are expected to more than double in the next two years, as well as the increased amount of green policy and legislation both at a governmental and industrial level, we see this as a growing market potential. Additionally, more specific sensors can be developed as second-generation products to meet any further industry needs within this market, expanding the market potential of this system and the potential profitability of our company.
Presently, detection is completed by expensive analytical machinery such as mass spectrometry. Portable biosensors systems do exist in this market, primarily marketed under the name MicroTox®. MicroTox® has established a powerful market presence, however it has numerous limitations due to its limited accuracy, expense, and sample limitations. We aim to partner with an end-user to be able to successfully compete in this market.
FREDsense is a product-based company with a revenue model consisting of the sale of the detection system and disposable cartridge units containing the test reagents. Recurring revenue is procured by selling individual cartridge units for each sample that needs to be analyzed, and different cartridge units will be developed for each type of sensor produced. Detector units will be sold independently of the cartridges, and a single detector will be usable for multiple samplings.
We have established a group of advisors and students with a firm foundation in science, chemistry, engineering, law, and business strategy. Our team consists of six biology/chemistry students, four professors, and three industry representatives with extensive experience. In our first year of operations, 2014, major milestones will include securing grant and private investment funding for research and development and a thorough market analysis. By year three we plan to secure one million in investment from venture"

Figure 7. A schematic of our wound healing patch.
During our conversations with experts on the topic of burn and chronic wounds,                      we learned that besides S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is also a major cause of problems in wound care of patients                  with burn and chronic wounds. As our lysostaphin-HlyA has a modular design, we changed the coding sequence of lysostaphin to that of pyocin S5, generating a new biobrick in addition to lysostaphin.              Pyocin S5 is a bacteriocin against P. aeruginosa (14) , enabling our patch to target both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa simultaneously. This demonstrates          the modularity of our patch, of which the concept is illustrated in figure 7. We also learned about the importance of a kill switch and included this in our design. Please see our Applied Design section for the kill switch and for an analysis of the potential impact of our bacteriocin secreting patch.
Model results were used to adapt the hydrogel shape to suit our wound healing application. We modelled which patch thickness would be feasible to create a patch that is as thin as possible, but also allows enough lysostaphin to reach the skin to kill S. aureus using experimental input as lysostaphin production rate and hydrogel paramters such as microstructure. Our model showed  that a patch with a thickness of the order of magnitude of approximately a millimeter allows a high enough concentration of lysostaphin to kill S. aureus. Subsequently, we adapted our hydrogel patch design to synthesize a hydrogel patch with a thickness of 0.75 mm. We could show that this hydrogel could be easily created and yielded flexible, stable hydrogels. For our wound healing application, we could develop a relevant prototype due to the modeling results.
Summary of our design
The core of our project consists out of three DNA constructs; the secretable lysostaphin, the type I secretion system proteins HlyB/D and the MpIBP adhesin.              To comply with the engineering principle of modularity, each of these three"

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"alia wrote that the plasmid is very stable and you can use the strain without antibiotic. Then we contacted him again to pray for help. He told us that it was possible to get the plasmid out with another strategy. This makes us very relieved, because if the plasmid is still in the modified strain, which would be critical for using the strain for cloning, due to marker and Ori incompatibility.  With his proposal to grow a culture with the add of IPTG and than to screen for clones who are no longer carbenicillin resistance, we are able to get the pMMB-tfox Plasmid out of the strains.  After it was possible for us to use natural transformation we start to build our own plasmid. Therefore we use the Marburg Collection, to make this great part good and easy accessible for the scientific community. Therefore we build a level 0 and a level 1 Plasmid and integrated it into the wildtype of V. natriegens.
The Flp/frt system
Figure 2:A Flp encoding plasmid. This plasmid is constructed using eight different parts. One of them is encoding the Flp recombinase additionally we used a constitutive promoter, a RBS, two connectors, a terminator and a backbone with a kanamycin resistance cassette.
In order to establish the Flp/frt system in V. natriegens for fast genomic deletions two components are needed. First we need to introduce genomic FRT sites for the desired modifications and second a FLP recombinase needs to be introduced into the V. natriegens cells. By attaching frt sites to the chloramphenicol resistance cassette that will be used for creating deletions, we will introduce the genomic FRT sites that are needed. Therefore, the resistance cassette from pYTK will be amplified using Primers with frt overhangs. Depending which kind of gene, we want to delete, the upstream and downstream homologous regions with a length of 500 to 3000 bp will also be amplified attaching frt overhangs to the upstream reverse and downstream forward primers. This way, upstream fragment, chloramphenicol resistance cassette and downstream fragment can be assembled to large linear fragments by performing fusion PCRs. Using the natural transformation method we will transform these linear fragments to the V. natriegens cells. By homologous recombination, the fragments can integrate into the genome. This Insertion will be proved by colony PCR. The second component for the Flp/frt system is introducing"

Science, is something that have always deeply interest me, because it answers the most amazing and vital questions: from the tiniest subparticle, to the most titanic supernova. But what truly interest me within it, is the great potential that we have thrue science to change the world for better. The things that we have accomplished as a scientific community are just terrifically unbelievable and to think what we can accomplish in a few years, just thrills me. I think that both GenetiX and iGem are a great opportunity to start that change. Also, I participate in Models of United Nations (MUNs) I had been in over seven muns in the past three years both as delegate and as chair. My most beloved hobby is parliamentary debate, I I was primary founder of the Debate Club in Tecnologico de Monterrey and we are going to participate next November on “Panamericanos”. Everything that I do is focused on achieving that change, because I want that every time someone mentions the word “future” they don’t think about a mass of gray polluted injustice, but as a bright community full of opportunities and hope.

CODON OPTIMIZATION: ENGINEERING A MORE USEFUL GENE AT THE CODON LEVEL
Click HERE to return to the Projects page.
Project Summary
Background
Many important bioproducts are comprised of proteins, and proteins are made up of amino acids, specified by certain codons in an organism's DNA. This DNA is then transcribed and translated to create these proteins. Since multiple codons can be used to specify an amino acid in E.coli, it is possible to use multiple coding sequences to produce the same chain of amino acids.
The Big Question
Even though genes with different codon preferences can code for the same protein, they may not necessarily do so at the same rate, or lead to expression of that protein at the same level1. The question we asked is ""How and why are they different?""
To biologists, the answer to this question may shed light on the nature of translation itself, and the reasons that some codons are naturally preferred by the genome of E.coli. To engineers, it could act as an additional point of control over tricky genetic systems, and perhaps more efficient production of useful bioproducts. To undergrads, the pursuit of these answers was the summer of a lifetime.
Degenerate codons do not necessarily lead to equally efficient expression of an amino acid.
Our Objective
Codon optimization is not a new idea, but what makes our project special is that it used several novel criteria for optimization. By picking specific codons for a synthetic gene, we can determine the effect of certain types of codons on translation and ultimately draw conclusions that may be very useful to the biotech community.
Our Design
To optimize genes we had to find some criteria. What we chose were codons that were generally rare in the overall genome (rare-G1), common in the overall genome (common-G2), abundant in regions of the genome with known fast translation initiation (fast-G3), abundant in regions of the genome with known slow translation initiation (slow-G4), or predicted by advanced software to have slow insertion time (slow insertion time-G5).
Next, we chose a gene to optimize, and came up with"
LMU-Munich,2012,Team:LMU-Munich#Data#Inducible_-_-_TEXT.html," of about 10.000 Lumi/OD600. After induction with bacitracin the Lumi/OD600 increases in a concentration depending manner. The highest activity of about 1.5 Mio Lumi/OD600 can be measured after induction with 10-30 μg/ml bacitracin. If the concentration is higher than 100 μg/ml the luminescence of both clones shows a different behaviour. In contrast, the constitutive promoter PliaG shows a constant value of about 10,000 Lumi/OD independent of the bacitracin concentration (data not shown).
To better illustrate the PliaI activity as a function of the bacitracin concentration, data from one timepoint (t=3.5h) of the experiment (Fig. 1) is plotted against the bacitracin concentration (Fig. 2).
Fig. 2: Promoter activity of PliaI depending on the bacitracin concentration (0,1 μg/ml to 100 μg/ml). Values of the experiment (Fig. 1) are shown in a different way: Luminescence per OD600 of both clones (blue/green) from the time point t=3.5h. Data is derived from three independent experiments.
β-galactosidase assays
The inducible promoter PliaI was also evaluated with the reporter vector pSBBs1C-lacZ
. (Fig. 3).
Fig. 3: β-galactosidase assay with (grey) and without (black) induction of bacitracin (20 μg/ml) of strains carrying the promoter PliaI fused to lacZ. The average of the β-galactosidase activity (Miller Units) and the standard deviation of two independent clones are shown depending on the time (minutes after induction). This graph shows representative data from three independent experiments.
The β-galactosidase assay of the inducible Bacillus promoter PliaI was repeated three times. We induced with bacitracin (20μg/ml) when the cultures reached an OD600 of 0.4. PliaI only shows marginal basal activity without induction. After induction a promoter activity of up to 500 Miller Units was measured. In summary, the promoter activity is induced about 500 fold in the presence of bacitracin.

Tongji_China,2017,Team:Tongji China#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," invited a lot of designers and scholars to make comments in different ways and show their recent results. We had a live webcast to allow people who could not come to watch ONLive through the internet. We hope ONLive can be a great way for people without professional knowledge to learn more about Biology. In the Q&A section we also got a lot of good advice from the guests, who thought that our project would be useful for pest control, and that's the reason we selected this as our final project.
We also held the 2nd Open Night Live to show the iGEM teams in Shanghai and to give an opportunity to people to exchange ideas and ask questions to every iGEM member. It has been an honor for us to invite Fudan_China, Shanghaitech, STJU_BioX_Shanghai and ECUST to our ONLive. We were delighted to find out that there were students from other universities watching our LIVE and asking questions. There was even a girl who watched our 1st ONLive in UITC Hefei, which is far away from Shanghai, and came to ONLive to ask questions. Some audience members said something about what more can our project do. Some of the suggestions even made it into our projects (we thought they were reasonable). There was also a symposium among iGEM teams after the Live and we exchanged ideas. We also set up a webcast and gave ONLive to iGEM teams in other provinces.
Teaching is a pleasure
According to the questionnaire, more than half of the people interviewed want to learn more about Biology by playing games. So we designed the board game 'BIO-CREATOR'. In this game, players will act as a creator of the ecosystem and try to maintain its stability. Players can use Synthetic Biology method cards to strengthen their own ecosystem. We printed the scientifically accurate information on the back of the cards.

In Sep 26th, we went to Shenzhen High School to give the students there a public course, and what’s more, we had a communication with their teachers and we finally had a common view of cooperation in synthetic biology in the future.
The public course was the same as we had in Shenzhen Experimental High School. It included the history of synthetic biology, and we described it with a very easy way for understanding. Then we talked about the basic idea and knowledge of synthetic biology, and helped them to understand how we can build a new circuit. After that, we focused on the safety and humanity of this new subject, which is the most important part to let citizens accept this mysterious thing. The last part was about iGEM, and this was the most interesting part; those students were very interested about it.
We had a very cheerful conversation with their teachers that they tried our software and we decided to have a cooperation of popularizing synthetic biology in their school in the future. That’s a big step of popularizing synthetic biology in Shenzhen, because they are the best high school here, and they can lead other schools to know and learn synthetic biology.

Delivered first official presentation, to Biohacker, a biotechnology startup.
Week 18: 8 August - 14 August
Wet Lab
Amanda, Orion, Claudia: Could not confirm expression of EtnR1 and EtnR2 in BL21(pLysS) cells, so decided to transform EtnR1 and EtnR2 constructs into BL21(pGro7) cells, which express chaperonins that could assist in protein folding
Sing-young and Alma: Started fourth round of amilCP error-prone PCR.
Dry Lab
Transcription parameters: found Etr1-GST values for DNA binding activity. However, these are in units of radioactivity “counts” so they must be converted to a rate constant to be applicable to our model.
Primer design app: researched into an app that would potentially crawl multiple primer design software and collate all the results into a single platform.
Human Practices
Alma, Amanda, Claudia, Wunna, Liam: Volunteered at Science in the Swamp, entertaining and educating young children about science.
Claudia: Delivered a STEM talk at Gordon Library.
Week 19: 15 August - 21 August
Wet Lab
Amanda, Orion and Sing-young: Continued testing expression of EtnR1 and EtnR2 in BL21(pGro7) cells.
Alma: Sequenced fourth batch of amilCP mutants and started fifth round of amilCP error-prone PCR.
Claudia: Attempted the Interlab with protocol modifications.

Brasil-USP,2015,Team:Brasil-USP#Practices#WomanInScience_-_-_TEXT.html," Several initiatives have emerged over the last decade to encourage more and more women to become active in such areas. Just a famous and popular example is the Women of Silicon Valley facebook page. We contacted another very sucessfull endeavor that has recently started on our own home town: PyLadies (click here for PyLadies international home page ). From their website, they are ""an international mentorship group with a focus on helping more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community."" Python is a high-level programming language that is spreading faster and faster every year. But it is not only about being a programming language and the fact that women are rare among computer scientists: Python is embedded in an environment of rich collaborations and mutual help. An environment where everyone is invited to participate and contribute however possible.
PyLadies São Carlos is the only PyLadies organization in the whole state of São Paulo (check here ), right in the home town of our team. During our discussion with Gabriela Mattos, representing PyLadies São Carlos, we learned that this strong spirit of community can bond women that otherwise would go through college and computer science studies all by themselves. Their ideal is to bring together women with this common interest and make them leaders among Python developers and software engineering. PyLadies São Carlos is in its first year, but is composed by people engaged with the group's ideals. They have been giving talks in conferences and classes to high-school students. We will share just a bit of all we learned with PyLadies São Carlos. Don't hesitate contacting them if you are interested in joing the group or even if you just want to get in touch with other people with the same interest!
It is not a secret that women in computer-based areas are somewhat lonely. And it is not about not having colleagues to talk to: sometimes, it is because your (male) colleagues won't see you as their peer; as their colleague. In the 60`s-80`s, according to Gabriela's research, the number of men and women attending computer science classes were almost equal. Yes, 50% men, 50% women on average. Apparently, this is due to the fact that secretaries were expected to have a ""background with computers"" - i.e., the majority wanted to learn how to type instead of dreaming with becoming a computer scientist or a software engineer. With time, and especially when computers became very popular and companies dropped the need of a college degree, they massively stopped enrolling to such disciplines. Nowadays, in most of computer science courses in Brazil, only about 10% of all freshmen are"

The design of antisense RNA's
The antisense-RNA's have been designed to be complementary to the transcribed mRNA's using Sfold. We have designed 12 antisense-RNA's that have different length and are aiming at the ribosome binding site in the beginning of the mRNA transcript and also a bit downstream where we had a high probability for an exposed segment of the mRNA's.
The Constructs
Preliminary Results
The Triparental mating worked very well for the antisense RNA constructs, of the eleven transformed all but two have plenty of colonies. For E1A1 and E1B2 however we only got one colony per construct, contrasting with the evenly distributed hundreds of colonies all of the other construct have. As all constructs were treated in the same way and all shuttle plasmids were verified by colony PCR this results seem very strange. An explanation could be that the E1A1 and E1B2 constructs are simple very effective at disrupting the PDC. The promoter we use, pPetE , is copper inducible and for most purposes it is enough not to add copper to the medium for it to be considered silent. However, with an extremely toxic product the slight transcription resulting from trace copper on glassware and in other salts maight be enough to severly limit cell growth, leading to the absence of colonies.
These results are preliminary and we will to the Jamboree have tried to re-transform the E1A1 and E1B2 constructs and induced the other constructs to evaluate their effect. If we again fail at the transformation of E1A1 and E1B2 and we can show effect of other antisense RNA:s we can probably safely assume the cause of failure to be high efficiency of inhibition.
Unmodified pictures can be found here:
Media:Uppsala_antisense_RNA.zip
Status
The antisense RNA project has been the smoothest of our projects and we will most probably have definite results of the constructs effects et the Jamboree. As of now we have inoculated all constructs except E1A1, E1B2 and E1B3, that's a success rate of 75% at the first try! While the E1B3 construct failed due to a bad transformation we, as mentioned above, have some reason to believe that the reason for the E1A1 and E1B2 might be more fun.

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," the data? What’s the time between Ok, I think this person has trachoma and the treatment with antibiotics?
George:
From the time we say this one has trachoma to the time we give treatment? Usually trachoma has got stages and we can [recognize] trachoma All the stages are very easy. By just looking at you I will know, this one has trachoma. Than we treat right there, because some of them with trichiasis, the stage where the eyelashes are touching the globe, so it’s very easy. You only treat them. Just when some eyelashes are touching the globe, than you know this one has trachoma, then you straight away start treating with antibiotics. If they are children you don’t expect to have such signs because the trichiasis will only come when there is recurrence of infection. Recurrence, recurrence, recurrence. So in children you don’t expect trichiasis. [...] you flip the lid and see the follicles that I was talking about. [...] So that’s how we treat. So we train our clinicians. It doesn’t take long because according to the stages, how I said, if it’s trichiasis you just see the signs and you say this is trachoma. You do the surgery and you make sure you cut so that the lashes don’t touch the globe. If it’s in children you make sure you treat so that the bacteria should die.
Dominika:
What are some problems you encounter when you are collecting data or when you are analysing data?
George:
[...] I am used [to] my data package, so I don’t have too much problems. Maybe there are some softwares I need to pay. Maybe they will tell you for you to do this type of analysis you need to pay or you should be a member of this for you to do maybe to do all these results you need to pay less much or maybe you have a nice craft you need to pay or there is maybe a free version and they will tell you if you want to use this pay this. So maybe this are challenges but otherwise in the analysis I can analyse global data in five minutes. If you ask me now: tell us how many people of this and this? [acts like he is hacking] ENTER. And it shows me. So in terms of analysis, Itˋnot a really big challenge. So the only challenge might be experience. So it takes much time to understand one thing. But otherwise it’s not a very big challenge.

Interlab
Worldshaper-XSHS team has participated in the Fifth International InterLab Measurement Study, Plate Reader and Colony Forming Unit (CFU), from June to August 2018, and uploaded the results twice, in July and August respectively. We followed the official CFU protocol, took the measurement together with another two high school teams: the ASTWS-China team and the HFLS-ZhejiangUnited team.
We feel greatly honored to be able to participate in the Interlab study. As a group of high school students, we have learnt a lot from feeling difficult in even reading the protocol at the beginning to finally being able to complete the whole experiment. However, the process really has been extremely difficult.
It took us two months from registering to join in the study on June 20 to eventually being recognized, which is a much longer time than that of many other teams. Joining in the iGEM competition was our first opportunity to come face to face with professional biological knowledge, upon which we realized that we lacked in both technical knowledge and experimental skills. In order to do a better job, we started preparing for Interlab early. We urged our group members to study the protocol carefully and thoroughly, confirm the materials and equipment for the experiment and practice the various experimental skills in advance. In this process, we encountered a lot of difficulties, all of which were solved, fortunately. For example, during the study of the protocol, we didn’t know how to prepare the serial dilution of Microspheres in a more evenly way, what the differences between OD600 and Abs600 are as well as how to dilute the bacterial solutions to a specific OD value. Fortunately, our laboratory is located in the College of Life Science of Zhejiang University, which gives us the convenience in consulting with the graduate students Qiu Yue and Lei Zhaoying. Under their explanation and guidance, we got a grasp of the specific steps. Another example is in terms of experimental conditions. We did not have plate readers in our lab. Luckily, we eventually borrowed one from other labs in the College of Life Science with the help of our mentor. Yet"

Additionally, they told us about various parties that are working on the conversion of cellulose into glucose. Lastly they gave us the suggestion to use glucose instead of cellulose for our project. However, we decided this was not feasible as we do not want to be competing with the the food industry.

Avantium: Ronny Pals (31st August 2018)
Rianne, Jens, Benno, Bram and team associate Tjerk Douma visited Chemical Park Delfzijl where we had a meeting with Avantium . Avantium is chemically breaking down wood chips to hemicellulose, glucose and lignin. Their technology allows them to break down cellulose with acid to glucose monomers in one reactor with high yields while recovering the acid. We are trying to do exactly the same, but enzymatically by employing our cellulosome. We agreed to test the suitability of Avantiums glucose for growth medium for our cells. Beyond that we learned a lot about the process of valorizing innovations in general. They gave us many insights regarding the financial and technical bottlenecks that stand between a promising idea and a large scale profitable industrial process. We were impressed by Avantiums technology as it is robust, works with almost any type of wood and requires only very little material preparation, especially in comparison to our enzymatic approach. An important take-away for us was that we have to consider the expenses and environmental implications of our cellulose pretreatment (grinding, autoclaving, phosphorylating) as well.

BioBTX: Pieter Imhof (25th July 2018)
As suggested by the Science Shop, we got into contact with Pieter Imhof of BioBTX . This company produces chemical intermediates out of biomass, however they use a chemical process. They explained to us how they use pyrolysis and combine this with a catalytic conversion step. In this way they are able to reach aromatics yields of approximately 30-70%, with BTX (Benzene, Toluene, Xylene) yields ranging from 5-40%, with yields dependent on the feedstock and used process conditions.       Regarding our project, Mr. Imhof thought that the process of turning glucose into styrene does not have high enough yields to be economically feasible. However, he thought that the conversion of cellulose to glucose in one reactor, combined with"

Assembly
For the bioreactor the breaKERs bought many parts to make our concept a reality. We bought parts from pet stores, local sellers, and hardware stores including: glass wine carboys, a fish tank aerator and pump, and a heat pad. Initially we ran into a few problems including but not limited to the LED backbone of the aerator not fitting inside the hole of the carboy, the tube from the aerator being too buoyant and floating when the carboy was filled with liquid, as well as the heating mat being an ineffective method of warming the liquid broth inside the carboy. We fixed these problems moderately quickly with simple solutions like separating the aerator tube from the a backbone, weighing down the tube with nuts and bolts, secured with elastic bands, and warming the growth medium before putting it into the carboy. The bioreactor took roughly a few months to plan, weeks to get the parts and a few weeks to assemble and it was a great opportunity to see how a few vague ideas about implementation could turn into a physical prototype of a bioreactor.
Testing
To test the bioreactor the breKERs still had to determine whether it could hold the construct at the optimal pH and temperature. This was done by assembling the bioreactor and filling it with water, a suitable placeholder for LB broth medium, and measuring the temperature and pH after a certain period of time. Through some initial problems we managed to keep the bioreactor at optimal growing conditions and then in theory convert to the optimal expression pH for the keratinaze enzyme at 8.5 for 50C. In theory the bioreactor will be able to create an environment for both the bacteria and the enzyme to perform to their maximum capacity.

Edinburgh_UG,2018,Team:Edinburgh UG#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," have designed a model that predicts the degradation time point for every possible promoter-RBS combination for Colicin and Imm2               using the Anderson promoters and ribosome binding sites on the iGEM registry. From this model we selected promoter BBa_J23105 for Imm2, and promoter BBa_J23106 for Colicin E2. Both parts had RBS BBa_J61107 and Terminator BBa_B0010
Semantic Containment
The second lock in our triple lock system ensures that even if the first lock fails, an environmental cell would not be able to express and utilise a gene obtained from our               maxicells. The basis for this came from the Paris-Bettencourt 2012 project but we have taken it a step further. This involved rewriting the DNA of our instructor plasmid so that it cannot be read by a foreign organism. Essentially we're giving our plasmid a different language.
The basis of semantic containment lies in the mutation of the supD gene - a tRNA amber suppressor - which causes amber STOP codons to be read as a serine codon instead. Our sequence may be re-coded to change serine codons to amber STOP codons, and as long as it has the supD mutation the genes will be translated correctly. However, if a foreign organism were to take up the DNA, it would read the amber codons as a STOP, producing a non-functional, truncated protein. This was achieved by Paris-Bettencourt using one and two serine codon replacements with amber STOP codons in the kanamycin resistance gene, which they designated P1003* and P1003**. This allows easy quantification of the effective expression of recoded genes by non-supD mutants simply by testing growth rates on kanamycin. Paris-Bettencourt's results showed that non-supD mutants with the recoded P1003* and P1003** genes showed limited growth on kanamycin, suggesting that the recoding was successful to a certain extent. We decided, however, that these results did not show a high enough level of security, and so we planned to go a step further.
Before designing parts for this, we again approached the problem by utilising rational design. We modelled the probability of a translational read-through with increasing numbers of amber             stop codons present in a coding sequence. With 2 amber codons, 1 in every 10,000 translation attempts will be able to generate a read through and express the recoded gene. When aiming for complete safety and containment, this is not good enough"

Aim of the experiment: Reapeat of transformation of E. coli XL1-Blue with ligation products of P71+P322, P71+P323, P206+P337 and P342+PCR66 from August, the 13th. The reason is that the freshly prepared competent cells are contaminated with a foreign plasmid.
Procedure:
5 µl of the ligation products (P71+P322, P71+P323, P206+P337 and P342+PCR66) and their negative controls (P206 NK, P324 NK) were added to 100 µl of CaCl2 competent E. coli XL1-Blue cells on ice.
30 min incubation on ice.
5 min heat shock at 37 °C
Adding of 1 ml LB-medium to each tube.
Incubation for 45 min at 37 °C in the 180 rpm cell-culture shaker.
100 µl of those cell suspension were plated on suitable antiotic plates.
The rest were centrifuged for 1 min at 13000 rpm and the supernatant was dicarded.
The pellet was resuspended in 100 µl of LB-medium and this concentrated cell suspension was plated again on suitable antbiotic plates. Accidently, only the pellet of P342+PCR66 and P342 NK was plated.

The coil sequences to be used:
K3 (K-coil):KIAALKEKIAALKEKIAALKE
E3 (E-coil):EIAALEKEIAALEKEIAALEK
Upon examination of their work and the sequences used, we noted a discrepancy in their data. According to the PDB file and NMR structure elicited in 2004 5, the coils interact in a parallel fashion, incorrectly identified as antiparallel in the registry: K coil and E coil. This has now been reviewed by us to indicate the correct interaction according to the PDB file 1U0I (Take a look at the experience pages for both the E coil and K coil to read about our changes).
Figure 6. Theoretical AFP-Scaffold Complex. Parallel coiled coil interactions selectively attach the AFP to the 12-mer scaffold. The blue ends of the coils represent the N-terminus, and the red the C-terminus.
To generate a model of our complex, the E-coil was fused to the Type III AFP and the K-coil was fused to the scaffold subunits. The expected interaction is a parallel alignment as depicted in Figure 6. The introduction of a flexible region between the C-terminus of the scaffold subunit and the coil is introduced to allow the coil movement to enable an interaction to occur without steric hindrance from the protein units.
Coiled-Coil Stability Simulations
Before using these coils we sought out to test their stability and method of interaction in its native form. The coils selected for our project is represented by the PDB file 1U0I, an NMR-solved crystal structure. These coils are described to interact in a parallel fashion (Figure 7a). To simulate this interaction, the individual coils were solvated and run thorugh MD simulations in GROMACS.
To simulate an antiparallel coiled-coil interaction, the K-coil's amino acid sequences were inverted such that it sat antiparallel to the E-coil. The file was then run though PyRosetta docking programs to undergo energy minimization, generating the most stable conformation. This file, with separated coil subunits, was then also run through GROMACS simulations (Figure 7b).

mRFP and iLOV
The red fluorescent protein was selected because its bright red colour can be clearly seen when produced in E. coli, as well as its availability from the CIDAR ICE repository. On the other hand, iLOV was selected because of its many advantages that could make it a better option than the most widely used green fluorescent protein. Its gene size is only 336 base pairs; most of the other fluorescent proteins available are at least twice as big. Its size, its reported superior photostability as well as its ability to fluoresce under anaerobic conditions make it an interesting reporter to be used across multiple organisms (Christie et al. 2012).

The LacI protein is required for the adequate repression of Plac derived promoters. Without its binding to the operator region of these promoters, there is nothing blocking transcription and therefore gene expression. In an effort to improve the reaction time of the induction and have better control over induction, research groups have suggested the addition of a LVA degradation tag to the C-terminus of LacI. The LVA tag is a short peptide sequence that marks the intended protein sequence for degradation by cellular proteases (Karzai et al. 2000).  In E. coli, however, at least one study seems to show that LacI without the tag actually reacts quicker in response to inducers (Andreassen et al. 2014). In Synechocystis it has been suggested that the amount of LacI present is correlated to the leakiness of LacI dependent promoters (Albers et al. 2015). It has also been reported that the addition of the highly active LVA tag to proteins greatly decreases protein concentration (Wang et al. 2012). It is because of this that the synthesis of a LacI without an LVA tag was decided.
Predicting coding sequences for simultaneous use in multiple chassi
Before focusing on developing new synthetic biology tools for organisms, one must try to elucidate as much as possible on the mechanism of its existing genetic framework. Even when promoter sequences and the molecular machinery between E. coli  and Synechocystis are considered similar, DNA parts are not directly transferrable (Ramey et al. 2015). Aside from regulatory sequences, coding sequences can sometimes be troublesome to work with, especially if these are not codon optimized for the selected organism. For the work group this"

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.
