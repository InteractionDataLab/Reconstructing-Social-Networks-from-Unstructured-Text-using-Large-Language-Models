Survey About Biotechnology
With this survey we intended to get an overview about what people already know about Vitamin B12 and what is their opinion to biotechnology in general.
The responses told us a lot about the knowledge of the people about biotechnology which is still lacking since most people think they rarely use products that are produced biotechnologically. Nevertheless, the majority of people see a high potential in biotechnology and synthetic biology, which includes production of Vitamin B12 .
Moreover, even if many people say they eat meat twice or three times a week, many people do not think they use a product that was produced biotechnolgically daily.
Furthermore, it is to mention that most of the participants of the survey were biologists, which could distort some results. Hence, it is important to mention that most people see a high potential for biotechnology in various fields, like diagnostics, food processing and industrial production. An important point is that most people think that biotechnolgy is a very powerful tool but needs to be carefully handled, hinting towards the awareness of new biologists for the consequneces of their work.
Postcard Campaign
One important goal of the iGEM competition is to get attention by the public, and awake people’s interest in a scientific field which plays a very important role in all our everyday lifes: Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology. In order to achieve this, and to spread our ideas and views regarding this topic, the iGEM Team Düsseldorf initialized a postcard campaign. Besides our team and team Düsseldorf, also the teams from Aachen, Bielefeld, Darmstadt, Erlangen, Hannover and Tübingen took part. The concept of this campaign was that iGEM Teams from all over Germany design postcards with an important aspect of Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology combined with a catchy motif, and exchange them with all the other teams. Now having a large variety of different postcards, the teams distribute them to the public. The aim is to give non-scientists an understanding of Synthetic Biology, what this means, and in which parts of our life it is involved. In order to give an impuls of thinking, we decided to create a postcard with the title “TOP DOWN"

Lysis Selection System
Lysis selection system Main | Lysis Characterization | DNA Recovery | DNA Selection | T7 Promoter Variants
One major challenge in designing new regulatory parts is to determine which combinations of transcription factors and binding sequences match. From previous research and our own MITOMI experiments, we know which DNA sequences TetR binds to, and which residues of TetR participate in binding, but we do not know how changing these residues will affect either binding affinity or specificity. Molecular dynamics simulations and other theoretical approaches have not come any closer to answering these questions. In short, we know too little about protein-DNA interaction to intelligently design transcription factors. To make up for this lack of knowledge, we present an experimental system to select valid binding pairs from many random tetR and pTet mutants, based on an inducible lysis gene.
The system – in a way a ""survival of the weakest"" – is related to directed evolution. A lysis system based on the K112808 lysis device is indirectly activated by tetR. Therefore, if in a given cell the tetR variant present can bind to the tetR promoter, the cell lyses and releases its DNA into the culture media. From there, DNA can be recovered and amplified, tranformed, or directly sequenced. By design, this DNA codes for a combination of TF and promoter with high mutual affinity, and therefore almost directly yields a valid regulatory part. In this light, it is a useful component of our transcription factor development pipeline.
This is a direct and practical way of solving the problem of selecting high affinity pairs among the millions of possible combinations of transcription factors and promoters. It can be seen as a form of DNA-based information processing, and is therefore also a neat example of a problem more efficiently solved by non-conventional computation.
To develop the system, we began with a simple experiment to check that a lysis cassette in a plasmid could lyse with greater efficiency as a function"
SDU-Denmark,2015,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour30_-_-_TEXT.html," can be divided into 2 fragments; T18 and T25. When these 2 subunits come together, it enables the production of cAMP. cAMP levels can be monitored by a cAMP-induced promoter expressing a reporter gene; in our case, Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP). RFP can be detected either by eye or quantitativly by flourecense microscopy.  The variable part of the peptide aptamer will be generated through a nucleotide library. The library consist of different sequences generated from 60 random nucleotide basepairs flanked by a suffix and prefix, this can be considered the variable part of the peptide aptamer. This is inserted in a scaffold protein, Human Thioredoxin (hTrx), which can be considered as the constant part of the peptide aptamer.  If the amino acid sequence of the variable part matches the target protein, RFP will be expressed in the cells and we have created a peptide aptamer for the given target protein.
Evaluation of large-scale production will be performed to determine whether it is valid to continue the work after iGEM. A production of 250 [batches/yr] of approximately one liter per batch with a concentration of 2 [g/L] is assumed appropriate on basis of a market analysis. A cost analysis was conducted and showed a profitability in all parameters at a price at 4% that of monoclonal antibodies. Which leads us to conclude, that there are grounds to keep up the good work.

Design
We designed a novel and safe data storage and transmission     system by combining digital and biological safety precautions. The system     consists of the data which is to be transmitted or preserved,     further called: the message, and a key to the message. The key     functions as a password to retrieve the message. Whilst the message     is encrypted and thereby protected by the digital key, the key     itself also needs protection. Therefore we developed a system of     different biological safety layers. Our CryptoGErM system is an     unhackable bioencryption system. Even if cyber criminals would     intercept the system, they would not be able to get their hands on     the message because they lack the key. To access the key not only     general knowledge about molecular biology is required. The     recipient has to know specific information about the exact     biological procedure that has to be applied in order to access the     key.
Watch this animation to learn about the CryptoGErM system!
Applications:
CryptoGErM has three main possibilities of application. Short     messages can be encrypted in the genome of Bacillus subtilis as     described in this chapter. The genome of B. subtilis consists of     approximately 4 million base pairs. Two bits are converted into one     base pair. Thus, 1 MB could be stored in the genome of one     bacterium.
For sending of larger datasets it would be possible to send the     encrypted data via conventional methods like email and only send     the key in spores.
Furthermore it is an option to divide the dataset over the     genome of several bacteria. This would also provide a way of long     term storage of large datasets.
Learn more about the applications of CryptoGErM
Encryption and Conversion
The message that is to be sent and stored is encrypted     using the Rijndael algorithm. This     means the message is encoded so only an authorized person can read     it. The plain text is being converted to cipher text. In this state     the message cannot be read. The algorithm requires a key for the     encryption process. This key can be a word just like a password. In     theory it is possible to decrypt the message without the key but a     lot of computing power, knowledge and resources are"

Dundee,2016,Team:Dundee#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html,". The stomach exerts mechanical stress, amongst other stresses, on the contents of the stomach. To prove that the BactiFeed we designed would survive the harsh mechanical stress we passed samples of BactiFeed through the ACME Stomach Masher. The Stomach masher uses a motorized pulley system to move a zip-lock bag of contents through the rollers taken from recycled printers. All parts of the hardware were taken from recycled or donated materials.
Figure . Includes an image and video of the experiment carried out in our lab. The stomach masher may also be operated manually to save on energy and is therefore environmentally sustainable. In the video we show a combination of motor force and manual utilization.
Figure 2. This shows the hardware sufficiently mashes up our samples, any liquids may be added to the sample such as adjusted pH media to enhance the stomach-simulated environment. The masher may also be applied to other uses, which require mechanical stress testing.
Figure 3: Western blot of experiment carried out by Stomach Masher. No GFP observed when bound by anti-GFP antibody.
The stomach masher experiment was repeated three times, once with total lysate, once with pelleted lysate and then once with clarified lysate. Western blots were then run to see whether we could detect any GFP with the anti-GFP antibody. No GFP was detected, this could be because the conditions were at pH4 and the optimum pH for the promoter was between 5 and 6.
We also used this device to test parts sent to us by UCL 2016 IGEM team, so the hardware has aided in our collaborations!

The mathematical modeling theory outlined on this page was integrated in the creation of our application, to ensure reliable results.
Relating Relative Promoter Units to Transcription Rate
Relating Relative Promoter Units to Transcription Rate
Assumption:
The first major assumption, is declaring ""Promoter Activity"" , to be a direct model of transcription rate. ""Promoter Activity"" is the number of RNAP molecules that clear the final base pair of a promoter (with units of [PoPS]  = Polymerase per second).
Thus,
Where,
Thus, through simple substitution:
The modelling can further be simplified through a series of assumptions:
1) GFP expressed from test and standard promoters, have equivalent maturation rates, as they mature under the same conditions:
2) Since both the test and standard promoters are carried on the same plasmid backbone, assume they have the same average copy number:
3) Since promoters have been standardized to have identical transcription initiation sites (predicted) and identical sequences downstream of the site, we expect them to produce the same mRNA sequences.
Therefore,
Expect transcribed mRNA to be identical, implying mRNA degradation rates are equivalent:
Thus, we assume translational rates of immature GFP from some mRNA are equal:
4) Assume that immature GFP is stable. Therefore, protein degradation is negligable compared to dilution due to cell growth.
Thus:
Thus,
and if
Then,
Therefore, we assume the difference between growth rates of cells containing the test promoter construct and cells containing the standard promoter construct, is negligible compared to the maturation rate of GFP.
Thus, for the purposes of QGEM's modelling;
Relating Transcription Rate to Protein Production
Relating Transcription Rate to Proteins Produced
Assumption:
CsgA alone and CsgA-fusions (such as CsgA-AFP8 and CsgA-SpyTag) behave similarly in terms of transcription in the cells.
The transcription rate of the CsgA gene is modeled as follows:
where,
Thus, by the stated assumption, the transcription rate of CsgA-fusions can be modeled with the same equation.

Actually, SPRING is a measurement system which is designed to detect antibiotics in                                 natural water bodies. As figure-1 shows, the system SPRING includes Optical part,                                 Hardware part and Software part. Optical part is actually Michelson Interferometer, which                                 can transform the shape change of a film into the change of interference fringe. Based                                 on a Raspberry-Pi, hardware part can take photos or videos of interference fringe, then                                 our software analyses them or transmits to your PC. Finally, we’ll see the results on                                 the screen.
figure 1:The whole design of our electhic part and optical part
Why SPRING? Because we strongly call for limpid rives, just like spring flowing                                 between mountains. Nowadays, contamination issue in river becomes more and more serious.                                 Not only excessive antibiotic emission in China, lots of other toxic heavy metal ion,                                 organic materials are found in river, which tremendously threaten public health and ecological balance. Consequently, we name our main body of device, SPRING, we hope with                                 the assistance of our SPRING, we are able to share and enjoy those clean river, like                                 those past days.
Michelson Interferometer
The Michelson interferometer is common configuration for optical interferometry and was                                 invented by Albert Abraham Michelson. Using a beam-splitter, a light source is split                                 into two arms. Each of those is reflected back toward the beam-splitter which then                                 combines their amplitudes interferometrically. The resulting interference pattern that                                 is not directed back toward the source is typically directed to some type of                                 photoelectric detector or camera. Depending on the interferometer's particular                                 application, the two paths may be of different lengths or include optical materials                                 or components under test.
This is our design of optical part.
Figure 2: The design of our Michelson Interferometer
Hardware Module
Cooperating with the optical part, the electric circuit part makes use of a CCD camera to                                 take pictures of interference fringe, and then our software in the Raspberry-Pi analyses                                 them and display the results on the screen.
This is our design of hardware part.

ZJU-China,2013,Team:ZJU-China#HumanPractice#BeyondTheTale#ScienceFair_-_-_TEXT.html," about synthetic biology. Choice #5 is in the “None” category, which shows that the respondents know nothing at all.
The result of question 4
The result of question 4 shows that about 70% of participants have at least heard of the terminology of “synthetic biology”. We are fortunate to meet an undergraduate student who has been paying attention to synthetic biology and iGEM for a long time. But still there were 67% of the attendants in the “partly” category. One of the reason that causing this rate being so high is that 58 out of 69 (~84%) attendants were undergraduates or above. Another reason is that there may be some confusions between synthetic biology and more generic biological disciplines (genetics, genetic engineering, etc.). Nonetheless, this result shows that the public (or even college students) still have little awareness of synthetic biology.
The result of question 5
Question 5 is a question concerning the attitude of using bacteria. Over 80% of the respondents say that they have been thinking of using bacteria to do something, and even 7% of them made their thoughts into practice. About 15% said that they didn’t ever think of doing something using bacteria. Amazingly, none of the respondents thought that using bacteria is ridiculous. We think that this is because we already have some mature technologies and industries that use bacteria (for example, fermentation engineering and brewers). We are happy to see that luckily, people have little resistance to bacteria technologies and products.
The result of question 6
We designed question 6 so as to see what the public think synthetic biology can do. The result shows that the public hold the view that bacteria can only do biological or medical jobs. Though attendants are granted to choose more than one answers, some choices seem to grab more popularity. More than 40 people chose the “mineral water production” and “cure diseases” choices, which is approximately over 60% among all respondents. The choices “material for printing”, “improve tastes” and “batteries” also receive many votes, which reflects that some people consider bacteria can do some work that is not closely related to biology and cells. Choices “calculate 1+1”, “photographing”, “compass” and “USB drive” have the least votes, since these issues are sort of physical and electronic ones. There still exists some votes for the “dangerous” choice, reflecting that some people are strictly concerning about the safety of bacteria and its products.

This is the iteration plan for the Construction iteration(s). See the UPEDU artifact description for information on what this is and what it contains (including a template).
Milestone
These are the major milestone objectives for the Construction phase:
TODO Our wonderful buoyant, metal filtering bacteria should be alive and kicking!
TODO (?) The lab/plan cloning strategy should be fully worked out at the end of the phase to reflect our final decisions on which parts/protocols/procedures/? to use. (I think this roughly corresponds to the Implementation Model in UPEDU. -- Jaspervdg 11:09, 23 June 2009 (UTC))

However, when a gel was run on the digest, the results still appeared incorrect. Consequently, the RXers decided to return to a previous step in order to retry the ligation between pBAD-CsgA and dCBD. Previously digested samples of pBAD-CsgA with KpnI and HindIII were further cut with the same enzymes to achieve a more thorough digestion.
Week 9: July 24-28
Monday (07/24/17)
Sense/Respond: The day was a bit more relaxed for the Monday morning. The weekly lab meeting was scheduled and the students were able to learn a lot about other researchers and their current studies. In addition, they learned how to present to an audience and create simple but informational slides. Afterwards, they enjoyed a team lunch together with mentors to discuss the Michigan meet up. The  ecstatic students exchanged travel ideas and a powerpoint presentation for the ""mini- jamboree"". Afterwards, the young researchers returned to the lab to pick colonies from Friday  to grow overnight in LB-Chl. They then left for the afternoon to get on wi-fi and worked on the wiki and human outreach goals.
Packaging: Lab Fun Day!
Tuesday (07/25/17)
Sense/Respond: The adventures continue the next morning as the team went back into the lab to look at the overnight cultures. Tina and Hayley were extremely pleased to find their cultures had grown perfectly and were ready to do the mini-prep and nano drop. However, Dallas and Jason did not get favorable results. They were very disappointed to find out that their cultures had not grown and would need to restart and pick other colonies.
Packaging: The RXers attended a branch meeting and then worked to develop presentations for the Journal Talk on Friday, and for Michigan State. Later, the team performed a gel extraction protocol on the digests from Friday and created a gel for gel electrophoresis on Wednesday.
Wednesday (07/25/17)
Packaging: The entire iGEM team met in the morning at RH to practice the Michigan State presentation and to discuss the trip. Later the RXers ran a gel of the gel extractions, as well as checking the concentrations with the Nanodrop. The results were not entirely desirable, likely due to the number of protocols performed with the samples, but a ligation was set up and performed. Vanessa helped the team gather pictures and begin work on their Friday presentation.

Our approach to snake venom detection, utilising the proteolytic activity of different venoms, has several potential advantages compared to current methods used for snake venom detection:
- The recombinant proteins can be produced at a lower price compared to the current immunological methods, which involves inoculating snake venom in horses.
- With this approach, we are able to find new potential target peptides for snake venom cleavage in a relatively fast and cheap way. Screening of these peptides is much less time consuming and easier than trying to identify suitable antibodies for the venom enzymes and toxins.
- If reliable measurements can be made, we might be able to not only detect which snake people have been bitten by, but also to determine the level of venom injected into the blood.
Choice of snakes
The focus of our project was sub-Saharan Africa, where snakebites are more common than other regions of the continent. Approximately 1 million snakebites occur in sub-Saharan Africa annually, resulting in up to 500.000 envenomations, 25.000 deaths and another 20.000 permanent disabilities. Due to no reliable reporting system in place, victims often never report their injury to clinical facilities, which makes these numbers  uncertain [7].
In sub-Saharan Africa, over 50% of snakebite incidents are not appropriately treated. Most victims, who receive treatment by healthcare professionals, have nevertheless delayed seeking medical attention sometimes up to 1 to 2 weeks. In many sub-Saharan countries, poor availability of expensive antivenom contributes to increased morbidity and mortality, whilst snakebites continue to remain a neglected health problem.
In that region, approximately 60% of all bites are caused by vipers, with the puff adder (Bitis arietans) being responsible for the most fatalities overall. For that reason, we chose these species to be of primary focus in our experiments.
Figure 1: Picture of Bitis arietans by 4028mdk09
Sub-Saharan Africa also hosts cobra species of the Elapidae family, which in forested areas, cause 30% of all venomous bites. One of the most prominent of them is black-necked spitting cobra (Naja nigricollis), which was also chosen as a representative of the Elapidae family for our project.

3.- Developing the project idea
After taking all of the above into consideration, together with our love for environmental biotechnology, we decided to tackle the local problem of bagasse waste from a global perspective: plastic waste. We decided to produce bioplastic from this residue by the development of a genetically engineered organism. Our project, PHAgave, also consists of a way of bioplastic production that is more circular and sustainable, instead of destining the production of new resources as the raw material for bioplastic production.
To corroborate the issue, validate our project idea and become immersed in the tequila production process, we visited several small and medium production plants, including El tequileño, Camarena, Saro, Tequilera El Olvido and El triángulo, all of them based in our home state, Jalisco. Jalisco has a lot of small Tequila producers that play an important role for the country’s economy. They told us how bagasse was a problem for them: they have A LOT of it, and it takes up a lot of volume, representing a contamination problem for the community, due to toxic leakages and mosquito proliferation. Usually the disposal is problematic and they even have to invest money to get rid of the huge quantities.
4.- Lab experimentation
Conscious on how crucial it is to protect the biological integrity of our ecosystems, especially when working with genetically modified organisms we collaborated with the Mexican Association of Biosafety to organize a Risk Analysis course, in which we got certified ourselves. We learned the three steps of a Risk Analysis: Risk Assessment, Risk management and Risk communication. We also reviewed the concept of “One Health” that emphasizes the interrelationship between animal, human and plant health. All of these concepts were taken into account when we designed and carried out our project. We also developed a Risk Analysis ourselves that can be found in our Biosafety section.
Biosafety
5.- Manufacturing
We certainly don't just want our project to end this november at the jamboree. We have considered the commercialization of our project and have developed a business model, designed in a way that the community is benefited from the use of environmentally friendly bioplastics. Also agronomy studies were taken into account. Tequila is not the only fermented beverage produced in Mexico, lots of small communities produce other fermented beverages from different Agave species, which could also be used under the model of our project.

Stanford,2010,Team:Stanford_-_-_TEXT.html," inducible promoter upstream of a coding sequence, either the sequence for the kinase or the phosphatase. The coding sequence for the transcription factor is under the control of a constitutive promoter; therefore, there is always some basal level of the transcription factor present. The reporter gene is under control of an inducible promoter than can only be activated by a phosphorylated transcription factor. The transcription factor can only be phosphorylated by the kinase, the amount of which is controlled by the concentration of an inducer chemical. Likewise, the phosphorylated transcription factor can be dephosphorylated by the phosphatase, the amount of which is controlled by the concentration of a second inducer chemical. Thus, the intensity of the reporter output is a function of the relative concentrations of inducers: a ratio.
An iGEM Community: Why Twitter?
Our team also created an iGEM 2010 list on Twitter to allow teams to help each other solve lab problems and share ideas. We reviewed a similar system in place at MIT, which allowed members of the bioengineering department to send out short requests and tips to each other.
We chose Twitter with the following parameters in mind:
Ease of use: our community should require minimal technical ability and have a straightforward user interface
Speed and breadth of distribution: any query should be quickly sent out to the entire iGEM community, where it should be easy for other teams to see and respond to
Brevity of messages: shorter messages are more likely to receive responses, and we wanted to avoid having long, intricate requests ignored by the community
Pre-existing community: teams would more quickly adopt something that other teams were already doing, rather than something we created from scratch
When we looked at these factors, Twitter came out as a top choice. Its established functionality allowed users to quickly start tweeting without requiring technical skills. Twitter's list function allowed us to easily gather teams into one conversation, while its 140-character limit on tweets ensured that that conversation never became bogged down with lengthy posts. To top it all of, several teams were already on Twitter, giving Twitter some institutional momentum.

①Weekly Newsletter
In order to know more about iGEM teams all  around the world and enhance the cooperation among us, we have joined the  Weekly Newsletter launched by Xiamen   University and become one  of the first teams to collaborate with them on this activity.
The  newsletter usually has two major parts: project update and team stories. We should  be writing about one of the parts every two weeks. What’s more, we share funny  stories about our experiments and members. Through this activity, all the teams  will be able to keep better record of their own projects, gain feedback from  their peers and get to know other young synthetic biologists.
②A Nationwide Questionnaire
In  order to investigate the spread and uptake of synthetic biology and IGEM  competition in universities, we made a survey on the internet, through a  wide-spread and professional platform for online questionnaire survey,  Questionnaire star. We promote our questionnaire within the scope of all  colleges in China  as far as possible. According to the investigation, students coming from  hundreds of schools have participated in the survey, including not only high  school and undergraduate students, but also graduate students. So we can  roughly believe that the results are authentic.
According  to our results, we can see that the great majority of the respondents are  undergraduate students, 1.24% of them are high school students and 0.62% are  graduate students. There are also 1.86% staffs and 3.73% other people. On the  other hand, 52.8% of them are men while 47.2% of them are women.
How  many people know about the concept of synthetic biology? We are very pleased to  find 40.37% respondents answered “yes”. As for the question, “Do you know some  applications of synthetic biology in our contemporary life?” 44.1% people  illustrate that synthetic biology has not yet entered their lives. 52.17% said  they have their"

Terry: How do you see costs? Will it be more expensive or cheaper?
Raneem: We did research on that and we had a survey and asked people whether they would be willing to pay more or less. A lot of people said they would be willing to pay more if it was renewable energy. At the moment it might be more, cost wise.
Terry: As you progress I suppose you could reduce costs.
Raneem: Possibly yes.
Terry: The cost is always up when something new comes out, and then gradually as you develop it, it becomes cheaper and more people use it. It’s a case of making the public aware with good campaigning, advertising, consultations and public meetings.
Raneem: Another question about your opinion on our project, what do you think is appealing about it and what is unappealing?
Terry: Will it be less waste? I think there was an issue with a lot of these circuit boards disposing of them. If it were less waste it would be a very good thing. I don’t know what is exactly involved so it’s difficult to give an opinion sometimes. But when I look around the lab, I can get some ideas
Raneem: You will get to meet some of our biologists. They will be able to explain it better than me – I’m just the engineer. We were thinking if we were to build a bioreactor in Kent to meet the green house gas emission target would you personally approve of such an idea?
Terry: Is waste included? You know when you read about using waste vegetation?
Lee: Basically it’s a bioreactor where we grow these bacteria. We have to stress this bacteria is genetically modified, we have to insert this DNA for them to produce this nanowire. Would you have a concern? These bacteria can feed of waste product such as molasses waste product. If we were to build one in Kent what is your main concern?
Terry: Position and impact on the environment. I think there has been a lot of object to these ones, which use food waste. I don’t sit on planning committees. If there is another way of renewable energy that is worth exploring and doesn’t have too great an impact on the environment I think we may support it. If there is a great impact then it may not be worth the problems.

Vitamin A (retinol)
Background
It has been shown that S. cerevisiae can be engineered to produce vitamin A with the addition of 3 genes.
Aims
Evaluate the yeast growth and its vitamin production in idli.       Improve the yield of vitamin A in S. cerevisiae.
Results
Showed that the vitamin A producing strain grows as fast as the WT in idli.
Proved that the yeast produces significant amounts of vitamin A in idli.
Designed a plan to increase the vitamin A synthesis.
Motivation
Current situation
Vitamin A deficiency is a crucial issue in India, affecting millions of people.
The government has developed different programs to provide people with vitamin A supplements, but they are not very convenient (people need to go to a center everyday to receive it), only help a small portion of the population, and the retinol present in the supplements is not as healthy as the ß-carotene found in food. Another potential solution is Golden Rice, a rice that have been genetically engineered to synthesize vitamin A. However, the use of Golden Rice is rather controversial and has not been implemented in India.
Our idea
Our idea is to have vitamin A produced by the microbes involved in food fermentation and not by the cereal itself. It is much easier, cheaper and faster to genetically engineer micro-organisms than plants. And for the consumer it is much less intrusive and constraining to have a starter of yeast and bacteria which they can chose to add or not to their food at anytime, rather than to have to change their entire crops as proposed by the Golden Rice project.
Design
To produce vitamin A in idli, a popular Indian fermented rice cake, we chose to use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae since it is commonly found in idli batter (Soni and Sandhu, 1989 and Nout, 2009), which reduces the likelihood of affecting the idli's taste. Though S. cerevis"

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#projectAlgorithm_-_-_TEXT.html," will try to increase the efficiency of the codes of this part.
Generation of products based on reaction templates
Within MoDeL definitions, product templates are composed of both ST parts and NST parts. The ST parts are all transfered from reactants or modifiers. A transfer table is defined in each reaction template to label where does each ST part comes from and goes to. It seems to be very easy to generate Chain-Node structure of products from reactants and mod modifiers based on the transfer table. However, it doesn't.
Consider first a template reaction with one reactant, X-A-B-Y, where A and B are both NST parts and X and Y are both ST parts with type ANY. If it could be digested by a certain enzyme, the products should be X-A and B-Y. In the real biological system, if there is a species with structure C-A-B-C, where the first part C and the last C binds to form a tree node. If we try to digest the A-B bond, the species would not be split into two pieces as expected because the two products are connected by the tree node. To generate the structure of products correctly, we design a three-step mix-trim-split algorithm to solve this problem.
Mixing, trimming and splitting: three-step algorithm to generate products.
The first step is to mix reactants and products. The mixture includes all chains of reactants except for those which are matched to the templates as well as all trees. It also includes all chains and trees of products. And now we have a mixed species with chains and trees from different sources. It is worth noting that chains and trees of modifiers will not be added into the mixture. The next step is to trim the trees. Trees with leaf nodes that are not defined in chains will be removed from the forest. The last step is to split the products out from the mixture. This is because the mixture may not be one standalone complex. For example, it may have two unbound and uncorrelated chains. In other words, some chains that are not connected with others via tree nodes should not be incorporated into other species. The final standalone split species are real products in the system.
We provide an example to illustrate the product-generating procedure. The reactant has two chains, A-B-C and D-E-F. A, B, C bind with D, E, F, respectively. The products are A and C. First we mix chains and trees. Chain A-B-C will not appear in the mixture. Since node B does not appear in mixed chains, tree with nodes B and E will be removed in"

The Community
Biohub 2.0 is a synthetic biology community, focusing on more efficient Biobricks information retrieval                 and more convenient biological ideas sharing. Apart from these functions, an online editor is added to                 BioHub 3.0. Users not only can finish their reports in a more convenient way, but also can release their                 reports and read or comment on other scholar's reports on this platform. Praise and collection are also                 supported. As an extensible community, more fantastic features would be integrated in the future.
Intelligent Search Engine
The Intelligent Search Engine is based on 2017's project. The following features are added.
It has a better command of language recognition. It supports semantic recognition, like ""reports                     today"", ""reports by ana"", ""reports this year"" and etc..
Filtering rules and Collation can be customized.
Advanced search is supported.
We have added many useful databases and academic websites to our search engine, so biologists could                     search information more quickly.
User Interface
We introduced a new user interface. In order to match our frontend framework perfectly, we choose                     Ng-zorro, which is written in TypeScript with complete defined types as our UI framework. The                     high-quality components and style of Ng-zorro help us complete our design quickly and provides a better                     experience."

Wash_U,2009,Team:Wash U#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," a uniform level under low oxygen conditions.  As a result, the first two layers of Wild Type bioreactors absorb nearly all the available light and starve the bioreactors behind them for photons.
Conversely, our mutant was modeled to have a dynamic expression of pucB/A based on the incident light intensity. This light response curve was modeled as an inverse exponential for the Cph8/OmpR ompC Promoter system and the saturation curve changes for each tissue flask in accordance with the incident light intensity- as light intensity decreases, the expression pucB/A increases.  This results in more light passing through the first 2 flasks and facilitating greater growth in flasks 3, 4 and 5 as they express large antenna complexes.  Nonetheless, we believe that growth across the bioreactors could be further maximized by increasing antenna size in the first 2 bioreactors and sacrificing growth in the 4th and 5th.  This could be achieved with a feedback mechanism that sets a minimum level for LH2 expression.
Conclusion
Though we were not able to conduct the tissue flask growth experiment on our mutant, the results of this experiment on our controls (WT and DBComega) match the assumptions that we had laid out at the beginning of the project, allowed us to draw further conclusions about the efficiency of light-based growth for a series of bioreactors, and to create a model for our mutant based on empirical data.
Based on this model, we have concluded that it would be favorable to have a feedback regulation mechanism that sets a minimum expression level for pucB/A to further improve photosynthetic productivity.
We intend to conduct the tissue flask w DBComega+prkcbc3 before jamboree and compare/interpret these results using our characterization data for the pucB/A and the puc promoter.
We will conduct the tissue flask experiment with our functioning mutant in future and compare the results to our model
Finally, we would like to characterize the puc promoter under various light conditions and additional oxygen tensions.
Overall- our project has demonstrated the potential for a synthetically regulated light harvesting antenna to improve photosynthetic productivity for a series of photobioreactors vs. the wild type.

Saving the bananas
Every time you go to the supermarket or to the local market to buy bananas you take for granted that there will be bananas readily available for you to enjoy and savour. However, banana plants are under threat and a world without bananas is more plausible than we all might imagine. Banana plants are threatened by Fusarium oxysporum. This pathogenic soil fungus enters plants through their root systems and lives off of them until they die. This fungus currently threatens all banana plants worldwide. Bananas, apart from being a delicious fruit, have economic importance in many tropical regions and are an important part of the diet. These are the reasons why the iGEM team Wageningen 2014 has designed and created BananaGuard, a genetic system in Pseudomonas putida that detects the presence of F. oxysporum in the soil and produces a combination of antifungals to remove the fungal threat.

Chassis Engineering: Background
<article> Chassis or strain engineering focuses on the modification of chromosomes instead of plasmids and encompasses both <a href="" https://2012.igem.org/Team:UC_Davis/Project/Directed_Evolution "">directed evolution</a> and <a href="" https://2012.igem.org/Team:UC_Davis/Project/Our_Strain "">rational engineering</a>. This part of the project focuses on the elimination of ethylene glycol, a degradation product of PET that is metabolized to oxalic acid further downstream the metabolic pathway. Oxalic acid is toxic to the kidney and fatal to the organism (2). (For a look at how we handled these compounds safely, look at our <a href="" https://2012.igem.org/Team:UC_Davis/Safety "">Safety Page</a>!)
<img src=""
"">
Once we discovered the potential toxicity of our project, we searched high and low to find ways to eliminate ethylene glycol (EG) as much as possible. In the scientific literature, we found that no wild-type E. coli can utilize EG (1). However, we did find an E. coli mutant, called Strain E-15 EG3, from the University of Barcelona, that is able to grow on ethylene glycol alone (1). While the University of Barcelona's paper on Strain E-15 EG3 was published nearly 30 years ago, we contacted the authors and asked for the strain to perform our own testing. The researchers were able to find the strain in one of their freezers and ship it to our lab. We have dubbed the rediscovery of the strain ""Freezer Archaeology"".

Plates were dried at 42°C for 15 minutes, just prior to plating. Upon plating we discovered a problem with many of the ampicilin plates we made a couple of days ago. The agar breaks on the slightest contact, and are therfore impossible to use.
As a result of the defective agar plates, most of our cells carrying E0040 were ruined. We managed to save and plate out two batches, one from each tube, so we are hoping for the best tomorrow.
Results: Only cells with E0040 grew colonies by overnight incubation.

We also discussed the issue of modification and misuse of the trap for possible malicious purposes. One potential misuse addressed was the decantation of toxins that diffuse through the hydrogel. However, considering the small amount of toxin produced and the specificity of the toxin, this is not a concern. There are other possibilities to collect the toxin; one could try to cultivate the bacteria to produce bigger amounts of it, but the growth inhibition module and the co-culture with the cyanobacteria make it hard to culture them to larger populations if isolated. Moreover, there is the risk of misuse of the device as a bioweapon or to kill animals besides mosquitos, for example bees, by replacing the toxin. For this to work, though, an individual would need great expertise as the multiple aspects of the trap would have to be changed. Not only would the hardware design needed to be altered, but one would have to exchange the toxin and eliminate the growth inhibition.
To further increase the effort needed to misuse the trap we decided to post sensible information about the method of toxin production only on the iGEM website, rather than spread it on social media.
We discussed testing our odour baits and toxin on Anopheles gambiae, the main vector of plasmodium falciparum. We worked with mosquitoes that were not infected and thus harmless to humans. All the experiments involving mosquitoes took place in the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine. Dr. Thomas Jacobs, who supervised our work, was also able to answer questions that remained unanswered during our discussion with Dr. Himmel. Namely, whether or not one could expect the occurrence of a resistance to our toxin and the possibility of pathogens growing on the hydrogel.
 
As we would not want the S.H.I.E.L.D. to depend on antibiotics, we discussed the necessity to introduce the DNA stably into the bacterial genome rather than working with plasmids as we currently do.
At a later point in our project we visited Dr. Himmel again, updating him on our progress and improvements we made after our group talk.

It would be a good idea to use the DNA they submitted to the registry and make it functional (e.g. removing the forbidden restriction sites...), because this is a great way to improve an already existing BioBrick, which is one of the things iGEM judges really like to see. Volker has already contacted them and got a friendly response.
Xanthohumol
Xanthohumol has never been produced in yeast. However, attempts have been made to alter the hops plant to increase its production of xanthohumol, which shows that beer with increased concentration of xanthohumol is a great idea. Two of the required genes have been well characterized, the other two haven't. The biosynthesis of xanthohumol also includes the intermediate Coumaryl-CoA.
Raspberry Ketone
The synthesis of Raspberry Ketone also includes Coumaryl-CoA.
Caffeine
Caffeine has never been produced in yeast. The required substrate for the synthesis occurs naturally in yeast, because it is a part of the nucleic acid metabolism. Two genes are required for synthesis of caffeine. Caffeine has been shown to inhibit growth of bacteria and yeasts at concentrations similar to that in coffee.
Aspirin
No enzymes are known which produce aspirin.
Nicotine
We decided against the production of nicotine for moral reasons. Our beer should be a healthy one.
Strawberry flavor
Strawberry flavor is not one single substance but a mixture of several hundreds. However, peach-flavor has been produced in yeast already. For interview teams: Ask Prof. Schwab about Furaneol (Dimethylfuraneol)!
Colors and pigments
In addition to the information given in our wiki, please look at [ iGem 2011 Uppsala ].
Beneficial Peptides and Proteins
The general question concerning Peptides and Proteins is how to ensure their secretion in yeast.
Knottins
Knottins do not fit our requirements well.
Thaumatin
The protein thaumatin is a natural sweetener. Its production should be easy, because only one gene is required.
Lactoglobulin
the digestion of ß-Lactoglobulin exhibits a broad variety of physiological active peptides. How many genes are required?

Reagents for Darwin Toolbox
We will offer smartly sized reagent kits around the needs of individual citizen scientists and classrooms. Examples include a collection of primers to identify common foods, or kits that follow lesson plans. Our kits are built around quantities that matter to individuals and the convenience of having all reagents in one place.
Furthermore, we are exploring a cradle-to-cradle approach by incentivising our customers to safely store their waste material such as old gels and recycle them by trading them with us for fresh supplies.
Background
The manipulation of DNA to create new genes or genetic elements relies on two key processes. Firstly, the amplification of DNA by a process known as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and secondly by the removal and reorganisation of DNA segments, digestion and ligation. These two processes make up the process known as DNA cloning.
An explanation of the principles behind PCR can be found here or, alternatively, here . The key enzyme in PCR is polymerase, an enzyme which joins individual nucleotides together into long strands of DNA. There are a wide variety of polymerases that exist, all with slightly different attributes, but Taq polymerase has been a reliable workhorse for research labs for many years, and the Quickload® Taq 2X MasterMix solution provides the a simple and cost-effective tool to begin your PCR reactions.
To cut out segments of DNA, a restriction endonuclease is needed. A restriction endonuclease reads a DNA strand and cuts at specific points, allowing you to reliably excise the region that you need. A detailed description of this process can be found here . The enzymes EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI,,and PstI are a set of restriction enzymes used for BioBrick cloning. BioBrick cloning is a standard of DNA cloning used within the synthetic biology community as it can be used to reliably build novel genetic circuits with relative ease. Further information on BioBricks can be found here . Once DNA fragments have been cut, they can be joined to one another using a DNA ligase enzyme. A ligase enzyme joins two fragments of DNA together by forming a phosphodiester bond between them, fusing them together so that they cannot break away. The"

Therefore, a primer (TALseqF) was designed  to take out TALE A and TALE B without the Kozak sequence. The PCR performed with forward primer TALseqF and reverse primer BBK R on TALEs was successful.
BsaI enzyme finally arrived. So the constructions of BBa_J04500 +His+ TALE A +linker+Kcoil and BBa_J04500 +His+ TALE B +linker+Kcoil in Golden Gate reaction were performed. The ligation reactions were run on the gel and expected bands were observed. However, the transformation was unsuccessful because of the new competent cells.
The PCR products of TALE A and TALE B without the Kozak sequence were run on a 1% gel and contained a lot of non specific amplification.
Week 13: July 22 - July 26
The 5 TALE B target sequences were sequence verified and are good.
We repeated PCR of TALE A and TALE B without the Kozak sequence and it worked (figure 18), so the PCR products were ligated with BBa_J04500 and successfully transformed. Subsequent colony PCR showed some positive results (figures 19 and 20).

For the TALE constructs, we did a colony PCR, plasmid prep, verification digest and sequencing preparation of the BBa_J04500 + TALE A and BBa_J04500 + TALE B , both without the Kozak sequence (figure 21). Glycerol stocks and streak plates of sequence verified BBa_J04500 + TALE A colony 12 and BBa_J04500 + TALE B colony 7 were made.

RIOT Model Collaboration
Given that diffusion and advection are the primary modes of spatial transport in fluids, our RIOT Model tool is very versatile and can be applied to any system that considers bacteria interacting with the environment. Two collaborations have resulted from this RIOT Model tool: one with the Melbourne iGEM team, and another with the HKUST iGEM team.
Collaboration with Melbourne iGEM team
As part of our collaboration with the Melbourne iGEM team, we implemented an earlier version of the outer model 5 on MATLAB, with the architecture to include their own interaction processes. The Melbourne iGEM team aims to increase the reaction kinetics of the mevalonate pathway using their star peptide. The implementation of the outer model gave the Melbourne iGEM team insights into the spatial dynamics of the star peptide augmented mevalonate pathway reaction kinetics. More information of the mevanlonate pathway can be found on the Melbourne iGEM Modelling page. The mevalonate pathway and the star peptide enzymes and processes are as illustrated in Figure 3.
Figure 3: Mevalonate pathway (left) adapted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mevalonate_pathway Enzymes attached to and processes involving the star peptide (right).
Figure 4: Sample of the simulation obtained from the collaboration. These concentration fields demonstrate the production and consumption of Acetoacetyl-CoA and HMG-CoA at the relevant nodes.
After the completion of our combined model, the Melbourne team realized that the contour lines of Figure 4 seems to indicate that the products from one enzyme reaction do not show a clear flow towards the node of the other enzyme reaction, where they will be consumed. Otherwise, the contour lines would trace a pattern that contains both nodes (the contour lines surrounding each node will be joined). This flow was an assumption that the Melbourne team made in the formulation of their project. More simulations are needed to verify the accuracy of that assumption.

Attendance to Meet Ups
The meets ups bring several advantages to the teams. It is one of the simplest ways to reach a greater number of people to whom you can explain your project. And therefore they allow you to know first-hand the projects of the rest of the teams so that you can consult and clarify doubts. These meetings also allow for more related and powerful collaborations thanks to knowing the rest of the teams in person. And last but not least, they allow you to practice exposing your project with a view to improving in the Giant Jamboree.
Our team attended two meet ups that took place in the month of August.
Marseille
Mediterranean Meet Up (Marseille)
This meet up took place between Thursday 9 and Friday 10 August in the city of Marseille and was organized by the team of this city, the Aix-Marseille. In it, all the teams from the Mediterranean area were summoned, so they ended up attending both France and Spain. Francisco, Gonzalo and Ivan attended this meet up on behalf of the team.
The event began with a reception in which all teams had their first informal contact. Subsequently, a 5 minutes presentation of each of the projects was organized, summarizing the concept on which the proyect was based, the work carried out and the plans to complete it. After the exhibition, each team answered the questions that could have the jury and the rest of the teams.
Later they invited us to a joint meal. In the afternoon it was organized a sightseeing tour of the city, but due to inclement weather it had to be suspended, although we could enjoy a pleasant evening of board games and conversations with the rest of the teams. At night"
Tec-Chihuahua,2017,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," Latin American region is experiencing the fastest growth in the biological control market, in spite of this, nowadays the strongest region in the biocontrol market in North America, having in 2016, 38% of the global share(Dunhamm M., 2017). Finally, the crop application in our product will be in the section of vegetable and fruits, and our target is a micro-organism. The growth of this market is attributed to high cost of agrochemicals and their negative impact on food quality and environment compared with biological control products that are considered as ecologically sustainable and safe crop protection solutions.
Microbials growing faster as both small and large companies invest in microbial discovery and development. Investors see a great opportunity to invest in biocontrol companies because of the rapid growth of this market. Investing in this market could be a great opportunity to increase the industrial production as it is one of the most reliable markets nowadays.
Digital Market Analysis
The digital market needs a thorough and deep analysis to understand their behavior, the needs of users and the type of solutions they seek, so it is necessary for companies to have knowledge of these factors in order to prepare an effective digital marketing strategy(Octopus.mx, 2017).
Google Trends is a free access tool provided by Google, which will allow us to compare the search popularity of several words or phrases; in this way we will know the level of search for a certain term, during a determined period of time, allowing us  to identify the variations in the searches in relative values based on a scale of 0 to 100, where 100 represents the highest point in search levels with respect to a term or keyword(Negocios and Lopez, 2017).
If an entrepreneur wants to found a new business into a sector, this tool can help to know the products within that category most wanted, what are the new trends, which are the  more  demanding users.
Our Digital Market Analysis focused on the search for different words related to the field of apple, fire blight, apple orchards, biofertilizers, biocontrol and among other words that describe to each other.
Market competitors
Although no significant events are projected to impact market growth, development of new technologies, especially in the area of microbial products could stimulate market growth. These new technologies are being implemented to get better and more efficient biocontrol products. This means that the market is going to evolve quickly. Our product not only aims to fulfill all the gaps that those products from our competitors can't achieve but also to improve those results from the ones that are commonly used nowadays. Since our product is a"

Transcriptions factors, chromosome insertion, the 5- UTR, and the reporter gene itself all can play a role in the protein expression.  Although, the promoter region might be the most common and simplest way to modify protein expression in eukaryotes.
Although simple to use, Eukaryotic promoters are fairly complicated.  Their function is to call on a RNA polymerase to initiate transcription.  The ability of a promoter region to call in an RNA polymerase will determine its strength and the relative protein expression.  The are a number of factors involved in this process ,but it varies from promoter to promoter.

Method
As both viral and cytoskeletal promoters are used for prolific expression of genes we selected the following mix of viral and protein promoters: MMV, FiMV, CLCuV, actin, myosin and proflin. In order to characterize the viral and cytoskeletal variable promoters, a standardization of the CaMV 35s promoter was required.  This was accomplished by expressing both GFP and mCherry sequentially under the promotion of CaMV 35s. A testing ratio was then established by assessment of the relative fluorescence of the expressed GFP and mCherry genes. Once this ratio was established, the first 35s promoter was exchanged for one of the various variable promoters. This allowed for the same characterization of promoter strength via relative fluorescence expression.  To prevent downstream expression as a result of carrying over from upstream promoters, two Nos terminators were placed between the GFP gene and the control 35s promoter.
Further Study
Due to limitations resulting from the lack of previous synthetic biology application within plants, we were unable to obtain any results. We have successfully isolated the desired parts needed for assembly of the plasmid and have the backbone with the 35s promoter left border and Nos terminator right border.  Successful construct assembly of these parts is still needed for bacterial and plant transformation. Following promising transformation, fluorescence testing and characterization must be done.

Testing PC reporter system
We invented a new protocol for testing our PC reporter system (Figure 17).
Figure 17. Flow chart for testing PC reporter system. Since one dCas9 fusion protein would form a complex with a pair of sgRNAs simultaneously, which will decrease the complementation of Nluc and Cluc, we incubated two split luciferase-dCas9:sgRNA complexes separately at 25°C for 10 min. After adding target DNA into the mixture of two complexes and incubated at 37°C for 30 min, they simultaneously bind to two adjacent half-sites on target DNA, bringing Nluc and Cluc into close proximity, thus leading to recovery of its enzymatic activity. Then transfer the mixture to 96-well plates before adding Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega) and promoptly measure the luminescence in Microplate Reader (Thermo Scientific).
High-throughput array detection assay
Based on the results we acquired, single-site target detection presents relatively high specificity and sensitivity. However, taking strain mutations, sample differences and other environmental factors in clinical practices into consideration, we set an array (Figure 18) to detect multiple target sites (markers) of MTB to make our PC reporter quantitatively reliable.
Figure 18. The 96-well plate layout in array detection assay. 9 fragments (F1-F9) screened out by SSPD from MTB genome were set in each line, and 8 MTB markers (M1-M8) in each fragment were respectively set in each sample pool. In total 8*9=72 markers were detected in one single assay. For each fragment, P9 meant a negative control with a mismatch sgRNA pair added. Two separated assays were carried out using MTB and a control strain (E. coli) as experimental subjects respectively

Overview
Problem Identification
Idea Generation
Designing the System
Prototype Building
The building of CAT-Seq characterization system was a highly dynamic process in which our team and selected stakeholders engaged in a year long dialog, which has allowed us to precisely identify the most vital obstacles holding back the field of synthetic biology, helped us to ask the right questions which led to the idea of CAT-Seq and enabled the constant iteration and improvement of the system design throughout the year.
That is why we see the Human Practices as the most important part of our engineering process and overall project. Therefore, as You travel along the Human Practices timeline you will find different sections that correspond to the different engineering stages our project was at that time.
We strongly suggest to read the design section first, as it will help to fully appreciate the story of how the final design came to be.

Purdue,2014,Team:Purdue#The Solution#Experimental Design_-_-_TEXT.html," about managing the complexity? Could we benefit plants with just one microbe or a cocktail?
We dived into the literature on the rhizosphere and the use of nitrogen fixing bacteria as a safe and well known practice. We asked ourselves are there microbes that could aid the uptake or bioavailability of nutrients in the soil. We realized that modern Ag practices focus heavily on the supplementation of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. But what about other nutrients like iron, calcium, sulfur and manganese?
We then came across an article by Scientific American titled, “Dirt Poor: Have Fruits and Vegetables Become Less Nutritious?” We found the article startling and looked into what deficiencies were most prominent in people and plants. We found that iron deficiency manifested in iron deficiency anemia was a huge problem. Now that we found our nutrient, how could we go about helping plants absorb more iron?
Plants uptake iron by 2 main mechanisms: non-grass plants reduction strategy; lowering the pH  of the soil around them making Fe3+ to Fe2+, and the grass plant chelating strategy utilizing  phytosiderophores or scavengers of Fe3+. We decided to exploit the biochemical pathway responsible for phytosiderophore production because bacteria naturally produce their own siderophores and plants can utilize them in iron- starved conditions. However another strategy we considered is using bacterial localization to roots circuits (used by imperial college auxin project 2011) and overexpression of membrane proton pumps on bacteria to decrease the pH of the soil and  increase the bioavailability of Iron.
The question then became what microorganism would host our phytosiderophore producing circuit? We ultimately decided on Bacillus subtilis because it is a common soil microbe around the world and its sporulation stage allows for effective transport.

After a gel confirmed the presence of expected band lengths, the team was prepared to tackle the next task of purifying the gel and utilize the PCR product for preliminary construction of the final plasmid. They also hoped to utilize the CheZ gene in many ways by attaching different ribosomal binding sites and testing them all within the iGEM-RhlR plasmid.
Lab 2
On Monday morning, the RX students entered lab and created 1 Liter of LB Agar in order to pour plates for the start of iGEM Interlab protocol.  They added a chloramphenicol resistance to the LB Agar.  After this was made, the team then poured plates so that the Interlab Top 10 E. coli will grow.
Tuesday (06/26/18)
Lab 1
After a very successful PCR yesterday and picture perfect yesterday gel, the LabPats were ready to begin the gel purification step. After the protocol was completed, the team was devastated to discover that the nano drop machine was out of commission and that it would be difficult to measure the concentration of the purified “RhlR”and “CheZ” bands. After jumping through some hoops, the labpats were able to utilize a neighboring lab’s machine and measure the concentration of both accurately. The measured results were a lot less than expected, and Dr. Breedon expressed her worries about a Gibson assembly protocol being successful. They decided to proceed anyways. In addition, the Dr. Breedon also talked to the students about attaching overlaps on the CheZ gene, and performing a PCR on the three ribosomal binding sites.
Lab 2
The RX Lab students began their day by attending a branch meeting.  After the meeting, the students went to their lab to continue work on the iGEM interlab.  For this portion of the mini-prep, the students performed a transformation on the DNA samples that iGEM sent them in the kit.  After the transformation was complete, the students headed to UES.  At UES, the students began work on the presentation for the Michigan State meetup which will occur on the following Saturday, June 30th.
Wednesday (06/27/18)

The students began the morning by redoing a PCR on the “RhlR” plasmid and “CheZ” gene to gather more concentration the second round. They also began their first Gibson Assembly, hoping to ligate the “RhlR” plasmid to the iGEM backbone. Afterwards, the LabPats ran the “Rhl"

Program
git, svn, and other version control systems focus on differences between lines. Since most DNA file formats split DNA to fixed-length lines, many lines are changed at once, for example, when inserting a single new line. darwin does away with that by producing a formatted file representing each ORF on its own line of text, making each edit only modify a single line of the output text.
Fig1. - darwin eliminates extra lines in the output file
Genes can be very long. To combat this, darwin will sample a section of every newly inserted ORF and compare it to nearby ORFs; if the new ORF is similar to another ORF, it is counted as “edited,” and darwin only records the character-by-character changes required to transform the old ORF into the new ORF.
Fig2. - darwin's unique method of parsing ORF
Finally, darwin uses concurrency to help speed up the process. File I/O is typically extremely slow, much slower than processing a file data already in memory. Splitting the processing concurrently helps to open up that speed bottleneck.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," ensure its continuity, new members need to be attracted. Here our main focus was on attracting new iGEM participants and keep them connected in the iGEM community after competing. Interactions between old and new participants and the mutual positive feeling established by these interactions ties them proverbally to the community.
Creating a coherent community “family” feeling is of great importance of the community’s success. To develop this, as well as enlarging trust in external parties, we focused on knowledge sharing as the main value for this community. Even though some of the necessary motivation will be internal, iGEM headquarters could establish some effective motivation by enabling and encouraging some activities. For example, the iGEM headquarters can start making a difference in the perception of external parties by recommending participating teams to write their experience in a certain format. We think the proposed format will make science communication – and here in specific science performed by the iGEM community – more open.  Thereby potentially also enlarging its trustworthiness in the scientific world.
Besides that, we have proposed different strategies to enlarge and improve both internal and external communications, to increase the community family feeling and the familiarity of iGEM in external parties simultaneously.

Education & Teamwork
In this chapter, we have focused on education. We have analysed what teams did to educate the public, but also what the influence was of external parties on iGEM projects.
Firstly we have asked teams whether they have developed an education tool and if so, whether the teams did evaluate their tool. It appeared that about half of the teams developed a tool and 60% of those teams did evaluate it afterwards. The teams that were able to test their tool, mostly used their tool in a real live setting. For example, they used the tool to educate school children, in outreach events or the tool is reviewed by experts.
Most of the educational activities were targeting high school students, almost 56% of the responders were engaged in educational activities for high school students. With respectively 48% and 40%, the university students and adults were also popular target groups. Only 23% of the responders educated  elementary school children and 10% of the responders reached a target audience outside one of these groups.
Based on the survey we can conclude that there are many teams that are engaged in educational activities. Some of those team have developed very interesting tools, that could also be very useful for other iGEM teams. We advise iGEM headquarters to make a page with interesting tools in order to make those tools more accessible.

The Second Generation Fuel Cell
This cell was designed with anaerobic operation in mind. The plastic parts needed were ordered from the workshop of the Faculty of Biology at Bielefeld University. The overall design is inspired by the fuel cell proposed by Benetto (Bennetto, 1990). Two frames make up the anode and cathode chamber. They are enclosed by two flat plates, which each have four bores. Threaded rods are put through the bores. The construction is held together by these rods, which have tightly fastened nuts on their ends.
All plastic parts are separated by thin rubber gaskets. A Nafion N117 membrane is placed between the two frames to allow cations to travel between the chambers. The two electrodes were initially cut out of the same carbon tissue as the ones used in the film canister cells. The rims were sown together with extra durable yarn to prevent the material from frazzling. These electrodes were held in place by two plastic parts plugged in each chamber. The copper wire connecting the electrode runs through two holes on the top of each plastic frame.
Initial testing revealed that the carbon cloth electrodes did not seem to be as conductive as expected. For this reason, they were replaced with electrodes made from another kind of carbon material, which were obtained from University of Readings National Centre for Biotechnology Education . However, the material is not very strong and easily ruptures, especially when wet. This made it difficult to connect the copper wires and to hold the electrodes in place within the chambers. The design also lacked means to drive out the oxygen from medium with nitrogen, an important prerequisite to establish anaerobic conditions within the fuel cell.
Dimensions per chamber:
height: 40 mm
width: 40 mm
depth: 14 mm
volume 22.4 mL

For most optical purposes it is very important that the produced lenses do not have a lot of variation. This underlines the importance of studying cell shape control to control the shape and size of our microlenses. Mrs. Verver and Mr. Monet also suggested looking for a system for sorting the cells on size. We could probably do this with a system like FACS, which is definitely worth researching a little more.
During the talk, a lot of new interesting applications for our cells were discussed. The lenses could certainly have applications in microscopy, by applying them either on a detector or on the surface of a lens to harvest more light. Using multiple tiny lenses could also lead to a new technique where multiple images of different focal planes could be made. Also, when our microlenses would be well-developed, they could be of use in consumer electronics, such as DSLR cameras, also for the purpose of harvesting more light. This would result in smaller, lightweight cameras. Especially for high-speed imaging and low-light imaging, both in microscopy and photography, the amount of light on the detector light is limiting. This might be improved by adding a layer of microlenses. One of the obstacles that Mr. Monet identified was the possible contamination our microlenses could cause. If one of the lenses breaks, the E. coli could get out. Therefore, we have to invest more research into the possibility to kill the cells within the microlens without disturbing the lens.
We have learned a lot on the possible applications of our microlenses and also identified some new obstacles to research a little further!
“Microlenses have very interesting possible applications in improving microscopy and photography. Capturing more light will improve high-speed imaging and low-light imaging.”
Ronald van Dijk - Olympus
Date: 07-09-2016
When writing a business plan and investigating the potential use and commercial viability of a product, it is very important to talk to potential customers and collaborators. Therefore, we went to Zoeterwoude to have a talk with Ronald van Dijk, Application Specialist Microscopy at Olympus, a worldwide leading manufacturer of optical and digital precision technology. We discussed both possible applications of our biologically produced microlenses as well as the potential to actually sell our product to companies as Olympus. Initially we wanted to apply our cells in confocal microscopes, but Mr. van Dijk recommended us not to do this, because the confocal pinhole is specifically"

UFAM-UEA Brazil team Collaboration
One of the UFAM-UEA 2016 iGEM team aims is to build a prototype bioreactor in which their engineered strains will be used in mercury contaminated water bioremediation process. To establish this partnership, we had some meetings with Manaus iGEMers in São Paulo and via Skype afterwards.
We also hosted them in São Paulo and showed a little of our campus and our city :)

Manaus team members visiting Bioproducts Laboratory (ICB-USP), where some experiments were carried out
Bioreactor model printing
UFAM-UEA team prepared a bioreactor model design/project to be 3D printed. Our team used a 3D printer available in our lab to print a reactor model and send it to the Manaus team at the Giant Jamboree. This 3D model will be used by the team in the 2016 Giant Jamboree and other project dissemination talks.
Bioreactor 3D model prepared and printed for team collaboration
Bioprocess mentoring
Another collaboration with the Manaus team was mentoring in bioprocesses, since one of the research groups involved in our work has great experience in this area. We had Skype meetings to discuss the use of models to implement the first tests of the bioreactor for mercury contaminated waters streams treatment.
Molecular Biology mentoring
UFAM-UEA team offered us molecular biology mentoring via Skype. Their tips helped us in our difficult task to polymerize MaSp DNA sequences, in order to obtain a greater number of ‘mer’ units for expression of this silk protein in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. They also contributed by telling their previous iGEM experience, better explaining the criteria to be evaluated and giving tips on how to build our wiki page.
USP-EEL Brazil team Collaboration
We exchanged a lot of ideas and support and even considered “assembling” both teams together at the beginning! This interaction which grew strong during iGEM will surely yield further collaborations, both for future iGEMs and independent projects involving science awareness and DIY Bio.

Poster ready to go!     Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.     We have collaborated with several iGEM teams, most notably Melbourne iGEM team. We worked with them extensively to consider an alternative approach to our bioremediation system using their star peptide instead of the micro-compartments that we'd previously considered.      Our engineers extensively modelled their system using stochastic simlation with the intention of investigating how reaction rates are improved using the star peptide. More information is available here:      Collaboration with the Melbourne iGEM team.     iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team’s scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM).

METU_Turkey_Software,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software#test_-_-_TEXT.html,"     But after performing all combinations for the first few hundred biobricks     application’s rate slowed downed tremendously, which also become very     time consuming for displaying biobricks graphs. To overcome this bottleneck     we have developed a new strategy, where we have only used the construct     combinations of the biobricks distributed within the plates. Moreover,     according to information gathered from the subparts of the constructs     distrubuted, we also collected the subpart assembly order, such as 1st:     promoter, 2nd:rbs, 3rd:coding seq, any internal parts and the Last:     terminator. Each specific Biobrick type has been assigned a number as     a unique image ID from 1 to 19. Gathering the information on subparts     was not a direct forward process. ImageID assembly orders for each construct     has been used to extract the type information for each subpart with     that construct. This innovative approach helped us to reveal 400 possible     brick combinations present within the 3x384 well plates distributed     by iGEM in Spring 2010.

Future Plan
The application we have developed can be used by all iGEM members.     As the iGEMs database expands and the recognition of the field of Synthetic     Biology increases, data resources from other biological databases such     as NCBI might be needed to be integrated to the application. In such     a situation, extendibility of the application is vital. New data resources     and new functions should be added easily.
Before planning ahead, feedback from other teams and iGEM headquarters     about the BioGuide 1.0 will be collected. That will help us to fill     in the missing features of the application and check the theories which     are basis of our algorithms.
As our application is not geared towards any commercial use and will     stay as an academic application, keeping track of the weekly developmental     process on the wiki notebook environment was satisfactory. If the need     for a commercial application emerges, we should be utilizing professional     software development approaches to determine the exact requirements     and to facilitate the use of a common language between interdici"

Furthermore, our wiki teams kept in contact and provided feedback for each other’s wikis. We also agreed to help each other during the Grand jamboree by listening to each other’s project presentations before the main Grand Jamboree talk.
Team Peshawar
In order to collaborate with other teams we scheduled some video conferences via Skype.
This gave us the chance to directly exchange information with e.g. the iGEM team Peshawar. The discussed topics were amongst others talking about the progress in the lab, comparing notes inside and outside the lab and looking for possible collaborations.
Skype made it possible to get in touch with people from other far away countries with other talents than us and help each other in solving problems that accrued during our working journey and motivating each other.
Talking with you was very informative and great fun. Hopefully we stay in contact after iGEM! See you at the Giant Jamboree in Boston!
Team Dresden
“The future will either be green or not at all.” - Bob Brown
This year's Team Dresden had the idea to make iGEM a greener competition. In the first place this means to make participating teams aware of  the environmental implications of their projects and how to work more environmentally friendly.
Therefor the Team Dresden created a GoGreenGuide , an emission calculator, lab poster and much more. Moreover, they hosted a workshop during the German Wide Meetup . During the German Wide Meetup we participated in this workshop, afterwards we decided to take part. So, we read the guide and took some advice for a greener lab - below you can see the points we fulfilled -  and we also used the calculator. In addition, the Team Dresden suggested to think about ideas to compensate greenhouse gas emissions. We had the idea to give away Bryophyllum.

Poisoning:
At least in India, rats are considered holy and there exist temples where rats are maintained and worshiped as incarnations of Goddess Karni Mata’s children. This leads to serious ethical issues with killing rats. It is also seen that rats can at times avoid the poison completely and if they do ingest it, it is followed by a long painful death. These rats move about and drop dead in the holes and crevices that they stumble upon.The dead body then decomposes and becomes a source of diseases that affect both animals and humans. When other animals eat the dead rat, the poison enters the food web leading to secondary poisoning and biomagnification of harmful chemicals which can easily crawl up trophic levels to reach human beings. Furthermore, the poison itself can be eaten by other harmless animals and even little unsuspecting children leading to poisoning and/or death.
High Pitch Noise Machines:
It is found that after a while rats get habituated to the noise rendering the above technique ineffective. This makes sense, given that noise acts as a repellent rather than a deterrent, so there is no survival value that murines gain by avoiding this noise.
Fumigation:
The chemical sprays are sprayed all over the Warehouse including on top of grain leading to the contamination of the grain. This causes the grains to be covered with the toxic chemical rodenticide, in turn making them poisonous. The situation is at such a stage that the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) mandates regular quality checks of the grains in these store houses.
Even though the best way to tackle the “RAT MENACE” is to install Airtight Aluminum Silos across the country, it is simply impossible to install silos across the country in the storehouses of individual farmers and it is equally impossible for government organizations to install large scale vertical silos to store the over 80 Million Metric ton of grains that they are in charge of overnight.
“The current capacity to store grains in silos is simply insufficient, so much so that at the time of BUMPER-HARVEST we have to store grains on the roads. ”
-Mr. J.P.S. Randhawa, General Manager, Punjab Mandi Board
To strive to solve the “RAT MENACE” whilst keeping in mind the limitations of present solutions we ventured into a project to genetically engineer yeast  (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to reproduce a pathway present in the cat's (Felis catus) kidney and synthetically produce a cat pheromone"

Other wise, several 3-rd party open source software or tools are used in our iGame source code. Libsbml is used to deal with sbml file operations. Qwt and Qwtplot3D are used for simulation data visual system.  At the early stage of our project SBML Ode Solver and Sundials were our main ode solver to produce the simulation data from our sbml model file, because the latest SBML Ode Solver is 1.6.0, developed in 2005, which is out of date and fail to support the newest sbml Level 2 Version 4 standard. We succeed in updating the SBML Ode Solver 1.6.0 to support SBML L2V4, but some unfixed bugs was found, so we turn to a better ode solver copasi , which moreover can flexibly display the ode solver output data and modify parameter to adjust the simulation output data curve. Obviously, those open source library and tools convenient to our design and implementation and help us to focus on our  core working.

Prerequisites
To sum up, iGame should be complied and run in computers with following tools and libraries:
C++ development environment. In Linux should be GNU C++ Tool Chain And in windows MingW Tool Chain.
Qt4 develop and run-time environment. Qt4.7 is requirement. Editor or IDE like QtCreator or Vim is also needed.
CMake, to configure the project and generate the Makefile. CMake 2.8 or later version is a requirement
dbxml, The Berkeley xml native database, is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/dbxml-core/
copasi, copasi 4.6 is a requirement. the source code and executable binary file can be downloaded at http://www.copasi.org/tiki-index.php?page=download , and one can follow those instruction to build it from source code. What should be noticed is that copasi also has prerequisites, including LAPACK/CLAPACK for Maths, Qwt and Qwtplot3D for plotting, expat to parser xml, raptor The latest version of this RDF parsing library, and libsbml for deal with SBML operations.
libsbml, Version 3.4.1 is required. Not only it is the dependence of copasi, but also the dependence of igame core code.
And libsbml should be built with configure option ""./configure --enable-layout=yes --enable-compression=no --with-expat""

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportBiosafetyBiosecurity_-_-_TEXT.html," demonstration, the author of the report has to concede its limits, mainly in the arbitrary choice of the variables. Degrees of certainty and strategical variability in the position of the social actor through the evaluation of risks also has to be taken into account. Thus, an NGO working on biotech risks will develop a more alerted position than a genomic laboratory. It can be interesting to notice, through this light, the importance of the variability of defended positions about risks and solutions, depending on the strategies of actors.
The intuition of “nature”
The work of the french association Vivagora enriched our approach about discourses on biosafety by referring to nature. What can we do about unexpected mutation of an organism in the environment? What can we do if a laboratory fails in containment and that a pathogenic agent escapes? Before that, Synbiosafe alerts us about the fact that environmental propagation is, sometimes, the main aim of an application, in particular about green and depollution application. Environmental biosensors need to be deliberately introduced into environment. Facing the weak capacities to evaluate risks, how can we be assured that the synthetic organism will succeed in the task it was designed for and no others? How can we control its behavior?
Through that variability that handicap us, Vivagora adds a fixed element, something solid we can hang on to : the natural dynamics that determines all organisms, evolution. The theoretical and paradigmatical base of the theory of evolution in life science seems to impart it with enough authority to be the element needed to fix risk evaluation. Thus, we can be sure that any organism is about to mutate and propagate in an adaptation process to its environment. Precaution linked to that point is then attached to the concept of control. Development, mutations and other kinds of evolutions of a synthetic organism has to be controlled. That control, however, has to be done through means of synthetic biology. Synthetic biology is thus able to answer autonomously to its own stakes. That control has to be faced from the beginning of a project, in the design of the application, to prevent the match with environment. Thus, precaution is at the heart of that process : from the formulation of the ethical risks to its material and biological answer.
2. Answers
What kind of answers are proposed or brought by our actors?
Biological answers with social faces
Vivagora doesn't defend any position but portray proposals from different researchers. Thus radical modification of organisms is proposed to make them unable to survive into the wilds and to cross with other species. It is the idea that “the less natural will be our production, the less they will be"

During ametabolic state, the DNA repairing mechanism is halted and cells are vulnerable to mutagenic radiation. Hence our final goal is to ameliorate our protection system by expressing the protein Dsup, in providing resistance towards radiation for the engineered bacteria, as well as MnSOD, which protect against oxidative stress during desiccation process.

Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Extras#Brainstorming_-_-_TEXT.html," in order to hold down soil that is in danger of being eroded.
This would be done using a two bacteria system, so that one strain of bacteria would associate closely with the roots of a specific plant and another strain could locate the target and secrete a long-distance signalling molecule that would cause the root-associated bacteria to secrete auxin, causing the roots to grow.
To model this, a simple system will be used, using Azotobacter paspali, which associates specifically with the roots of paspalum grass. The bacteria would be modified to secrete auxin in a dose-dependent fashion in response to a signal. The exploratory strain of bacteria would be engineered to seek out specific conditions and to release a signalling molecule.
The signalling molecule could be glutamate, calcium, possibly a homoserine lactone in a vesicle, Paris 2009.
In this paper, http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0011915 , it was shown that tomatoes and arabidopsis plants are able to take up microbes to degrade them. The bacteria were alive for around 10 days before they were all completely gone. It might be possible to have these bacteria secrete nitrates and auxin once inside the cell, or over-express it so that it is released when the bacteria are lysed by the plant.
The bacteria could potentially be engineered to thrive inside the plant roots. For this, it is important to note that it is the plants that break down their own cell walls and actively take up the bacteria.
Could also use yeast.
Converting PAH to PHA
PAH or poly aromatic hydrocarbon has been one of the major water pollutant in many tropical countries due to incorrect water waste regulation in the plastics and fuel industry. Its carcinogenicity is considered highly toxic to both human and the river creatures and hence causes major health and agricultural problem. PAH primarily accumulates inside the soil and contaminates the plankton on the riverbed. The toxicity is transmitted as the fish eat the plankton and is eaten by human respectively. Our idea is to convert this highly dangerous substance into a useful product where PHA ,polyhydroxyalkaonate, since it uses the same precursor that could be broken down by PAH, acetyl CoA and succinyl CoA. PHA is also biodegradable, thereby safe for environment, has higher elasticity, strength and and thermal stability than polyethelene and polypropylene, the non-biodegradable plastics using in everyday-life.
