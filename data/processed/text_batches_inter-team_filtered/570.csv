Our team is proud to say that we did almost all the work by ourselves : finding sponsors, making communication tools about our project, finding the protocols to use and testing them, ...
However, we needed occasional assistance during our project, it is why we required help from different people : scientists, administrators, specialists and even normal citizens. We would like to warmly thank all these persons for their contribution and their support, whatever the kind of it. Our project could move forward because they offered their help.
Ulule: a crowdfunding website to help us finding funds

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,". Upon confirmation of the correct cloning of our BioBricks in TOP10 we purified the BioBricks and transformed them into our chassis organism, E. coli B, strain BL21. All characterization experiments were carried out using this organism.
To evaluate the safety of our project, we have developed a safety tool,: an online software tool that can evaluate and qualify the safety of our project, as well as the safety of other synthetic biology projects. More information on our safety tool can be found here .
Environmental impact of our project
At the current stage of our project, our cells are maintained in the lab and do not cause any risk to the environment at all. However, our biological lenses are eventually destined for products that can be used outside an ML-1 lab, e.g. in solar cells, cameras or microscopes. The only real risk that our project might pose is that the bacteria are encapsulated inside the glass spheres; this means that the lenses we produce contain a core of a live bacterium. Current (European) ML-1 safety regulations do not always allow the use of GMO's outside the lab. Besides that, it is safer to have a product that does not contain any bacteria at all, in that case, if the glass will break it won’t cause any contamination. Therefore, we need to find out how to get the bacteria out of the biological lens, without distorting its optical properties. We are currently doing literature research in how to metabolically stop a cell, without breaking it down completely, since the cytosol is suspected to contribute to the optical properties of the lens. Firstly, we are testing if the cells are still able to grow in their silicate layer, if this is not the case, we don’t necessarily need to take any extra measures before implementing our product in the environment. However, mutations could occur so it’s always safer to make sure the bacteria are not able to reproduce anymore. Therefore we are also experimenting with autoclaving, freeze-drying and UV-sterilizing our cells to see if this kills them without disturbing the optical properties.

Valencia,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Molecular_-_-_TEXT.html,"].
The molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is as follows: the promoter is activated when there is a lack of O2 in the environment thanks to a family of proteins called FNR. FNR proteins are global transcriptional regulators that respond to fluctuations in ambient oxygen. They recognize DNA sequences in inverted disposition with this sequence: TTGATN1N2N3N4ATCAA [4], where N1-4 represents a non-conserved tetrad (no influence). The FNR sensor domain contains four cysteine residues that act like ligands for a group (cluster) of 4Fe-4S oxygen-sensitive structures. The acquisition of a 4Fe-4S cluster begins heterodimer formation of FNR that bind to specific sites of DNA and regulate transcription of target promoters. Under aerobic conditions (i.e. when oxygen is present), 4Fe-4S clusters are disassembled and the FNR dimers dissociate and form no structures that can bind to DNA.
How did we deal with this construction? Anaerobic conditions were achieved after putting a culture of E. coli, stirring, inside a sealed box. We let the bacteria to grow for at least two days and then we measured fluorescence.

Standard BioBrick Assembly
modified from Silver lab :
This assembly method can be used for BioBricks which are bigger than 150 bp. The BioBrick should be at least 500 bp bigger or smaller than the backbone. The BioBrick, which complies with these conditions, is used as the insert and is assembled into the prefix or suffix of the other used BioBrick, called vector. So you have to differentiate between a prefix and a suffix insertion.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html,"ible promoter for this purpose and it was decided to put RelB under control of the LacI-regulated, lambda pL hybrid promoter, BBa_R0011 . The William and Mary team found that the LacI-regulated, lambda pL hybrid promoter had a low level of noise,  a measure of the variability in gene expression between cells in the population, when cloned into a low copy vector. Therefore, this regulated promoter was chosen.
To mimic the expression of  RelB, a reporter system composed of the LacI-regulated, lambda pL hybrid promoter and GFP was assembled. Hereby, the appropriate concentration of IPTG required to induce the promoter on a low copy vector, was identified. During the cloning, it was discovered that the site between the LacI-regulated, lambda hybrid promoter and this particular construct under the tested conditions had formed a hotspot for transposons. In the light of this finding, another inducible promoter was chosen. The HKUST-Rice iGEM 2015 team demonstrated that induction of the AraC-regulated promoter, pBAD, caused a gradual increase in gene expression when cloned into the low to medium copy plasmid, pSB3K3, in contrast to an all-or-none behavior when cloned into the high copy vector, pSB1K3. Taking these results into consideration, the pBAD promoter was used in combination with the pSB3K3 vector to regulate the expression of the antitoxin RelB. Again, a reporter system was used to mimic the expression of RelB, as the part, BBa_I6058 , containing YFP controlled by pBAD, was assessed on different vectors.
The Final Approach for the Three Components Comprised Three Different Vectors
Based on the modelling the system approaches reviewed in the preceding part, the final design, which is illustrated on Figure 4, was established. Ultimately, the dormancy system was composed of the photocontrol device controlled by the PenI-regulated promoter on a high copy vector, RelB controlled by pBAD, BBa_K2449031 , on a low copy vector  and RelE controlled by the OmpR-regulated promoter on either a low copy vector or the chromosome.

What Can We Solve？
This year, the final goal of iGEM_BIT team is to provide the potential versatility, precision, and affordability of JACOB—essentially a representation of modularized biomarker detections—to ordinary communities. Biomarkers can reflect the user’s risk of corresponding cancer to.So as to warn the real patients to go to the hospital earlier.Less money,but higher cure rate.
Where is our market？
Diagnostic Market”,so how about IVD? JACOB falls in the category of in vitro diagnostic devices, particularly serum biomarker detection. Diagnosis market is characterized by inelastic demanding and steady growth. According to the International Trade Administration, medical device market is forecasted to grow $20 Billion per year after 2017, along with constant growth of population. For United States solely, In Vitro diagnostic devices made up 14.7% of total medical device export in 2015, while keep increasing, currently ranked 4th among all categories. Such market is advantageous to the commercialization of JACOB.
 
 
 
What determined characteristics of JACOB?
We determined the main characteristics of JACOB gradually through three stages
 
 
a.
Stage 1:Questionnaire interview
  
By questionnaire,we found an Interesting phenomena-people yearn to health while people are unwilling to go to hospital.When people feel unwell, their first reaction is to look for medicine according to their experience,why?For saving money?
Q8:When you feel your body is not very well ,will you go to the hospital first?(Fig.4)
Q9:If there is a convenient early biomarkers detection instruments, the price is not expensive (charge about 10 yuan), you only need to collect a little blood sample, are you willing to buy it?(Fig.5)
 
 
 
 
a.
Stage 2:Face to face interview
  
To get the answer further,we interviewed people face to face.The answer comes from subjective and the objective aspects.
Subjective factor:most people are more confident of their body, and some people think that is not very important to their body.they think it's almost impossible to get cancer.
 
 
Objective factor：it is inconvenient and expensive to go to hospital.  So JACOB at least need achieve two goals：
1.Tell users whether they need go to hospital accurately
2.Everyone"

Finally, we purchased Mucor circinelloides f. circinelloides (American Type Culture Collection catalog number 20132), a strain known to produce high levels of saturated lipids, compounds rich in hydrogen. As a high concentration of protons should help protect from neutrons and charged particles found in cosmic radiation. Hydrogen or hydrogen rich materials are ideal materials for radiation shielding because hydrogen does not easily break down to form a secondary radiation source.
Mycelium Glue
Mycelium has been the subject of increasing renown in recent years as a versatile substrate for use in biological engineering applications [1].  In thinking about the versatile uses of mycelium for both Earth and Mars based applications, it became clear that it would be highly advantageous to have some form of attachment mechanism for distinct pieces of mycelium material. This would be advantageous for several reasons, the first being that larger-scale structures comprised of mycelium could be more structurally sound if made up of adjoined subunits rather than one continuous unit. Modular subunits, perhaps in the shape of bricks, could be grown in parallel to accelerate the process of constructing a large mycelium structure. Another compelling reason to engineer an attachment mechanism for mycelium is the flexibility it would afford individuals in space and on Mars: mycelium can grow in virtually any shape and can grow into into 20 cm by 10 cm by 8cm bricks in under two weeks.
IIn the process of selecting different forms of biological attachment mechanisms, it was found that a bacteria-synthesized, mycelium specific bioadhesive would best fit our need. First of all because of how mass-efficient the system could be made for spaceflight. It’s been estimated that on a journey to mars, the cost of transportation is approximately $2.78 million per kilogram, so transporting bacterial spores would be highly cost-efficient in comparison to several kgs of pre-made glue or larger scale attachment devices [2]. The bacterium Bacillus subtilis has been shown to be highly resilient to the spaceflight environment and would be a viable organism to use for this endeavor [3]. It’s also worth noting that NASA and other space agencies have long been developing applications of bacteria on space; once the infrastructure for these applications are in place, the addition of a singular DNA construct for our bioadhesive"

Abstract
SeeDNA - aims to create a system for bacterial-based DNA detection.  We have designed customizable plasmids that can be activated to detect any specific short DNA sequence.  This system potentially provides digital quantification of target DNAs – representing an alternative to digital and real-time PCR.  Interaction of the target sequence with the plasmid and subsequent transformation into E. coli results in bacterial cell growth and production of a visible fluorescent signal.   As proof-of-principle we have designed a HPV-detector plasmid that detects a short sequence from the human papilloma virus.  This could be a rapid and cheap diagnostic tool for pathogenic DNA, and a revolution in resource poor hospital labs in developing countries or in an agricultural or industrial setting.
Project Overview
DNA diagnostics is a large and expanding biomedical/biotech sector.  Traditionally DNA diagnostics employs  PCR-based methods to identify disease associated genetic variations and to detect pathogens.  Despite their success, PCR-based methods have limitations for accurate DNA quantification and are expensive, limiting their application in point-of-care, cost critical and resource poor healthcare settings.
SeeDNA - aims to create a system for bacterial-based DNA detection.  We have designed DNA detector system that can in principle detect any short DNA sequence.  This DNA detector system potentially provides digital quantification of target DNAs – representing an alternative to digital and real-time PCR.  In our DNA detector system, interaction of the target sequence with the plasmid and subsequent transformation into E. coli results in bacterial cell growth and production of a visible fluorescent signal as readouts.   As proof-of-principle we have designed a HPV-detector plasmid that detects a short sequence (HPV target) from the human papilloma virus and a Y chromosome detector (SRY target).  The results of our testing and optimization to date confirm the versatility and specificity of the system.  Improvements to the"

modelling and simulation
Replication of E.coli cell
Model written in SBML format is shown below. The dynamic curve of E.coli replication is plotted by time course simulation. Exactly speaking, dynamic behaviors of biological system are meaningless after 4000s because of termination of reproduction of E.coli. However, the curve is in qualitative agreement with that from experiments in the first and second stage of reproduction of E.coli.

Basic example with pLac-LacI repression system
introduction
MoDeL provides poweful supports for description of interactions between two species. No interactions exist in the previous example. In this example, we will construct a plasmid backbone with promoter, rbs, coding sequence and terminator inserted in and transform it into E.coli. LacI repressor are produced after two steps of transcription and translation. It binds with itself to form a dimer and then a tetramer, which could bind with promoter LacI on the plasmid to repress the process of transcription. Besides, replication of E.coli cells, degradation of proteins and mRNAs, as well as dilution due to replication of cells, are also considered.
database construction
Actually, it is a complex molecular process and takes many steps to complete a transcription reaction. It includes binding and initiation, elongation, and termination. So does translation reactions. The first version of MoDeL DOES NOT support transcription and translation reaction templates and they will be handled by our core program of iGame and thus no need to write in the database.
All binding reactions in the database demo are modeled using law of mass action. They are dimerization of two LacI repressors and that of two LacI dimers. LacI tetramers will bind with promoter LacI in the plasmid and thus repressing the expression of plasmid DNAs. However, MoDeL enables any mathematical model form for species-species interactions and is not constrained within only law of mass action. Users could change the reactants, modifiers, products, as well as kinetic laws arbituarily and validate their models via output of dynamic curves.
Species reaction templates are worth mentioning to show features of our new language MoDeL. It is never a easy problem to calculate degradation rates of proteins since different parts in a fused protein may have different degradation rates and the overall rate is still unknown. What's more, a protein in MoDeL may have different protein chains and it is more complex to determine the overall rate. In"

Warwick,2017,Team:Warwick#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," enormously when we came to look at our own Human Practices.
After lunch, everyone travelled across the Thames to meet at the iconic tallest building in the UK – The Shard. This was our contribution to the UK meet and we used it as an opportunity for teams to practice their presentations. As the event took place in mid-August, we were aware that not all teams had finished their research yet, and so teams gave a condensed, 10-minute version of their Jamboree presentation. Once again, this was a great chance for teams to find out what they do well and what they need to work on.
Emzo De Los Santos, a research fellow at the University of Warwick kindly came to give a short talk on how he came to work within the field of Synthetic Biology. His research has both computational and experimental aspects, which is indicative of how interdisciplinary SynBio is. We wrapped up the UK iGEM Meet with cocktails in the Aqua Shard bar, on the 31st floor of The Shard. Taking in the Panoramic views of London was the perfect way to end a very successful and valuable weekend.
The two days were obviously a good way for us all to meet the other teams, talk about synthetic biology and practice our presentations, but there were also lots of opportunities for teams to say ""we need some help with coding"" or ask ""is anyone here a cellulose expert?"". Some of the problems that teams raised were solved there and then, whilst others developed into official collaborations between teams after the event. The collaboration between ourselves, Westminster and UCL in organizing the event provided the perfect opportunity for teams to troubleshoot their projects and gain invaluable advice from their peers.
We hadn’t met either Westminster or UCL before the event, and so we organised the entire meet via Skype sessions and instant messenger alone. We were so pleased when all of our hard work came together, and we got feedback from all of the other attending teams saying that they had had a really enjoyable time and had found the whole weekend to be very useful.
Bristol: iGEM Development Environment (IDE)
As we’re sure that most other teams have found too, Wiki editing can be a real pain. We had played around with making changes early on in the summer, but found it quite frustrating that it wasn’t possible to make real-time changes quickly and easily. You can imagine how relieved we were when Bristol iGEM contacted us with their collaboration proposal… IDE allows local development of your Wiki, which means that edits can be viewed almost instantly by simply refreshing the page.

Executive Summary
Synthetic biology can be used to advance so many facets of the world today, from agriculture and biomanufacturing to groundbreaking cancer treatments and medicines. As the science continues to evolve, the scientists, engineers, and designers themselves need to focus our efforts on creating local biological solutions to meet global needs. But what we can’t forget is to take a step back and look at the world as a whole. Not just how does anyone latest advancements better human life, but what are the footprints we are leaving behind? How does what we develop ultimately affect the world, from insects and plants to animals and aquatic life? While the full potential of synthetic biology continues to develop, we as a community must join together to make sure we don’t lose focus on the global impacts of our collective capacities. How can we best help not only humans but also the rest of the planet? (The Synthetic Biology Strategic Research Initiative)
Erwinions is a startup business whose objective is to eradicate the damage caused by the bacteria Erwinia amylovora, a bacteria attributed to causing millions of dollars losses on yearly bases. As a solution, we developed a biocontrol that doesn’t affect the microbiota when introduced, preserving the ecosystem, while doing its job. Biocontrols are an efficient and cutting-edge that can bring great success, as it can ease the plague. Our team is composed of Biotechnology undergraduates, and our product consists of a genetically modified strain of Erwinia amylovora. This modified bacteria has three exogenous genes (aiiA, yhjH, and epsE), which eradicate four main virulence factors (exopolysaccharides formation, motility, biofilm formation and system type 3 secretion). Moreover, the bacteria will not have the capability to infect the tree but will compete for natural Erwinia amylovora space and nutrients. Therefore, it will serve as a biological antagonist control against fire blight.
This product aims to replace the common treatments"

The sequencing results confirmed that we successfully cloned the J23106-INP-mSA-PSB1C3 expression vectors, we transformed the target plasmids to DH5α for amplification.
Protein Expression Assay
If the protein is successfully expressed, they will be displayed on the extracellular mem-brane of the E.coli. Therefore, we can verify protein expression by detecting whether INP-mSA exists in the total outer membrane protein.
We used the Fractionation Separation to extract three components of the outer membrane protein, the intimal protein and the cytoplasmic protein of engineered E.coli. Further Western Blot aim to confirm the previous result specifically and We choose to use horseradish peroxidase-biotin because it has the specific ability to bind INP-mSA.

Western Blot result shows that there is a clear protein band at corresponding position with a correct size and the result specifically. It prove that we do express INP-mSA on the E.coli surface successfully .
Protein function verification
Immunofluorescence Staining
After verifying the protein expression, we want to prove that the protein can function as normal. We used Rhodamine-biotin to immunofluorescence stain the engineered E.coli and negative strains  DH5α to observe whether the bacteria has fluorescence under fluorescence microscope.
The result proves that the function of protein was normal.

Meanwhile, we would like to quantify the expression of INP-mSA compared with DH5α by plate reader. When we carried out the experiment, we met the problem that there are different incubation conditions in different paper.  So we had to explore the"

Transaminase B forms leucine from aKIC and glutamate. In this reaction glutamate is converted to aKG. The reaction kinetics is of the ping-pong bi bi form. This model describes a mechanism in which the binding of substrates and release of products is ordered. The enzyme shuttles between a free and a substrate-modified intermediate state.
3.6 Degradation
mRNA degradation, Protein degradation, product degradation
3.7 Diffusion
Our model has 2 types of diffusion. Diffusion from the inside of the cell to the outside and diffusion in the outside of the cell. The diffusion over the cell membrane is more complicated because some proteins play a role in it. For AHL we found a value given in molecules/second. This unit seems strange because diffusion is most often used with units in concentration. It also lead to strange results since the amount of molecules is being levelled out so the inside amount equals the outside amount even though the concentrations are different. This is why we added a correction for the volume of the cell and the external volume to it.
We assume that the volume of the cell has a shape of a cilinder and is constant. For this simplified volume we found a value of $5.65 {\cdot} 10^{-16} $ l. The outside compartment will be modelled as a cilinder in the agar with a radius that increases with $\sqrt{2*D*t}$. For the initial value of the outside compartment we take a volume slightly bigger than the cell volume.

Chart 1. The fluorescence intensity data measured by a microplate   reader.
As can be seen from the results shown here, the fluorescence intensity of the experimental group is higher than   that of the C2 and C3 groups by a large margin. Considering the precision of our equipment, this can demonstrate   that the MVN-mRFP fusion protein is truly displayed outwards by using the INPNC displaying system. The   results of the Experimental group and C1 group are close and it may be because of the breakage of Linker1 when we   centrifuged the cells. However, the relatively high result of the C1 group is still in accordance with the   demonstration.

This assay is the final testing to identify the binding effect of our genetically modified E. coli. First,   we designed and constructed the plasmid for the experiment group (See Fig. 7). As described in the Design, we   inserted 2 transcription units into the same vector pSB1C3. One transcription unit that encodes INPNC-MVN under a   library of promoters was first introduced by the means of PCR and Gibson Assembly. The second transcription unit   that codes for GFP only was first constructed in another plasmid and later inserted into the first plasmid by   Biobrick Standard Assembly. We also constructed one plasmid for the control group that only had the second   transcription unit encoding GFP. After construction, the plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)   cells.
>Figure 7. The final construct of the ""Binding"" plasmid. One transcription   unit that expresses INPNC-MVN and one that expresses GFP are inserted into the same plasmid pSB1C3. GFP is expressed   under the constitutive promoter BBa_J23117 while INPNC-MVN is expressed under a library of constitutive promoters   (Pc). INPNC and MVN are separated by Linker1 which is a 10aa flexible protein domain linker.
We also carried out this binding test with 2 different strains of cyanobacteria, M. aeruginosa PCC"

Generally, for a course of treatment, it takes 3000 or so CNY using domestic drugs while using imported takes more than 10000 CNY. And a common cancer patient needs about 6 courses of treatment.
Q: What’s the strategies in taxol administration?
A: It’s relatively complex to use this medicine. To guarantee the performance of taxol and keep its form, we will add some excipient when preparation. But sometimes these excipient can cause allergy. As a result, some anti-allergic medicine will be used .
Q: Is taxol used to treat some other illness?
A: Nope, maybe. By now I only know it treating cancer.
Q: Does taxol has some substitutions, which may be more curative or have less side effects?
A: Yes, there are also docetaxoel, gemcitabine, vinorelbine. Not everyone suits taxol treatment. For example, because of the affect on myocardium, some people can not take taxol; and people allergic to hormone also cannot be treated by taxol for hormone would be applied before it. So we should treat appropriately based on specific conditions. In more time targeted drug is a better choice.
Q: Do you think there would be improvement in taxol treatment?
A: People will tend to use targeted drugs and immunologic therapy in the future. And now many cancer have their own targeted drugs. But for most patients, they can’t afford it and can’t check his or her target. In these cases, we still choose traditional treatment. So maybe traditional therapy would be obsolete in some day, but won’t be substituted soon."

1.8mL of each cell resuspension was transferred to two 35mm petri dishes; before starting UV exposure, 3*10uL were transferred to three wells on a 96-well PCR plate w/ 90uL of PBS pr. well. The petri dishes were then placed on the horizontal reflector under the UV lights, and the timer was started. At intervals of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mins, the petri dishes were removed from the box, and 3*10uL samples from each dish were transferred to wells on the dilution plates. The dishes were then returned to the UV box for further exposure.
From the exposed samples, a dilution series (10-1, 10-2, 10-3,10-4, and 10-5) were created. For each of the 100- to 100000-fold dilutions, 6 drops of 2uL were spotted onto one quadrant of a petri plate (LB agar; arabinose added for HB101+pGLO) using a 10uL multichannel pipette; plates were then incubated for approx. 20hrs at 37oC, and colonies were counted.
Third experiment, Sept. 7th, 2015
Liquid cultures of transformed pGLO HB101 and untransformed HB101 (grown overnight in TSB at 37oC w/ shaker) were prepared by transferring 1.0mL of culture to a microcentrifuge tube and spun for approx. 5 min at 3000 rpm. The supernatant was removed, and 1.5mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was added to each tube and vortexed gently to resuspend cells. This washing procedure was repeated 3 times. Finally, cells were resuspended in PBS to approx. OD600 = 0.35.
UV box (ExoTerra fluorescent bulbs and fluorescent nail curing light; Insulfoam sides) was set up in flow hood w/ 10.5 inch tall plastic contained placed upside-down approximately centered under the lights, and a horizontal reflector was placed on top of the container. The lights were turned on 5 mins prior to start to ensure that the fluorescent tubes had sufficient time to warm up. Combined UV-A and UV-B light intensity was measured at approx. 1.96mW/cm2,"

Week 3 (May 14-18)
Decarboxylation
The third week included some additional literature investigation in the first two days. The iGEM distributions arrived this week, and verification began on May 17th by transformation into E. coli, followed by colony PCR on May 18th (using standard protocols on the wiki). Additionally, primers were designed for CAR in N. iowensis, along with primers for Nocardia posphopantetheine transferase (NPT), a second enzyme required for optimal function in the former, and a short list of contacts were acquired to request the donation of the required strain (called NRRL 5646) from researchers who have worked with it previously. A sort of form email was drafted for this purpose, and should this be unsuccessful, we will be purchasing the strain from DSMZ (http://www.dsmz.de). In the following week, we will begin with development of overnight cultures and gel preparation.
Ring Cleavage
In the second week we continued to do more research on the degradation of alicyclic compounds and found two strains of bacteria that contained genes needed for this process.  The first strain, Thauera butanivorans, contains the genes required to activate the ring by adding a hydroxyl group. The gene is called butane monooxygenase and is composed of three subunits, a hydroxylase, a reductase, and a regulatory component.  The second strain, Acinetobacter sp. SE19, contains the genes needed to oxidize the alcohol, formed by butane monooxygenase, and to cleave the ring.  There is a cluster of nine genes that perform this oxidation and cleavage but only six are involved directly.
Desulfurization
Building on the previous week's literature review, the 4S pathway was recognized as the preferred biological mechanism that we would explore in devising a desulfurization biosystem. Of specific interest is the dsz operon consisting of the genes for dszA, dszB, and dszC which selectively and non-destructively remove the sulfur from the hydrocarbon structure, and therefore preserves the carbon skeleton. In addition to these, another dsz gene exists. dszD, which codes for a FMN:NADH reductase, is an essential component of the pathway, but not part of the operon. Instead, it is encoded on the chromosome. The enzyme produced by this gene is required to regenerate the FMNH2 consumed by the reactions carried out"

Hypothesis 2: Increased expression of YFP due to increased osmotic pressure
We cultivated TOP10 cells, transformed with the successful clonings, in sucrose and salt gradients and thereafter measured fluorescence (excitation wavelength 485-12 nm ± 10, emission wavelength 520 nm ± 30) of YFP at each OD600 from 0.1 to 0.6, expecting to see higher levels of fluorescence in higher sucrose and salt concentrations. We used both negative and positive controls in the highest concentrations of sucrose and NaCl and in a 0% sample. Our negative control was untransformed TOP10 cells and positive control TOP10 cells transformed with constitutively expressed YFP (BBa_K592101).
Figure 2. Average fluorescence of YFP at OD 0.3, only sucrose and controls.
Figure 3. Average fluorescence of YFP at OD 0.3, only NaCl and controls.
However, the obtained results from the fluorescence measurements were not conclusive. First of all, the negative controls showed higher fluorescence than some of the samples. This is further demonstrated in figure 2 and 3. As the negative control contained no YFP, we concluded that the bacteria itself have a lot of background fluorescence. Second, we observed no trend regarding increasing fluorescence with rising osmotic pressure, neither in sucrose nor in the salt gradient. We could therefore not draw any conclusions regarding the activity of the OmpR promoter when using YFP as reporter and decided to replace the reporter protein to RFP, the same as iGEM Stockholm 2015 had used.
RFP
Hypothesis 3: Successful cloning OmpR+RFP (BBa_M30011) into low copy number plasmid (pSB4A5)
After deciding to replace the YFP reporter with RFP reporter, we began working with the already existing biobrick BBa_M30011 which contains the construct OmpR-RFP. We performed the same cloning procedure as we designed for the earlier construct, and successfully retrieved OmpR-RFP in the low copy number plasmid pSB4A5 (figure 4). The red colonies contain the correct ligation product, and the white/yellow colonies have re-ligated.

COBRA
The COnstraints Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) approach to systems biology accepts the fact that we do not possess sufficiently detailed parameter data to precisely model, in the biophysical sense, an organism or plant at the   genome scale [1]. The COBRA Toolbox is a freely available Matlab toolbox can be used to perform a variety of COBRA methods, including many FBA-based methods. Models for the COBRA Toolbox are saved in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML).
AraGEM Model
AraGEM  [2] is the genome-scale metabolic network model covering primary metabolism for a compartmentalized plant cell based on the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis Thaliana) genome.  AraGEM is a comprehensive literature-based model,   that accounts for the functions of 1,419 unique open reading frames, 1,737 metabolites, 5,253 gene-enzyme reaction-association entries, and 1,601 unique reactions compartmentalized into the cytoplasm, mitochondrion, plastid, peroxisome,   and vacuole. Using efficient resource utilization as the optimality criterion, AraGEM has already been used to predict the classical photorespiratory cycle as well as known key differences between redox metabolism in photosynthetic and   nonphotosynthetic plant cells.
Figure 1.  In AraGEM, palmitic acid is also called Hexadecanoic Acid_acc.  The reaction added ExZ11 produces the efflux   V3 known as palmitic acid exchange.
AraGEM is a viable framework for in silico functional analysis and can be used to derive new, nontrivial hypotheses for exploring plant metabolism.  We take for granted that AraGEM is the genome-scale metabolic network model that   currently better approximates the metabolism model of N. benthamiana.

TU-Eindhoven,2012,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Thoughts_-_-_TEXT.html,".' We hereby would like to thank Robert Campbell for his permission to add the GECO-BioBricksTM to the Registry! Although both Addgene and the Registry provide services to non-profit organizations and aim to help scientists around the world, there are subtle differences. Addgene is not completely open-source and requires MTAs for distributing their plasmids. The Registry, however, does not make use of MTAs. It is interesting to experience these differences in the world of science and does make one wonder whether a general set of rules or guidelines should be enforced.
Registry
The manner in which the BioBrickTM Registry collects the BioBricksTM is not the most practical way. Every single team has to send their newly synthesized BioBrickTM, ligated into the standard BioBrickTM plasmid.  The shipment of all of these BioBricksTM is basically unnecessary, because during the last couple of years synthesizing DNA sequences has become much cheaper. The DNA sequence of the BioBrickTM, which is registrated by every iGEM team, can be synthesized for 10 eurocent per base pair. The shipment of the BioBricksTM is not needed if every team will synthesize the desired parts by themselves. This procedure will decrease the costs for the BioBrickTM Registry and will also prevent the Registry containing and distributing nonworking parts.
Besides these advantages for the BioBrickTM Registry, there are also advantages for the participating teams. The ligation of the BioBrickTM into the standard BioBrickTM plasmid takes time. The enzymes, which are delivered with the BioBrickTM kit, can be used to cut the insert DNA and the plasmid. However, these are not suitable for all DNA strands.  Some of them will cut at a restriction site which also occurs in the insert DNA. As a result of this unintended cutting the BioBrickTM will be inoperative. Even though this issue will not occur on a regular basis, the BioBrickTM ligation will take extra time. This extra time can be put to better use for further project research.
In addition to the decrease of time and money for both parties, skipping the shipment of the BioBrickTM in the standard plasmid will have another last advantage. The collaboration between the different teams will increase because teams will approach each other for their desired parts. Teams can synthesize the desired parts by themselves but they can also approach other teams for working vectors which can lead to more collaboration between teams.
Sharing sequences instead of plasmids therefore has several advantages, which makes it a"

According to this group, the technology could be useful for everyone with smelly feet. Since you want to make it suitable for every type of feet and shoes, they propose coupling to stores specialized in making individual shoe soles. In the future,       they want to implement a system that could protect the user for ‘escaping’ organisms.

Purity straw
The second group provided a solution for the contamination of drinking water, the Purity Straw. The straw has a membrane inside, which can clean contaminated water. The straw is suitable to use it in most situations where access to clean water is limited.
The printer gives the opportunity to print different kind of membranes, which makes it useful for every type of contamination.
Figure 2.
The team surprised us with a short but to the point market strategy on their poster (Figure 2). According to them, the product could be useful for humanitarian organisations in helping developing countries to get clean water. Moreover, the army can get   access to clean water everywhere. With this technology they target especially remote areas, over populated regions and areas struck by disaster. Finally, why did they think the technology was useful and beneficial? Well, it is easy to use, the material   is light and therefore easy to take with you. Finally, it could be small.
The discussion after the presentation contained some nice questions:
“What about the fact that people could swallow the bacteria during drinking? The team answered with: “People should just adapt to this situation, since the bacteria in the straw are less harmful than the bacteria present in water”. Actually, by using     this device, the bacteria should have a GRAS status;
According to a student of industrial design, such a technology already exist. So, this team did a really nice job here!
Lumy
Another team came up with a totally different application of our construct; ‘The Lumy”. Lumy provides a sustainable version of lights for bicycles. The Lumy can be ordered at a special website in every shape you like. The product you will receive at home   consists of a sticky layer, a layer of nutrients (medium), the biofilm which has the property to emit light. So, the only thing you need at home is medium for the bacteria! Since batteries are not necessary anymore, the product could be highly sustainable.
The Lumy is especially useful in a country like the Netherlands (students for sure), since everyone uses a bikes often. Moreover, since the equipment is closed, the bacteria cannot escape.

Enrichment Studies Unit
This summer, QGEM hosted three week-long synthetic biology courses for middle school and high school students through the Summer Enrichment Experience at Queen's (SEEQ) program hosted by the Enrichment Studies Unit (ESU). Synthetic biology is an emerging field that students are seldom educated in  elementary school, high school, and even postsecondary institutions. We believe that synthetic biology is the future, and therefore educating young people about it is a crucial component to raising public awareness. It is also an excellent way to promote iGEM to high school students on the verge of attending postsecondary institutions, for which they will have gained prior exposure that can potentially influence them to join iGEM.
QGEM had the pleasure of teaching students from grades 6-12 this summer. Although students in grades 6-8 experience a very basic science background by virtue of the curriculum, they were eager to learn from our presentations. We started by introducing our students to biological cells and cellular organelles, and how cells play a role in maintaining optimal function in a living organism. Next, we taught them the basics of DNA and heredity, while also touching on genetic diseases in our class discussion. We would complete the lesson series with an introduction to protein structure and function.
Some concepts that we focused on in our lessons included: the idea that DNA serves as the blueprint of the cell (via transcription and codons), the concept behind proteins functioning as the machinery working inside of cells (including examples such as hemoglobin, digestive enzymes, and DNA repair enzymes), and the pathology of mutations and certain genetic diseases (such as heritable diseases, mutagen-induced diseases, and diseases related to chromosomal nondisjunction). We also introduced students to the basic concepts of synthetic biology (fusing biology with engineering) and organized class discussions on the ethics and societal implications of synbio research.
Our lesson plans were modified from the William and Mary 2015 iGEM team's Synthetic Biology Curriculum . We included many interactive activities (such as making cell models using treats, DNA helices using Twizzlers, and extracting DNA from bananas) to ensure that the learning process is hands-on, engaging, interesting, and drives the important points home. We were fortunate to have run these courses in partnership with Queen's ESU, who conducted the"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#DateRapeDrugs_-_-_TEXT.html,"1758377 in pSB1C3 (as described previously) was induced to express T7 polymerase in medium with different concentrations of either GBL or GHB. As control, medium without GBL nor GHB was used.     As the strain constitutively expresses BlcR, we expected the fluorescence signal to be higher when GBL or GHB were present in the medium, as both analytes interact with BlcR. Supplementation with GHB or GBL lead to releasing of the repressor from the blc-operator, thereby raising the expression of sfGFP.
As illustrated in the nearby figure, fluorescence signals of strains that had grown in medium with the analytes were slightly higher, except for cultures with 1% GHB which showed inhibited growth.
These results indicated that, although a difference could be seen, the device has its limits in vivo.
In vivo characterization of GBL / GHB sensor with strain containing BBa_K1758377 . All experiments were perfomed as triplicates. All samples except ""control, not induced"" were induced to express T7 polymerase at OD600 = 0.7-0.8
Characterization – in vitro experiments
Because of the the issues regarding the in vivo characterization, we testes the sensor system in our CFPS-approach as described previously. We conducted a CFPS with extract from strain constitutivly expressing BlcR. As reporter plasmid, BBa_K1758376 (see figure genetic approach) was used. This plasmid is analog to our CFPS positive control PT7-UTR-sfGFP (see CFPS results ) except that T7 promoter is followed by the blc-operator.
As well as in vivo, GBL and GHB had detrimental effects on the molecular machinery. 0.3% (v/v) of GBL were sufficient to strongly, but not completely inhibit protein synthesis when we used our standard cell extract. For GHB the effect was even greater, stopping protein synthesis completely at 3% (v/v) final concentration as depicted in the graphs.
Influence of γ-butyrolactone (GBL) on expression of sfGFP in our standard CFPS reaction (t = 60 min). Positive control: PT7-UTR-sfGFP ( BBa_K1758102 ). Values are normalized to cell lysate containing sfGFP. n=3

Toronto,2016,Team:Toronto#HP-Impact_-_-_TEXT.html," academic careers and strengthening knowledge-generation capacity. Third, there is the direct economic benefit of assisting in the creation of dynamic, young firms that will put the synthetic biology workforce and knowledge generated by academic to use. However, there are other benefits that we have not discussed at length heretofore.
Many iGEM teams engage in outreach activities towards the youth and general public in order to generate interest in genetics and synthetic biology. It’s not really possible to study this quantitatively, but we will provide some examples to illustrate the creativity and enthusiasm of iGEMers.
University College London’s 2013 team (University College London Wiki, 2013) instigated a TED Debate on neuroethics. This formed the basis for their later speed debate on ethics in synthetic biology, which featured speakers from academia and industry before splitting into moderated debates in small groups that were periodically shuffled and posed new questions. Participants’ animated discussion inspired a creative writing competition on the human practices of their project to fight Alzheimer’s Disease.
MacQuarie Australia’s 2015 team (MacQuarie Wiki, 2015) continued with their web-based reality video series “So You Think You Can Synthesise”. The team was able to integrate laboratory practices and their project into the show while allowing viewers to influence the outcome through online voting.
Purdue iGEM’s 2013 team (Peking wiki, 2013) worked with high school biology teachers to incorporate mathematical modeling into their classrooms to ease the transition into synthetic biology. The team also collaborated with Biomaker Bench to help organize outreach efforts to K-12 students in Indiana. Lastly, they organized and implemented a workshop for Girl Scouts to learn about biotechnology.  Washington’s 2011 team (Washington, 2011) introduced their project to university students and students at the K-12 level. They created an interactive cloning project, where students use ribbons and balloons to visualize the processes of digestion, ligation, and cloning of vectors into cells. Their program then introduced students to the functions of proteins and let them use ‘Foldit’, an interactive protein folding and design computer game. The team presented their interactive activity at the Bellevue School District Bennett Elementary School Young Scientist Week to K-5 students, parents, and teachers.
At a time when scientific progress provides great opportunities and poses great risks, good scientific governance is essential. However, trust in public institutions is declining (Gallup Inc., 2016) and attitudes towards settled scientific concepts like climate change are deeply polarized (Funk and Kennedy, 2016). Groups like iGEM that generate interest"
Heidelberg,2010,Team:Heidelberg#Team#Members_-_-_TEXT.html," from India to Germany to do her masters in Molecular Biosciences with majors in Systems Biology, Aastha had already a bachelor degree in Bioinformatics from there. Her bachelor thesis was about creating a web tool for calculation of protein interactions which she carried out at the Indian Institute of Science. For iGEM, she is a part of the modelling force. Working with systems and synthetic biology has been of prime interest to her and, of course, she thinks with this we can achieve our ultimate goal: creating tiny pet dinosaurs.
Alejandro Macías Torre
After finishing his bachelor studies in Universidad Autónoma in Madrid with a bachelor thesis in directed evolution of dihydroxyacetone kinases, Alejandro spent a year working in the Biocatalysis department of a Japanese company with the program Vulcanus in Japan. Currently he pursues the master program on Molecular Biosciences with major in Systems Biology in Heidelberg University. One of his strongest reasons to join iGEM was the unique opportunity of combining science with creativity, something that does not happen very frequently. He thinks that synthetic biology can help mankind take steps forward at the same time it provides some insight about the basic principles of life.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION (original)
About four billion years ago our planet was at a historic turning point. While organic chemistry had already been invented, the recent generation of organic molecules was profoundly different. They organized into spatially confined structures and self-replicated at an ever-increasing speed. Soon, the freely available organic building blocks became limited and the increasingly complex structures began to actively compete for resources and space. Life emerged and with it the Darwinian evolution.  The concept of life turned out to be powerful and rapidly transformed our planet into what ET could easily describe as a huge bioreactor. Innumerable rounds of mutation and selection over billions of years gave rise to the beautiful biological diversity and complexity we can appreciate today. Life appears to seamlessly adapt to even the most harsh and unfriendly environments by finding clever solutions – provided it has enough time to do so. And this is where our project begins.  This year, the iGEM team Heidelberg aims at harnessing the enormous power of Darwinian evolution to facilitate the development of biomolecules for human benefit. To this end, we will build upon the PACE (phage-assisted continuous evolution) method, which miniaturizes and accelerates evolution and governs it towards a predefined purpose. PACE couples the survival of quickly mutating phages carrying a scaffold protein to directed selection within E. coli hosts. Thereby, proteins with desired properties can be evolved within hours instead of centuries.  To harness its enormous potential, we will create a comprehensive and standardized toolbox and accompanying software that will enable the application of PACE on diverse protein classes, including enzymes for pharmaceutical and biomaterial production.

Secret garden
Congratulations! You've found our secret garden! Follow the instructions below and win a great prize at the World jamboree!
A video shows that two of our team members are having great fun at our favourite company. Do you know the name of the second member that appears in the video?
For one of our models we had to do very extensive computations. To prevent our own computers from overheating and to keep the temperature in our iGEM room at a normal level, we used a supercomputer. Which centre maintains this supercomputer? (Dutch abbreviation)
We organised a symposium with a debate, some seminars and 2 iGEM project presentations. An iGEM team came all the way from the Netherlands to present their project. What is the name of their city?
Now put all of these in this URL:https://2013.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/(firstname)(abbreviation)(city), (loose the brackets and put everything in lowercase) and follow the very last instruction to get your special jamboree prize!

Paris_Saclay,2014,Team:Paris Saclay#Modeling#bacterial Growth_-_-_TEXT.html," 10^{-2} ~ min^{-1} \] and \[ \mu = 4,6 \times 10^{-4} min^{-1} \]
So we are in the case $\lambda>\mu$. The partition coefficient of variation ensure us that the system is asymptotically stable.
Moreover, we know, through the part probability of extinction , that the probability of extinction is, if we denote $N_0$ the initial population size, \[ p_0(\infty) \sim \left(\frac{\mu}{\lambda}\right)^{N_0} = \left(\frac{4,6 \times 10^{-4}}{\lambda = 3,6 \times 10^{-2}}\right)^{N_0} \simeq (1.3 \times 10^{-2})^{N_0} \simeq 10^{-2~N_0} \] which is really near to $0$.
In practice, there is almost no chance that the population will be extinct and that there is places where bacteria will develop indefinitely.
If we want to be really sure, we just have to choose $N_0$ as \[ N_0\geqslant\frac{3}{log_{10}\left(\frac{\lambda}{\mu}\right)} = \frac{3}{log_{10}\left(\frac{3,6 \times 10^{-2}}{4,6 \times 10^{-4}}\right)} = \frac{3}{log_{10}(78)} = \frac{3}{1,9} = 1,6 \] what, with our model, ensures us that if we deposit at least two bacteria on our lemon it will be wholly covered.
Actually, our model can be considerably improved but we feared it was not of the level of the iGEM competition.

So the     while the individuals labs are receiving plates with higher rated, fully     working parts for their projects, anyone who wants to work on a more     exotic part can search through the achieves and re-vitalize the parts     stored there. The challenge of re-vitalization of parts can be encouraged     as an collaborative effort.
New Options for the Parts Registry Database
96% of participants are like minded with us that it      will be useful to have a link out to the gene/protein information      of the parts and - %97 of participants have been agree that they      would like to know if a part is also involved in known biological      pathways.
For receiving pathway information more participants have     voted for NCBI Cog (59%) than KEGG pathways (38%) when the responses     for both has been distributed among the choices according to response     rates. Adding the blast option to the parts registry has also     been suggested to locate parts of interest. We are sure all of us would     like to see gene-protein and pathway information if these information     was integrated into the database and offered automatically for each     entry in the database.
We are planning to provide this information about the parts to     all parts registry users as a build-in option in the next version of     BioGuide in iGEM 2011.

NEPTUNE DESIGN MOTIVATION
Neptune was designed to help lower the barrier of entry to microfluidics to any biologist by providing accessible, parametric, and free tools which can be used to make many iterations of devices quickly and cost-efficiently. We accomplished this by the sum of all of our deliverables that we are presenting and contributing to the iGEM community.

VALIDATION OF CONTRIBUTION

NEPTUNE SOFTWARE DELIVERABLES
Neptune is an Open Source tool. All software components are readily available for download and installation by anyone on either Github or NONA.
Through Neptune’s Software User Interface, biologists can build their chip from the ground up. By creating a project in Neptune, a user is provided with all of the necessary tools to successfully build their device. At any point while using Neptune, the user can refer to their dashboard for helpful hints and progress tracking.
First, the user will be able to specify their design at a high level on the Specify page. Through the simple IDE tool, they can specify their design in terms of the inputs, outputs and any operations and features between those two in the Liquid Flow Relations (LFR) file. All of these operations and features are defined in the User Constraint (UCF) File, which is provided to the user by default. However if he or she wishes to add to or change the UCF file they may do so on this page. Once the user is finished describing their chip in the LFR file and have made any edits necessary to the UCF file, they can compile their code and move on to the Design stage of Neptune.
In the Design stage, the user is provided a more detailed description of their microfluidic in the form of a MINT (Microfluidic Netlist) file, which is automatically outputted from the Specify stage. If the user wishes to work with"

There are a lot of exciting Parts in the Registry, but many Parts have still not been characterized. Synthetic Biology needs great measurement approaches for characterizing new parts, and efficient new methods for characterizing many parts at once. If you've done something exciting in the area of Measurement, describe it here!

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
As the first modern university in China, Tianjin University has a history of 120 years. However, our School of Life Sciences is very young and fresh, which was founded in 2012. Though our college is so young, we have made many achievements owing to the great supports given by our university and the hard work of our professors and graduates.
This year is the first year when our school took part in the iGEM competition. The recruitment included all undergraduates in our university. After resume screening, audition and a tough winter vacation work which required candidates to submit a complete project design with protocols, 22 students were chosen as the members of team Tianjin 2015.
Our team consists of students majoring in life sciences, chemical/pharmaceutical/biological engineering, computer science, and even electric engineering. In particular, Yifan Zhang in computer science is from Zhejiang Sci-tech University. We are divided into four groups which are responsible for wet lab, wiki&design, modeling and human practice.
In our iGEM journey, our instructors always give us great help, and many graduates shared their experience with us. Since all of us are green hands in biological research, a small step for our project could be a gaint leap for ourselves. No matter what the result is, we have spent a happy and fulfilling time all together.
It is the second time for Ketong to take part in iGEM. And this year not many people would play jokes on him because he has become the team leader and usually shows his straight face. He doesn't like pretty loli anymore, but he still loves female.
Dongqi is another leader in our team. She is lazy in body but hardworking in mind. Larry in the book The Razor's Edge is her idol.
Jiashu is a gentle nice girl, and everyone is impressed with her warm smile. Meanwhile, she is often called Boss by Junjie Yu because she could conduct biological experiments perfectly.

OpenPlant
Understanding the bottlenecks of plant synthetic biology and best practices for open science
Hosted at the John Innes Centre in Norwich, the OpenPlant Forum presented talks from some of the most exciting innovations and research developing in plant synthetic biology at this moment. The three-day event also featured panel discussions on predominant issues in this field, including a discussion on “Commercial opportunities and bottlenecks in the future of plant synthetic biology”, featuring the inventor of BioBricks and ‘godfather’ of synthetic biology, Tom Knight.
This discussion raised the need for creating more efficient techniques for engineering plants into chassis for commercial production of biofuels and pharmaceuticals. This is something which we already aim to achieve as part of our project, through a standardised cas9 system for chloroplast engineering, which follows the phytobrick common syntax. Other relevant challenges were also raised in the discussion on “Reprogramming Agriculture”, such as responsible research and public perception of plant synthetic biology. Members of our team took part in this talk, sharing our views with an audience of over 100 people and making the key point that scientists have a responsibility to document their research and methods thoroughly. Mistrust and misunderstanding of what plant synthetic biology will be used for, and the ownership of this technology, is a result of miscommunication between the scientific and nonscientific communities.
The discussions highlighted the importance of  DIY Bio Hackspaces, such as those we had encountered at the Bio NightScience event in Paris.  By allowing ‘ordinary’ citizens to actively participate in synthetic biology projects for themselves, this helps to bridge the gap between the two communities and create a dialogue between them. This further encouraged our design of a low cost growth facility and gene gun for such spaces, as any techniques for plant engineering which industry hopes to commercialise must first be widely accepted in the public eye. Providing accessibility to these techniques for hackspaces, schools and other small community labs will, we hope, promote more widespread understanding and acceptance of them.

Braunschweig,2013,Team:Braunschweig#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," However, we observed some point mutations in the prefix/suffix sequences of some bricks as well as major annotation differences in the BioBrick C0061.
Sunday, June 9, 2013
Investigators: Laura, Kerstin
We ran a colony PCR of two clones of each ligation (transformation from June 6, 2013) and the biobricks P1002 and K091117 (primers VF2 and VR).
We also inoculated overnight cultures for plasmid preparations the next day.
Monday, June 10, 2013
Investigators: Laura, Kerstin
We analyzed yesterday’s colony PCR gel electrophoresis for the expected fragment sizes. Looking at the gel all clones seem to be positive, although clone 1 of J23100+B0032 and J23106+B0032 did not contain the promoters as later shown by DNA sequencing.
We isolated the plasmid DNA from all clones with a miniprep kit following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Tuesday, June 11, 2013
Investigators: Kerstin, Laura
We transformed the chemically competent E. coli XL1 Blue MRF’ with the ligation C0061+B0015 (prepared on June 6, 2013) and the biobrick E0420 (eCFP).
The plasmid DNA isolated the day before was sent to GATC for sequencing.
The DNA sequences from June 7, 2013 were evaluated by sequence alignment with the vector maps. The biobricks C0079, C0078, C0070 and B0032 were sequence verified. However, the biobrick C0061 did not match the annotated sequence. The prefix was missing and there was an additional oligonucleotide sequence in the 5’ region of the biobrick. This led to the assumption that C0061 might be a composite part.
Wednesday, June 12, 2013
Investigators: Tabea, Oliver
The biobrick B0015 was amplified by PCR using the resuspended DNA from the distribution kit as template. The PCR was successful (expected fragment size was 443 bp).
A colony PCR of two clones of each of yesterday’s transformations (E0420 and C0061+B0015) was run (primers VF2 and VR). Overnight cultures of the analyzed clones were inoculated.
The remaining DNA sequences (from June 7,2013) were evaluated by sequence alignment. While the BioBricks J06702, B0012, C0071, R0062 and R0071"

Exploring the German Community Lab Scene
At the 12th of June, the iGEM Team Darmstadt came to visit us. Due to the technical nature of the teams Darmstadt and Aachen, we have compared how both of our teams are operating. The team organization of TU_Darmstadt is completely different to ours, but nevertheless we offered them an instance in tubefront . The feedback that we got from team Darmstadt helped us to understand how we could improve tubefront.
iGEM Team Darmstadt in Aachen
Apart from presenting and discussing ours as well as their project and spending two fun days together, we invited them to have a deeper discussion about the growing Community Lab scene in Germany. All the participants of this discussion group had quite different knowledge about community labs ranging from having heard about their existence up to being an active member of a community lab.
Together, we had a first evaluation of the general pros and cons of community labs. Our discussion can be subdivided into three main topics: Exemplary Features, Risks & Solutions and Gain.
Exemplary Features
Since Fabian from Team Darmstadt is a member of a local BioHackerSpace (recently founded by the Makerspace Darmstadt) he could give us a first insight into the work, structure  and motivation of biohackers. This particular biohackerspace is motivated by the idea that although there is a great number of life sciences and technical do-it-yourself kits availabe in Germany, as for chemistry, biology and microcontroller based programming, there is none for biotechnology. Therefore the 15 members with various"

The purpose of this technique is to introduce a recombinant plasmid DNA into a bacterial strains and to use bacteria strains to amplify the plasmid mutant-pSB1A3 for further plasmid construction. Method
1. Take out an  appropriate number of tubes that contain competent cells(100μl ) from the freezer. Immediately place the tubes on ice, so that all  but the cap is surrounded by ice. Allow the cells to thaw on ice for 2-5 min.
2.  Visually check the cells to see whether they  have thawed and gently flick the cells 1-2 times to evenly resuspend the cells.
3. Add 10μl PCR products(mini-prep purified) to the competent cells DH-5α.  Stir gently to mix and return the tube to the ice, making sure that the tube is  surrounded by ice except for the cap. Repeat for additional two times for the  same samples.
4. Incubate the  tubes on ice for 30 min.
5. Place the tubes  in a 42°C  water bath for exactly 90 sec; do not shake.
6. Place the tubes  on ice for 2 min to cool down.
7. Add 800 μl of room temperature LB medium to each tube.
8. Shake the tubes  vigorously at 37°C for 45-60 min.
9. Centrifuge the  tubes at 3K RPM for 1 min. Discard the supernatant liquor and leave 100-200 μl of the mixtures.Mix the contents and spread  the whole liquid on LB agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotic ampicillin  for the plasmid.
10. Place the  plates on the bench for several min to allow excess liquid to be absorbed, and  then invert and incubate overnight at 37°C (12-16 h).
Colony PCR for Verification
Colony PCR is used to identify and select cell colonies that have the correct plasmid inserted. The procedure is a way to do several PCR operations on cell colonies in parallel, to evaluate the results and select the corresponding positive cell colonies. After an overnight growth of E.coli, we can pick up several colonies from the plate and do a colony PCR verification. Besides, the colonies we choose and should also be stored, we can incubate these colonies in one plate after every colony has been marked.
Method
1. Prepare the sample reaction as  indicated below:

Composite 3:
Dual Expression of FucO and GSH
The first protein coding region we have, placed after the RBS, FucO, will code for L-1,2-propanediol oxidoreductase (a homodimer enzyme)                  in order to act upon furfural presence in the field (Zheng, 2013). The metabolism of furfural by NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductases will                  reduce the toxicity of the chemical by turning it into a derivative, furfuryl alcohol, and increase the furfural tolerance (Zheng, 2013;                  Wang et al., 2013; Allen et al., 2010). Our second protein coding region, bifunctional gamma-glutamate-cysteine ligase/Glutathione                  synthetase (GSH), is a non-protein thiol group and a tripeptide composed of cysteine, glycine and glutamic acid (Lu, 2013). It is crucial                  for the detoxification of reactive oxygen species and free radicals (Ask et al. 2013). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are harmful substances                  that alter protein based matters by taking electrons (Lu, 2013; Burton & Jauniaux, 2011). Because many benefits of GSH include scavenging                  of ROS, protection against endogenous toxic metabolites and detoxification of xenobiotics, we choose this gene to integrate with FucO (Höck et al., 2013). Thus we constructed a multi-functional gene providing long life span and resistance.
Design Notes of Dual Expression of FucO and GSH (BBa_K2571006)
Our construct for composite part 3 is composed of two stages, first the reduction of furans (specifically furfural and 5-HMF)  and second the                  detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To achieve this effect, we designed our composite 3 part as with a prefix, a strong promoter                  (J23100), RBS (B0034), FucO as the first protein coding region (BBa_K2571003) ,                  RBS (B0034), G"

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," thermocycler settings which resulted in many different sized bands on an agarose gel. To reduce the amount of nonspecific primer annealing in these reactions, we decided to only use touch-down thermocycler settings and to put the primers on the side walls of the PCR tubes to limit the Q5 polymerase exposure to the primers. The exonuclease activity of the Q5 polymerase chews back the ends of our primers and causes non specific annealing, so we made sure the primers were added last before putting the reactions into the thermocycler. We also decided to run OE PCR reactions without primers to allow the overlapping regions of the genes to anneal and form the full length genes which could be used as templates for regular PCR reactions.
Since our project would eventually require separate experiments with 5 different inserts, our first goal in lab was the amplification of our experimental base plasmid. We first created a stock of ampicillin selective plates with a concentration of 100ug/mL. We carried out a transformation with NEB DH5α chemicompetent cells and created a glycerol stock of leftover cells after plating. We plated out transformants on 3 plates at original strength, 10-fold, and 100-fold dilutions using glass beads. Our platings were successful, and we used the 100-fold dilution plate to isolate single colonies and create a monoclonal culture of transformants. We also learned how to plate with a sterile wire loop in order to keep the number of plates used to a minimum. Every protocol--pouring plates, transformations, platings, and creating glycerol stocks--was new to us and required some reading of protocols from NEB and other sources.
Created 80% glycerol freeze stocks of four S. cerevisiae strains obtains from the Heinrich lab at UCSC. Did a second attempt of miniprepping the pXRL2- and pUC19-containing E. coli, but unfortunately had salt contamination in our resulting sample. We attempted this a third time by tossing out flow-throughs between each step of the miniprep procedure and obtained workable plasmid samples for pXRL2 and pUC19.
Primers came in and were rehydrated.
We performed our first attempt to PCR amplify out the ade2 homologous arms from Y. lipolytica using colony PCR. No amplification was observed. For our second amplification attempt, we used Touchdown PCR and used increasing concentrations of yeast cells in the PCR reaction mixes. Still no results.

Colombia,2012,Team:Colombia#Human#SynthEthics_-_-_TEXT.html," the Sabana University located in Chía, Colombia to the first philosophy and biosciences workshop (11, 12, and 13th of June). The main focus of this event was to address the concepts of “complexity and emergency” from both stand points, as well as to generate very much forgotten dialogues between philosophers and scientists. The main guests ranged from local representatives of the scientific community, to expert philosophers from Spain and Poland. Some of these special guests were Prof. Juan Arana , an expert in Philosophy and Contemporary Culture from the Universidad De Sevilla in Spain, Dr. Fernando Lizcano , an Endocrinnology specialist from Universidad de la Sabana, Colombia, Prof. José Murillo , an subdirector of the Anthropology and Ethics Institute of the Universidad de Navarra, Spain, among others.

For this particular audience, we elaborated a different style of lecture, based in a presentation given by Stanford’s Prof. Drew Endy during a synthetic biology EMBO workshop in Buenos Aires, Argentina last April. We skipped the basic biology and molecular biology sections of our usual formula, and decided to focus into the technical, scientific, and social ambitions of synthetic biology. We discussed how the scientific perspective to an emergent technology may be different from the general public political ones, and how interdisciplinary projects together with philosophy may strengthen bioethical initiatives. As always, we followed with a short overview of our project aims and methods. As a means to address the main topics of the workshop, our main point was extracted from the words of Caltech’s Michael Elowitz (Elowitz & Lim, 2010): “Build life to understand it”. We proposed synthetic biology as an alternative to understand life and what makes us human, and purposely used expressions such as “create life” or “produce organisms” in order to generate philosophical debates regarding our way to address complexity. We proposed the idea that synthetic biology may stand as a vanguard discipline in the way in which we think about life. Instead of limiting biology’s concern with past and present life forms, synthetic biology may be making an important step forwards into thinking about the organisms that may be. We also stated how the gap between engineering and biology is rapidly shortening, and discussed if philosophy and science may merge again in the future in a similar way. If you are interested in the lecture and the debate click here ! (Sorry, spanish only!).
After our presentation at the workshop, we were given about 30 minutes for questions and debate. There were two main concerns from our audience. The first one questioned"
CIEI-China,2017,Team:CIEI-China#HP#Our Story_-_-_TEXT.html," February, we brainstormed the idea of our project. During this time, we visited the Institute of Zoology and discussed with Dr. Wei, the expert of Conservation Genetics, for advice. We made clear of the prospection of idea with the professors; and they confirmed that our research topic will be very meaningful in the society and gave us some very useful suggestions.
CGEM Forum
Besides the idea-exchange seminar we had with the experts in Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Science, before the experiments in summer, in August and September we contacted many iGEM teams in China and invited them to attend the CGEM (China Genetically Engineered Machine) Forum in October, which is organized by our team together with CIEI-BJ.
On 4th, Oct. the First CGEM Forum was held in the meeting room “Reddish Lake” on the 4th floor of WenJin International Hotel. In respond to the invitation, two high-school teams (HFLS-H2Z-HangZhou and RDFZ-China) and one college team from Beijing institute of technology came to the forum. In total, more than 70 teachers and students attended the conference. Our team was in duty of welcoming, leading the people, setting the room, as well as doing signing up for visitors.
During the seminar, teams first gave presentations on their own topics on the stage; then, the professors provided advice and improvement directions from many aspects including topic (purpose, experiment design, influence, potential danger), power point (words, color, number of pages), and speech (content, volume, order of speaker, motion, time management). Dr. Li, Dr. Cheng and Dr. Xue kindly provided every team with suggestions and opinions.
Through communication with members in other teams after all speeches and comments were given, we gladly heard that they considered the forum as a useful chance to modify their own presenting process. “The suggestions from Dr. Wang made us jump out of the box easily and immediately came up with new idea about how to design our wiki,” said the leader of CIEI-Beijing, “quite amazing!” As an old saying goes “bystanders always know better”, the improvements mentioned by the professors, indeed, sparkled every single teammate’s mind, provoking them to find better solutions to their problems and move forward.
What’s more, idea-sharing seminar gave the forum members chances to exchange ideas about poster design and production, as well as listen to advice and stories from experienced professor, who is now running his personal bio-company.

""We are unknown to ourselves, we men of knowledge-and with good reason"" - Nietzsche
In the pursuit of the truth we look towards ourselves. And each in our our own way, in our own time, on our terms, and some not at all - we shall end full circle - at the beginning of nothingness.
Ego sum veritas, veritas von liberat.
Science as my conduit to freedom, affords me the chance to give my imagination a corporeal existence. And therefore, allows me to be truly free.
Joshua Resa
Joshua is a senior at Stanford University, deviously working on a master plan that will enable him to stay in school forever. Hs is fascinated by the universe, by science, physics, chemistry, and biology (ignoring math, in order of the xkcd comic, you know the one). He wonders at the amazing intricacies of how stuff works and frustrated by what doesn't. He hopes to figure out the former and, with luck, fix what's broken. This project and IGEM in general have provided a wealth of experience and ideas, of problem solving and problem belly flops (you must imagine how that feels). It was a great experience.
Sean Allen
Sean Allen is a 4th year Molecular and Cell Biology major with an emphasis on Immunology. After graduating in the Spring of 2009, he plans on taking a year off to work and study for the GRE. From there on, graduate school and research are his primary goals.

Utah_State,2009,Team:Utah State#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," a rich heritage. Whether on campus, historic Main Street, down in the “island”, or up the canyon, there is always something to do.
Originally founded in 1888 as the Agricultural College of Utah, the school officially became a university in 1957. As the state's land-and space-grant university, USU conducts world-class research in many disciplines and has several projects in conjunction with the Department of Defense and NASA. USU’s research program is second in age only to MIT in the United States. USU's Space Dynamics Laboratory has put more experiments into space than any university in the world and is ranked first in the United States for funding for aerospace research.
The engineering program at Utah State is known for its excellence, with a 96% first-time pass rate on the national engineering exam compared to a national average of 55%. Beyond the Logan campus, Utah State's Extension programs extend academic resources and support throughout the entire state of Utah, having extension locations in each of Utah's 29 counties.
Biological and Irrigation Engineering is a relatively small department at Utah State, with about 30 faculty and 120 undergraduate and graduate students. This great student-to-teacher ratio helps students succeed in their classes. The Biological Engineering Program teaches students to manipulate biological systems for useful purposes, understand scientific literature, and to work well and communicate effectively with others, both in the field of Biological Engineering and out. In the first years of the program, students learn the basics of biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. This knowledge base is then broadened by a study of liberal arts and humanities including literature, philosophy, political science, art, and music classes. Students finally delve into technical engineering courses, many chosen personally by students to apply to their particular areas of interest. These courses develop practical problem-solving abilities, increasing sensitivity to the economic, social, and legal dimensions of technical problems. Students leave the program well-qualified for their careers, with an understanding of the importance of social and professional ethics and responsibility to accompany their technical learning. After graduation, students will apply their knowledge to a wide range of careers, from genetic engineering to design of prosthetic devices for amputees.

User Research
Overview
This summer, the Wellesley College iGEM team worked extensively with users to create a suite of software tools that improve synthetic biology education, as well as efficiency and collaboration in the context of synthetic biology research. We spoke to many potential users, from researchers heading labs in synthetic biology research, to users in the industry, to college students studying biological sciences. We conducted user studies of our programs with volunteer subjects from the MIT and BU iGEM teams as well as students from Wellesley College who had a range of knowledge and exposure to synthetic biology. Receiving feedback from future scientists is a vital part of the user-centered design ( UCD ) process. We valued all input from the people we collaborated and interacted with during user testing.
Basic Wet-Lab Training via BioBuilder at MIT
Working in the wet lab
At the beginning of the summer, the Wellesley iGEM team received an introduction to synthetic biology and basic wet-lab training by Professor Natalie Kuldell at MIT. After reviewing the core concepts of synthetic biology, we discussed in detail the safety concerns of working in a wet-lab environment. During the wet-lab training, we were also able to conduct well-known and highly regarded experiments such as E.chromi and Eau d'E coli . Thus, through this experience, our team realized that several factors could strongly affect the success or failure of a synthetic biology experiment: labeling equipment properly, meticulously following clearly written instructions, and communicating with other team members.
In addition, we discovered that there are many technical difficulties when working in a laboratory environment, especially for future scientists. Most importantly, there are many safety concerns that are not understood or well known to the public because of synthetic biology’s recent emergence as a leading field. Thus, we realized the importance of educating the public, especially the next generation of synthetic biologists, on the safety concerns of working in a wet-lab environment. The Wellesley iGEM team considered these"

Prioritized autoclaving YPD media, YPD plates, 1M LiOAc solution, 0.1 M EDTA solution, and 10mM Tris-HCl 1mM EDTA solution.  Note that there were some issues while making the 0.1 M EDTA (i.e. spilling some of the volume before the EDTA had been completely dissolved), such that the estimated molarity is less than 0.1M.  Thus, since this EDTA solution was used to make the 10mM Tris-HCl 1 mM EDTA solution, the concentration of EDTA in the latter solution is also lower than specified.
Also note contamination in the LB left over from making LB + amp last night.  One must thus be wary about using the LB + amp produced from what ended up being contaminated media, especially if it is to be used for a glycerol stock.
Added 20.5 mg of ampicillin to 200 mL LB from a different batch of LB from 6/25/08 that had been sitting out and was most certainly not contaminated.
For parts that were listed yesterday as requiring a miniprep, they were innoculated in 7-10 mL LB + amp (almost all parts were in around 8 mL of culture except P0520, which was in 10 mL).  For parts that had sufficient amount of DNA from yesterday's miniprep, they were cultured in 2 mL liquid in preparation for making glycerol stocks tomorrow.
Placed in incubator set to 250 rpm, with tubes slanted at an angle, at 1:12 am on 6/28/08.  Will check on them tomorrow at 3:12 pm.
